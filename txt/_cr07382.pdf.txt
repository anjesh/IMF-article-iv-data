Discussions were held in Beirut May 14–28, 2007. The mission comprised
Mr. Gardner (head), Ms. Oner, Messrs. Schimmelpfennig and Sdralevich (all MCD),
Finger (PDR), Hoffmann (MCM), and Le Borgne (FAD). Mr. Di Tata (MCD) and
Ms. Choueiri (OED) participated in some of the policy discussions. The mission met
with the central bank governor, the ministers of finance, economy and trade, tourism,
and energy, the Banking Control Commission, senior government officials, the
director of the electricity company, and representatives of the banking sector, the
business community, the trade union, and donor countries.

Lebanon accessed Fund resources under Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance
(EPCA) (25 percent of quota or SDR 50.75 million) in April 2007. Lebanon has
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in 1993 and maintains
an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions; controls on capital account transactions are minor,
and relate mostly to a prohibition on domestic borrowing by nonresidents. The
Lebanese pound is de facto pegged to the U.S. dollar; since October 1999, the
Banque du Liban has intervened to keep the pound within a narrow corridor of
LL 1501 to LL 1514 per U.S. dollar. The 2006 Article IV consultation was
concluded by the Executive Board on May 3, 2006.

Lebanon participates in the General Data Dissemination Standards. The fiscal
ROSC was published May 16, 2005, and the last FSAP update was concluded in
2001.

This report reflects information through May 2007. A progress report on
performance under EPCA at end-June 2007 was issued to the Executive Board for
information (IMF Staff Country Report No. 07/371) on September 5. A forthcoming
staff statement will discuss more recent developments.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and recent developments
The economy is slowly recovering from the 2006 conflict with Israel. A political stalemate
continues to paralyze legislative activity, and, combined with repeated security incidents, is
weighing negatively on economic activity. Money demand has remained robust. In support
of the government’s 2007 program, the Executive Board approved EPCA in April 2007.
Outlook and policy discussions
•

The government’s five-year reform program lays out an ambitious strategy aimed at
reducing Lebanon’s large debt overhang and financial vulnerabilities. The strategy is
subject to recognized risks from domestic and regional tensions, macroeconomic
shocks, contingent fiscal liabilities, and the difficulty of mobilizing political support
for sustained adjustment. To address some of these risks, the authorities’ fiscal
strategy is complemented by structural reforms to promote private sector growth
(with privatization at its core) and social sector reforms.

•

The objectives of the 2007 program are to contain the budget deficit and to maintain
financial stability during this difficult transition year, while preparing for sizeable
fiscal adjustment and structural reforms in 2008. Revenue, expenditure and public
financial management reforms have been identified; structural reforms in the key
power and social sectors are being finalized in collaboration with the World Bank.

•

Successful fiscal adjustment would provide an opportunity to strengthen the central
bank’s balance sheet and reform the monetary policy framework by relying on
short-term monetary instruments.

•

Banks face balance sheet risks from dollarization and exposure to the sovereign. They
are diversifying their portfolio through regional expansion and increased retail
lending. The sector appears well prepared for the introduction of Basel II in 2008.

Staff appraisal
•

Performance in the first quarter was consistent with the 2007 program objectives, but
the uncertain economic and financial outlook requires monitoring. The authorities
rightly intend to create a fiscal buffer through tight expenditure control. Early
introduction of a floor on gasoline excises would help safeguard revenues.

•

Full implementation of major reforms and adjustment measures planned for 2008 will
be important to establish the credibility of the strategy and safeguard external
stability over the medium term.

•

The exchange rate peg remains key to financial stability, and needs to be supported
by the authorities’ planned fiscal adjustment as well as greater interest rate flexibility
and a strengthening of the central bank’s balance sheet.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The Lebanese authorities presented an ambitious five-year reform program to
donors at the Paris III conference in January 2007. The program aims at raising growth,
improving living standards, and reducing Lebanon’s large debt overhang and financial
vulnerabilities, taking account of the special challenges created by the conflict with Israel in
July–August 2006. A number of reforms were developed in close consultation with the Fund
(Box 1), and, on April 9, 2007, the Executive Board approved the authorities’ request for
EPCA in support of their 2007 program.
Box 1. Implementation of Past Fund Advice
Since the Paris II conference of 2003, Fund advice has focused on the
implementation of the authorities’ medium-term strategy of fiscal adjustment,
privatization, and structural reforms. The pace of reform and fiscal adjustment has
fallen short of the initial plans and of Fund recommendations because of political
instability and insufficient domestic consensus on the reform agenda. The conflict
between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006 caused a further setback and led to the
authorities’ decision to delay most adjustment measures until 2008.
In developing their reform strategy, the authorities have, to a large extent, relied
on Fund advice. Most of the tax policy and administration measures, as well as the
public financial management reforms, embedded in the revised strategy presented by
the authorities at the Paris III conference were developed in close consultation with
staff, and have benefited from extensive Fund technical assistance. The Fund has
supported the authorities’ view that the exchange rate peg remains key to financial
stability.
2.
Even with the strong fiscal adjustment envisaged for 2008-12, Lebanon will
continue to be highly vulnerable to swings in investor confidence, and the level of public
debt will remain high for years to come. Against this background, discussions for the
Article IV consultation stepped back from the immediate program context and focused on:
(i) making the reform strategy more resilient to inherent risks and potential shocks;
(ii) reforms in the monetary policy framework and banking sector; and (iii) policies for 2007
and 2008 to support the authorities’ medium-term objectives.
II. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Economic developments in 2006 were significantly affected by the conflict with
Israel (Tables 1–10).1 Real GDP is estimated to have been flat in 2006, with strong growth
in the first half offsetting the disruptions created by the conflict (Figure 1). Inflation
1

Developments in 2006 were discussed in more detail in IMF Staff Country Report No. 07/177.

6
accelerated in July–August, largely reflecting supply shortages during the conflict and the
ensuing blockade. Financial pressures were managed effectively owing to the banking
system’s strong liquidity position. Immediately after the conflict, donors pledged $1.7 billion
for relief and recovery (mostly at the Stockholm conference in August 2006), and
disbursements in 2006 roughly offset the immediate fiscal costs of the conflict
(Text Table 1). Nonetheless, the overall fiscal deficit increased in 2006 because of rising
interest expenditures and higher than expected transfers to the power company, Electricité du
Liban (EdL). Government debt rose to over $40 billion (178 percent of GDP) at end-2006.

4.
Despite continued political uncertainty, economic developments in the first
quarter of 2007 pointed to an incipient recovery. Indicators of economic activity during
the first quarter suggest that GDP had recovered, faster than expected, to the level of early
2006. Inflation has receded as the impact of supply shortages during the 2006 conflict is
fading out, notwithstanding the depreciation of the U.S. dollar to which the currency is
pegged. Due to strong year-on-year import growth, the trade deficit widened in the first
quarter of 2007. With lower capital inflows and limited donor disbursements, gross
international reserves fell by $300 million, to $11 billion at end-March.2
5.
The political tensions that erupted after the conflict with Israel between the
government and the opposition remain high. If not resolved, the political confrontation
could lead to a constitutional crisis by the time of the presidential election later this year. On
June 10, the United Nations established a tribunal to investigate the assassination of former
Prime Minister Hariri. After a period of calm, the security situation deteriorated again in
late May with fighting between the Lebanese army and the Fatah al-Islam militants in
northern Lebanon and several bomb explosions in and around Beirut.

The political tensions have also affected financial markets, though money
demand remains robust. Notwithstanding considerable monthly volatility, bank deposits
have grown at an average (annualized) rate of 9 percent between October 2006 and
May 2007.3 Lebanese Eurobond and Credit Default Swap spreads remain some 200 basis
points above the levels prevailing prior to the 2006 conflict, but have also been quite volatile
reflecting political developments. Deposit dollarization (currently at 76 percent) is also
higher than prior to the conflict, while the stock market index has remained broadly constant
since end-2006 in very low trading.
III. OUTLOOK AND AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS ON POLICIES4
7.
Discussions were based on a scenario developed by staff that incorporates full
implementation of the Paris III reform program (Text Table 2). Fiscal adjustment and
privatization are expected to begin in 2008, and, as a result, government debt would be
reduced by almost 50 percentage points to below 130 percent of GDP by 2012, in line with
the authorities’ targets. In addition to the contribution of fiscal adjustment (7 percentage
points), the debt reduction comes from privatization (31 percentage points), the projected
Paris III donors assistance (6 percentage points), and the transfer of unrealized gold valuation
gains from the Banque du Liban (BdL) to the budget (7 percentage points). The associated
improvement in confidence is assumed to result in a pick-up of growth to 4–5 percent a year
(similar to the historical average rate over the last 15 years), and a narrowing of interest rate
spreads. The authorities considered the macroeconomic scenario realistic, but believed that
they will obtain a higher fiscal yield from their reforms.
A. Minimizing Risks to the Paris III Reform Strategy
8.
The Paris III reform strategy is subject to a number of risks, which were
acknowledged by the authorities. Given the large debt overhang and fiscal and external
imbalances that are financed by short-term deposit inflows, Lebanon will remain vulnerable
to shocks to confidence for years, even with full implementation of the reforms. The most
immediate risk to the strategy is the political risk that reforms cannot be initiated or would be
reversed. Shortfalls in growth or higher than projected real interest rates constitute the main
macroeconomic risks. Lastly, there are some uncertainties over the yield of reforms, as well
contingent liabilities that have yet to be quantified. The effects of these risks are illustrated
by the debt sustainability analysis (Box 2).

3

A temporary peak in deposits at end-2006 was reportedly related to some “window dressing” by banks aimed
at posting high deposit growth rates for the year.

Staff’s views are given in Section IV.

Box 2. Debt Sustainability Analysis
The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) reveals that under a number of shocks, the
debt-to-GDP ratio would revert to an unsustainable path. The DSA shows the impact of
six shocks on the baseline debt trajectory as well as the implications of using historical values for
the interest rate, growth rate, and the primary balance (Figure 2, and Table 11):
Panel 1: The baseline scenario—full implementation of the Paris III agenda.
Panel 2: A permanent increase in the real interest rate by 170 basis points (i.e., one-half standard
deviation from its past distribution) relative to the baseline.
Panel 3: A drop in average GDP growth from 4 percent in the baseline to 3 percent, i.e., the
average rate for 2002–06.
Panel 4: A shortfall in the yield from fiscal reforms, i.e. halving of the yield of the fiscal reform
package. This reduces the average primary surplus to just over 1 percent of GDP in
2007–12, compared with over 4 percent of GDP in the baseline, and implies that the
primary surplus converges to 1 percent of GDP in the long-run, compared with
3 percent of GDP in the baseline.
Panel 5: Absent sustained reforms, no privatization and only partial fiscal adjustment (the
primary surplus reaches only 3 percent by 2012); growth remains sluggish at 3 percent
per annum, while interest rate spreads widen by 220 basis points relative to the
baseline.
Panel 6: No privatization—since privatization essentially brings forward the income stream
from the privatized companies, the scenarios with and without privatization converge to
the same debt-ratio in the long-run. However, this abstracts from the negative impact
that abandoning privatization plans would have on growth and possibly interest rates
relative to the Paris III scenario.

9.
The authorities concurred with staff that broad domestic support was needed to
achieve and sustain the targeted fiscal adjustment. They considered that the tranched
donor support, which was conditional on reform implementation, would provide an effective
incentive to maintain the reform momentum over time. Beyond that, they noted that the
growth and social pillars of their Paris III program were intended to build public support for
reforms by compensating for the inevitable difficulties of fiscal adjustment.
10.
The program’s growth pillar is centered on privatization, improvements in the
business climate, and opening of markets. The authorities emphasized that privatization of
the telecom sector was the lynchpin of their growth strategy, and that additional public sector
enterprises were also being slated for privatization. Furthermore, they were establishing a
competitiveness council, consisting of private sector and government representatives that
would be tasked with identifying legal and administrative impediments to growth. In this
context, they were taking steps to streamline the process of obtaining business licenses, and,
more generally, to lower the cost of doing business. The authorities also thought that
accession to the World Trade Organization—envisaged for 2008—would contribute to
further liberalizing markets; they expected to have all relevant legislative changes ready for
parliament by the end of 2007.

11.
The main elements of the social pillar are to improve service delivery in health
and education and strengthen the social safety nets. The authorities noted they could
achieve a lot by redirecting the existing envelope of social spending, improving public
services, and creating public social safety nets (including through a cash transfer system).
12.
The authorities were less concerned about uncertainties over the yield of
reforms, arguing that there was also an upside potential. For example, the ongoing
revision of the reform plan for EdL was expected to lower reform costs, while yielding the
same reduction in transfers from the budget. They also expected tax administration reforms
to increase tax buoyancy relative to staff’s revenue projections. However, the authorities
acknowledged the risk of added spending pressures on account of the security situation.
13.
Reforms to address imbalances (and possible contingent liabilities) in the
pension and health system are being developed. The authorities did not see immediate
pressures developing in the public pension system, and felt therefore that they had time to
assess imbalances (ongoing) and introduce reforms. The reform of the private pension
system—currently in parliament—envisions the system’s transformation from an
end-of-service allowance to a fully funded pension system. Transition costs may have to be
borne by the state, but their extent would only be revealed once the audits of the National
Social Security Fund’s (NSSF’s) accounts are completed (Table 12), and the contribution
and replacement rates for the new system are finalized. In the meantime, the authorities plan
to introduce professional asset management to raise the private pension systems’ return on
investment. Another source of open-ended budget transfers are the losses of the health fund
of the NSSF. In this regard, the authorities are discussing with the World Bank options for
addressing underlying structural problems in contribution rates and coverage, which, among
other problems, create a bias toward hospitalization that is pushing up costs.
14.
In parallel, the authorities plan to develop institutions that will help sustain the
adjustment effort. They have taken steps to develop a medium-term budget framework to
better align short-term policies with strategic objectives, and are also aiming to move
gradually toward program budgeting. They also consider adopting a fiscal responsibility law
to provide a self-reinforcing mechanism of fiscal adjustment and debt reduction that reduces
the risk of backtracking. The authorities acknowledged that such institutional reforms will
require substantial preparation.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
15.
The authorities consider that their monetary policy framework has enabled
them to deal effectively with financial pressures. They believe that interest rate stability,
notably in treasury bill (T-bill) rates, played a key role in maintaining confidence during
periods of pressure (Table 13). However, they recognized that the counterpart to that was the
need for the BdL to occasionally rely on alternative instruments (central bank CDs, special
discount windows, swaps, etc.) to manage liquidity and safeguard international reserves. The

13
authorities also reiterated that the BdL’s mandate was to maintain financial stability, and
that, in their view, this involved providing financing to the government in times of shortfalls
from other sources. Nonetheless, they agreed that such financing should only be temporary,
and that prolonged shortfalls in market demand would have to be met by raising T-bill rates.
16.
The monetary authorities confirmed their intention to introduce new short-term
instruments for managing liquidity once the financial situation improves. They
considered a resolution of the political and security situation, and an improved fiscal
environment as preconditions for moving toward short-term, market-based instruments of
monetary control (such as repos and reverse repos). However, they acknowledged that this
would require greater price flexibility in T-bill auctions. In the context of monitoring
performance relative to the EPCA monetary and fiscal targets, the authorities are planning to
establish a technical working group to enhance information sharing between the ministry of
finance and the BdL.
17.
The authorities continue to regard the exchange rate peg as key to financial
stability. Exchange rate stability was particularly important given balance sheet risks related
to widespread dollarization and the government’s high foreign currency debt servicing
obligations. They agreed with staff that fiscal imbalances, but also temporary factors related
to the post-conflict environment, were at the core of Lebanon’s high current account deficit,
and noted that the planned fiscal adjustment would help improve the current account position
significantly. Against this background, and the fact that trade competitiveness was being
maintained, the authorities concurred with the staff analysis (Box 3), which does not suggest
that the exchange rate is misaligned. Furthermore, the authorities were confident that the
envisaged structural reforms would generate the competitiveness gains needed to sustain
growth.
18.
The authorities were confident that the weakening of the BdL’s balance sheet
has not impaired monetary control. They noted that the weakening was largely the result
of managing past crises, although quasi-fiscal activities carried out by the BdL had also
contributed. They did not see an immediate risk to their ability to control liquidity, and
thought that the BdL’s balance sheet could absorb the transfer to the government of
unrealized gold valuation gains. Looking forward, the authorities expected that fiscal
adjustment and improvements in confidence would help reduce dollarization, which would
facilitate a further build-up of net international reserves and strengthen the BdL’s income
position.

average rate of 5 percent a year in
volume terms in 2004–05 (staff estimate based on Lebanese customs data), and maintained positive
momentum in 2006 (2 percent) and into 2007, despite the conflict-related disruptions in production
and the two-month air, land, and sea blockade. As such, Lebanon’s exports have more than kept pace
with the buoyant demand in the region; the market shares vis-à-vis all trading partners have been
stable in 2005–06. Exports of services (primarily but not exclusively tourism) have suffered from the
political and security disruptions of 2005–07, but still have strong growth potential as was
demonstrated in 2004.
Applying the three methodologies proposed by the IMF’s Consultative Group on Exchange Rate
Issues (CGER) does not suggest that the REER is misaligned.
• Equilibrium real exchange rate approach: An estimation of the long-run equilibrium REER derived
from key macroeconomic fundamentals (the net external asset position (NEAP), the productivity
differential with trading partners, terms of trade, and government consumption) suggests that the
REER could actually be modestly undervalued relative to its estimated equilibrium level. However,
the result is well within the margins of error in this type of analysis.
• External sustainability approach: In this approach, the underlying current account deficit in 2007 is
compared to the current account deficit that would stabilize Lebanon’s NEAP at the end of 2006. The
empirical estimate of Lebanon’s NEAP is subject to large uncertainty, and depending on the choice
of the NEAP, the REER is either slightly undervalued or slightly overvalued, also within the typical
margin of error.

• Macroeconomic balance approach: For this approach, a current account norm of –5 to –6 percent of
GDP is derived based on macroeconomic fundamentals (fiscal balance, dependency ratio, population
growth, NEAP, oil balance, output growth, income relative to the United States in purchasing power
parity terms). The current account norm is then compared to medium-term projections based on the
authorities’ planned policies under the Paris III program. With full implementation of the authorities’
program, the projected current account deficit for 2012 would narrow to –5½ percent of GDP.
However, if the fiscal adjustment planned under the Paris III program is not achieved in full, the
projected current account deficit under current policies would exceed the norm which could
potentially lead to external instability. This result is also reflected in the historical scenarios of the
DSA (Figure 2) that show an unsustainable debt path if the program is not implemented and the key
macroeconomic variables remain at their average levels over the last decade.

15
19.
The BdL has introduced a scheme to provide relief to banks and businesses
affected by the 2006 conflict. Under the scheme, the BdL would provide loans to banks at
below-market interest rates which the banks would re-invest in fresh T-bills. Banks would
then use the interest differential to provide a 60 percent subsidy toward the reconstruction of
productive facilities destroyed during the conflict. The authorities argued that in the absence
of any assistance, some banks with large exposures would find it difficult to absorb
conflict-related losses. The authorities estimated the total subsidy under the scheme would be
at most $180 million, although disbursements could be significantly lower owing to strict
eligibility requirements.
C. Banking Sector Vulnerabilities
20.
The banking sector is profitable and its capitalization is increasing, though
vulnerabilities remain high (Tables 14–15). The balance sheet of domestic banks stands at
$77 billion (320 percent of GDP) and exposure to the sovereign (government and central
bank) is around 50 percent of assets. The authorities were concerned about the substantial
maturity mismatch that banks carry on their books, largely from sourcing their holdings of
government paper from short-term deposits (Table 16). In addition, the high degree of
dollarization exposes banks to substantial credit risk. Reducing these vulnerabilities will
ultimately depend on the success of the debt reduction strategy, although the authorities are
working in parallel to encourage banks to strengthen risk management and diversify their
portfolio. While some banks are targeting a reduction in their sovereign exposure, their
systemic exposure to the government makes it difficult for them as a group not to roll over
government paper. The authorities took some comfort in the fact that banking sector
profitability increased in 2006 and early 2007, although this was in part the reflection of
regulatory measures to ease provisioning rules in the wake of the conflict.
21.
The authorities welcomed the regional diversification strategy of commercial
banks. The larger banks are expanding very rapidly their presence in countries where their
expertise puts them at a strong comparative advantage by setting up local subsidiaries and
branches, and potentially by cross-border lending.5 They are also developing domestic
private sector lending, in particular retail lending. Among the larger banks, 20 percent of
assets are by now in foreign operations, with the objective of generating half of their profits
abroad within three years. The banking control commission has taken steps to facilitate and
enhance its monitoring of the banks’ diversification strategy. Thus, for instance, in 2006 it
issued a circular raising the limits on the exposure of Lebanese banks to non-resident
borrowers, and has signed, or is negotiating, memoranda of understanding on consolidated
supervision with supervisory authorities in countries where Lebanese banks are expanding.
5

In addition to their traditional bases in Europe and Cyprus, Lebanese banks are (or plan to be) present in
Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates.

16
22.
The authorities expect commercial banks to strengthen risk management in
response to the introduction of Basel II standards in 2008. The banking system seems
well-prepared for the introduction of Basel II, and the authorities expect all banks to meet the
tightened capital adequacy criteria. The increased risk weight on foreign currency
denominated government and BdL debt instruments would force banks to internalize in part
the systemic risks associated with sovereign foreign currency debt.6 The authorities are also
trying to encourage banks to better manage their maturity mismatch. To that end, they
decided, for the time being, not to reopen the repo window for Lebanese lira T-bills which
they had closed during last year’s conflict to ease pressures on the Lebanese lira.
23.
The authorities saw scope for consolidation of the banking sector over the
medium term. In particular, smaller banks whose main source of income is lending to the
government may lose ground to larger banks which are better positioned to adapt to Basel II
and diversify their asset structure. The promotion of mergers, including through financial
incentives provided by the BdL, has been the main instrument to facilitate the exit of
non-viable banks in the past. The BdL believes this is the most suitable instrument in the
Lebanese context, because of concerns that outright bank failures would destabilize the
system. However, this instrument could give rise to moral hazard, notably in terms of
depositor, shareholder, and management behavior.
D. Policies for 2007 and 2008
24.
Political tensions and outbreaks of violence are key obstacles to reform
implementation and economic recovery. The political stalemate is constraining the
government’s room for maneuver and paralyzing legislative activity. This, combined with
security concerns, is expected to weigh negatively on economic activity. As such, real GDP
growth is projected at about 2 percent in 2007. Under the fixed exchange rate regime, CPI
inflation should return to around 2 percent by year-end. Capital (including deposit) inflows
are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and are therefore projected conservatively—
money growth is put at 5 percent for the year as a whole. Reflecting reconstruction
expenditure and replenishment of inventories, the current account deficit is expected to
increase to 11 percent of GDP in 2007, largely financed by official inflows and foreign direct
investment.
25.
The authorities expected to be able to contain the primary fiscal deficit
(excluding grants) to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2007 as programmed. First-quarter
performance was within program targets (Box 4). However, the authorities recognized the
6

The risk weight on Eurobonds would increase from 20–50 percent presently to 100 percent, and that on central
bank foreign currency debt from zero to 100 percent. The risk weight on domestic currency sovereign debt is
expected to remain at zero.

17
risks of unforeseen expenditure pressures, such as from security measures and transfers to
EdL on account of higher oil prices. They indicated that, as in 2006, they would maintain
tight expenditure control—delaying low-priority spending until later in the year—to build up
a buffer in the event of unforeseen shocks. On the revenue front, the widening gap between
domestic and international oil prices reduced the gasoline excise to near zero in May. On
current trends, gasoline excise revenues would fall short of program targets by around
½ percent of GDP for the year. However, the authorities were confident that, if the political
situation stabilized, they could introduce a floor on excises (of $0.20 per liter) by
September 2007, as agreed under the program, which is expected to yield ½ percent of GDP
during the remainder of 2007. At the same time, they noted that other revenues have been
more buoyant than expected.
Box 4. Performance Under the Program Supported by EPCA1
The authorities met all end-March 2007 quantitative targets under EPCA, except
for the ceiling on government borrowing from the BdL, which was exceeded by a
small margin (Table 17). Stronger than projected revenue collection helped contain
the primary deficit and the accumulation of net debt in the first quarter. However,
insufficient demand for government paper by commercial banks led the government to
rely more on BdL financing than programmed. The outcome was LL 106 billion
($70 million) above the LL 903 billion ($602 million) flow envisaged for the first
quarter. Despite the difficult market situation, the gross reserves target was met with a
modest margin. No domestic or external arrears were accumulated.
The authorities also reported on progress toward achieving the monitorable
actions for end-June (Table 18). On May 21, the cabinet approved the draft budget
for 2007, which includes the foreign financed component of the Council of
Development and Reconstruction and activities of the Higher Relief Council. The
auditing of EdL has already started, and the launching of the audit of NSSF is on track.
With respect to privatization, the authorities have modified their strategy to privatize
only the licenses of the two mobile phone companies and effect the transfer of assets
and contracts through separate transactions. This would avoid the need for a special
law prior to privatization, and ensure that privatization can proceed as planned, making
the end-June submission of such a law to parliament no longer relevant.

26.
The authorities were confident that they could meet their financing needs
through donor support and from the market during the remainder of 2007. They
pointed to recent T-bill auctions and a Eurobond issue in May as indications that commercial
banks had returned to the market, and, therefore, saw no immediate need for raising T-bill
rates. At the same time, negotiations with key donors are proceeding, and disbursements of
grants and loans could amount to $1.9 billion in 2007 (Text Table 3). As such, the authorities
were confident that they would reduce net borrowing from the BdL and achieve the
programmed build-up of international reserves over the rest of 2007 (Tables 19–20). As
another risk to their financing strategy, they listed EdL’s fuel payments over which they had
only limited control. Negotiations with domestic banks on a possible Paris III contribution
have not progressed, with banks being reluctant to make commitments before reform
implementation is underway.

27.
The authorities reported on recent steps toward fiscal adjustment in 2008. On the
revenue side, the draft 2007 budget already provides for increasing the value-added tax rate
and the tax on interest income as of 2008. Preparations for the introduction of a global
income tax in 2008 were advancing, with a view to submitting the draft law to parliament in
2007. The authorities also expected ongoing revenue administration reforms, such as the
introduction of a medium taxpayer office, new audit procedures, and changes to the property
valuation system, to yield revenue gains. On the expenditure side, they were finalizing the
reform plans for EdL (Box 5) and NSSF, and were developing a reform plan for the health
sector, all in cooperation with the World Bank. With respect to EdL, they were more
optimistic than staff about the potential yield of reforms.7 Moreover, they were aiming for an
7

Staff’s scenario envisages that net transfers to EdL (excluding debt service, but including investment costs)
would decline to 1.3 percent of GDP by 2012, from 3.3 percent of GDP in 2006.

19
across-the-board cut in discretionary spending of five percent in 2008, and a reduction of
expenditure duplication across ministries through better cooperation and information sharing.
They also pointed to the planned establishment of a debt management office charged with
reducing debt service costs and improving asset management, although details remain to be
worked out.
Box 5. Energy Sector Reforms
Electricity production in Lebanon comes at a high budgetary cost, while service delivery
is of poor quality. Budget transfers to EdL net of debt service amounted to $750 million
(3.3 percent of GDP) in 2006. Weak management, poor governance, inadequate infrastructure,
and reliance on oil instead of less expensive gas are the sector’s main problems. Technical
losses are estimated at 15 percent of production, while non-technical losses (essentially illegal
connections) account for another 18 percent. At the same time, power cuts are endemic.
The government is finalizing a comprehensive energy sector reform plan in close
cooperation with the World Bank. EdL’s financial management will be enhanced through:
corporatization (which would allow hiring a more professional work force); the appointment of
a new board of directors and qualified advisors; auditing of EdL’s accounts; and installing
remote meters. Reforms also seek to promote private sector involvement and increase capacity
through independent power producers; tendering is envisaged for early 2008. Fuel costs are to
be reduced by switching to natural gas in at least one power plant in the second quarter of
2008; this plant might also be privatized alongside the entry of independent power producers.
A National Control Center, planned for 2008, is expected to realize efficiency gains in
distribution. Toward the end of the reform period, the authorities plan to unbundle and partially
privatize the sector. A regulator would be set up in parallel.
The tariff structure is far from achieving cost recovery and suffers from inefficiencies.
Given the high production costs and losses, the average tariff of 9.4 cents/kWh achieves cost
recovery at a fuel price of $25/barrel. The above reforms would narrow the gap relative to
current oil prices, but an increase in tariffs may also be required, although international
experience suggests that tariff increases should be introduced following improvements in
service quality to avoid even higher non-payment and illegal connections. At the same time,
Lebanon’s tariff is already significantly higher than regional tariffs which puts Lebanese
producers at a disadvantage. In addition, there are inefficiencies in the tariff structure, for
example, the peak tariff for industry encourages self generation.

28.
The authorities also emphasized ongoing efforts toward strengthening public
financial management. The carryover of committed and uncommitted spending from one
budget year to the next has seriously weakened the ability to control budgetary outcomes and
to align spending to current priorities. To address this problem, the authorities intend to
roll-back the carry-over of committed spending starting in the 2008 budget. As a first step,
they plan to explicitly revoke the ability of line ministries to carryover uncommitted

20
expenditures beyond one month into the new budget year in the 2007 budget. The authorities
explained that the 2008 budget circular also introduces the notion of medium-term planning
and top-down spending envelopes for line ministries. In particular, they would pilot
medium-term budgeting that incorporates the implications of investment spending for future
current spending in four ministries and agencies.
E. Other Issues
29.
The authorities are working on improving the statistical system, but significant
data problems remain. With support from INSEE, they are revising the national accounts,
including the compilation of quarterly GDP data. The 2004 National Accounts have just been
released. However, statistical provision in other areas (balance of payments, prices,
employment, wage and social indicators) remains seriously deficient. Lebanon is due to be
assessed by the Middle East North Africa Financial Action Task Force in January 2008.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
The authorities’ reform strategy lays out a promising path toward reducing
Lebanon’s large debt overhang and financial vulnerabilities. The authorities’
medium-term fiscal adjustment objectives are appropriately ambitious in the circumstances.
The reform measures are designed to yield the targeted improvement in the primary balance,
and, combined with pledged donor support and privatization, should reduce the debt-to-GDP
ratio significantly over the next five years. The challenge now is to move from the planning
stage to implementation, which would be facilitated by improvements in the political and
security situation.
31.
Performance in the first quarter of 2007 bodes well for the attainment of the
program objectives for the year, but the uncertain economic and financial environment
requires close monitoring. The authorities’ intention to create a buffer by maintaining strict
expenditure discipline is welcome. At the same time, gasoline excise revenues should be
safeguarded by promptly raising gasoline prices in line with recent increases in international
oil prices. The authorities’ commitment to reduce reliance on central bank financing over the
remainder of the year is equally welcome. Every effort should be made to limit any new
borrowing from the BdL to short-term bridge financing in order to safeguard international
reserves. To that end, greater interest rate flexibility is necessary.
32.
This transition year is the time to prepare the ground for sizeable adjustment
and deep-seated reforms starting in 2008. The decision to include in the draft 2007 budget
law the 2008 increase in the value-added tax and the tax on interest income provides a strong
positive signal in this direction. The authorities are also encouraged to ensure that all
legislative and administrative work for the introduction of the GIT in 2008 is completed
before the end of 2007. The largest source of adjustment on the expenditure side over the
medium term is to come from structural reforms of the energy and social sectors, which have

21
been a source of large fiscal leakages over the years. Completion of these reform plans and
their swift implementation are therefore key priorities for 2007–08. The success of energy
sector reforms will require a careful sequencing of infrastructural and governance initiatives
to avoid compounding existing problems, and NSSF reforms should be guided by fiscal
considerations.
33.
Significant improvements in public financial management are necessary to
strengthen budgetary control, improve the allocation of scarce resources to priority
areas, and enhance the effectiveness of policies. Staff encourages the authorities to
follow-up on the action plan developed with Fund technical assistance to improve cash and
budget management functions. At the same time, across-the-board expenditure cuts should,
in general, be avoided because they are hard to sustain and undermine the quality of public
spending. More generally, comprehensive public financial management reforms would be a
prerequisite for the envisaged adoption of a fiscal responsibility law.
34.
Fiscal adjustment will facilitate the reform of the monetary policy framework.
Once more stable and predictable market conditions prevail, the central bank should be able
to focus on guiding interest rates through transparent short-term instruments, which would
allow the BdL to achieve its balance of payments and monetary objectives more efficiently.
This will need to be accompanied by price flexibility in T-bill auctions. Such an environment
would create the conditions for the government securities market to develop, thereby
attracting a wider range of investors and helping the government diversify its financing base.
As a first step, the authorities could consider reopening the repo window and relying on the
repo rate to influence banks’ behavior. In the short term, the interlinkages between the
government’s cash and debt management and the BdL’s liquidity and reserve management
call for close cooperation between the two institutions to increase the efficiency of financial
policies. Steps being taken in this direction are welcome.
35.
Progress is also needed on strengthening the central bank’s balance sheet to
preserve the monetary authority’s ability to control liquidity over the medium term. An
improvement in the overall financial situation and de-dollarization will help in this regard.
However, financing operations, such as the transfer of unrealized gold valuation gains to the
budget, and quasi-fiscal activities, such as providing subsidized lending to banks, adversely
impact on the BdL’s income and balance sheet positions and should therefore be avoided.
More generally, public support to the private sector should be provided through the budget to
ensure consistency with policy priorities. The privatization of the assets held by the BdL
would also strengthen its financial position, while contributing to the government’s growth
agenda.
36.
The exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar has contributed significantly to
maintaining financial stability under very difficult circumstances and without
impairing competitiveness. The peg played an important role as a nominal anchor during
recent financial pressures. In the current circumstances, international reserves held by the

22
BdL combined with the banking system’s liquidity cushion appear sufficient to meet
temporary pressures on the exchange rate, and the REER appears broadly in line with
fundamentals. Going forward, macroeconomic policies need to be geared toward supporting
the exchange rate peg. The debt overhang and the large external current account deficits are
the counterpart of fiscal imbalances and, therefore, should be addressed by implementing the
authorities’ Paris III fiscal adjustment program.
37.
Domestic banks remain the primary source for the government’s financing
needs. The resulting interdependence of the government, the central bank, and the
commercial banks has created incentives for all actors to behave in a concerted way to
preserve financial stability. However, this interdependence also creates systemic risks, in that
shocks to either the fiscal or the financial sector would be quickly passed on to other sectors.
In this regard, the commercial banks’ strategy of regional expansion and focus on private
sector lending is welcome both from a risk management perspective, and given the envisaged
decline in government financing needs over the medium term. The authorities have been
aptly accompanying this process through regulatory and supervisory reforms, and it is
important that they deepen these efforts as banks expand into new cross-border activities,
including by implementing the applicable Basel Core Principles. Moreover, there is a need to
strengthen the bank resolution mechanism to facilitate consolidation when needed, while
minimizing moral hazard and increasing banks’ management accountability and shareholder
responsibility.
38.
The authorities’ program appropriately emphasizes private sector growth and
improved delivery of social services. Privatization of the telecom sector is a crucial element
of the growth strategy and should be accompanied by endowing the regulatory authority with
the powers and capacity to ensure proper competition in the sector. Staff also welcomes the
authorities’ intention to widen the privatization agenda to other sectors, as well as ongoing
efforts to improve the business climate. In this regard, the growth agenda should be
complemented by actions to dismantle oligopolistic practices and eliminate barriers to entry
and exit.
39.
Timely and flexible disbursement of Paris III pledges is another important
element for the success of the authorities’ strategy. Progress has been made in locking in
the terms and conditions for the release of funds from some key donors, but negotiations are
still underway with others. Staff fully supports the authorities’ request that donors make
timely disbursements and convert their pledges from project to budget support, or at least
align their project disbursements to the government’s own spending priorities.
40.
Risks to the reform strategy call for a continuous reassessment of policies.
Shocks to the macroeconomic environment, shortfalls in the privatization program, and
contingent fiscal liabilities (from actuarial imbalances in the public and private pension
systems, open-ended transfers to the health fund, and unforeseen costs from power sector
reform) all have the potential to throw the economy off course relative to the targeted debt

23
reduction path, and to require corrective actions. Equally important are implementation risks,
particularly in view of domestic and regional tensions and the need to maintain consensus
around the reform program. The authorities’ emphasis on a multipillar approach of fiscal
adjustment, growth promotion, and improved social services should help mitigate these risks.
In addition, a wider public debate about the economic and financial challenges facing
Lebanon would be important to sustain public and political support for reform and
adjustment during and beyond the Paris III horizon.
41.
Data gaps hamper the analysis of real and external sector developments. High level
commitment is needed to address these shortcomings through a comprehensive strategy to
strengthen the statistical system.
42.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the standard
12-month cycle. Quarterly reports on performance under the program supported by EPCA
will be issued for the information of Executive Directors, as requested by Directors at the
time of the EPCA approval.

1/ Central government gross debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
8/ This path assumes that, from 2008 onwards, real GDP growth is set at its 10-year average level while the primary fiscal balance and real interest rates are the same as in the baseline scenario.
9/ This path assumes that, from 2008 onwards, real interest rate and real GDP growth are set at their 10-year average level while the primary fiscal balance is the same as in the baseline scenario.

Exchange Arrangement
The Lebanese pound is a de facto peg. Since October 1999, the Banque du Liban
has intervened to keep the pound around a mid-point parity of LL 1,507.5 per $1,
with a bid-ask spread of LL+/-6.5.

Article IV Consultation
The 2006 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on May 3, 2006
(IMF Staff Country Report No. 06/201).

XII.

Financial Sector Assessment Program
Lebanon participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 1999,
and the related report was presented to the Executive Board at the time of the
Article IV consultation. A Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) update was
conducted in 2001, and the related report similarly presented to the Executive Board
at the time of the Article IV consultation.

XIII.

Technical Assistance

Fiscal area—FAD has provided advice on introducing the VAT, reforming customs tariffs
and income taxes, strengthening tax and customs administration, improving public
expenditure management, and consolidating fiscal accounts. A fiscal ROSC report was
published in May 2005. This technical assistance was well received by the ministry of
finance and, notably on the VAT, its impact has been positive and substantial. Considerable
needs remain in tax policy, tax administration, budget preparation, fiscal management, and
public accounting and reporting. Technical assistance missions in 2005 primarily dealt with
(i) the consolidation of fiscal accounts, and (ii) public liquidity management. In October
2006, a multi-sector mission provided advice on fiscal reform priorities after the conflict with
Israel.

4
Financial area—Over the past few years, the now Monetary and Capital Markets
Department has provided technical assistance in the areas of the payments system and
vulnerability indicators. The related missions undertook an assessment of compliance with
Core Principles for Systemically Important Payments Systems, advised on developing
systems to improve efficiency and liquidity management in public sector payments and
receipts, and assisted in the elaboration of a framework for collecting and analyzing
macro-prudential indicators to develop capacity to monitor systemic financial sector
vulnerabilities. Progress in implementing IMF recommendations has been limited. In 2006, a
mission conducted an assessment of banking sector soundness, including a stress-test
exercise, with a view to developing a strategy for banking sector consolidation.
Statistical area—The Statistics Department has provided technical assistance on the
development of price and balance of payments statistics, but so far, little progress has been
achieved. There is no official producer price index (PPI) or consumer price index (CPI);
balance of payments data remain incomplete and Lebanon does not report balance of
payments data to the Statistics Department. In early 2002, a multisector statistics/GDDS
mission provided an assessment of statistical needs and prepared action plans for
improvements. In February–March 2007, three missions provided assistance for the
compilation of the CPI. Statistical gaps remain substantial, particularly in the areas of
national accounts, price statistics, and the balance of payments, but stronger political
commitment to filling these gaps is needed in order for further technical assistance to be
effective.

Annex II. Lebanon: Relations with the World Bank Group
The World Bank (Bank) presented a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) covering fiscal
years 2006–09 to the Board in December 2005. The CAS aimed at assisting Lebanon in
addressing its macro-economic imbalances and its deficient public infrastructure and
services, with attention to associated social and environmental issues. The key pillars of the
CAS were: (i) governance for economic management and to support growth; (ii) the
development of human capital and the mitigation of the poverty effects of transition; and
(iii) resource and environmental management. The CAS foresaw up to $700 million over the
four year implementation period, subject to significant progress in addressing fiscal
imbalances and improving the debt outlook. The major deterioration in Lebanon’s fiscal
balances since the hostilities temporarily placed Lebanon in the CAS low case which
precludes Bank lending.
In response to its inability to lend at a time of great need for assistance, the Bank set up a
Trust Fund for Lebanon (TFL) in September 2006 with a transfer of $70 million from IBRD
surplus. The funds from the TFL support projects that are geared towards addressing
immediate post-conflict needs ($30 million for municipal development and $15 million for
water sector improvements), providing technical assistance in key reform areas ($5 million
for power sector reform) and, through IFC, an SME guarantee facility ($15 million).
In addition, through grant financing from its post-conflict fund the Bank is providing
technical assistance to the government for developing a financial tracking system for donor
funds and for simplifying government procurement and financial management procedures.
Upon the minister’s request, the Bank also temporarily placed two staff in Ministry of
Finance, focusing on local development and donor coordination and programming.
Immediately after the cessation of hostilities and at the request of the government, a multisector Bank team undertook an assessment of the economic and social impact of the
hostilities and an analysis of macro and structural reform priorities for the future. The
process involved intensive consultations with government officials, donor partners, the
private sector and other stakeholders in Lebanon. The study was an important input into the
preparation of the government’s reform program which was adopted in January 2007.
At the occasion of the Paris III donors’ conference on January 25, 2007, the Bank agreed to
provide up to $700 million in IBRD lending subject to and phased in with the
implementation of the government’s reform program. A CAS update will be presented to the
Board once the Bank and the government have reached clarity on the proposed lending
program.
Following interruptions in project implementation and delays in restarting work due to the
hostilities, the Bank’s project portfolio is progressing well. This is in large part the result of
early and intensive efforts of the Bank’s task teams and their Lebanese counterparts. The

7
portfolio currently consists of seven projects (see Annex) totaling a commitment of
$314.6 million (of which $186.9 million remains undisbursed).
IFC’s activities
IFC began work on a post-conflict program while the hostilities were ongoing, building on
previous experiences in other conflict or post-disaster situations. IFC joined the Bank’s
assessment team and developed a comprehensive program of investment and technical
assistance in support of private sector recovery.
At the core of the program, which is now under implementation, is the Lebanon Rebuild
Program in the financial sector, consisting of (1) an up to $200 million investment program
with a number of partner banks to which IFC will provide credit lines with a tenor of up to
seven years and/or risk sharing facilities; this will enable these banks to lend to
conflict-affected enterprises, primarily SMEs, and (2) an up to $75 million increase in
funding under IFC’s existing Global Trade Finance Program in Lebanon.
In addition to investments in companies through the financial sector, IFC expects to support
select real sector companies in the retail and services sectors.
Technical assistance activities continue to focus on improving the environment for the
private sector, including a roundtable on techniques for recovery of microfinance portfolios
and an expanded corporate governance program focusing on improving transparency and
management practices in the private sector. Programs to assist SMEs in the agriculture sector
and capacity-building support to entities lending to SMEs are being considered. Finally, IFC
is in discussions with the government on the next steps in administrative reform which
impact private sector activity, particularly in relation to issues raised by the recent
administrative barriers study carried out by FIAS which identified administrative and
governmental barriers to private sector development and proposed solutions to remove these.

Annex III. Lebanon: Statistical Issues
Gaps in the coverage of macroeconomic statistics hamper effective surveillance. In some
cases, these gaps widened, owing to the effects of the 2006 conflict. In particular, there is a need
for further work on the compilation of the international reserves template in order to facilitate
monitoring of the gross and net international reserves and for compiling accurately the counterpart
data in the central bank balance sheet. At present, it appears that most components of the monetary
and financial statistics, the public debt statistics, and data on the central government budgetary
accounts are available on a regular basis. However, other macroeconomic statistics (national
accounts, prices, employment, general government and the rest of the nonfinancial public sector,
and balance of payments) are largely estimated on the basis of partial information. Lebanon
participates in the GDDS.
The availability of real sector data remains very limited, although there has been progress in
compiling the national accounts. The ministry of economy and trade is currently receiving
technical assistance from the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies
(INSEE), for the development of national accounts statistics, including the compilation of
quarterly GDP data. The first set of national accounts estimates for 1997 (the base year) was
published in 2003 and estimates for 1998–2004 are now available. Prior to this initiative, official
national accounts statistics had not been produced since the mid-1970s, although preliminary
estimates for the major components of GDP at current prices for the years 1994 and 1995 were
published in October 1997. A household income survey was published in 1997. With assistance
from the EU, progress is being made toward a new census on buildings, dwellings and
establishments; developing and undertaking economic surveys; and conducting a household
budget survey on a national level.
Consumer price indices are prepared by the Central Administration for Statistics (CAS) and
private organizations on the basis of a limited basket of goods for the greater Beirut
metropolitan area. The CAS index is a quarterly index based on price collection from Beirut and
its suburbs. The index weights are based on the 1997 Household Budget Survey and are in need of
an update. Preparations for the new index are well under way and will have national coverage.
Published monthly data on the central government budgetary accounts are not
comprehensive. The published figures do not include certain transfers1 and financing data, omit
foreign-financed capital expenditure, and do not cover arrears. In addition, there are no data on the
widespread quasi-fiscal activities conducted by public corporations. Certain (treasury) spending is
only identified ex-post, and its economic classification with a lag. However, these items are
provided to the staff in the context of surveillance activities. No monthly data are available on
1

These transfers apparently include those to municipalities, subsidies for the state-owned electricity company,
foreign-financed capital expenditure, and payments to service providers (e.g., for waste management and cleaning
services in Beirut).

10
central government, as available data do not cover the social security funds. No sub-annual fiscal
data are currently reported for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS). Cash-based
annual government finance statistics limited to the budgetary central government are published in
the Government Finance statistics Yearbook (GFSY). The latest data received are for 2004, and
were published in the 2006 GFSY.
Lebanon has not received technical assistance in monetary and financial statistics in many
years. An assessment was undertaken during the 2002 GDDS/multisector mission which left an
action plan for improvement. The monetary and financial statistics are timely although the
institutional coverage is limited to the central bank and other depository corporations. However,
recently questions have emerged about the central bank’s statistical treatment of repos. On the
basis of available data and supporting information, it appears that some Eurobond repo
transactions undertaken by the central bank in mid-2005 were not recorded in its balance sheet
until end-2006.
Lebanon participated in the Coordinated Compilation Exercise for Financial Soundness
Indicators (FSIs). Data and metadata on a benchmark set of indicators of the soundness of the
financial system (for year-end 2005) are posted on the IMF website
(http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/fsi/fsicountrycategorylist/?strcode=LBN). Lebanon
attached high priority to the compilation of FSIs and has produced one of the most comprehensive
sets of indicators.
The balance of payments statistics (BOP) are weak. The data reflect deficiencies in the current
account (unrecorded exports, underestimation of private sector services and workers’ remittances),
the capital account (grants), and the financial account (equity investment in the nonbank private
sector, and corporate borrowing abroad). As a follow-up to the 2002 multisector mission, a
technical assistance mission in November 2005, made the following recommendations: (i) the
Central Bank of Lebanon and the CAS need to give high priority to extending the coverage of
their existing inter-agency agreement on the share of work for data collection and compilation in
balance of payments statistics; (ii) develop new data sources, with regard particularly to direct
investment; (iii) adopt the definition for official reserve assets as set out in the international
guidelines; and (iv) improve the periodicity of dissemination of detailed balance of payments data
to a quarterly frequency.
BOP source data improved with the implementation in 2003 of the International
Transactions Reporting Systems (ITRS). In July 2005, Lebanon provided STA for the first
time with quarterly data for 2002–04 and with methodological notes. Data currently covering
2002-2005 are published in the IFS and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY).
However, there have been significant revisions in financial account data and the flows in the
investment income-portfolio investment data (debit) for 2003 remained very large; even larger
then the flows in the financial account for the same instrument. The official reserve assets are
currently compiled on a gross basis consistent with the international guidelines.

AS OF JUNE 18, 2007

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
October 3, 2007
1.
This statement reports on most recent developments and their impact on the economic
outlook and the staff appraisal. It complements information contained in the Staff Report for
the 2007 Article IV Consultation and in the Report on Performance Under the Program
Supported by Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (IMF Staff Country Report No. 07/371).
A. Recent Developments
2.
The parliamentary majority and the opposition are still in discussion over the
choice of a compromise presidential candidate. The current president’s term comes to an
end on November 24, 2007, and the presidential election (by parliament) has been
postponed to October 23. The security situation remains tense in the wake of the latest
assassination of a member of the parliamentary majority on September 19. Main military
operations at the Nahr al-Bared Palestinian refugee camp were successfully completed. The
authorities estimate the cost of rebuilding the camp and the surrounding communities at
$300–400 million. They will be seeking additional donor assistance to fill this need.
3.
The latest economic activity indicators are consistent with the earlier projection
of 2 percent real GDP growth for 2007 (IMF Country Report No. 07/371). The economic
recovery in the first half of 2007 was relatively modest (economic activity remained well
below the very strong first half of 2006), and is unlikely to pick up momentum in the second
half given the unsettled political and security situation. CPI inflation decelerated to below
2 percent year-on-year in July, consistent with the end-year inflation projection of 2 percent
or lower.
4.
Financial markets have weathered relatively well the domestic political
uncertainty and the recent global financial turbulence. The Eurobond market has
reportedly been very quiet with hardly any trading, suggesting that investors are maintaining
their positions and waiting for the political situation to evolve. Eurobond spreads stood at
492 basis points on September 27, or 120 basis points higher than in mid-July. Deposit
inflows have continued at a sustained pace, with broad money growth of 7 percent since the
beginning of the year. Deposit dollarization is broadly unchanged at 76 percent.
5.
Despite the strength of monetary growth, commercial banks provided no new
net financing to the government in July and August. In the absence of fresh donor
support, the government turned to central bank financing. Still, riding on the strength of
capital inflows, gross international reserves increased by $300 million in July–August to
$11.9 billion. Gross government debt stood at $40.2 billion at end-August.
6.
Government revenue and expenditure performance through July is in line with
annual program objectives, but the authorities have not yet taken steps to increase
gasoline excises to the level agreed for end-September (monitorable action under the

2
program). At current international prices, the excise rate has declined to near zero, and
reaching the target rate of $0.20 a liter would require a 30 percent increase in gasoline retail
prices. Such an increase would yield about 0.5 percent of GDP over three months. The
authorities have indicated that they expect to meet the primary deficit target for 2007 even
without this measure, thanks to over performance on other revenue items and lower
expenditures, related in part to delays in capital spending.
7.
The authorities have requested technical assistance from the IMF’s Fiscal
Affairs Department to prepare for the removal of various subsidies and the
liberalization of gasoline prices, and to advise on the final stages of preparation of the
General Income Tax (GIT). Preparations for a staff mission are underway, awaiting receipt
of information on a household expenditure survey. The GIT is still under review before its
submission to the Cabinet for approval. The law would have to be approved by parliament
this year, if it is to come into effect in 2008 as planned. However, this deadline remains
challenging as considerable preparatory administrative work is still needed to meet this
objective.
8.
Disbursements of Paris III budget support this year are likely to fall significantly
short of program assumptions. Since June, the authorities have received a U.S. budgetary
grant of $75 million, and a $100 million World Bank Development Policy Loan is in the
process of being disbursed. They are also expecting the disbursement of $300 million in
budgetary loans from the United Arab Emirates. However, out of total outright budgetary
support (loans and grants) of around $1.6 billion projected for 2007, only $0.6–0.9 billion is
likely to be disbursed this year, mainly on account of technical and administrative reasons.
Moreover, the Paris III program was premised on the expectation that a significant portion of
project loans would be converted into indirect budget support (by financing existing or
planned government capital projects), but negotiations on this are still under way.
9.
A safeguards assessment of the Banque du Liban is currently in progress with
respect to Lebanon’s Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance. A mission visited Lebanon
September 10–17, and a draft report is being prepared for the authorities comments prior to
completion of the assessment.
B. Changes to the Outlook and Implications for the Staff Appraisal
10.
Recent developments do not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal of the
Article IV Staff Report:
•

Relative to the projections underlying the Article IV Staff Report, deposit inflows
have been stronger than expected, which should enable the government to increase its
reliance on domestic market financing at a time when donor support appears to be
falling short of program assumptions. However, as noted in the staff report, tapping
the market will likely require an upward adjustment in domestic interest rates,

3
particularly given the authorities’ commitment to rely on central bank credit only as
short-term bridge financing.
•

The upward revision in oil prices relative to those assumed in the Article IV report
will adversely affect the financial position of the loss-making power utility (EdL).
However, the budgetary impact is likely to be felt only starting in 2008 because of
lags in the financial support provided by the government to EdL.

•

The 2007 budget target remains achievable. Early action to increase the gasoline
excise would enhance the chances of meeting the target, and is also key to meeting
the authorities’ medium-term fiscal objectives, as spelled out in the Paris III program.

•

While a resolution of the political impasse is expected to lower Eurobond spreads,
Lebanon’s financing costs are likely to have increased on account of the global
re-assessment of risk. The adverse impact on debt sustainability reinforces the need
for a prompt implementation of the adjustment and reform measures planned for
2008. Realizing the expected privatization receipts and securing donor disbursements
will be important to meet projected foreign currency debt service payments of over
$4 billion in 2008 (of which $3.6 billion for Eurobond debt service).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation
with Lebanon
On October 3, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Lebanon.1
Background
Economic developments in 2006 were significantly affected by the July–August conflict
with Israel. Real GDP is estimated to have been flat, with strong growth in the first half of
the year offset by the disruptions during and after the conflict. Inflation increased, mainly
reflecting supply shortages during the conflict and the ensuing blockade. Financial
pressures associated with the conflict were managed effectively owing to the banking
system’s strong liquidity position. Immediately after the conflict, donors pledged
US$1.7 billion for relief and recovery (including at the Stockholm conference in August
2006), with disbursements in 2006 roughly offsetting the immediate fiscal costs of the
conflict. Nonetheless, the overall fiscal deficit increased in 2006 because of rising
interest expenditures and higher than expected transfers to the power company,
Electricité du Liban. Government debt rose to over US$40 billion (178 percent of GDP)
at end-2006.
The economic situation continues to be overshadowed by the political stalemate and
episodes of violence, including the assassination of a member of parliament in
June 2007 and a fifteen-week long battle between the army and Fatah al-Islam militants
in northern Lebanon. In this environment, economic activity, including tourism, remains
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
subdued, and real GDP is expected to rebound only slowly in 2007. Inflation as
measured by the Consumer Price Index declined through mid-2007 from its 2006 peak,
notwithstanding the depreciation of the U.S. dollar to which the currency is pegged.
Trade flows have recovered from the near- standstill during and after the conflict, with
the trade deficit in the first half of 2007 deteriorating slightly relative to the same period
in 2006.
The financial system has remained resilient to the political uncertainty. Owing to
moderate capital inflows and slow deposit growth as well as limited donor
disbursements, international reserves declined by US$300 million to US$11 billion in the
first quarter. However, deposit growth accelerated subsequently, and by end-June broad
money was already 4½ percent higher than prior to the conflict with Israel, with
international reserves more than recovering to US$11.6 billion at end-June 2007. Still,
the political deadlock has increased risks, as reflected by Eurobond spreads of 495
basis points as of end-August and deposit dollarization of around 76 percent,
significantly higher than prior to the 2006 conflict. The recent turbulence in international
financial markets has not had, up to now, a significant impact on Lebanon. While
spreads have increased by around 80 basis points between mid-July and mid-August,
there has been no pressure on the currency, and deposit inflows have remained robust,
though at a more moderate pace than in the second quarter.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended a good policy performance under the program supported by the
Fund’s Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance. The economy is recovering despite the
persistent high oil price and political uncertainty, inflationary pressures have eased, and
gross international reserves have increased further.
At the same time, Directors underscored that major challenges remain, including the
large debt overhang, financial and macroeconomic vulnerabilities, and high energy
costs. They considered the authorities’ 2007–12 reform program to be an ambitious and
credible strategy for meeting these challenges. They acknowledged that implementation
of the program will be a challenging task given the difficult political and security
situation. While Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ reiterated commitment to
reform, they noted that the authorities will need to pay close attention to the timing of the
reform process. Directors stressed that donor support is an important pillar of the reform
strategy, and called for timely disbursement of such support.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ success in containing the primary fiscal deficit in the
first half of 2007. They emphasized the need for determined action to achieve the 2007
budget deficit target and the medium-term debt reduction objectives. In this regard,
Directors commended the steps taken to initiate reforms in the social security and power
sectors. They encouraged the authorities to give priority to raising gasoline excises as
soon as the political situation allows.

3

Directors welcomed the fiscal adjustment and privatization plans for 2008. They noted
the planned increases in the value-added tax and the tax on interest income in 2008, the
preparations for the introduction of a global income tax in 2008, and the administrative
reforms underway. Directors emphasized that further progress is needed on energy
sector reforms to realize the expected medium-term expenditure savings. They
supported the planned privatization of the telecom sector as crucial to the success of the
reform strategy.
Directors stressed the importance of strengthening public financial management. They
encouraged the authorities to follow up on their action plan to improve the cash and
budget management functions. While they called for expenditure restraint, Directors
advised against across-the-board expenditure cuts, and recommended that efforts focus
instead on curtailing low-priority current spending rather than capital spending. Directors
also emphasized the need to strengthen the social safety nets. They welcomed the
establishment of a debt management office.
Directors noted that the monetary policy framework has served Lebanon well, especially
in helping to maintain financial stability in the face of disruptions in international financial
markets. They underscored that central bank financing of the government will need to
be gradually reduced in order to safeguard the central bank’s balance sheet, and
supported the authorities’ intentions to rely increasingly on market finance.
Going forward, Directors supported the planned introduction of transparent short-term
monetary instruments, and underscored the importance of allowing greater interest rate
flexibility in Treasury bill auctions. Directors advised that the central bank refrain from
quasi-fiscal activities, and supported the establishment of a joint working group in the
Ministry of Finance and the central bank to better coordinate interventions in the
financial market.
Directors considered that the exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar has helped maintain
financial stability without impairing competitiveness. They noted that gross international
reserves, combined with the banking system’s liquidity cushion, appear to be sufficient
to meet temporary pressures on the exchange rate. Directors agreed that the real
effective exchange rate appears broadly in line with fundamentals. Going forward,
Directors stressed that continued sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms,
particularly full implementation of fiscal adjustment plans, will be essential to support the
exchange rate peg.
Directors noted that the banking sector, though profitable and well capitalized, faces
vulnerabilities associated with high sovereign exposure, maturity mismatches, and the
high degree of dollarization. They agreed that a reduction in the government debt will be
crucial to reduce these vulnerabilities, but also emphasized the need to strengthen risk

4
management, diversify loan portfolios, and enhance cross-border supervision. Directors
welcomed commercial banks’ readiness to adopt Basel II requirements in 2008.

Statement by A. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Lebanon
October 3, 2007

1.
On behalf of the Lebanese authorities, I would like to express my appreciation to the
staff, Management, and the Executive Board for their continued constructive engagement
with Lebanon. The authorities view the consultation process, as well as the continued
provision of technical assistance, as being of great value to the country.
2.
The authorities remain committed to their ambitious medium-term reform program,
which was presented to donors at the Paris III conference in January 2007. The program,
developed in close cooperation with the Fund, aims at raising growth, improving living
standards, and reducing Lebanon’s large debt overhang and financial vulnerabilities, while
carefully considering the timing of adjustment measures, given the current difficult post-war
environment. The program includes a strong phased fiscal adjustment which, along with
privatization proceeds and Paris III contributions, should gradually strengthen the primary
balance and result in a significant reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term.
The institutional structure that the government has put in place to monitor the
implementation of the Paris III program aims at ensuring sustainability of the reform
momentum generated under Paris III. The authorities acknowledge, however, that proper
implementation of the program remains subject to improved political and security conditions.
Recent Developments
3.
The current year continues to be particularly difficult, with persistent serious political
tension and security concerns ahead of the presidential election, which is expected to be held
by November 2007. Notwithstanding the daunting political and security challenges,
economic indicators point to a slow recovery from the 2006 Israeli attack on Lebanon. Real
GDP is expected to rebound to about 2 percent in 2007. CPI inflation is projected to fall to
around 2 percent by year’s end, following price pressures in the summer of 2006, due to
supply shortages related to the war and the subsequent blockade. The financial system
remains resilient. Gross international reserves recovered to about $12 billion at end-August,
supported by strong deposit inflows. Moreover, trade flows have resumed after an
interruption occasioned by the 2006 war.
4.
Against this background, the authorities continue to consider the Fund-supported
Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA) to be critical in supporting their efforts to
implement the 2007 agenda, thereby paving the way for more ambitious fiscal adjustment
and structural reforms in subsequent years. Performance under the EPCA was strong, with all
end-March 2007 quantitative targets observed, with the exception of the ceiling on
government borrowing from the Banque du Liban (BdL), which was exceeded by a small
margin. Indeed, in the first months of 2007, the government had to solicit further direct
financing from the BdL, amidst serious political tensions and ensuing tight market

2
conditions, as commercial banks failed to roll over maturing government paper. Moreover,
all the quantitative targets for the second quarter of 2007 were observed with large margins.
5.
Economic policy and performance in the first half of 2007, particularly the strong
revenue collection and continued expenditure restraint, augur well for the achievement of the
program’s end-year quantitative fiscal targets. However, actual disbursements of pledges
committed at the Paris III and Stockholm conferences have so far fallen well below EPCA
assumptions. While of the total US$7.6 billion pledged at the Paris III conference,
agreements have been signed for about US$3.4 billion, out of US$1.6 billion in budgetary
support pledged for 2007, only US$0.6–0.9 billion is likely to be received this year. At the
same time, US$175 million has been disbursed to date and a US$100 million World Bank
Development Policy Loan is in the process of being disbursed. Should disbursement fail to
accelerate considerably in the last quarter of 2007 in line with Paris III pledges, the
authorities would find it extremely difficult to identify additional fiscal measures to offset the
resulting sizable shortfall, as rightly pointed out by staff. This outcome would weigh on the
government’s indebtedness.
6.
Notwithstanding their strong commitment to the objectives of the EPCA and the
medium-term reform agenda, the authorities are aware of persistent vulnerabilities. In the
short-term, the economy remains vulnerable to swings in confidence. Moreover, the political
deadlock has increased risks, as reflected by Eurobond spreads and deposit dollarization,
which remain higher than prior to the 2006 war. Looking ahead, despite the strong fiscal
adjustment and structural reforms embedded in the authorities’ program to bring down the
debt-to-GDP ratio significantly, the debt dynamics are likely to remain fragile and
vulnerabilities high. Accordingly, in addition to the commitment of the authorities to pursue
their ambitious reform agenda under the EPCA and beyond, continued strong international
support remains essential to help Lebanon reduce its economic vulnerabilities. In particular,
it is important that donors fully carry through their financial commitments made at the
Paris III conference, in a timely fashion, and in line with the authorities’ macroeconomic
objectives and policy priorities. The authorities continue to actively seek flexibility from
donors to convert project loans pledges into budgetary support to further reduce the debt
burden. They are particularly grateful for the Fund’s assistance in this regard.

3
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
7.
Sound fiscal management to date in 2007 succeeded not only in avoiding a
deterioration in the fiscal position, but also in improving the primary balance, while
attempting to meet the large social and reconstruction needs of the Lebanese population. The
first and second quarter performance was within the EPCA targets. Stronger than projected
revenue collection, and containment of expenditures below the EPCA targets, helped contain
the primary deficit and the accumulation of net debt. Moreover, the cabinet approved the
draft budget for 2007, which includes the foreign financed component of the Council of
Development and Reconstruction and activities of the Higher Relief Council.
8.
In spite of unanticipated and sizeable conflict-related expenditure, the primary budget
deficit, excluding grants, is expected to be contained at 3.7 percent of GDP at end-2007, as
programmed, supported by higher than projected revenues. On the revenue front, the
authorities remain committed to introducing a floor on gasoline excises of $0.20 per liter.
Given the continued political instability, however, implementation of this measure may have
to be postponed until after the presidential elections. Uncapping domestic gasoline prices in a
context of high international oil prices would translate in a substantial hike in gasoline retail
prices, which, in the present political and economic environment, may seriously exacerbate
existing tensions. It is well to note that delaying implementation of this measure will not
jeopardize the primary balance target for 2007, as envisaged under the EPCA. Indeed, the
potential loss stemming form a delayed introduction of a floor on gasoline excises has
already been largely compensated for by increases in other sources of revenue, including
VAT, customs, income tax, and telecom transfer. Preliminary estimates indicate that the
end-September 2007 revenue performance already exceeds the end-of-year target under the
EPCA. The authorities have also requested technical assistance from the Fund to prepare for
the removal of various subsidies and the liberalization of gasoline prices.
9.
Important progress has been achieved in preparing the fiscal adjustment effort
envisaged for 2008. On the revenue side, the draft 2007 budget already provides for
increasing the value-added tax rate and the tax on interest income as of 2008. The draft
Global Income Tax law is near completion and should be ready for submission to parliament
by year end. In addition, the review of the Tax Procedure Code has been finalized by the
parliamentary committees, and is awaiting ratification by Parliament. Ongoing revenue
administration reforms, including the introduction of a medium taxpayer office, new audit
procedures, and the update of the real estate tax database, are expected to yield revenue
gains. On the expenditure side, the authorities’ medium-term program aims at gradually
eliminating transfers to the public sector, which hinges on reforming the energy and social
sectors that have drained budget resources over the years. In this connection, and in close
cooperation with the World Bank, reform plans for Electricité du Liban (EdL) and the

4
National Social Security Fund (NSSF) are being finalized.1 Administrative measures include
better cooperation and information sharing across ministries and the planned establishment of
a debt management office, in addition to measures aimed at strengthening treasury and debt
management capabilities. The authorities have achieved further progress in implementing the
public financial management reform plan developed with Fund assistance, and aimed at
enhancing budget monitoring and control procedures. A pilot project for program budgeting
at the Ministry of Public Health was also introduced in the draft 2008 budget.
Monetary Policy and Banking Sector Policies and Reforms
10.
The monetary policy framework has enabled the authorities to effectively control
financial pressures. The exchange rate peg continues to serve the economy well by providing
a firm anchor to financial stability. It proved crucial given balance sheet risks related to
widespread dollarization and the government’s high foreign currency debt servicing
obligations. The debt overhang and the large external current account deficits are the
counterpart of fiscal imbalances, as well as temporary factors related to the post-conflict
environment. They would be addressed by implementing the Paris III fiscal adjustment
program. In this context, the authorities are of the view that the current exchange level is
appropriate, and agree with staff’s assessment outlined in Box 3. Furthermore, they are
confident that Lebanon’s competitiveness could significantly benefit over the medium term
from the planned structural reforms.
11.
Interest rate stability has largely contributed to facing financial pressures, reflected in
higher dollarization and pressures in the foreign exchange market. Admittedly, these
conditions have required the BdL to occasionally resort to various financial and long-term
monetary instruments to manage liquidity and safeguard international reserves. These
included the issuance of dollar-denominated certificate of deposits, special discount
windows, and swaps. While the authorities believe that the BdL could temporarily provide
financing to the government under tight market conditions, in line with its mandate to
maintain financial stability, they concur with staff that prolonged shortfalls in market demand
for government paper would have to be met by raising treasury bills rates. The authorities are
of the view that flexible interest rates are essential to counter further increases in
dollarization, which might adversely affect the central bank’s foreign reserves levels. They
consider that an appropriate spread between returns on foreign currency and Lebanese

Key progress has been achieved in reforming EdL, including: (i) the appointment of an auditor for the
2002-2006 fiscal years, and the publication of the audited 2001 financial statements; (ii) the appointment of
international consultants at the Ministry of Energy and Water, EdL and the Higher Council for Privatization, to
assist in implementing the restructuring of the electricity sector; (iii) the appointment of a transaction advisor
for the sale of Beddawi power plant in Northern Lebanon and the investment in new capacity by the private
sector; (iv) the signature of an agreement with Egypt for the import of Natural Gas to the Beddawi power plant
in the North; and (v) the appointment of a consultant to prepare a generation and transmission Master Plan for
the energy sector.

pounds in the domestic market should thus be assured in order for commercial banks to
subscribe in government paper. On the current account level, an adequate spread between
domestic returns on dollar investments and international rates would help ensure the
necessary inflows of capital into the economy. The authorities are of the view, however, that
an upward adjustment in domestic interest rates at this stage may not attract sufficient market
financing given the existing uncertainties, and thus have an adverse signaling effect. Once
more stable and predictable market conditions prevail, the central bank should be in a better
position to maintain price stability using short-term monetary instruments. This would help
strengthen its balance sheet and reduce its cash losses. Going forward, fiscal adjustment and
improved confidence would help reduce dollarization, which would facilitate a further
buildup of net international reserves and strengthen the BdL’s income position. Improved
political and security conditions, however, remain essential to the reform of the monetary
policy framework.

The banking sector remains profitable, well-capitalized, and well-supervised.
However, vulnerabilities are high, as reflected in domestic bank’s high exposure to the
sovereign, the substantial maturity mismatch on their books, as well as the high degree of
dollarization which exposes them to credit risk. In this context, and given potential systemic
risks between the fiscal and the financial sector, the authorities welcome the commercial
banks’ focus on private sector lending and their strategy of regional diversification. The
regulatory and supervisory framework has appropriately adapted to these developments. This
is evidenced in the circular issued by the banking control commission in 2006, raising the
limits on the exposure of Lebanese banks to non-resident borrowers, and the progress in
developing memoranda of understanding on consolidated supervision with supervisory
authorities in countries where Lebanese banks are expanding. Commercial banks are
expected to further strengthen risk management with the introduction of Basel II standards
in 2008.
Other Structural Reforms
13.
Reforming the social and energy sectors, which have drained the government’s
financial resources for years, is pivotal to the medium-term structural reform agenda.
Reforms to address imbalances, and possible contingent liabilities, in the pension and health
system are being developed. A draft pension law, providing for transforming the private
pension systems from an end-of-service allowance to a fully funded system, has been
submitted to parliament. Furthermore, the authorities, supported by the World Bank, are
looking into options for addressing the losses of the health fund of the NSSF. The
government is currently finalizing a comprehensive energy sector reform plan in close
cooperation with the World Bank, with the objective of restructuring EdL to pave the way for
partial privatization. The main reform measures envisaged for 2008 include: (i) the
completion of an audit of EdL accounts for 2002–2006, (ii) the completion of EdL’s asset
registration and valuation, (iii) the corporatization of the company, (iv) the launch of a pilot
project for remote meter installation and distribution management by private operators,

6
(v) launching the privatization of the Beddawi power plant, and (vi) soliciting private sector
investment in new capacity.
14.
The privatization of the telecommunications sector is expected to start as early as
October 2007. A legal opinion by the ministry of justice concluded that the law for the sale of
the fixed assets of the two state-owned mobile phone operators was no longer necessary.
Accordingly, the government expects that invitations for expressions of interest for the two
companies to be issued by the end of 2007. The authorities are committed to undertaking the
privatization of the mobile sector companies through a transparent public offering. The
privatization of the fixed line, as well as a third mobile license, are planned to be launched
in 2008.
15.
In conclusion, looking forward, for the reform agenda for 2008 and beyond to be
successfully implemented, three critical conditions have to be met. First, a satisfactory
outcome of the current ongoing presidential elections. Second, the international community’s
delivery of aid committed under Paris III. And finally, a reasonable environment of peace
and security in Lebanon and the region as a whole.
