INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
and Request for an Arrangement Under the Precautionary Credit Line
Prepared by the European Department
(in Consultation with other Departments)
Approved by Adam Bennett and Jan Kees Martijn
January 4, 2011
Discussion: Skopje, November 4–17 (for Article IV consultations and to discuss a possible
PCL) and December 6–9, 2010 (to continue PCL discussions). The mission met with Prime
Minister Gruevski, Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Stavreski; Deputy Prime
Minister Peshevski; Economy Minister Besimi; NBRM Governor Goshev; other officials;
members of the political opposition; the private sector; press representatives, and others. At
the conclusion of each visit a joint press conference was held with the finance minister and
NBRM governor.
Team: November visit: Mr. McGrew (head, EUR), Mr. Arregui (EUR), Ms. Dobrescu (FAD),
Ms. Bi (SPR), and Mr. Tieman (Resident Representative). December visit: Mr. Bennett
(EUR), Mr. McGrew and Mr. Tieman.
Consultation focus: The focus was on policies to support the economic recovery while
guarding against external risks, and the role a PCL could play in supporting the authorities’
program.
PCL request: The authorities requested a two-year PCL arrangement, with access of 500
percent of quota (SDR 344.5 million) in the first year and an additional 100 percent of quota
(SDR 68.9 million in the second year) to help protect the economy against external risks.
Political developments and EU accession: The ruling VMRO-DPMNE enjoys a majority in
the unicameral parliament and does not face elections until mid-2012. It also holds the
presidency and a majority of municipal governments. Together with its Albanian coalition
partner DUI, it controls a super-majority of two-thirds of seats. The name dispute with Greece
continues to block the initiation of EU accession negotiations and NATO membership.
Publication intentions: The authorities have agreed to publication of the staff report.
Exchange rate arrangement and Article VIII status: The de jure exchange rate regime is
managed floating; the de facto regime is a stabilized arrangement against the euro. Macedonia
has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
Recovery from the modest recession in 2009 is underway, and growth is expected to
accelerate to 3½ percent in 2011. The resumption of growth is supported by the recent
reductions on policy interest rates, which are expected to be transmitted with a lag to lower bank
lending rates, the ongoing recovery in European trading partners, the cyclical bounce typical of
recoveries, and the overall healthy condition of the banking sector. Core inflation has remained
below 1 percent, although increasing food and energy prices have pushed headline inflation
somewhat higher.
2.
External adjustment has been rapid and international reserves are broadly
adequate. The current account deficit fell from a peak of close to 13 percent of GDP in 2008 to a
projected 3½ percent in 2010. The balance of payments appears sustainable over the medium
term in light of the lack of significant overvaluation, healthy export prospects, and more subdued
capital inflows and domestic credit growth than in the run-up to the crisis. International reserves
are expected to be some 95 percent of short-term debt at end-2010 and to trend upwards in 2011
and over the medium term.
3.
The fiscal deficit is expected to be 2½ percent of GDP in 2010 and the 2011 budget
also targets a deficit of 2½ percent. The fiscal stance in 2010 was somewhat contractionary but
will turn broadly neutral in 2011. In the view of staff, this strikes an appropriate balance between
supporting economic recovery and preserving low public debt ratios and investor confidence.
Over the medium-term, the authorities plan to reduce fiscal deficits to strengthen public finances
further.
4.
The monetary authorities are near the end of an easing cycle that began in late 2009.
The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) reduced its policy rate from 9 percent
in November 2009 to 4 percent in December 2010. It based this easing on favorable trends in the
balance of payments and international reserves, against a backdrop of contained inflation and
below-potential output. In staff’s view this easing has been consistent with protecting the
exchange rate peg yet providing more room for growth, while the scope for further easing is
limited due to the narrowing spread over ECB rates.
5.
The banking sector remains sound. The crisis took its toll in the form of a significant
increase in nonperforming loans and reduction in profitability over the past two years. However,
the underlying soundness of the system remains intact, based on high capital adequacy ratios,
ample liquidity, minimal reliance on foreign financing, conservative balance sheets, and careful
supervision and regulation.
6.
The principal risks to this broadly favorable outlook come from the potential for
financial turbulence in the Eurozone to spill over to Macedonia. Turbulence in sovereign
debt markets and financial systems and negative growth shocks in the Eurozone could affect
Macedonia through the current and capital accounts. Lower demand for Macedonia’s exports
would damage growth prospects and could cause balance of payments pressures, while loss of

5
access to capital markets would deprive the authorities of financing for external debt service and
the fiscal deficit. Upside risks include progress in the name dispute with Greece, which could
unblock the path to EU accession and NATO membership, and further increases in prices of
metal exports.
7.
In light of these risks, the authorities have requested a Precautionary Credit Line
(PCL) arrangement. They have requested a two-year arrangement, with access of 500 percent
of quota (SDR 344.5 million) in the first year and an additional 100 percent of quota (SDR
68.9 million in the second year).
8.
Staff supports the authorities’ request. The resources available if needed under the
proposed arrangement would help ensure that Macedonia could weather an adverse scenario.
Moreover, having a PCL in place would send a positive signal that policies are sound and that
the authorities have adequate resources to draw upon if needed, which should strengthen investor
confidence and improve access to international capital markets. The authorities would not be
expected to draw upon the PCL unless there is a significant deterioration in external conditions.
9.
The program will include indicative targets on the fiscal deficit and on net
international reserves, as well as the standard continuous performance criteria. These
targets are described in the authorities’ written communication requesting a PCL arrangement
(Attachment 1). They are consistent with the authorities’ 2011 budget and with their ongoing
commitment to ensure a level of reserves sufficient to protect the exchange rate peg.

I. OVERVIEW: GRADUAL RECOVERY TWO YEARS AFTER ONSET OF GLOBAL CRISIS
A. Growth and Inflation Developments
10.
Gradual recovery is underway. Growth is projected at 1.2 percent in 2010, after a
contraction of 0.9 percent in 2009. This

The current account deficit has adjusted sharply and is expected to register a deficit
of some 3½ percent of GDP in 2010. This adjustment from the deficit of 12.7 percent of GDP
in 2008 reflects improvement in the trade balance and strong growth in private transfers.

The banking sector remains healthy and growth of bank credit and of deposits has
started to recover. The rapid growth of earlier years slowed to a crawl in 2009, but turned
upwards in 2010. Meanwhile, bank balance sheets remain sound despite a rise in nonperforming
loans, funding sources have been stable (primarily domestic deposits, with relatively little external
borrowing) and the banking system is in a position to support economic recovery (Figure 3;
Box 2).

D. Policy Stance
13.
The budget is on track to meet the 2010 fiscal deficit target of 2.5 percent of
GDP. Revenues are projected to fall some 1 percentage point of GDP short of amounts in the
supplemental budget, due in part to lower than projected growth. The government has
responded by restraining discretionary expenditure, including both current and capital
spending, in order to meet the target. Earlier in the year, it also accumulated payment arrears
on government invoices and VAT refund payments, which were cleared by October. These
arrears resulted from cash flow pressures, related in part to the later than usual timing of the
dividend on the government’s stake in the telecom company and to difficult external debt
market conditions in the wake of the Greek crisis.
14.
The SDR allocation, T-bill issuance, and use of deposits at the central bank were
the main funding sources in 2010. Gross financing needs, including the fiscal deficit and
debt amortization, amounted to 4.5 percent of GDP. The authorities’ original financing plan
envisioned a Eurobond issuance of some €200 million, but this was shelved when market
conditions worsened during the Greek crisis. The authorities instead drew upon their SDR
allocation (1 percent of GDP) and used other official foreign financing, T-bills, and public
deposits at the central bank (paragraph 23).

Box 1. Macedonia’s Response to Past Policy Advice from the Fund
During the 2009 Article IV consultations (concluded in December 2009), Directors praised Macedonia’s
macroeconomic policies, while identifying the still large current account deficit (7.2 percent of GDP in
2009) as a vulnerability.
On fiscal policy Directors agreed that the 2010 fiscal deficit target of 2.5 percent of GDP was appropriate
and that the authorities should strive to achieve this target even if revenues were to fall short of projections.
Directors advised that debt sustainability considerations should guide fiscal targets over the medium term.
On monetary policy Directors called for easing contingent on favorable trends in the balance of payments
and international reserves.
The authorities’ policies over the past year have been broadly consistent with the advice of Directors. The
government is on track to meet its 2010 fiscal deficit targets, after reducing expenditures in response to
underperformance of revenues. The NBRM has significantly lowered interest rates, in a context of rapid
adjustment of the current account deficit and increasing international reserves, and has signaled that further
interest rate reductions will be contingent on continued favorable trends in the external accounts.

hold ample liquidity, with highly liquid
assets comprising 24 percent of total
assets.
The two Greek-owned banks, representing 26 percent of system assets, are healthy overall. Stopanska
Bank (owned by the National Bank of Greece) is the largest bank in Macedonia with 23 percent of
system assets, and is systemically important. Its capital ratio is above the system average, it does not
rely on its parent for funding, and has not experienced deposit outflows. The second Greek bank, Alpha
Bank, holds 3 percent of system assets and has been hit harder by the downturn. Alpha expanded rapidly
in 2007 and the first half of 2008, and was confronted with substantial NPL increases in 2009 and 2010.
In response, Alpha has thoroughly reorganized its portfolio and lending practices, received a capital
injection from its parent, and is now in a consolidation stage.
The quality of banking regulation and supervision has contributed to the stability of the banking sector.
Supervision is conducted by the independent NBRM, which pays close attention to capital ratios, uses
conservative practices and rules on NPL provisioning, and has set reserve and liquidity requirements at
conservative levels. In addition, the NBRM conducts regular and thorough on-site examinations of asset
quality and lending practices. It runs regular stress tests, which show that the system remains solvent
under extreme adverse scenarios. In a scenario with a 20 percent depreciation combined with other
shocks, the average capital adequacy ratio of the system remains above 12 percent but falls slightly
below 8 percent for one large bank and becomes negative for one medium-sized bank.
The banking system is highly euroized, with 56 percent of deposits and 58 percent of loans either in FX
or linked to FX. Euroization increased with the onset of the global crisis in 2008, but has trended down
(deposits) or been flat (loans) since mid-2009 (Figure 3). While the banking system has a net long open
foreign exchange position, it is exposed to indirect credit risk from unhedged borrowers (according to
NBRM surveys, 14 percent of loans to corporates are fully or partially hedged). Stability of the peg is
thus important for the system’s health.
The remaining 10 percent of the financial sector (insurance, leasing, and pension funds) do not pose
systemic risk.

II. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK
A. Real Economy and Inflation
16.
The recovery is expected to pick up
pace in 2011, with growth at 3½ percent. This
favorable outlook is based on signs of momentum
visible in leading indicators of consumption and
investment and the upturn in bank credit. The
resumption of growth will be supported by the
recent reductions on policy interest rates, which
are expected to be transmitted with a lag to
lower bank lending rates; the ongoing recovery
in European trading partners; the cyclical
bounce typical of recoveries; and the overall
healthy condition of the banking sector. The
authorities broadly share this outlook.

B. Balance of Payments
18.
The current account deficit is expected to remain at moderate levels that can be
financed largely by FDI over the medium term. As the recovery gains momentum and FDI
recovers toward pre-crisis levels, the current account deficit is expected to widen to the
5½ percent range over the medium term. If growth surprises on the downside or FDI remains
stagnant, the deficit would be more contained. International reserves are expected to rise
gradually over the medium term, reaching 120 percent of short-term debt (residual maturity)
in 2013–2015.
19.
The medium-term balance of payments is sustainable and the exchange rate peg
remains viable and well supported. This assessment is based on (1) the lack of real
exchange rate overvaluation; (2) strong export prospects; (3) the strong link of the current

14

account to capital inflows (in particular FDI); and (4) slower domestic credit growth over the
medium term than over 2004–08.


The standard CGER methodology does not show any significant misalignment. The
three CGER measures show a slight 3.3 percent to 6.3 percent overvaluation, which is
not significantly different from zero (Box 4). This assessment of competitiveness is
supported by the low wages and taxes (including 10 percent flat personal and
corporate income tax rates) in Macedonia.



Prospects for export growth are good
over the medium-term. Exports in 2010
are projected to be 8 percent below 2008
levels, indicating excess capacity. Several
large exporters have invested recently in
capacity and have plans for sizable
expansion, including the largest metals
exporters and the auto part companies.
Foreign investment in other export
industries is in the pipeline.

Historically, the current account responds more to FDI and other capital inflows (with
a lag) than to the exchange rate. Indeed, the real exchange rate has been very stable
over the past decade, making its influence on the trade and current accounts difficult
to isolate.

20.
Macedonia’s external debt service ratio is moderate compared to other countries
in the region. External debt service was about 57 percent of exports of goods and services in
2009, slightly higher than in Poland and Serbia but lower than in other countries in the
region. About 80 percent of external debt service consists of short-term debt, comprising
mainly trade credits and intercompany loans. Both these types of short-term debt are less
subject to rollover risk than many other liabilities such as bilateral bank loans, syndicated
loans, and sovereign debt. In addition, trade credits are covered by imports that usually serve
as collateral. The high level of trade credits in Macedonia can be partly explained by its high
imports-to-GDP ratio. Another mitigating factor is strong private transfers, which have been
stable over time. If these are included in the denominator, the debt service ratio falls to
40 percent.

Staff views this fiscal stance as broadly appropriate on the basis of cyclical
demand management and debt sustainability. The 2010 stance is somewhat contractionary
(a negative fiscal impulse of 1.3 percent of GDP), while the 2011 target is close to neutral.
Although a more counter-cyclical stance might have been justified in 2010 (in light of slower
than expected growth early in the year), financing was constrained externally by market
volatility related to the crisis in Greece, and domestically by the limited size of the public
debt market. This fiscal stance implies a rise in public debt from 24.6 percent of GDP at
end-2010 to a projected peak of 27 percent of GDP in 2012, and then a gradual decline in
outer years.

17

23.
The authorities plan to finance their 2011 budget deficit with a Eurobond issue
in the first half of next year. They view this as preferable to domestic financing, as it will
help boost international reserves and may reduce crowding out of the private sector as
economic activity picks up. Moreover, the domestic T-bill market is relatively small (below
4 percent of GDP) and over one percent of GDP will be required to repay maturing state
bonds (which are largely a legacy of the break-up of the former Yugoslavia). Market
conditions have improved since the onset of the Greek crisis, with secondary market yields
on Macedonia’s 2015 Eurobond under 6 percent (390 basis points over German Bunds) as of
mid-December and little impact thus far from the crisis in Ireland. Staff agreed that Eurobond
financing was appropriate for 2011 and that market conditions appeared to be adequately
receptive at present. Staff advised that the authorities should turn towards domestic debt
markets in the medium-term (Box 3). The authorities intend to avoid payment delays in the
event of future financing pressures.

Box 3. Medium-term Public Debt Strategy
The authorities’ strategy of relying on Eurobond markets for deficit financing in 2011–2012 appears
appropriate on balance. However, over the medium term Macedonia should seek to reduce its need to
issue Eurobonds by developing domestic debt markets and reducing fiscal deficits.
Macedonia’s public debt structure is in transition, from low interest rate non-market debt (multilateral
and bilateral) to more costly private debt (domestic T-bills and external Eurobonds, Table 10). In
2011–2012 the government plans to finance budget shortfalls largely through Eurobonds, and over
the medium-term to reduce deficits and develop the domestic debt market. As this process unfolds,
debt management will become more important in light of the higher cost and greater volatility of
market borrowing.
The higher cost of market debt means that the authorities must have higher primary surpluses to
preserve stable debt ratios. For example, if Macedonia were to meet projected fiscal deficits through
2015 only with Eurobonds issued at the present secondary market yield, interest payments would rise
by 0.3 percent of GDP, requiring an equal increase in the primary balance to stabilize public debt
ratios.
As the authorities consider the relative weights of Eurobond and domestic T-bill issuance, there are
several tradeoffs to take into account.


Eurobond financing has several attractive features. First, it helps to build international
reserves (provided it is at least partially sterilized by NBRM instruments). Second, it
lengthens debt maturities (domestic market debt is virtually all short term), which reduces
rollover risks. Third, there may be some reduction in crowding out, as external issuance
boosts reserves and allows a more relaxed monetary stance (less than full sterilization by
NBRM instruments). Finally, Eurobond financing helps establish a presence in international
capital markets and broadens the investor base, with benefits for corporate access.



Eurobond financing also carries risks. External markets are subject to volatility for external
reasons, as seen in the spike in Eurobond yields during the Greek crisis, which did not have
the same impact on domestic debt yields. A cross-country panel model of the determinants of
spreads shows that domestic factors explain only a small portion of the recent movements in
Macedonia’s borrowing costs1. This external volatility creates the risk that markets will be
closed or demand a high premium for issuance needed to finance deficits or roll over
maturing debt. Moreover, external debt exposes the country to foreign exchange risk if the
exchange rate comes under pressure.

There are no established benchmarks for the optimal or maximum stock of Eurobond debt. Looking at

1

Empirical models indicate that Macedonia should be able to issue at a spread of some 250 basis points. This
suggests that Macedonia can expect its current secondary market spreads of around 400 basis points to narrow
as global financial conditions normalize.

19

other countries’ experience, Macedonia’s stock of external market debt is around 5 percent of GDP,
which is relatively low and suggests there is room for additional issuance. However, if it were to
finance its fiscal deficits solely by Eurobonds through 2015, its stock of Eurobond debt as a share of
GDP would be high relative to comparable issuers. With respect to the size of individual
bond issues, the 2½ percent of GDP range envisaged by the authorities for 2011 and 2012 is not out
of line with the experience of other issuers.2

authorities that this is an appropriate
framework and that recent rate cuts were justified in light of conditions (trends in reserves,
balance of payments, euroization, inflation and the output gap). Staff expressed the view that

20

further easing should be cautious and dependent on continued favorable conditions, in light
of the narrowing spread over Eurozone rates and the cost to credibility of easing excessively
and then being required to reverse course. The authorities concurred, while noting that
further modest easing is possible if conditions remain favorable in the coming months.
25.
The authorities are committed to maintaining the exchange rate peg, which they
believe has provided a successful anchor for monetary policy and has deep public
support. Staff agreed that the peg has served Macedonia well, delivering low and stable
inflation, a stable real exchange rate, and moderate volatility of output, and has not prevented
current account adjustment. There was agreement that with supportive policies, the peg
continued to provide a suitable anchor for the authorities’ objectives of low inflation and
stable growth.
C. Financial Sector and Structural Reform
26.
The authorities recently passed a new NBRM law and are taking several
initiatives to improve further the resilience of the banking sector and to strengthen
crisis response capabilities. The new law on the NBRM will strengthen its independence
and bring practices fully in line with EU directives and the European System of Central
Banks Treaty, drawing upon advice from the EU, IMF, and World Bank. The authorities
have prepared draft legislation to address the risk of court challenges to NBRM intervention
of insolvent banks and close gaps in the ability to impose fit and proper requirements on bank
owners and managers. They have also prepared proposals to widen the class of assets that
banks may use to access liquidity support from the NBRM. The authorities recently created
the Financial Stability Committee to coordinate crisis response activities and are in the
process of making it operational.
27.
The authorities are undertaking structural reforms that are intended to improve
Macedonia’s long-term growth potential. In the area of public infrastructure, they are
making investments to raise the quality of key highway and railroad links with neighboring
countries and have submitted a new energy law that will create a liberalized energy market
and improve incentives for energy efficiency and investment. Full liberalization of the energy
market will also have important macroeconomic benefits by helping to insulate the balance
of payments from shocks to domestic electricity production and volatility in the price of
electricity imports3.The authorities are also continuing their efforts to improve the business
environment and attract investment through initiatives such as cadastral reform, privatization
of several loss-making state-owned enterprises, and moderate further reductions in social
contribution rates in 2012 and 2013 to reduce the labor tax wedge and increase employment.
The authorities plan to make these reductions in rates in a manner that is consistent with the

21

long-term financial sustainability of the public pension system.
28.
Economic and financial statistics are broadly adequate, though there are some
shortcomings. These include the lack of adequate quarterly real GDP statistics and
incomplete fiscal data on public enterprises. The authorities recognize the need for
improvement and are drawing on EU and IMF technical assistance, including an ongoing EU
project whose goals include harmonizing national accounts and other statistics with the
Box 4. Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff analysis suggests that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals. This is consistent with the conclusions of the last Article IV staff report. Standard
CGER analysis based on three methodologies points to a slightly overvalued real exchange rate in the
medium term (3 to 6 percent), which is not judged to be significant given the wide error bands:

current account deficit.
Depending on the assumptions used for elasticity of the current account with respect to the
real effective exchange rate (REER), a real depreciation of 4 to 4½ percent would be needed
to close the gap between the norm and the underlying current account in the medium run.
Similarly, the ERER approach suggests an overvaluation of about 3½ percent.



The External sustainability (ES) approach indicates a somewhat larger overvaluation
than the above two approaches. In ES, the current account norm is estimated to be
-3.4 percent of GDP, implying a REER adjustment of about 6 percent to stabilize net foreign
assets.

This assessment relies on the projection that the current account deficit will widen only
modestly before stabilizing at a level financeable by FDI. There are both upside and downside risks
to this baseline scenario. On the upside, faster recovery in Eurozone and other neighboring countries
could support a more vigorous rebound in exports, as could higher metals prices. Progress towards EU
accession would improve prospects for foreign investment as well as competitiveness through
accelerated structural reforms. On the downside, weaker than expected recovery in the Eurozone or
terms of trade shocks (energy and metals prices) could increase the current account deficit. Moreover,
if FDI rebounds over the medium term, the current account deficit is also likely to widen, as
historically current account shortfalls tend to mirror FDI inflows (see text chart in paragraph 19).

Eurostat norms. They have taken the decision to subscribe to the IMF’s Special Data

22

Dissemination Standard (SDDS), which will be an important step forward in ensuring best
practices. An IMF STA mission visited Macedonia in December to help the authorities
develop an action plan and timetable for subscribing to SDDS.
IV. RISKS
29.
Vulnerabilities in Europe pose the main known risk for Macedonia. Turbulence
in sovereign debt markets and financial systems and negative growth shocks in the Eurozone
could spill over to Macedonia through the current and capital accounts. Lower demand for
Macedonia’s exports would damage growth prospects and could also reduce international
reserves and require a monetary policy response. Adverse developments in sovereign debt
markets could make it difficult for the government to issue external debt to cover its external
debt service and finance the fiscal deficit. On the upside, progress in the name dispute with
Greece could unblock the path to EU accession and NATO membership, with positive effects
on foreign investment and growth. Terms of trade shocks pose risks in both directions.
Higher energy prices would increase the import bill, while further gains in metals prices
would boost export revenues.
V. PRECAUTIONARY CREDIT LINE
A. Context: Sound Economic Fundamentals, Policies, and Policy Framework
30.
Macedonia has sound economic fundamentals and a track record of sound
policies. In the last five years, Macedonia has averaged an overall fiscal deficit of 1.2 percent
of GDP, inflation of 2.7 percent and real growth of 3.7 percent. It has maintained the peg to
the Deutsche Mark and euro since 1997. External debt, projected to be at 58 percent of GDP
at end-2010, has a favorable composition and is manageable. The banking system is well
capitalized, liquid, and funded predominantly by local deposits.
31.
The authorities’ policy mix, consistent with recommendations in the 2009 Article
IV consultation, has been supported by a sound institutional policy framework and
good implementation capacity. The central bank has tightened policy as needed to protect
the exchange rate peg and operates independently of the government. Monetary policy was
allowed to ease only as underlying balance of payments trends turned favorable and reserves
rose to the recommended range, against a background of weak domestic demand. The
finance ministry maintains low multiyear budget deficit targets and consistently meets them
with regular budget rebalancing if revenues fall short during the course of the year.
32.
The authorities remain committed to sound policies in the future to reduce any
remaining vulnerabilities. The authorities are committed to a program of exchange rate
stability, low fiscal deficits, structural reforms to improve the business climate and to
strengthen further the resilience of the financial sector, and further improvements in the
quality of economic and financial data.

23

33.
Macedonia’s external accounts have improved, it does not have an actual
balance of payments need at present, and it is not expected to have such a need in
2011–12. The current account deficit is moderate and mostly financed by FDI. Foreign
reserves have fully recovered their post-Lehman losses and are projected to reach 95 percent
of short-term debt (residual maturity), 208 percent of base money, and 3.7 months of imports
of prospective goods and services at end-2010.
B. Role of PCL, Access, and Conditionality
Role of PCL
34.
The PCL arrangement requested by the authorities would provide insurance
against external risks. Despite sound fundamentals and policies, external risks remain
significant, including those emanating from financial markets in Europe. The resources
available if needed under the proposed arrangement would help ensure that Macedonia could
weather an adverse scenario. Moreover, having a PCL arrangement in place would send a
positive signal that policies are sound and that the authorities have adequate resources to
draw upon if needed, which could be expected to strengthen investor confidence.
Access
35.
The authorities have requested a two-year arrangement with 500 percent of
quota (SDR 344.5 million) in the first year and an additional 100 percent of quota (SDR
68.9 million) in the second year. They believed a two-year arrangement was appropriate in
light of the persistence of external risks and the stronger signal that this would send relative
to a one-year arrangement. They believed access of 500 percent of quota for the first year
was justified by the risks of severe shocks relating to European sovereign debt markets,
financial systems, and growth. For the second year, an additional 100 percent of quota would
provide a buffer against a scenario of persistent shocks. The authorities also noted that they
will need to pass legislation that will allow them to draw upon the PCL if needed, as required
under the Public Debt Law (the government would submit legislation after Fund approval of
the PCL, and passage would be expected by early March). Staff shares the authorities’
confidence that parliamentary approval will be forthcoming.
36.
Staff agreed that a two-year arrangement would provide valuable insurance
against the risk of a protracted external crisis and could also help to strengthen
confidence ahead of the parliamentary elections due by mid-2012. With respect to access
level, staff agreed that a reasonable stress scenario could give rise to financing needs that
would justify the access levels requested by the authorities (Box 5).

Box 5. Access Level
Staff prepared a stress case scenario based on negative shocks to EU growth and sovereign debt markets. The
proposed access level of 500 percent of quota in the first year of the arrangement and 600 percent in the
second year would broadly cover the financing needs arising in such a scenario (Table 4). The scenario
assumes:


GDP growth of 0.7 percent for the EU in 2011 (one percentage point lower than the Fall 2010 WEO
baseline). Some persistence of this growth shock is assumed for 2012, when growth is assumed to
rise only to 1.2 percent. Lower growth in the EU would widen Macedonia’s trade deficit and reduce
transfers and FDI.



An outflow of 5 percent of bank deposits in 2011, with half the outflows returning in 2012. The
assumed outflow reflects the possibility of the loss of depositor confidence in the event of negative
developments in European banking systems.



The loss of access to sovereign debt markets in 2011–12, which could occur in the event that shocks
to external debt markets spill over to Macedonia.



The financing gap is defined as that level of support needed to maintain gross international reserves
at 85 percent of short-term debt. This is below the 100 percent benchmark that is often used for
emerging markets, which is justified by the large share of relatively stable trade credits and
intercompany loans in Macedonia’s short-term debt. It is above the low point reached in spring
2009, when reserves dipped to 79 percent of end-year short-term debt.

Economic concept-based metrics for Macedonia’s potential access of SDR413.4 million are in line with
access under previous Fund arrangements.

25

Box 6. Exceptional Access Criteria
In view of the exceptional access under the authorities’ request for a PCL arrangement
(Attachment I), staff’s evaluation is that Macedonia meets the four exceptional access criteria.


Criterion 1: The member is experiencing or has the potential to experience actual or potential
exceptional balance of payments pressures on the current or capital account resulting in a
need for Fund financing that cannot be met within the normal limits. Macedonia does not face
actual balance of payments pressures. However, it is exposed to risks of economic and
financial disruptions in Europe. Staff is of the view that the realization of a stress scenario
could give rise to financing needs beyond normal access limits.



Criterion 2: A rigorous and systematic analysis indicates that there is a high probability that
the member’s public debt is sustainable in the medium term. Staff is of the view that there is a
high probability that the debt will remain sustainable. Gross public debt is moderate at some 25
percent of GDP and would remain stable based on the authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy.
Stress tests indicate that under the standard shocks, debt ratios would remain sustainable,
below 35 percent of GDP.



Criterion 3: The member has prospects of gaining or regaining access to capital markets
within timeframe when Fund resources are outstanding. Macedonia has two outstanding
Eurobonds, maturing in 2013 and 2015. Secondary market yields on the 2015 issue spiked to
13 percent following the Lehman collapse and again (to a lesser extent) in the run-up to the
support program for Greece, but have since eased back to around 6 percent. Staff is thus of the
view that Macedonia could issue at present at rates near to those in its secondary market.



Criterion 4: The policy program and capacity to deliver the programmed adjustment provide
a reasonably strong prospect of success. Staff judges that the program has reasonably strong
prospects of success, including both with regard to sound policy plans and also with respect to
the institutional and political capacity to deliver on those policy plans. Macedonia’s economic
program, based on fiscal restraint and a central bank committed to policies consistent with the
exchange rate peg, faces good prospects of success. The authorities’ performance during the
recent global crisis, the long track record of fiscal discipline, and the independence of the
central bank give confidence in the prospect for continued sound policies in the future.

Conditionality
37.
The proposed arrangement would include indicative targets on the fiscal deficit
and on net international reserves, as well as the standard continuous performance
criteria. These are described in the authorities’ written communication requesting a PCL
arrangement (Attachment 1). The authorities’ program also includes improvements in data
quality (they have committed to subscribe to the IMF Special Data Dissemination Standard),
financial sector measures, and other structural reform measures (paragraphs 26–28 and
Attachment 1). Information on indicative targets, review dates, and access is summarized in
Table 12.
Fiscal target
38.
The fiscal targets for 2011 would be set at levels that correspond to an annual
deficit of 2.5 percent of projected GDP, which is consistent with the budget passed by
parliament. The target for the first review, which would take place in July 2011, would be a
cumulative deficit of denar 6.4 billion (1.4 percent of GDP) through end-May. This is based
on the authorities’ intention to phase the deficit evenly over the year while allowing some
margin for lumpiness of revenues and expenditures. In the event that revenues fall short of
projections, the government is committed to reduce expenditures to meet the target.
39.
This target avoids a negative fiscal impact on growth as the recovery gains
momentum, and is consistent with stable public debt ratios at sustainable levels. The
authorities have a strong record of moderate fiscal deficits and of taking measures necessary
to meet their deficit targets. This includes both 2009 and 2010, when revenues fell short of
projections due in large part to slower than anticipated growth and the government met its
targets by restraining expenditure. The proposed indicative target will help to strengthen
confidence in the government’s continued commitment to sound fiscal policies. In light of
the strong credibility of the government’s commitment to its deficit targets, staff supports the
authorities’ view that an indicative target rather than performance criterion is appropriate.
Net international reserves
40.
The proposed indicative targets (floors) on net international reserves (NIR)
would be set at €1.15 billion for the end-May test date and €1.35 billion for the
end-November test date. These NIR floors correspond to gross international reserves (GIR)
of €1.4 billion and €1.6 billion, respectively. The proposed floors are based on staff
projections that GIR will finish 2011 at €1.85 billion (104 percent of short-term debt at
residual maturity) if the government issues a Eurobond and €1.65 billion (93 percent of
short-term debt) otherwise. They provide a margin for events that may affect reserves
without signaling persistent pressures and hence do not call for a policy response. If reserves
were to fall below the proposed floors, this could indicate the emergence of external

30

pressures and should trigger an examination of whether a monetary (and possibly also fiscal)
policy response would be appropriate to protect reserves.
C. Qualification Criteria
41.
Macedonia performs strongly in three of the PCL qualification areas, notably
fiscal policy, monetary policy, and financial sector soundness and supervision. There is
moderate underperformance against the remaining two areas, external position and data
adequacy.
Fiscal policy
42.
Macedonia performs strongly in the fiscal policy area, with moderate fiscal
deficits and public debt levels, and its track record indicates strong commitment to the
announced fiscal deficit targets (Figure 4). Some 50 percent of public debt is from official
lenders at low interest rates, and a further 15 percent is non-market, low interest rate
domestic compensation bonds, leading to an average interest rate on public debt of 3 percent.
43.
Macedonia has a medium-term fiscal strategy in place and is undertaking efforts
to fine-tune its medium-term budgeting framework. A three-year fiscal strategy is
prepared annually and includes allocation of budget ceilings to specific budget users and
provisions for multiyear capital projects. Macedonia is receiving technical assistance from
the IMF and the EU to put in place further improvements, including simplification of budget
codes, more coordinated monitoring of spending units, and more streamlined production of
strategic planning documents.
44.
The fiscal transparency ROSC from 2006 gave a generally positive assessment
and further progress has taken place since. In particular, the medium-term budgeting
capacity has been improved, including a focus on the economic development program.
Monetary policy
45.
Macedonia performs strongly in the monetary policy area (Figure 4). The
exchange rate peg has contributed to low inflation for over a decade. The central bank has a
strong record of acting to defend the peg during periods of market pressure, most recently in
2009 when it raised the interest rate decisively in response to significant reserve losses. As
pressures receded and reserves recovered, and against a background of weak growth and low
inflation, it embarked on an easing cycle.
Financial sector soundness and supervision
46.
The financial sector is sound and supervision is adequate, fully satisfying
Macedonia’s performance requirements in this area (Box 2). The 2008 FSAP provided a

31

broadly favorable assessment of banking supervision. It found that a sound legal and
regulatory framework and supervisory independence had been established, and that
supervisory practices broadly conformed to Basel Core Principles.
External position and market access
47.
Macedonia scores well in the external sector area, but does have some remaining
vulnerabilities. External debt service is moderate, rollover pressures are limited and foreign
reserve levels are broadly adequate (Section II.B). The real exchange rate appears to be fairly
valued, and low wage rates and prices relative to trading partners are supportive of export
growth over the medium term.


External debt is largely made up of intercompany loans (22 percent of the total at
end-2009), official sector loans to the government (21 percent), and trade credits
(18 percent) (Table 11). Foreign investors do not hold local currency public debt. The
standard debt sustainability tests show modest impact from interest rate, growth, or
current account shocks, although a significant depreciation could create a large spike
in the debt ratio (Figure 6).



The financial account is dominated by private capital flows. Over the past five years,
the public sector has on net repaid debt from official lenders.



Macedonia first accessed international sovereign debt markets in 2005 with a 10-year
€150 million Eurobond issue (at an original yield of 4.7 percent), followed by a
second 3½ year €175 million bond in July 2009 (issued at 9⅞ percent). Secondary
market yields on these bonds have declined as pressures from the global crisis eased,
with yields of around 6 percent in mid-December 2010. The government plans to
issue another Eurobond in 2011 for purposes of budget financing (including some
€100 million in external debt service) and to build foreign exchange reserves,
although market access remains vulnerable to adverse developments in EU sovereign
debt markets.



Reserves are relatively comfortable at €1.65 billion currently, meeting the standard
thresholds for reserve adequacy and falling within the €1.5–2 billion target range
recommended in the 2009 Article IV consultation. Projected balance of payments
flows support moderate continued reserve accumulation over the medium term.

Data adequacy and integrity
48.
Data quality is adequate for surveillance and program monitoring, though there
are shortcomings in national income accounts and government finance statistics.
Monetary and balance of payments statistics are generally of good quality (as discussed in
the monetary and financial policy transparency ROSC). Fiscal data in key areas are adequate
and are comprehensive for the central government (fiscal transparency ROSC). However,

32

data on state-owned enterprises remains inadequate. Macedonia does not currently subscribe
to SDDS but the authorities have committed to do so and are working with the IMF STA
department on an action plan for subscribing. They also aim to bring national account
statistics up to European standards (ESA95) for production and dissemination of data, and
are actively working on this with extensive multiyear EU technical assistance.
Approval criteria
49.
Macedonia does not face any of the circumstances under which the Fund may
not approve a PCL: (i) sustained inability to access international capital markets; (ii) the
need to undertake a large macroeconomic or structural policy adjustment; (iii) a public debt
position that is not sustainable in the medium term with a high probability; or (iv) widespread
bank insolvencies.
VI. IMPACT ON FUND FINANCES, RISKS AND SAFEGUARDS
50.
Access under the proposed PCL of 600 percent of quota (SDR 413.4 million) is
small relative to the Fund’s liquidity. The Fund’s liquidity is expected to remain adequate
after approval of a PCL arrangement for Macedonia, as discussed further in the supplement
assessing the impact on the Fund’s finances and liquidity position.
51.
Risks to the Fund are expected to be low. The authorities are not expected to draw
upon the PCL, which is intended to be used only in the event of adverse shocks. In the event
that Macedonia were to draw the entire amount available, its low public debt ratios and
strong fiscal position would leave it well-positioned to repay the Fund.
52.
Macedonia has agreed to undergo a safeguards assessment, as required under
the PCL framework. The assessment has already been initiated. The most recent previous
safeguards assessment update was completed in 2006.
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
53.
Macedonia’s track record of sound economic policies held it in good stead
during the recent economic crisis. A history of low deficits and low public debt created
room for modest increases in fiscal deficits in 2009 and 2010, reducing the need to match
weak revenues with pro-cyclical expenditure cuts. The exchange rate regime has helped
bring about low inflation and stable output for the past decade, and in staff’s view there is no
significant exchange rate misalignment. The NBRM responded firmly to pressures in early
2009, and as pressures abated it began an easing cycle at end-2009. A well-regulated banking
system with limited integration into international markets helped shield it from the impact of
the crisis.
54.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ continued commitment to sound policies. Their
intention to reduce fiscal deficits over the medium term will keep debt ratios low and ensure

33

there is adequate fiscal space to respond to future shocks. The NBRM’s policy of
conditioning interest rate cuts on adequate levels and favorable trends in international
reserves is a cornerstone of ensuring the continued stability of the exchange rate regime.
Structural reforms to attract investment and support productivity growth will help ensure
medium-term sustainability in the balance of payments. Based on this sound policy
framework and contained vulnerabilities, prospects for a return to stable growth in 2011 and
beyond look promising.
55.
Notwithstanding this positive outlook, Macedonia faces external risks that could
translate into balance of payments or fiscal financing needs should an adverse scenario
materialize. These vulnerabilities are more a reflection of Macedonia’s exposure to external
shocks than weakness in economic fundamentals or policies. Nonetheless, they call for an
extra degree of caution in macroeconomic and financial policies.
56.
The proposed PCL arrangement would offer Macedonia valuable insurance
against external shocks. While the authorities would not be expected to draw upon the PCL
unless there is a significant deterioration in external conditions, it would provide a significant
additional buffer that could help preserve stability and reduce the need for contractionary
adjustments in the event of temporary shocks. Moreover, the PCL arrangement should
strengthen investor confidence and facilitate better access to international capital markets.
The level of access requested by the authorities is commensurate with a reasonable stress
scenario.
57.
The conditionality under the proposed arrangement is appropriate for
Macedonia’s circumstances. The two indicative targets reflect the existing policies of the
authorities. The target on the fiscal deficit signals the government’s commitment to stable
public finances and to taking compensating measures in case revenues fall short of
projections. The target on net international reserves signals the authorities’ policy of
maintaining adequate reserve buffers and taking measures to safeguard reserves in the event
they are threatened by adverse external developments. In light of the authorities’ strong
commitment to policies consistent with these targets and their strong track record, staff
supports the authorities’ request for indicative targets rather than performance criteria in
these areas.
58.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ The adverse scenario assumes: (1) a 0.7% growth for the EU in 2011 and a 1.2% growth for the EU in 2012. Lower growth in the EU would affect the trade balance,
transfers, and FDI; (2) an outflow of 5 percent of bank deposits in 2011 and half of the outflow returns in 2012; and (3) loss of access to sovereign debt markets in both
2011 and 2012.
2/ Excludes amortization of MLT intercompany loans, which is included in FDI (net).
3/ Includes capital account balance and net errors and omissions.

1/ Until 2007Q3 Tier I Capital includes common shares, non-cumulative preference shares, general reserves and undistributed profits,
net of uncovered loss from previous years, current loss and goodwill. Starting from 2007Q4, Tier I Capital includes nominal value of
common and non-cumulative preference shares, premiums from common and noncumulative preference shares, general reserves and
distributed profits, positions as a result of consolidation, net of uncovered loss from previous years, current loss and intangible goods,
owned common and non-cumulative preference shares and the difference between the amount of necessary and the amount of allocated
reserves for potential losses.
2/ Includes loans to financial and nonfinancial sector.
3/ Adjusted for unallocated provisions for potential loan losses. Since 31.03.2009 these items have been adjusted for unrecognized
impairment.
4/ Interest margin is interest income less interest expense. Gross income includes net interest income, fees and commissions income
(gross, not net), dividends, net income regarding securities, net capital income, net FX income and other income excluding extraordinary
income.
5/ Noninterest expenses include fees and commissions expenses, operating expenses and other expenses excluding extraordinary
expenses.
6/ The data has been revised as of 2010Q1.
7/ Highly liquid assets are defined as cash and balance with the NBRM, treasury bills, NBRM bills, and correspondent accounts with
foreign banks.
8/ Short-term liabilities are defined as deposits and other liabilities with a maturity of one year or less (without deposits and borrowings
from domestic banks). The data has been revised as of 2010Q1.
9/ FX indexed deposits include deposits and other FX indexed liabilities. However FX indexed deposits comprise the majority of these
items. Since 31.03.2009 the figure refers only to FX indexed deposits.
10/ The increase in 2006 is due to loans channeled through NBRM, not NBRM credit to banks.

B4. Combination of B1-B3 using one-quarter standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2006 8/
B6. 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2006
Sources: MoF and IMF Staff estimates.
1/ Consolidated central government gross debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of euro).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data.Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks. Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the
respective variables in the baseline and scenario being presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent or a 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2009. Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation
(measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

ATTACHMENT: REQUEST FOR A PRECAUTIONARY CREDIT LINE ARRANGEMENT
Skopje, Macedonia
December 30, 2010
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn,
We welcome the recent approval by the International Monetary Fund of the Precautionary
Credit Line (PCL) as a new financial instrument designed for countries with sound
fundamentals and policies, but moderate vulnerabilities.
Macedonia has sound economic fundamentals and a track record of sound policies, and does
not have a balance of payments need. Yet we continue to face risks arising from uncertainties
in the global economy. We therefore believe that the PCL would be an appropriate
instrument to support our continued commitment to sound policies and to provide insurance
against downside risks that could generate unanticipated financing needs. On this basis, we
would like to request the IMF to approve a PCL arrangement covering 24 months in the
amount of SDR 413.4 million (600 percent of quota), with a maximum of SDR
344.5 million (500 percent of quota) available during the first twelve months of the
arrangement.
As elsewhere, Macedonia was affected by the recent global economic crisis. However, it
suffered only a mild recession and balance of payments pressures in 2009 were contained.
The situation has improved in 2010. Growth has gradually resumed, exports have rebounded,
the external current account has adjusted rapidly, and international reserves have recovered
fully. Meanwhile, our financial sector has avoided any significant pressures. This favorable
performance during a period of external stress is due to our strong economic fundamentals
and our commitment to take the policy measures needed to preserve stability. This included
budget restraint sufficient to meet our 2009 fiscal deficit target of 2.8 percent of GDP despite
a significant shortfall of revenues, an increase in central bank policy rates to safeguard
international reserves, and higher bank reserve requirements to ensure adequate buffers. We
also benefited from having a sound banking system with a conservative balance sheet and
minimal reliance on external financing, which helped to shield it from the turbulence in the
global financial system.
We are well-positioned to strengthen our economic and financial position and reduce external
vulnerabilities further during the coming years. We remain committed to following strong
policies and to responding appropriately to any adverse events that may arise. However,

51

external risks persist due to the potential for adverse developments in Macedonia’s trading
partners and in international capital markets. These risks could potentially spill over to
Macedonia through loss of access to international capital markets and widening of the trade
deficit, which could lead to pressures on the balance of payments. A PCL arrangement would
complement our economic policy strategy by bolstering investor confidence, which should
help to mitigate the impact of any new external shocks.
Our 2011 budget targets a fiscal deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP, which we expect to be phased
evenly over the year. The budget calls for both expenditures and revenues to increase in line
with nominal growth. It provides for an increase in capital spending to strengthen public
infrastructure and help lay the foundations for future growth. Non-capital spending will be
restrained, with no nominal increase in government sector wage and salary levels and a
freeze in public employment levels (with limited exceptions in areas related to the Ohrid
Framework Agreement and EU accession). The budget will also be supported by measures to
rationalize the delivery of health services, which we are undertaking with the support of the
World Bank and the EU. We intend to meet our public financing requirements in 2011 with a
combination of domestic and external financing, including the issuance of external debt to
the private markets.
This prudent fiscal stance is consistent with our medium-term strategy to preserve our
moderate public debt ratios and is in line with available financing, while also safeguarding
essential government expenditure and supporting the resumption of economic growth. In the
event that revenues fall short of budget projections, we will reduce expenditure in order to
achieve our fiscal deficit target. For 2012, we foresee a reduction in the fiscal deficit to near
2 percent of GDP. The 2012 budget will aim for a continued emphasis on capital
expenditure, with a particular focus on our development program in the areas of
transportation, school construction, and hospital equipment.
Monetary policy will continue to be guided by the principle of consistency with the exchange
rate regime, which seeks to maintain low inflation through a fixed rate relative to the euro.
This policy has served Macedonia well for over a decade, delivering low and stable inflation
and a stable real exchange rate that have allowed us to preserve competitiveness. In the first
half of 2009, during the period of intense global financial turbulence, we increased our policy
interest rate from 7 to 9 percent and increased bank reserve requirements in response to an
outflow of international reserves. That policy response, together with prudential banking
measures and fiscal restraint, helped to stabilize the situation. By midyear the balance of
payments had strengthened and we began to rebuild international reserves. In light of
favorable trends in the balance of payments and reserves, and against the background of
weak growth and very low inflation, we initiated a series of reductions in interest rates that
brought the policy rate to the present level of 4 percent.
Our monetary policy will continue to be governed by the need to support our exchange rate
regime and maintain an adequate level of international reserves. In judging what is an

52

appropriate level of reserves and how to respond to changes in reserve levels, we take into
account a range of factors. Reserve levels in relation to months of imports and to short-term
debt are important guideposts for assessing the desired reserve level. We also take into
account underlying balance of payments trends, including seasonal factors in trade and
remittances, and one-off events such as the timing of the government’s external debt
issuances and commercial bank substitution between foreign assets and domestic public debt
that is denominated in or linked to foreign currency. The ultimate objective is to have a
comfortable buffer to support our exchange rate in the event of adverse developments. If the
level of reserves and underlying trends threaten this objective, we will respond with an
appropriate mix of monetary and fiscal policies to help safeguard reserves and preserve
confidence.
Our external position is solid, with a moderate current account deficit (projected to be below
4 percent of GDP in 2010), an adequate level of reserves, and favorable underlying balance
of payments trends. We expect to see a further accumulation of reserves over the course of
2011. We successfully accessed external capital markets in 2009, although at a high price
that reflected the prevailing unsettled market conditions. Secondary market yields on our
outstanding Eurobonds have since fallen to below 6 percent as of November 2010, indicating
that we enjoy improved market access. This reduction in yields reflects investor confidence
in our public finances and external sustainability, and increased market differentiation
between Macedonia and other countries.
Our financial sector and banking regulatory framework are both sound. Capital adequacy
ratios have been stable at above 16 percent throughout the crisis. Nonperforming loans
(NPLs) as a share of total loans have risen from 6.8 percent at the end of 2008 to 10.4 percent
in the third quarter of 2010 as a consequence of the economic downturn. However, these
NPLs are 93 percent provisioned, on a conservative basis that excludes collateral. Funding is
stable, with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 91 percent and low reliance on external funding. Profits
have fallen, largely due to the need to provision nonperforming loans, but have remained
positive. Liquidity is strong, with highly liquid assets totaling 23.8 percent of all assets.
Our agenda for structural reform seeks to further strengthen our financial sector regulatory
framework, improve the quality of our economic and financial data, and improve our
long-term growth potential.
In the area of financial sector regulation, we have submitted a new law on the NBRM that
will strengthen its independence and bring practices fully in line with EU directives and the
European System of Central Banks Treaty. This new law has benefited from advice from the
ECB, European Commission, IMF, and World Bank. We have also prepared draft legislation
that will address the risk of court challenges to NBRM intervention of insolvent banks and
close gaps in our ability to impose fit and proper requirements on bank owners and
managers; and we have prepared proposals to widen the class of assets that banks may use to
access liquidity support from the NBRM. We recently created the Financial Stability

53

Committee to coordinate our crisis response activities and are in the process of making it
operational.
We are committed to continuing the process of improving the quality and transparency of
economic and financial data. In this effort we have benefited from EU and IMF technical
assistance, including an ongoing EU project whose goals include further harmonizing
national accounts and other statistics with the Eurostat norms. We have taken the decision to
subscribe to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), which will be an
important step forward in ensuring we meet best practices in this area, and we look forward
to the findings of an IMF technical assistance mission that we have invited to help us develop
a roadmap and timetable for subscribing to SDDS.
We are taking actions on several fronts to improve our long-term growth potential. In the
area of public infrastructure, we are undertaking investments to raise the quality of key
highway and railroad links with our major trading partners, and we have submitted a new
energy law that will create a liberalized energy market and improve incentives for energy
efficiency and investment. We are also continuing our efforts to improve the business
environment and attract investment through initiatives such as cadastral reform, privatization
of several loss-making state-owned enterprises, and further reductions in social contributions
in 2012 and 2013 to reduce the labor tax wedge and increase employment. Reductions in
pension contribution rates will be made in a framework that ensures the long-term financial
sustainability of the public pension system.
We will provide the Fund all needed information to monitor economic and policy
developments under the requested PCL arrangement, and we invite a safeguards assessment
in accordance with the IMF safeguards policy. We will also observe the standard
commitments related to trade and exchange restrictions, discriminatory currency
arrangements, multiple currency practices, and non-accumulation of external debt payments
arrears, in accordance with requirements under the PCL.
In summary, our sound economic fundamentals and institutional policy framework, and our
track record of sound policies and commitment to such policies in the future, provide
confidence that we will respond appropriately to any future balance of payments difficulties
that may arise. The strength of our policies was recognized by the positive assessment of the
Executive Board of the IMF in the context of our most recent Article IV consultations.

ATTACHMENT: REVIEW DATES, INDICATIVE TARGETS, TEST DATES, AND DEFINITIONS
Review dates (assuming Board approval date of 1/19/2011):
The first review is scheduled to be completed by July 18, 2011.
The second review is scheduled to be completed by January 18, 2012.
The third review is scheduled to be completed by July 18, 2012.
Indicative targets:
(1) Central government overall fiscal deficit:
For the first review: a ceiling of denar 6.4 billion for the period January through May 20111.
The test date will be May 31, 2011. For the second review: a ceiling of denar 11.6 billion for
the period January through November 2011. The test date will be November 30, 2011. A
target and a test date for the third review will be set during the second review under the
arrangement. The government will report to the IMF on the monthly and cumulative
year-to-date fiscal deficits for each month before the end of the following month.
(2) Net International reserves (NIR):
The indicative targets for floors on NIR for the first and second reviews will be set at
€1,150 million and €1,350 million, respectively. The test date for the first review will be May
31, 2011 and the test date for the second review will be November 30, 2011. A target and test
date for the third review will be set during the second review under the arrangement. The
NBRM will report to the IMF the level of NIR not later than two weeks after the end of each
month.
Definitions and adjustors
For purposes of this arrangement, the deficit of the central government covers the central
government as defined in the Annual Budget Document (including Special Revenue
Accounts, Employment Fund, Health Insurance Fund, Pension Insurance Fund, and Road
Fund), which are treated by the Ministry of Finance as part of the consolidated central
government. It is the authorities’ policy not to accumulate arrears on central government
payments or delays in non-disputed VAT refund payments past the legal limit for paying
such refunds. In the event that such arrears or VAT refund delays occur, they shall be

1

The May 31 target is calculated as (i) 5/12 of the annual deficit target of denar 11.59 billion; plus (ii) 5/12 of
the telecom dividend (anticipated to be denar 2.6 billion), which is expected to be received after May 31, plus
(iii) a 10 percent margin to account for unanticipated lumpiness of revenues and expenditures.

55

included in the definition of the deficit for purposes of this arrangement.2.
For purposes of this arrangement, NIR is defined as the difference between NBRM’s reserve
assets and its reserve liabilities,3 where reserve assets and liabilities will be calculated at a
gold price of US$ 1,391.50 per ounce, a US$/€ exchange rate of 1.29980, a SDR/€ exchange
rate of 0.84957; exchange rates for other reserve assets held as of December 1, 2010 will be
the market rates prevailing on December 1, 2010. The indicative target on NIR is set at a
level that assumes the government will issue a Eurobond in the amount of €190 million
during the course of 2011. In the event that it does not issue a Eurobond, or issues in an
amount smaller than €190 million, the NIR target for November 30 will be adjusted
downward by the shortfall of actual issuance relative to the amount of €190 million, with the
downward adjustment limited to a maximum of €100 million.
For purposes of this arrangement, external payments arrears will be defined as total past-due
debt service (principal and interest) on government, government-guaranteed, and NBRM
external debt.

2

Central government domestic arrears, excluding those to suppliers, are defined to include all payment delays to: (i) banks
for bond payments (including for the repayment of frozen foreign currency deposits); (ii) individuals for Social Assistance
Program payments; (iii) central government employees including for wages and salaries, and food and travel allowances;
(iv) benefit recipients of the Child Care Program; (v) local governments. The definition excludes the customary lag in
paying wages, social assistance and child allowance
payments, and transfers to the extra-budgetary funds (in the following month after they accrue). Central government
domestic arrears to suppliers are defined as obligations to suppliers which are due but not paid by more than 60 days and are
non-disputed.
3

Reserve assets are defined as liquid and usable foreign convertible currency claims on nonresidents plus
monetary gold. Reserve assets of the NBRM thus include monetary gold, SDRs, foreign currency cash,
securities, deposits abroad, and the reserve position at the Fund. Reserve liabilities are defined as all foreign
exchange liabilities of the NBRM to nonresidents and residents (excluding central and local government foreign
exchange deposits at the NBRM), including all credit outstanding from the Fund, arrears on principal or interest
payments to commercial banks, suppliers, or official export credit agencies, and future and contingent
commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from transactions in derivative assets (futures, forwards, swaps,
and options).

Exchange Arrangement:
The currency of the FYR Macedonia is the denar. The FYR Macedonia maintains a
managed floating exchange rate system with a de facto stabilized arrangement against
the Euro. The exchange rate system is free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions. Households can transact through
commercial banks or through foreign exchange bureaus that act as agents of banks;
enterprises can transact through the banking system. The reserve requirement on
foreign currency deposits is set at 13 percent, while that on FX-indexed denar deposits
are set at 20 percent.
At end-November 2010, the official exchange rate was 46.8 denars per U.S. dollar and
61.5 denars per euro. The FYR Macedonia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 with effect from June 19, 1998.

IX.

Article IV Consultations:
The first consultation with the FYR Macedonia was concluded in August 1993. The
last consultation was concluded on December 11, 2009 (SM/09/278). The FYR
Macedonia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

ANNEX II—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of December 1, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for
surveillance and monitoring purposes. Areas that would benefit most from
further improvement are national accounts and government finance statistics.

National accounts: Quarterly GDP data in constant prices are not compiled.
Despite recent improvements, there continue to be discrepancies between the
official quarterly and annual GDP estimates. Employment data from the
company survey continue to be unreliable.
Price statistics: The CPI series are rebased every year and this has caused
small discrepancies in historical data.
Government finance statistics: The consolidated central government data
are affected by lack of data on arrears, including hospital arrears. In addition,
data coverage on government below-the-line financing from National Bank
deposits is inadequate, as a result of different coverage of accounts between
the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank – the Treasury Single
Account and budgetary FX account balances are not regularly reported. Data
on state enterprises are limited. Macedonia does not report government
finance statistics to the Fund for publication in either the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSMY) or the International Financial
Statistics (IFS).
Monetary sector: EUR receives a monthly electronic report of monetary
statistics, covering the balance sheet of the central bank, the commercial
banks and other depository corporations.

External sector: Balance of payment data are compiled on monthly basis.
The compilation and coverage have improved in recent years, and most of
the recommendations from the 2004 ROSC mission and the late 2006 STA
mission were implemented.

ANNEX III—COORDINATION OF IMF AND WORLD BANK WORK PLANS
1.
IMF and World Bank country teams for FYR Macedonia agreed that FYR
Macedonia has weathered the global crisis relatively well but continued to face challenges
that include below-potential growth and high unemployment. Low growth has resulted in
weak tax revenues that have given rise to budget financing pressures. Further, while the banking
sector remained broadly in good shape, it was exposed to risks of prolonged slow growth in
Macedonia through a deterioration in the quality of its loan portfolio. Balance of payments
pressures have eased significantly as the current account deficit has fallen and official foreign
exchange reserves have recouped their losses. Nonetheless, the exchange rate peg to the Euro,
while beneficial for stability, will continue to constrain economic policies. Against this
background Macedonia’s main macroeconomic challenges are to avoid procyclical fiscal policies
and maintain fiscal sustainability while securing adequate budget financing; pursue monetary
and fiscal policies that are supportive both of the exchange rate regime and of economic growth;
and safeguard the stability of the financial system, including through continued sound
supervision and regulation as well as contingency planning.
2.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified six areas of structural reform
as macrocritical in light of their importance for stimulating private sector activity, and ensuring
fiscal and external sustainability and financial sector stability.


Public expenditure management and public finance. Improving budget planning and
the structure of public spending are key areas for improvement. Accurate revenue and
expenditure forecasts are needed to ensure realistic budgets and avoid supplementary
budgets that result from revenue underperformance or underestimation of spending.
Moreover, further expanding the medium-term elements of the fiscal framework would
help to anchor fiscal policy around the goal of public debt sustainability. The domestic
public debt market needs to be developed over the medium term to provide a domestic
source of fiscal financing and reduce reliance on external funding.



Tax administration. Continued reforms in this area will help to improve compliance and
reduce informality, contributing to a broader and more stable tax base that allows lower
tax rates and adequate fiscal financing. Macedonia has already achieved major gains by
unifying the collection of social contributions (pension, health and unemployment) and
integrating them with personal income tax collection, resulting in significant
improvement in compliance.



Social Sector spending. Pension reform. Considerable reforms have been implemented
to put the system on a sustainable financial basis. Still, with the recent reduction in
contribution rates and changes to the pension indexation formula, the budgetary transfers
made to the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund (PDIF) increased. Social safety net.
The social safety net is complex, with a large number of overlapping programs that are

10
not well-targeted and fail to reach some of most vulnerable elements in society. Efforts
are needed to ensure pressures to cut spending do not weaken the social safety net while
increasing share of transfer reach the poor. Health Sector. Spending pressures recently reemerged in the health sector as contribution rate were lowered while higher wages
increased costs.


Improving the business environments. The business climate improved in Macedonia in
recent years, though areas where further efforts can pay off include streamlining
administrative procedures, improving contract enforcement, and facilitating foreign trade,
particularly by reducing tariffs and simplifying procedures and costs. Advances are
needed in safeguarding property rights and the rule of law, facilitating competition
through improved market entry and exit, and improving access to financing. Though the
burden of excessive regulations has been reduced it still impedes economic activity in
certain areas and there is some evidence that policy uncertainty has increased.



Financial sector. Stronger financial sector supervision and contingency planning will
help to ensure the authorities are able to monitor the health of the system carefully and
respond appropriately to problems that emerge. This includes powers of the banking
regulator to impose fit and proper requirements on bank owners and to intervene in banks
that are not viable. Implementation in practice of the recently concluded MoU on crisis
coordination and cooperation between the NBRM, the Finance Ministry (MoF), and other
agencies, is also important to improve supervision as well as identify and provide a quick
response to threats.



Electricity sector. It will be important over time to revise the tariff structure to better
reflect the costs of service delivery and comply with the country’s obligations under the
Energy Community Treaty. This will help eliminate hidden and cross-subsidies that are
poorly targeted, encourage inefficient patterns of consumption, damage incentives for
investment, and impose fiscal or quasi-fiscal costs. New investment in generation
capacity is also needed in light of inadequate domestic supplies. In view of financial and
environmental considerations, end-use energy efficiency improvement, use of PPPs and
renewable energy sources should be promoted. Reforms to create a more transparent
regulatory framework will be helpful in this regard.

3.

The teams agreed on the following division of labor.



The Bank will begin the preparation of the new Country Economic Memorandum which
should help identify challenges to improved competitiveness and poverty reduction, by
integrating sustainability and green growth into the main objectives of stronger growth,
job creation and attracting FDI and EU accession.



The Fund will retain the lead in tax administration reform. It has a full-time resident
advisor in place (funded by the Dutch government) as well as a full program of technical

11
assistance missions. Priorities for the coming year include reviewing the progress in
modernizing revenue administration, addressing compliance problems that have emerged
with the economic slowdown, increasing training for Public Revenue Office staff, and
coordinating technical assistance with other donors.


The Bank will support the Government in undertaking an analysis of the recent changes
to the pension system and their implications for its financial sustainability and will work
with the authorities to make needed adjustments to preserve the system’s sustainability
and prevent a drain on general tax revenues.



Social safety net. The Bank will continue to advise the government on measures to
consolidate various programs and improve targeting through its Social Protection
Implementation Loan (SPIL) and Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) operations and the
Programmatic Poverty Assessment analytical work. Future priorities include introduction
of a registry of programs and beneficiaries, initiating a conditional cash transfer system to
ensure compliance with requirements for mandatory secondary school enrollment,
consolidation of benefits, etc. Once implemented, these activities should result in better
administration and targeting of social programs.



Both the Fund and the Bank will encourage the authorities to implement realistic,
predictable, and transparent budget procedures. The Fund will also encourage the
authorities to anchor fiscal policies in a credible medium-term fiscal framework and is
prepared to offer technical assistance for that purpose. The Bank will provide support in
improving the public procurement process.



A considerable part of the World Bank’s portfolio is providing support to improve the
business environment. Infrastructure improvements are supported under the Regional and
Local Roads Project, the Railways Project, Municipal Services Improvement Project and
the Second Trade and Transport Facilitation Project. At the same time, the Business
Environment Reform Project, the Real Estate Cadastre and Registration Project, the
Legal and Judicial Implementation Project and the Agriculture Strengthening and
Accession Project support development and reform of institutions to support growth. The
ongoing Education Modernization Project and a planned Technical Assistance for Higher
Education aim to assist the authorities in building skills. An innovative regional Disaster
Management operation planned for 2011 will provide financial protection from losses
caused by climate change and geo-hazards. Going further, the authorities have requested
technical assistance from the Doing Business Reform Advisory on selected elements of
the business environment (construction permits, trading across borders etc.).



The Fund and Bank have both been involved in financial sector reform, including through
the November 2008 joint FSAA update as well as the extensive dialogue during the
preparation of the 2009 World Bank First Development Policy Loan (DPL1). The Fund
has also provided technical assistance in the area of contingency planning and will

12
provide further assistance in this area as well as in macro modeling and stress testing
bank balance sheets. The Bank, through the DPL2 and the Balkan Financial Sector
Technical Assistance Facility will: i) (with input from IMF staff) assist the authorities in
reviewing the bank resolution framework and the operational capacity of the Deposit
Insurance Fund and ii) provide advice on the operational rules for the Financial Stability
Committee and the design of a solvency test in case of Lender of Last Resort request.


The Bank has the lead on electricity sector reform. It will continue to encourage the
adoption over time of realistic prices of electricity and elimination of subsidized rates. As
part of the dialogue, the Bank provided comments on sections of the Energy Sector
Strategy and is advising the government on promoting use of alternative ways of
financing energy sector investments (PPPs) as well as diversifying energy sources (use of
gas, renewables, wind etc.). The Bank is also providing assistance to strengthen the
Energy Regulatory Commission. The Bank’s Energy Community of South East Europe
Adaptable Programmatic Loan 3 (ECSEE APL3), the follow-up financing of this project
planned for 2011 and the hydro-power project planned for 2011, support improvements
of interconnectivity and the transmission grid and reliability of production. Finally, the
recently restructured Global Environment Facility project will promote energy efficiency
in the public sector.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia—Assessment of the Impact of the Proposed
Precautionary Credit Line Arrangement on the Fund’s Finances and Liquidity Position
Prepared by the Finance and Strategy, Policy and Review Departments
(In consultation with other Departments)
Approved by David Andrews and Jan Kees Martijn
January 7, 2011
This note assesses the impact of the proposed Precautionary Credit Line (PCL)
arrangement for Macedonia on the Fund’s finances and liquidity position, in
accordance with the policy on exceptional access.1 The proposed arrangement would be
the first under the PCL, and would cover a 24-month period, with access in an amount
equivalent to SDR 413.4 million (600 percent of quota) available in one or more purchases.2
Of this access, an amount equivalent to SDR 344.5 million (500 percent of quota) would be
available in the first year of the arrangement and the remaining amount would be made
available at the beginning of the second year, subject to the completion of the relevant
six-monthly review. As required for a PCL arrangement, Macedonia does not have an actual
balance of payments need; therefore, the authorities intend to treat the arrangement as
precautionary.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Macedonia had several Fund arrangements in the 1990s and 2000s until it fully
repaid its outstanding credit in 2007. Since 1995 Macedonia has had three Stand-By
arrangements (1995, 2003, and 2005), two PRGF arrangements (1997 and 2000), and one
extended arrangement (2000). The first SBA—equivalent to SDR 22.3 million (45 percent of
quota)—was fully drawn. In April 1997, a three-year PRGF arrangement was approved but
was cancelled in the aftermath of the 1999 Kosovo crisis and replaced by an extended
arrangement and a PRGF arrangement in late 2000. However, the latter were cancelled by the
authorities because of a new military crisis and were succeeded by an SBA in April 2003,
which was fully drawn. In August 2005, Macedonia requested an SBA equivalent to
1

See paragraph 5 in: The Fund’s Mandate—The Future Financing Role: Revised Reform Proposals (August 25,
2010), http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2010/082510.pdf .
2

After the first six months of the arrangement, any purchases are subject to completion of six-monthly reviews
under the PCL arrangement.

2

SDR 51.7 million (75 percent of quota); after an initial drawing of SDR 10.5 million, the
authorities indicated that they would treat the arrangement as precautionary. Macedonia fully
repaid its outstanding credit in May 2007 (Table 1).

2.
While Macedonia’s total external debt is moderately high, its public debt is
modest; both appear to be sustainable. Under the baseline scenario, external debt, which
has been in the range of 50–60 percent of GDP over the last few years, is projected to remain
below 60 percent of GDP over the medium term. Short-term external debt (on a residual
maturity basis) is projected at around 40 percent of total external debt and 80 percent of gross
international reserves. Public debt, which is estimated at 25 percent of GDP by end-2010, is
projected to decline as the public sector’s primary surplus improves. Sustainability analyses
show both external and public debt remaining manageable under a range of scenarios.
3.
If the full amounts available under the proposed PCL arrangement were to be
purchased:


Access would be the lowest among the current exceptional access arrangements.
Macedonia’s outstanding use of GRA resources would reach SDR 344.5 million in
the first year and SDR 413.4 million in the second year.3



Fund credit would represent a modest fraction of Macedonia’s external debt.
Total external debt would rise to nearly 65 percent of GDP initially, and public
external debt would rise to over 28 percent of GDP, with Fund credit being close to

3

The largest GRA credit exposure thus far has been SDR 23.359 billion to Brazil in 2003.

3

about 6 percent of GDP (Table 2). At its peak, Macedonia’s outstanding use of GRA
resources would account for about 9 percent of total external debt, about 21 percent
of public external debt, and about 22 percent of gross international reserves.


External debt service would increase moderately over the medium-term and
would be manageable under staff’s medium-term macroeconomic projections.
Macedonia’s projected debt service to the Fund would peak in 2015 at
SDR 201.9 million, or about 2.4 percent of GDP.4 In terms of exports of goods and
services, external debt service to the Fund would peak at about 4.4 percent by 2015,
and would account for 45 percent of public external debt service in 2014, and
42 percent in 2015.

The impact of the proposed arrangement on the Fund’s liquidity and potential
exposure would be small:


The proposed arrangement would reduce the Fund’s forward commitment
capacity (FCC) marginally.5 Approval of the proposed arrangement would reduce
the FCC by SDR 413.4 million, a 0.4 percent reduction (Table 3).



If the resources available under the PCL arrangement were fully drawn, GRA
credit to Macedonia as a share of GRA credit outstanding would be 0.8 percent.
As a result, the concentration of Fund credit among the top five users of Fund
resources would decline to 71.9 percent from 72.4 percent.



Potential GRA exposure to Macedonia would be less than 6 percent Fund’s
current precautionary balances. While the scale of the Fund's potential exposure to
Macedonia is relatively small, the recent increases in commitments to other members
and the possibility of further credit expansion under already existing or new Fund
arrangements––underscores the need to strengthen the Fund’s precautionary balances.

The FCC has been greatly bolstered by the supplementary resources available under the bilateral borrowing
and note purchase agreements. The FCC reflects that most creditors have responded positively to the Managing
Director’s request to keep their bilateral lines open for the financing of pre-NAB activation commitments after
the enlarged and amended NAB becomes effective, currently expected around end-March 2011.

II. ASSESSMENT
5.
The proposed PCL arrangement would have a limited impact on the Fund’s
liquidity. The authorities intend to make purchases under the PCL only in the event of
adverse shocks. If Macedonia were to draw the entire amount available, the impact of the
proposed arrangement on the Fund’s liquidity position would be limited, and Fund’s liquidity
would continue to be manageable. It should be noted, however, that if purchases under the
proposed PCL occurred against the backdrop of very adverse global conditions, there could
be substantial demand for Fund resources from other members.
6.
Risks to the Fund are expected to be low. Macedonia faces external risks that could
bring about balance of payments difficulties or fiscal financing needs should an adverse
scenario materialize. Macedonia’s vulnerabilities largely stem from its exposure to external
shocks, which call for caution in macroeconomic and financial policies. Nonetheless,
Macedonia’s overall external debt and debt service ratios are expected to remain manageable
even if the PCL is fully drawn; while short-term external debt is about 80 percent of its gross
international reserves, the composition of this debt significantly lowers potential rollover
risks. Macedonia’s sustained track record of implementing strong policies and sound
institutional policy framework provide assurances about the future course of policies such
that Macedonia’s capacity to repay is expected to remain strong.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia
Executive Board Meeting
January 19, 2010
This statement provides information that has become available since the issuance of the
staff report (EBS/11/3). The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
The cumulative fiscal outturn through November 2010 was 2.1 percent of
projected annual GDP. This suggests the budget was on-track to meet the 2010 deficit
target of 2.5 percent of GDP.
2.
Average inflation in 2010 was 1.6 percent, while December year-end inflation
was 3.0 percent. These figures are close to the staff report projections of 1.5 percent
(average) and 2.8 percent (end-year). The December uptick is mainly due to jumps in food
and energy prices.
3.
GDP grew 1.3 percent year-on-year in the third quarter. This is broadly
consistent with the staff projection of annual growth in 2010 of 1.2 percent.
4.
Gross international reserves were €1.71 billion (99 percent of short-term debt by
residual maturity) on December 31. This is higher than the €1.65 billion projected in the
staff report and suggests balance of payments trends were somewhat more favorable in
December than expected by staff.
5.
Macedonian government Eurobond spreads have not been notably affected by
sovereign debt market pressures in the Eurozone thus far. The spread on Macedonia’s
five-year Eurobond was 414 basis points on January 5 (a yield of 5.93 percent), similar to
levels of mid-October.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves €475.6 million Arrangement for Macedonia Under the
Precautionary Credit Line
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a two-year
arrangement for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia under the Precautionary
Credit Line (PCL) in the amount equivalent to SDR 413.4 million (about €475.6 million,
600 percent of quota). The access under the arrangement in the first year will be equivalent
to SDR 344.5 million (about €396.4 million, 500 percent of quota), rising in the second year
to cumulatively SDR 413.4 million).
The arrangement for Macedonia is the first commitment under the PCL. The PCL was
established in 2010 in the context of expanding and enhancing the IMF’s lending tools to
help provide effective crisis prevention.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Macedonia, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“Macedonia’s track record of sound economic policies has contributed to a solid
macroeconomic performance that includes low public debt and inflation, and a resilient
banking system. Such strong fundamentals have cushioned the impact of the global crisis on
the Macedonian economy.
“The authorities are committed to maintaining sound economic policies. One pillar of their
policy framework is moderate fiscal deficits, which will help preserve a sustainable fiscal
position and safeguard investor confidence. A second pillar is the ongoing commitment to
support the exchange rate peg, including with a monetary stance that maintains an adequate
level of international reserves. Based on these commitments, prospects for preserving
macroeconomic stability and returning to more robust economic growth appear good.
“Despite the broadly favorable outlook for growth and macroeconomic stability,
vulnerabilities to spillovers from economic and financial volatility in the region remain. The

2

PCL will mitigate the risk of contagion, including by signaling sound policies. In light of
Macedonia’s strong fundamentals, the absence of balance of payments pressures at present,
and the generally positive economic prospects, Macedonia is not expected to draw upon the
resources available under the PCL. Nevertheless, the availability of these resources, if
needed, will provide important insurance against the possibility of adverse external
developments”.
The PCL is an instrument established last year that is available to Fund members with sound
economic fundamentals and policies that do not have actual financing needs but face risks
that could give rise to such needs (see Press Release No. 10/321). Thus, countries with PCL
arrangements would be expected not to draw upon the available funds unless there is a
deterioration in external conditions. The PCL arrangement provides countries with
confidence that in the event of adverse developments they have a deep reservoir to draw
upon to preserve stability. Moreover, having a PCL arrangement in place should help to
strengthen confidence and facilitate better access to private capital markets.

Statement by Mr. Bakker and Mr. Tanasescu on Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia
January 19, 2011
Economic Developments
Macedonia has sound economic fundamentals. As elsewhere, the country was affected by
the recent global economic crisis, but recovery from the 2009 recession is underway.
Growth is projected at about 1 percent for 2010 and is expected to accelerate to
3.5 percent this year. The resumption of growth was initially led by exports, but
revitalization of investment and consumption demand are expected to play a more
important role this year. This economic recovery is supported by recent reductions in
policy interest rates, which led to resumption of bank credit growth. Risks related to
growth projections still exist however, especially in case export demand fails to continue
recovering as expected or if metal prices weaken again. Vulnerabilities in euro zone
countries could spill over to Macedonia through the current and capital accounts, and
could hamper access to international capital markets. On the upside, progress towards EU
accession would improve prospects for attracting foreign investment.
The inflation rate is expected to rise in the coming months and to reach 2.5 percent in
2011, due mainly to higher food and energy prices. At the same time, core inflation has
remained below 1 percent, and is expected to remain low.
The external position is solid, and the most recent data show the current account deficit to
be at below 3 percent of GDP in 2010, down from 13 percent of GDP in 2008. The
balance of payments is sustainable over the medium term and the international reserves
are relatively comfortable at 1.7 billion euros. The projected balance of payments flows
support moderate continued reserve accumulation over the medium term. In 2009
Macedonia successfully accessed external capital markets, although at a high price, that
reflected the prevailing unsettled market conditions. Since then secondary market yields
on the outstanding Eurobonds have fallen to below 6 percent as of January 2011. This
reduction in yields reflects investor confidence in the public finances and external sector,
and creates good prospects for issuing a new Eurobond on the international capital
markets in the first half of 2011.
Fiscal Policy
In recent years the authorities have successfully pursued fiscal consolidation. This
provided room in the current economic crisis to implement some fiscal stimulus and to
move ahead with improving infrastructure. The fiscal deficit is expected to have reached
2.5 percent of GDP in 2010 and the 2011 budget also targets a deficit of 2.5 percent of
GDP. This prudent fiscal stance is in line with the authorities’ medium-term strategy to
preserve moderate public debt ratios. For 2012 the Macedonian authorities will continue
the fiscal consolidation and they foresee a reduction in the fiscal deficit to near 2 percent

2
of GDP. Over the medium term the authorities plan to reduce the fiscal deficit to
1.5 percent of GDP, which will stabilize public debt near 25 percent of GDP and help
protect international reserves and the peg.
Monetary Policy and Financial Sector
The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) continues to play a central
role in ensuring the stability of the exchange rate peg, and in maintaining low inflation. In
2009 the NBRM responded firmly to the global financial turbulence, increasing its
interest rate and bank reserve requirements in response to an outflow of international
reserves. Since November 2009, after the situation stabilized, in light of favorable trends
in the balance of payments and reserves, and against a background of weak growth and
low inflation, the NBRM reduced gradually its interest rate that brought the policy rate to
the present level of 4 percent. The National Bank takes a cautious stance, acknowledging
that further easing should be dependent on continued favorable conditions. The
authorities will remain vigilant to keep monetary policy the main anchor in keeping a
stable exchange rate regime backed by an adequate level of international reserves.
The financial sector and bank regulatory framework are both sound, and the banks are
well capitalized. At the end of September the capital adequacy ratio was above
16 percent, providing a significant buffer against shocks.. NPLs as a share of total loans
increased, due to the economic downturn, but more than 93 percent of them are
provisioned. Recently the authorities passed a new NBRM law which brings practices
fully in line with EU directives and the European System of Central Banks Treaty. At the
same time, the authorities have initiated changes in the legislation which would address
the risk of court challenges to NBRM intervention in insolvent banks, and to widen the
class of assets that banks may use to access liquidity support from the NBRM.
Structural Reforms
Macedonia has made significant progress on structural reforms, attracting greenfield
foreign direct investment, privatizing and restructuring most of the economy, liberalizing
telecommunications, and improving the business climate. In line with their medium-term
strategy, the Macedonian authorities will continue structural reforms, including in the
area of public infrastructure, and in the energy sector. The authorities have submitted a
new energy law that will create a liberalized energy market and improve incentives for
energy efficiency and investment. Going forward, implementation of these policies will
contribute to reliable and safe energy supply at lower environmental costs, and reduce
risks to the balance of payments and the budget.
Precautionary Credit Line (PCL)
My Macedonian authorities welcome the recent approval by the Fund of the PCL as a
new financial instrument designed for countries with sound fundamentals and policies,
and moderate remaining vulnerabilities. The policies implemented in the last years have
well positioned Macedonia, and the authorities are committed to strengthening its

3
economic and financial position and to further reducing external vulnerabilities during
the coming years.
The authorities recognize that external risks persist due to the potential for adverse
developments in Macedonia’s trading partners and in international capital markets, which
could lead to pressures on the balance of payments. The Macedonian authorities consider
that a PCL arrangement would complement their economic policy strategy by bolstering
investor confidence and mitigating the impact of any new external shocks. The
authorities believe that the PCL would be an appropriate insurance against downside risks
that could generate unanticipated financing needs. They will treat the PCL as
precautionary, and they would not expect to draw upon the PCL unless there is a
significant deterioration in external conditions. They plan to finance their 2011 budget
with a Eurobond issue in the first half of 2011. Market conditions improved since last
summer and have not been negatively affected so far by renewed turbulence in euro zone
sovereign debt markets, and staff agreed that Eurobond financing is appropriate for this
year. At the same time, the authorities agreed that they should turn towards domestic debt
markets in the medium term.
Finally, we would like to express the authorities’ commitment to continuing to implement
sound policies, and they consider the PCL a significant additional buffer that could help
preserve stability and reduce the need for contractionary adjustments in the event of
temporary shocks.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
FYR Macedonia
On January 19, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2010 Article IV consultation with FYR Macedonia. 1
Background
The pace of economic recovery is picking up, with growth expected to accelerate from
somewhat over 1 percent in 2010 to 3½ percent in 2011. The recovery was driven
initially by a rebound in exports, but the contribution from domestic consumption and
investment has increased more recently. Inflation remains at low levels, despite some
increases in food and energy prices. On the external side, the current account deficit
has adjusted rapidly over the past two years, on the back of strong remittances and an
improved trade balance. The current account deficit is expected to finish 2010 at some
3½ percent of GDP. Meanwhile, international reserves have fully recovered their earlier
losses to reach their pre-crisis levels.
In the financial sector, non-performing loans (NPLs) rose and bank profitability declined
as a result of the crisis. However, the system remained free of pressures on liquidity or
solvency. NPLs were close to fully provisioned, capital ratios remained well above their
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
regulatory minimum, and bank liquidity was ample. Stable funding sources (primarily
domestic deposits), minimal reliance on external funding, and conservative asset
portfolios all helped to contain the effect of the crisis on the banking system. After
dipping following the onset of the crisis, bank deposits and bank credit to the private
sector have both resumed growing, although at a more moderate pace than before the
crisis.
Macedonia appears to be on track to meet its 2010 fiscal deficit target of 2½ percent of
GDP. This was achieved by reducing expenditure as revenues fell short of projections,
in part due to weak economic growth. The 2011 budget passed by parliament also
targets a deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP, which represents a neutral cyclical stance. On
the monetary policy side, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) has
reduced interest rates from a high of 9 percent in 2009 to the current level of 4 percent.
The NBRM based this easing on the recovery of international reserves and favorable
underlying trends in the balance of payments.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the
Macedonian authorities for their sound macroeconomic and financial policies, which
helped to contain the impact of the global crisis, and welcomed prospects for a return to
more robust growth in 2011 and beyond.
Directors noted that the fiscal outcome in 2010 and the 2011 budget strike the right
balance between safeguarding investor confidence in continued fiscal prudence and the
need to support the economic recovery. They concurred that, once a more robust
recovery is underway, fiscal consolidation will help strengthen the public finances further
and provide a policy buffer against future shocks. Directors considered that deepening
the domestic public debt market over time could help reduce external financing
vulnerabilities.
Directors noted that the significant reductions in policy interest rates over the preceding
year were justified against a background of subdued inflation, output below potential,
and favorable trends in international reserves. In their view, the scope for further interest
rate cuts is limited by the narrowing spread over ECB rates, and additional easing
should be contingent on continued favorable developments in the balance of payments
and international reserves.
Directors were encouraged by the overall healthy condition of the financial system. They
noted in particular the high capital and liquidity cushions at banks and the reliance on
relatively stable domestic deposits for funding. Directors encouraged the authorities to
move forward with the implementation of the new law on the central bank.

3
Directors emphasized the need to accelerate structural reforms and strengthen public
infrastructure to raise productivity and help reduce high unemployment. Directors were
also encouraged by the authorities’ commitment to improve data quality, including by
subscribing to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.
Despite the broadly favorable outlook for macroeconomic stability, Directors agreed that
vulnerabilities to spillovers from economic and financial volatility in the region remain.
Directors believed that Macedonia met the Precautionary Credit Line (PCL) qualification
requirements and that such an arrangement would mitigate the risk of contagion,
including by signaling sound policies. In light of Macedonia’s strong fundamentals, the
absence of balance of payments pressures at present, and the generally positive
economic prospects, Directors expected that Macedonia would not need to draw upon
the resources available under the PCL.
