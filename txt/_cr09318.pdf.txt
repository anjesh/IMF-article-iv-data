Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation and Request for Disbursement
Under the Rapid-Access Component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility
Prepared by the African Department
(In collaboration with other departments)
Approved by Mark Plant and Dhaneshwar Ghura
June 19, 2009

Discussions. The Article IV consultation discussions took place in Yaoundé and Douala,
March 26-April 9 and in Washington, April 25-29. The mission met with Prime Minister Inoni, Finance
Minister Menye, Economy Minister Motaze, several Cabinet members, BEAC National Director Mani,
members of Parliament, donors, and representatives of civil society, labor unions, the private sector and
the press. The team comprised Mr. Mecagni (head), Mr. Singh, Mr. Samake (all AFR), Mr. Klemm
(FAD), Mr. Gemayel (SPR), Mr. Vandepeute (MCM), and Ms. Kabedi-Mbuyi (Resident Representative).
Mr. Ghura joined the mission for the first few days. World Bank and African Development Bank staff
participated in the discussions.
Consultation focus. The discussions focused on the impact of the global crisis on Cameroon’s economy
and appropriate responses that preserve debt sustainability. Although macroeconomic stability was
strengthened under the recently completed PRGF arrangement and debt relief firmed up the country’s
debt sustainability, growth has remained too low to reduce poverty. The recent sizable exogenous shocks
have considerably affected economic activity and the balance of payments, as well as tightened
budgetary resources.
Policy advice. The staff report recommends (i) maintaining the 2009 budgeted spending plans to prevent
a fiscal contraction in a year of declining economic growth; (ii) continuing efforts to achieve greater
nonoil revenue mobilization, strengthen public expenditure management, and develop alternative sources
of financing; (iii) creating a more conducive environment for private sector development through further
improvement in transparency and governance, public enterprise reform, and trade liberalization; and
(iv) closely monitoring the health of the banking system.
The authorities’ position. The authorities broadly shared the staff’s assessment, and are concerned
about the pace of fiscal and external deterioration. They agreed that the 2009 budgetary spending plans
should be protected in priority areas. In the absence of social safety nets, targeted measures could be
taken in favor of sectors in distress. They also agreed that developments in the banking system should be
monitored closely.
Request for support under the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF). The authorities are requesting
support under the rapid-access component of the ESF (SDR 92.85 million, 50 percent of quota) to help
the economy weather the impact of the shocks. The full amount would become available upon Board
approval.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Cameroon’s macroeconomic performance was strengthened under the PRGF
arrangement completed in January 2009 (Figure 1 and Box 1). Debt relief in April 2006
under the HIPC Initiative helped firm up the country’s debt sustainability, and create fiscal
space for poverty-reducing spending. Public expenditure management is now more
transparent and the financial sector stronger.1 Prudent management of oil earnings and
revenue has allowed the authorities to accumulate government deposits at the regional central
bank (BEAC) and to contribute to the currency union’s pool of foreign exchange reserves,
while raising investment and normalizing relations with creditors.

Despite these improvements, the economy
remains vulnerable to commodity shocks,
especially from oil, and reducing poverty is a
challenge (Figure 2). Cameroon still relies heavily
on commodities for its foreign exchange earnings
and fiscal revenues, making it vulnerable to a
decline in demand and prices for these products.
Furthermore, the reforms carried out to date have
not yet delivered the expected pickup in investment
that would set the country on the higher growth path
needed to reduce poverty. Reform of public

enterprises has been slower than expected under the PRGF arrangement, and limited
infrastructure and an unfavorable business environment continue to hamper economic
growth. As a result, Cameroon’s per capita real GDP has trailed comparator countries and the
population living below the poverty threshold has remained virtually unchanged at 40 percent
since 2001. On its current trajectory, Cameroon is unlikely to meet the MDGs.
Box 1. Cameroon: Response to Previous Fund Advice

Policy Area

Staff Recommendations During
the 2007 Article IV Consultation

Fiscal policy and
management

Raise nonoil revenues; contain
expenditures while promoting
priority outlays; improve public
finance management; and ensure
prudent debt management.

Public enterprise
reform

Take actions to reduce government
participation in public enterprises
and improve services.

Private sector
development

Improve the business environment
in order to boost growth.

Implementation/Outcome
Despite reforms in tax and customs
administrations, nonoil revenues stagnated as a
share of nonoil GDP (once adjusted for
transparency effects).2 Priority spending,
including investment, increased. A new public
finance system law was adopted in 2007 and is
being phased in over five years. Only
concessional debt was contracted and budgetary
surpluses were used to reduce domestic debt.
Although the water company is now under a
management contract, the restructuring of the
airline and telephone companies has yet to be
completed.
Spending on infrastructure increased. Limited
progress was made toward the removal of
impediments to trade within CEMAC. An action
plan has been prepared to deepen financial
intermediation on the basis of the 2007 FSAP
recommendations. The government is taking
steps to strengthen the judiciary and fight
corruption.

3.
The authorities are eager to set the economy on a higher-growth path that can
lower poverty, though they realize that the global crisis will make this task more
challenging. Even before the global crisis, the authorities had stressed their resolve to revive
economic activity, while preserving macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. They
had accelerated priority expenditure, refocused capital spending on infrastructure and
agriculture, and stepped up efforts to mobilize nonoil revenue. They are preparing an
economic program in the context of a new poverty reduction strategy (PRS). The global
slowdown has made this policy agenda even more urgent.

4.
Social tensions that arose last year have abated and the political situation is
stable. Dissatisfaction with rising costs for food and fuel amid discussions of changes to the
constitution had caused unrest in early 2008. Fiscal measures adopted by the authorities in
March 2008—customs duty exemptions for some necessities, a fuel price freeze amid high
oil prices, and salary increases for civil servants—helped to reduce social tensions and price
pressures. The impact of the global crisis carries a risk of severe social implications,
however. In April 2008, Parliament amended the constitution to eliminate the two-term limit
for presidents.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK—WEATHERING
THE GLOBAL CRISIS
A. Economic Developments in 2008
5.
In 2008, the global downturn had little effect on Cameroon’s economic activity
(Table 1). Despite a contraction in oil output, real GDP grew by about 3½ percent driven by
the continued pickup in nonoil economic activity, including agriculture. Slower external
demand has, however, lowered timber and cotton exports. In addition, increased imports
resulting from high food prices kept the current account in deficit (Table 2), despite high oil
prices for most of the year. Nonetheless, the overall external position remained in surplus,
allowing a further contribution to the regional pool of foreign exchange reserves.

Fuel and food continued to dominate price developments. Despite the fuel price
freeze and lower taxation of some staple goods, inflation increased in 2008. Headline
inflation reached 5.3 percent (year-on-year) in December 2008 (compared to 3.4 percent a
year earlier), but core inflation remained stable at about 4½ percent. Combined with a recent
strengthening of the euro, these developments contributed to an appreciation of the real
effective exchange rate (REER).3 While the REER is broadly in line with fundamentals,

Fiscal performance was mixed,
however. Although the overall fiscal balance
remained in surplus (2 percent of GDP,
including grants), allowing some further buildup of government deposits at the regional
central bank (BEAC), spending pressures
narrowed the surplus. Capital spending
increased substantially relative to 2007, as the
authorities began to tackle bottlenecks to
investment and better coordinate with donors.
Current spending expanded with higher explicit
subsidies replacing the lower taxes granted to
SONARA (the national oil refinery).4 Oil
revenues remained strong with high oil prices
for most of the year. Nonoil revenues were,
however, broadly unchanged, despite the
authorities’ continued efforts to improve
revenue administration.

Weaknesses in public expenditure management have resurfaced. Overspending
on goods and services in 2008 was partly the result of large settlements of unpaid bills
(treasury float) related to the previous budgetary period.5 There was also a re-emergence of
domestic arrears. In particular, subsidies to SONARA to offset losses incurred as a result

Box 2. External Competitiveness and Real Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff’s analysis suggests that Cameroon’s real effective exchange rate (REER) is in line with its
equilibrium level. Survey data indicate, however, that the country’s competitiveness continues to
suffer from several nonprice factors, principally related to a poor business environment.
Methodology. Five approaches were used to assess
Cameroon’s real effective exchange rate (REER)
and competitiveness: the three CGER
methodologies complemented by a Cameroonspecific multivariate reduced-form model (see
Table) and survey data analysis.
1. The macroeconomic balance approach
estimates a current account norm (or equilibrium
current account) based on economic fundamentals
for Cameroon relative to its trading partners. The
analysis shows that a 4 percent (backward) to
3 percent (forward) real depreciation would be
required to close the gap between the underlying
current account, which strips the actual current
account of all temporary factors, and the current
account norm.

analysis suggests that the REER would need to
depreciate by 6 percent (backward) to 8 percent (forward) to stabilize NFA.

3. Two reduced-form Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange Rate assessments were conducted: the
CGER panel-based and the country-specific multivariate vector error correction model. These
methodologies assume that the equilibrium REER is related to a set of fundamental factors: terms of
trade, productivity, investment, government consumption, NFA, and trade openness. They produce a
range of results from 0.2 percent undervaluation (CGER panel-based) to 7 percent overvaluation
(country-specific model).
4. Survey data analysis, which is a complement to the above quantitative assessments, provides
information on structural obstacles to competitiveness. For the last two years the Global
Competitiveness Index (GCI) and the World Bank Doing Business reports have ranked Cameroon in
the bottom quartile. The country’s share in world nonoil products markets has been declining for the
past decade (see text figure). These observations suggest an erosion in Cameroon’s competitiveness.

B. The Impact of the Crisis in 2009
10.
The global crisis is expected to take a considerably greater toll in 2009 (Figure 4).
Although Cameroon’s banking sector is not directly exposed to the global financial turmoil,
Cameroon’s economic activity is expected to be adversely affected through the following
channels:


World prices for Cameroon’s main export commodities (e.g., oil) have declined, leading
to a sharp deterioration in the terms of trade (about 20 percent).



Slower world demand has had adverse effects on timber, rubber, cotton, and to a lesser
extent, aluminum, which was also affected by input constraints.



Given the tight international liquidity conditions, financing for some large investment
projects has been delayed, particularly in the energy, aluminum, and mining sectors,
reducing the inflow of foreign capital.



Remittances (although they amount only to about 0.8 percent of GDP) are expected to
decline.

11.
As a result, economic activity, the external position, and the fiscal accounts are
being severely affected. Economic growth is projected to slow by 1 percentage point, to
2.4 percent in 2009, with risks on the downside. The estimated net impact of the shocks on
balance of payments flows is about 7.6 percent of GDP. Offsetting developments in other
items bring the deterioration in the balance of payments to about 6 percentage points of GDP
in 2008-09. This would imply a sharp decline in the country’s notional foreign exchange
reserves at the BEAC from 6.2 months of imports in 2008 to about 4.5 months of imports by
end-2009 in the absence of additional financing. Similarly, the overall fiscal surplus of
2 percent of GDP (including grants) observed in 2008 is expected to turn into a deficit in
2009 of close to 1 percent of GDP.

C. Medium-Term Outlook
12.
Cameroon’s medium-term economic outlook has also been revised downward.
The deterioration in Cameroon’s terms of trade is expected to be partially reversed in 2010
and the country’s export outlook should gradually improve as the global economy recovers.
Nevertheless, delays in implementing important infrastructure projects will continue to weigh
adversely on the country’s medium-term economic prospects. Against this background,


Nonoil real GDP growth is expected to be lower than previously projected by about
1½ percentage points per year.



Fiscal oil revenues have been revised slightly upwards with recent investment
temporarily raising oil production in 2011 and 2012.



Nonoil revenues have been revised downward, because of the weaker growth projections.



The overall fiscal balance will turn into a modest deficit of less than one percent of GDP
and the nonoil primary deficit will widen broadly by the same magnitude.



The current account deficit, widening by about 2 percentage points of GDP because of
the global crisis, will persist over the medium term.



On the positive side, price pressures on food and fuel seen last year have subsided.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS—RESPONDING TO THE CRISIS AND
REDUCING VULNERABILITIES
13.
A key challenge confronting the Cameroonian authorities is to address the
impact of the global crisis within a framework that maintains fiscal and external
sustainability while leaving room to boost growth. The authorities recognize that the
impact of the global crisis underscores the continued vulnerability of Cameroon’s economy
to external shocks, especially fluctuations in demand and prices for its key commodities.
They have taken immediate actions to shelter the economy in the short run and are
committed to reforms that would increase resilience to external shocks over time. Against
this backdrop, the Article IV consultation discussions centered on three key areas:


Using the available fiscal space;



Reducing the obstacles to growth; and



Ensuring the stability of the financial sector.
A. Using Fiscal Space

14.
The authorities and staff agreed that in the short run fiscal policy should help
cushion the economy from the impact of the global crisis, despite the tighter financing
conditions. The private sector has expressed concerns about the potential social costs of the
current crisis and is calling for immediate action in favor of sectors in distress (Box 3). In this
context, the authorities agreed to avoid to the extent possible a fiscal contraction in a year of
significant decline in growth. In this regard, they are preparing a supplementary budget
which would allow for some targeted support, a minor increase in domestic investment, and a
larger allocation for the clearance of arrears. The level of the 2009 budgeted spending would
be maintained (with the exception of fuel subsidies). The implied fiscal stance would remain
broadly unchanged in 2009 compared to 2008.6


6

In the absence of social safety nets, targeted measures will be taken to protect sectors
facing particular difficulties. In the forestry sector, cascading has been reduced by
eliminating some taxes and the annual timber royalty could be reduced to reflect
lower timber prices. In the agriculture sector, given the tight financial situation of
many small producers, the authorities are moving to provide targeted subsidies to
purchase seeds and fertilizers for the next harvest.

The projected reduction in the nonoil primary deficit, from 6.8 percent of nonoil GDP in 2008 to 4.3 percent in
2009, stems mainly from the elimination of fuel subsidies.

16


Lower international oil prices offer an opportunity to eliminate fuel subsidies in 2009 and
resume timely retail fuel price adjustments. In this regard, options for rolling out targeted
mechanisms to protect the poor are under consideration.



The decline in oil revenue is expected to turn the overall fiscal balance in 2009 into a
deficit. While the country’s low debt level would allow it to borrow without jeopardizing
fiscal sustainability, access to concessional financing could be limited in the near future
in light of the global downturn. In addition, the domestic debt market is not yet
operational. Hence, the deficit would have to be financed by drawing on the government
deposits at the BEAC.



Given the downside risks, the authorities agreed in principle on the need to consider
contingent measures, in case revenues are much lower than expected. In this regard, they
agreed that such measures should be rapid to implement, yield quick results, imply
limited economic distortions, and minimize adverse effects on the poor. These actions
would aim at safeguarding government deposits and would probably imply cuts in
nonpriority spending.
Box 3. Views from the Private Sector
Staff had a number of meetings with the private sector, including representatives of the
aluminum, banking, cement, cotton, electricity, forestry, and oil industries.
Private sector representatives have expressed concerns about the severe impact of the
global crisis. Lower external demand and prices are affecting a number of key sectors in
Cameroon, some of which were already in difficulty. The cotton sector, for instance, had been
suffering from a steep increase in the cost of inputs, especially fertilizers, and production was
in sharp decline. Spillover effects were expected to be significant, especially in the transport
sector with about half of its activities related to the seriously affected timber industry.
Social costs were seen as high. The forestry sector (10,000 jobs) has laid off about 20 percent
of its employees and put another 15 percent on forced leave. The cotton sector (370,000 jobs)
is under threat. If the crisis were to be protracted and no action taken to help sectors in distress,
especially timber, it was feared that the financial crisis could degenerate into a social crisis.
There were calls for immediate action. The private sector called for immediate measures to
alleviate the impact in the sectors most affected, through subsidies or tax deferrals. It was
suggested that the government help laid-off workers find other jobs to reduce hardship. Private
sector representatives also underscored the need for structural reforms to make the economy
more resilient to shocks and improve competitiveness. They stressed the importance of
improving transparency and governance, access to financing, and public infrastructure
(especially roads, ports and energy).

17
15.
The medium-term fiscal strategy should continue to reflect the nonrenewable
nature of oil revenues and the need to address obstacles to growth, while preserving
debt sustainability. Cameroon should limit fiscal deficits while oil revenues are significant
so that future generations are not faced with a renewed debt burden. Oil revenues and
available prudent borrowing should be effectively used to finance growth-enhancing
investments. This strategy is ensured by maintaining a moderately positive nonoil current
balance and by avoiding sizable overall deficits for as long as oil revenues remain
substantial. Finally, fluctuations in the nonoil primary balance should be contained to avoid
destabilizing effects on the economy. The macroeconomic framework discussed with the
authorities is in line with these principles.
16.
Within this framework, the authorities recognize that existing fiscal buffers are
limited and adjustment efforts needed over the medium term. In view of limited
financing prospects at terms consistent with safeguarding sustainability, a balanced overall
fiscal position would need to be gradually restored over the medium term, while continued
support is provided to the economy. The policy discussions focused on a three-pronged
strategy: (i) increase nonoil revenues, (ii) rationalize public spending to protect priority
programs, and (iii) develop alternative sources of domestic financing.

17.
The recent significant decline in oil revenues makes it more urgent to continue
efforts to mobilize additional nonoil revenues in order to protect priority spending. In
view of the expected decline in oil production beyond 2012 and further envisaged import
tariff reductions–and given that tax rates on capital income, labor, and consumption are
already high–broadening the tax base through administrative measures is a key priority.
 The authorities agreed that the priority should be to reduce the cost of compliance by
simplifying tax procedures. In particular, the number of tax forms will be reduced. In
addition, the opening of tax centers offering accounting and tax advice to small- and
medium-sized enterprises is expected to facilitate compliance.

18
 Implementation of exemptions will be tightened. A more effective tracking system
will be put in place to monitor transit trade and trading risk-profiles will be further
developed to improve customs administration.
18.
The quality of public spending would need to be improved. With tighter budgetary
constraints, efforts to achieve greater efficiency should continue. In this regard, capital
expenditure (and maintenance of existing infrastructure) would need to be stepped up to
reduce the severe infrastructural bottlenecks, and provide a renewed and stronger impetus to
growth. Related administrative capacity needs also to be further strengthened.
 To be effective, new capital projects need to be carefully selected to maximize their
impact on growth and integrated into a medium-term strategy. In this context, the
authorities intend to continue (i) reinforcing public expenditure tracking and training
of personnel; and (ii) building capacity to prepare, evaluate, and execute projects.
 The large fluctuations in the treasury float make it difficult to assess the fiscal stance
in any given period. In this regard, the authorities have committed to settle the arrears
to SONARA in 2009 and produce comprehensive budgetary execution data on a
payment orders basis by the end of the year.
 The gradual implementation of the new public finance system law will require careful
monitoring. Among the changes it introduces are a budget structured by program,
stronger budget execution, more stringent accounting and control rules, and improved
transparency. The introduction of such changes has been a challenge, even in
advanced countries.
19.
Alternative sources of financing should also be developed. A broader financing
base could help protect priority spending while preserving fiscal sustainability and containing
pressures on the region’s pool of foreign exchange reserves. Staff recognized that the
country’s low debt level would allow it to borrow prudently without jeopardizing fiscal
sustainability, and encouraged the authorities to continue to work with relevant regional
agencies and take action to speed up the development of the domestic bond market.
20.
In this regard, the DSA analysis indicates that the risk of debt distress remains
low, but the authorities are taking steps to strengthen their debt management capacity.7
Cameroon’s debt management was assessed by the World Bank as among the weakest in
post-completion point HIPC countries. The authorities have indicated that improving this
area is a priority. Following joint Bank-Fund technical assistance, they are working on
implementing a new debt management strategy in line with CEMAC regional guidelines.
This will require the definition of an institutional framework with clear responsibilities,
7

Cameroon still has outstanding external arrears of about US$1.4 million. The authorities have made every
effort to finalize negotiations with the private creditors involved (see the attached Debt Sustainability Analysis).
The lack of agreement with these creditors does not undermine Cameroon’s reform and adjustment efforts.

19
effective coordination of all relevant entities (Budget, Treasury, CAA, and BEAC), and the
elaboration of an annual borrowing plan and calendar for the issuance of bonds suited for the
country’s financial situation.
B. Raising Growth: Addressing the Bottlenecks
21.
The authorities recognize that an unfavorable investment climate is holding back
the country’s economic expansion. Inadequate infrastructure and an unfavorable business
environment hamper output and export diversification and faster economic growth (Box 4).
The authorities have initiated a dialogue with the private sector and donors to identify
concrete measures and recognized that continued efforts to improve governance would
reduce regulatory uncertainty.
22.
Further progress in reforming public enterprises would also help improve the
business environment. Progress in restructuring public enterprises and service delivery has
been slow (Box 5). The authorities recognize that the global financial crisis could hamper
access to financing and cause further delays for their privatization agenda. Against this, the
opportunity should be taken to clarify the reform strategies, in particular for air transport and
telecommunications, allowing a prompt finalization of the restructuring once international
financial conditions improve.
23.
Progress in trade liberalization would stimulate economic growth. The authorities
signed an interim economic partnership agreement with the European Union (EU) in January
2009, pending a broader regional agreement with the other CEMAC members. Intra-CEMAC
regional trade remains very limited, however. CEMAC import tariffs are among the highest
in sub-Saharan Africa.8 Against this backdrop, the authorities agreed to continue to urge
CEMAC partners to further liberalize trade by (i) reducing the maximum common external
tariff (CET) from 30 to 20 percent, and (ii) harmonizing rules of origin and streamlining CET
exemptions, and (iii) working toward a regional trade agreement with the EU.
C. Assuring the Stability of the Financial System
24.
Although the banking sector is generally sound, there are pockets of
vulnerability. Observance of regional prudential norms has generally improved, but the
compliance of some Cameroonian banks with capital requirements and credit exposure limits
remains weak, making them vulnerable to an economic slowdown. In this regard, the
authorities agreed that they would continue to work with the relevant regional agencies to
monitor closely developments in the banking sector, and in particular ensure timely

Major constraints on greater intraregional trade include weak regional infrastructure and lack of production
diversification.

assessment of asset quality and adequate provisioning for nonperforming loans, and enforce
corrective action where needed.

transportation problems. Surveys have highlighted that unreliable electricity supply was also a major
deterrent for private investors. Electricity consumption in Cameroon is far lower than in other
lower-middle-income countries. Supply is insufficient and distribution is uneven, with frequent
blackouts affecting also important parts of the public administration.

21
Box 5. Public Enterprise Reform
The authorities have been carrying out public enterprise restructuring programs to improve
their performance and the quality of services they provide, as well as reduce the burden on the
budget. Progress, however, has been slow, contributing to the infrastructure bottlenecks that
hamper faster economic growth.
CAMAIR (the national airline company) ceased operations in May 2008 and is being
liquidated. The authorities have stepped up their efforts to launch a successor company,
CAMAIRCo. The preparatory work for issuing the bids for the selection of a strategic partner
is ongoing, but the prospects are problematic in the current financial environment.
Bids for the privatization of CAMTEL (the telephone company) were issued in March 2007,
but the government judged the offers unsatisfactory. It is now considering a management
contract as a more appropriate framework, in light of the investment it has made to set up a
fiber optic backbone and the significant market power it would convey to a private operator.
Efforts to reduce the costs of SONARA (the oil refinery) continue. The financing package for
the expansion of its production capacity is being finalized and would allow greater economies
of scale. The next step is to improve efficiency to allow the refinery to process more of the
heavier Cameroonian crudes.
The 2008 financial accounts for CAMPOST (the postal bank) have been produced. A business
plan has been prepared by the management company on how best to provide financial services
to rural areas and move ahead with the restructuring. The authorities are examining the options.

25.
The authorities recognize that bank credit remains hampered by a poorly
functional judicial system, absence of adequate collateral, and limited credit
information. Given the global financial crisis, credit conditions could become even tighter if
impediments to access are not tackled and asset quality deteriorates. The authorities agreed,
therefore, to accelerate the implementation of their action plan to deepen financial
intermediation, based on the recommendations of the 2007 FSAP mission. The plan aims to
(i) improve credit information by supporting the BEAC in finalizing implementation of the
central credit registry; (ii) introduce financial instruments appropriate to small and medium
enterprises such as factoring, leasing, and venture capital; and (iii) improve contract
enforcement by setting up a court dedicated to commercial matters and facilitating
out-of-court settlements.

22
IV. ESF REQUEST
26.
Cameroon is facing difficulties caused primarily by sudden and exogenous
shocks with a severe impact on the economy. Declining commodity prices, lower external
demand, and tighter external financing are adversely affecting key economic activities.
Growth projections have been revised downwards and the overall external balance is
expected to turn into a deficit. A financing requirement of CFAF 111 billion (1.1 percent of
GDP), which mirrors the fiscal gap, would emerge if the deterioration in the country’s
notional foreign exchange reserves were to be limited to a level corresponding to about
5 months of imports.
27.
The authorities have expressed concern about the size of the shocks and the pace
of deterioration of their fiscal buffers. The authorities consider it prudent to maintain
government deposits at about their current level (equivalent to about 2.6 percent of GDP or
1¾ months of public spending), given (i) the uncertain duration of the global crisis, (ii) the
volatility of oil revenues, (iii) the risk of contingent liabilities materializing, considering the
pockets of vulnerability in the banking system, (iv) the absence of an operational market for
government securities, and (v) their commitment to regularizing their payment arrears. Under
current conditions and without additional financing, the authorities’ proposed fiscal strategy
would imply, however, a decline in usable government deposits from 2.6 percent of GDP at
end-2008 to about 1½ percent of GDP at end-2009 (equivalent to about a month of
spending).9
28.
Against this background, the authorities have requested Fund financing under
the rapid-access component of the ESF in the amount of SDR 92.85 million (50 percent
of quota). In light of the unfinished structural agenda, the authorities intend to move rapidly
to a new PRGF arrangement and have approached other multilateral development partners
for additional financing. Meanwhile, rapid Fund assistance would provide some temporary
additional financial support to help the economy adjust to the exogenous shocks, and to
ensure that priority outlays (investment, health, education) are protected in 2009.
29.
Cameroon has adequate capacity to repay the Fund (Table 6). Access of
50 percent of quota (about 0.6 percent of GDP) will not jeopardize debt sustainability. The
country has a low stock of external debt, and the debt sustainability analysis places
Cameroon at a low risk of debt distress. Following the HIPC Initiative assistance and MDRI
debt relief, Cameroon’s stock of public debt fell to about 10 percent of GDP and external
debt to about 6 percent of GDP at end-2008, while the NPV of external debt stood at
10.2 percent of exports.

9

Usable government deposits exclude C2D funds, earmarked for specific projects financed by France. Data for
the first quarter of 2009 are in line with the projected deterioration.

23
V. RISKS
30.
The economic outlook is nevertheless subject to significant downside risks. The
main risks relate to a further worsening or longer duration of the global downturn and delays
in implementing the proposed policies.


A sharper or more protracted growth decline in the global economy could lower demand
and prices for commodities, including oil, and remittances.10



Tighter financial conditions could dry up further net private capital inflows and postpone
large infrastructure projects with adverse effects on the country’s prospects for growth
and poverty reduction.



Lack of improvements in mobilizing nonoil revenue and reducing nonpriority spending
could put greater pressure on the government’s deposits at the regional central bank.



Delays in improving the investment climate could hamper the expected pickup in nonoil
exports and net capital inflows, putting pressure on the regional pool of foreign exchange
reserves.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL

31.
The global economic crisis is affecting Cameroon severely. After last year’s social
tensions arising from high food and fuel prices, the global crisis this year is providing yet
another set of challenges. Lower oil prices are reducing exports and fiscal revenues.
Considerably weaker external demand is adversely affecting key exports. Tighter external
financing conditions have delayed important investment projects. As a result, growth
projections have been revised downward, and the overall fiscal and external balances are
projected to turn into deficit. Without appropriate social safety nets in place, the social costs
of the downturn could be severe.
32.
Recent economic achievements provide Cameroon with a relatively solid
foundation for weathering the impact of the global crisis. Prudent management of oil
windfalls under the recently completed PRGF-supported program has allowed the authorities
to accumulate government deposits at the BEAC and contribute to the regional pool of
foreign exchange reserves. These savings now provide welcome fiscal and external buffers
that can be prudently used to alleviate the impact of the crisis.

10

For instance, should international oil prices be US$10/barrel lower than currently projected, fiscal revenues
would be lower by 0.9 percentage point of GDP.

24
33.
Economic growth has, however, been too slow to reduce poverty. While the
exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, nonprice factors continue to adversely
affect Cameroon’s competitiveness. Limited infrastructure and an unfavorable business
environment hamper faster economic development. On the current trajectory, Cameroon is
highly unlikely to meet the MDGs. Against this backdrop, staff commends the authorities’
commitment to continue to preserve macroeconomic stability and tackle structural
impediments to growth, although the global crisis will make this task more challenging.
34.
The authorities have already taken steps to deal with the shocks. Staff agrees that
the implementation of the 2009 budgetary priority spending plans should be maintained to
avoid a public sector contraction in a year of declining economic growth. Targeted measures
are being put in place to help particular sectors in difficulty and alleviate social distress.
35.
Staff welcomes the accelerated implementation of structural measures to
increase the economy’s resilience to shocks. The authorities have committed to enhance
their efforts to achieve greater nonoil revenue mobilization, strengthen public expenditure
management and transparency, and develop alternative sources of financing. Decisive actions
are also needed to improve governance, make the business environment more attractive, and
enhance the still limited role of the financial sector in the development of the economy. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ efforts and commitment to address these challenges through a
medium-term economic program in the context of a new PRS under preparation.
36.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for the rapid-access component of the
ESF. The authorities have demonstrated a readiness to collaborate with the Fund in finding
solutions to the deteriorating balance of payments situation. Their policy commitments
appropriately address the impact of the shocks and contribute to making the economy more
resilient. Rapid Fund support would contribute to contain the decline in the country’s
notional foreign exchange reserves and in usable government deposits to a level that is
prudent to maintain in light of the uncertainties facing the economy. Cameroon has adequate
capacity to repay the Fund and, with a low risk of debt distress, access of 50 percent of quota
will not jeopardize debt sustainability.
37.
Nonetheless, the authorities should continue to remain vigilant against the
possibility of downside risks. While not directly affected, the financial sector in particular
could be negatively affected by a protracted economic slowdown and act as a further drag on
growth if credit conditions become tighter. Developments in this sector should be closely
monitored in cooperation with regional supervisors and corrective actions taken if needed.
38.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Cameroon take place on
the standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX—LETTER OF INTENT
June 18 , 2009

Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
The conclusions of the Article IV consultation mission to Cameroon indicated that
our country’s economic situation, which had improved significantly with the implementation
of reforms supported by the most recent PRGF arrangement (October 2005–January 2009),
will deteriorate owing to the international economic crisis.
2.
The Cameroonian economy remains vulnerable to fluctuations in global demand and
commodity prices. In particular, the sharp decline in oil revenues this year will lead to a
deterioration in the fiscal and external balances. These tighter financial conditions will make
the government’s efforts to accelerate economic growth, particularly through public
investment, more challenging. Despite the progress made to consolidate macroeconomic
stability, poor infrastructure and an unfavorable business environment still hamper economic
activity and make it difficult to reach the growth rates needed to reduce poverty on a
sustainable basis.
Impact of the Shocks
3.
The global slowdown is having a severe impact on the Cameroonian economy
through several channels:


Lower international oil prices, which will lead to a significant deterioration in the
terms of trade, as well as a substantial drop in fiscal oil revenues;



Weaker external demand for our main export products, particularly timber, cotton,
rubber, and aluminum;



Tighter international financial conditions, which could delay some of our large
mining and infrastructure projects;



Reduced transfers from Cameroonians working abroad.

32
4.
This situation will negatively affect our net external balance and our economic
growth, which could decline from 3½ percent in 2008 to 2½ percent in 2009. The overall
fiscal balance could also turn into a deficit of about 1 percent of GDP in 2009, while the
balance of payments deficit could stand at around 4½ percent of GDP. The government is
concerned by the magnitude of this deterioration (several percentage points of GDP).
Policies to Address the Shocks
5.
To deal with this situation, the government has taken the immediate decision to
maintain the priority expenditures included in the 2009 budget. It intends to use the available
fiscal space to protect the economy from the effects of the global crisis and continue to lift
the infrastructure bottlenecks hampering economic development. The government has also
reaffirmed its commitment to eliminating subsidies on fuel prices and resuming
implementation of the mechanism for adjusting the retail prices of petroleum products. To
protect the most vulnerable segments of the population, it will continue its efforts to
strengthen the social safety net, and look at the modalities and mechanisms for introducing a
more targeted system.
6.
The government has also taken measures to provide assistance to sectors in distress,
particularly with a view to help small producers. In the timber sector, it has eliminated the
bank guarantee required from taxpayers at the beginning of each fiscal year. It has also
eliminated the factory admission tax for products entering second and third processing, thus
reducing the cascading tax distortions adversely affecting the sector. It is also planning to
reduce the annual timber royalty by half this year to take into account the decline in demand
and lower prices for forestry products. In the cotton sector, the outstanding VAT credits have
been cleared. Given the tight financial situation for small producers, there is a risk that many
of them will lose their source of revenue this year if they are not able to produce. In this
regard, discussions are ongoing with operators in the agricultural sector on the possibility of
subsidizing inputs.
7.
In this context, the government is committed to contain the overall fiscal deficit in
2009 to about 1 percent of GDP and the nonoil primary deficit to about 4 percent of GDP.
For this purpose, it will adopt a supplementary budget in 2009 to reflect the decline in oil and
nonoil revenues. On the expenditure side, the supplementary budget will take account of the
need to maintain the initially planned priority expenditures, support the sectors in crisis, and
eliminate arrears in the payments to SONARA to cover its losses incurred in 2008 as the
result of the government’s policy on retail prices for petroleum products.
8.
The government also undertakes to respond to the exogenous shocks by
implementing economic policies aimed at reducing the vulnerability of the Cameroonian
economy while maintaining macroeconomic stability. To that end, it will take steps
to: (i) increase nonoil revenues; (ii) diversify the sources of public financing; (iii) strengthen
public expenditure management; (iv) improve the business environment; and (v) preserve the

33
stability of the financial sector. In addition, the government will avoid introducing or
intensifying trade restrictions.
Increasing nonoil revenues
9.
The government will step up its efforts to mobilize nonoil revenues by expanding the
tax base. To that end, the following measures will be implemented:
In regard to internal revenue:
In 2009


Simplify tax payment and filing procedures by cutting the number of forms to be filed
by half, and hence reducing the high cost of tax compliance;



Bring back into the general tax regime 19 enterprises identified as still benefiting
unduly from exemptions;



Establish management centers (offering tax and accounting services to small and
medium-sized enterprises) to encourage operators in the informal sector to register
with the tax administration, and improve and simplify the tax returns of operators
already registered;



Finalize the computer connection between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry
of Forestry and Wildlife to improve the exchange of information on taxpayers.

In 2010


Complete the work to update the fiscal cadastre in order to expand the property tax
base;



Implement electronic filing to continue to reduce the cost of tax compliance.

In regard to customs revenue:
In 2009


Improve the use of ASYCUDA (computerized customs system) through better
tracking of its risk indicators to combat customs fraud;



Introduce and use a GPS–based tracking mechanism to improve the monitoring of
merchandise in transit and combat fraud affecting customs revenues;



Accelerate implementation of the import duty sticker for tobacco and alcohol to
combat smuggling and increase customs revenues.

34
In 2010


Install ASYCUDA at other major revenue-collection posts, in particular Maroua and
Garoua-Boulai, and establish computer connections between existing posts where
ASYCUDA is installed;



Computerize procedures and enhance data sharing by improving the electronic
one-stop shop;



Introduce a value registry to ensure proper application of the transaction value and
achieve a better assessment of declared values.

Diversification of the sources of public financing
10.
To diversify the sources of financing for the economy, the government plans to issue
bonds in the coming year, as soon as the subregional mechanism is operational.
Improvement of public expenditure management
11.
The government will continue its efforts to improve the quality of public spending to
better match committed expenditures to services provided, and achieve savings that can be
reallocated to priority outlays. To that end, starting in 2009 it will undertake a quarterly
revision of the reference prices for government orders to limit overcharging and ensure the
effectiveness of public spending.
12.
Increasing public investment will be an essential component of our policy to foster
economic recovery. The government undertakes to continue to: (i) improve the tracking of
government spending; and (ii) strengthen capacity to prepare, evaluate, and implement
projects. To that end, a consulting unit with government participation will be created in 2010
to build capacities for evaluating projects and ensuring that projects included in the
government budget are carried through to completion.
13.
The government will also take measures to improve fiscal transparency. The
government intends to continue to publish quarterly reports on budget execution. The
presentation of government financial operations (TOFE) on a payment order basis will be
finalized in 2009 and will thereafter be produced on a regular basis to give a more complete
picture of the government’s fiscal commitments. In addition, the government recognizes the
need to avoid excessive accumulation of arrears and treasury float. To that end, it will settle
amounts remaining due to SONARA in 2009 and will continue its efforts to strengthen
expenditure management.
14.
A number of steps currently under way for the gradual implementation of the new
public finance system law will be completed in 2009, in particular: (i) the drafting of the
decree regulating government accounting, clarifying the fiscal operations of the government,

35
the parties concerned, and their respective roles in the new environment; and (ii) the drafting
of the methodological guide on the preparation of program budgets.
Improvement of the business environment
15.
The authorities will give priority to development of the private sector in order to
expand and diversify the production base and thus help to reduce the vulnerability of the
economy to exogenous shocks. Emphasis will be placed on improving the business
environment and combating corruption. To that end, the government is taking steps to create
a more favorable environment for foreign investment with the help of the IFC. In 2009,
planned priority actions focus on the simplification of procedures for establishing companies
and improvement of cross-border trade.
Protection of the stability of the financial sector
16.
Although contagion from the international financial crisis via financial channels
seems very unlikely in Cameroon, a lasting slowdown in economic activity could increase
the vulnerability of banks. To that end, the government will continue to work with the
relevant regional authorities to strengthen surveillance of the banking system and limit any
potential cost for the budget, while ensuring in particular that banks provision appropriately
against nonperforming loans and that the needed corrective measures are taken.
Request for Fund Assistance under the Rapid-Access Component of the ESF
17.
Despite these measures, the effects of the international crisis will result in an
increased need for budget financing. In the absence of an operational government bond
market, the overall fiscal deficit expected in 2009 could be financed by drawing on
government deposits at the BEAC.
18.
However, the current level of these deposits is appropriate to provide some guarantee
in the face of: (i) uncertainties regarding the length of the international crisis; (ii) oil price
volatility; (iii) the vulnerabilities of the banking sector; and (iv) the lack of a government
bond market. To protect priority spending and not jeopardize poverty reduction efforts, it will
be necessary to access other sources of financing.
19.
Given the scope of these financing needs, the government has initiated discussions
with its development partners to seek their assistance. Moreover, it is anticipated that the new
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) will be completed in August 2009 at the latest.
This will be an important milestone for our dialogue with our partners and will lay the
foundation for discussions with the IMF on a new program supported by the PRGF by
end-2009.

36
20.
However, the mobilization of this financing will take time. We request, therefore, that
the IMF allow the government of Cameroon the maximum access of 50 percent of quota
(SDR 92.85 million) through the rapid-access component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility
(ESF).
21.

The government of Cameroon authorizes the IMF to publish this letter.

Sincerely yours,
/s/
Inoni Ephraim
Prime Minister and
Head of Government

Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis1
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Mark Plant and Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
and Carlos Braga and Sudhir Shetty (World Bank)
June 19, 2009
The joint IMF-World Bank low-income country debt sustainability analysis (LIC DSA)
indicates that Cameroon’s risk of debt distress remains classified as low. All external debt
ratios remain well below the policy-dependent thresholds under the baseline scenario and
the stress tests; public debt indicators also remain at comfortable levels. Strengthening debt
management practices, enhancing nonoil revenue mobilization, and widening the export base
remains advisable in light of the anticipated long-run decline of oil revenues.

Prepared by IMF and IDA staffs in collaboration with the Cameroonian authorities. The preliminary results
were presented by IMF staff during a seminar organized by the Cameroonian authorities in Yaoundé on April 2,
2009. This DSA reflects comments from government officials and follows the IMF and World Bank Staff
Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income
Countries, October 9, 2008 (available at http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4297 and
http://go.worldbank.org/JBKAT4BH40). The analysis updates the 2008 DSA (IMF Country Report for
Cameroon 08/279, available at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=22260.0 ). This DSA is
conservatively undertaken on gross (as opposed to net) basis as no data on Cameroon’s claim are available.

2
I. BACKGROUND
1.
This report updates the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) prepared in 2008
(IMF Country Report No. 08/279). The baseline scenario reflects the latest IMF Article IV
discussions with the authorities (March-April 2009). Since the 2008 DSA, Cameroon has
been adversely affected by the global crisis through lower world demand and a drop in prices
for commodities. Reduced export for timber, rubber, cotton, and aluminum products and
lower oil production and prices have adversely affected GDP growth, with a sizable effect on
both, the balance of payments and the fiscal accounts. As a result, the Cameroonian
authorities have requested Fund assistance under the Rapid Access Component of the
Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF-RAC) in an amount equivalent to 50 percent of quota
(0.6 percent of GDP). This DSA reflects these developments.
2.
The DSA is based on data provided by Cameroon’s main multilateral creditors
and by the authorities on the remaining creditors. The debt data coverage continues to
improve. It currently covers central government external debt, public-guaranteed debt, and an
annual estimate of domestic debt. Despite efforts to improve debt statistics, the coverage of
public enterprises’ liabilities, contingent liabilities of financial institutions, and overdue
claims of public enterprise and parastatal entities of the government remain uneven.
3.
Debt relief agreements with bilateral and most commercial creditors have been
finalized. To date, all bilateral agreements with Paris Club and non-Paris Club creditors have
been signed. Agreements were also finalized with most London Club commercial creditors,
whereby the stock of debt was reduced to US$1.4 million in 2008 compared to
US$91.2 million in 2007. Agreements have yet to be finalized with one bank
(US$0.5 million) and three nonbank corporations (US$0.9 million). The authorities are
making every effort to settle the outstanding debt (0.06 percent of GDP), but are
experiencing difficulties in engaging with some creditors either because of a lack of response
from them, or because they no longer exist as ongoing commercial entities.
4.
Cameroon’s debt situation has sharply improved in recent years. Its public debtto-GDP ratio declined from 51.8 percent in 2005 to 9.8 percent in 2008 (US$2.28 billion),
thanks to HIPC and MDRI relief in 2006 and prudent borrowing policies since then (Text
Table 1).2 Since the HIPC Initiative and MDRI debt relief, further decline in external debt
has reflected the following: (i) a reduction in net borrowing by public enterprises; (ii) the
settlement of most London Club commercial creditors; and (iii) valuation effects due to

2

Debt data, after the HIPC and MDRI, exclude the debt service to France under the Debt Settlement and
Development Contract (C2D).

3
changes in the exchange rate. On domestic debt, substantial repayments were also made
possible due to the use of windfall gains from higher-than-expected oil prices in 2008.3

between 2006 and 2008, the
concessionality has been slightly
lowered (from 41 percent to
39 percent), and the average interest
rate has increased (from 1.1 percent
to 1.4 percent).

II. THE DSA BASELINE SCENARIO
6.
The medium- and long-term macroeconomic framework remains broadly
unchanged relative to the previous DSA:
 The international financial crisis
and global slowdown affected
adversely several macroeconomic
variables, reflecting lower global
demand and prices for key exports.

expected to pick up over the medium
term, reflecting increased investment Sources: Cameroonian authorities; and
and structural reform implementation. 1 IMF and World Bank staffs estimates.
Previous DSA covers the period 2008-28.
The current account deficit is
projected to deteriorate over the medium term, but then gradually improve over the
longer term. Fiscal policy would be supportive of economic growth and poverty
reduction. Over the medium term the nonoil primary balance is expected to deteriorate,
reflecting the need to address considerable social and infrastructure needs. New public
borrowing is assumed to increase gradually over the medium term to help finance
infrastructure investments.

5

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario4
Against the backdrop of steady decline in oil production, the baseline annual growth, which is
expected to be driven by the nonoil sector, has been revised downward in 2009–10 to about
2½ percent (3.2 percent for the nonoil sector growth), and is expected to increase gradually to
4.2 percent by 2012 on assumptions of increased capital spending and structural reforms in the
areas of business climate, provision of public goods and infrastructure, and more efficient
public finance management. Longer-term growth is expected to average 5.2 percent for
2015-29, driven by the nonoil sectors (agriculture, mining, and service). Staff projections
include several distinct growth episodes. After an initial period of low growth in 2009-10 due to
the financial crisis impact on Cameroon, growth is expected to pick up to about 4 percent in
2011-12. Growth is then projected to accelerate further to 5½ to 6 percent in 2013-16 reflecting
the impact of envisaged structural reforms over the next 2-3 years aimed at improving
transparency, governance, access to financing and a more competitive business environment, as
well as new investment in public infrastructure, especially in transportation (including ports)
and energy sectors. After 2016, growth would decline gradually to a more moderate range of
4 to 4½ percent, reflecting declining oil production and the weakening growth impact of the
initial round of structural reform and investments projected to take place during 2010-13.
Domestic investments over the projection period are expected to be sustained by capital
inflows.
With the 2008 food and fuel crisis gradually abating, the consumer price-based inflation is
expected to ease in 2009 and hold steady at around 2 percent—assuming a slow adjustment
from the 2008 peak of over 5 percent but below the CEMAC threshold—over the medium- and
long-term, in line with recent historical trend, which is also consistent with the CEMAC
convergence criteria.
Government revenues are projected to decline over time as a result of reduced oil proceeds.
Non-oil revenues are expected to rise from about 12½ percent of GDP in 2008 to about
16 percent at the end of the projection period, reflecting sustained implementation of measures
to strengthen tax and customs administrations. Government expenditures are expected to rise
over the medium term to about 19 percent of GDP. This path is consistent with a gradual
increase in capital expenditure over the medium term, control of current spending growth, and a
rise in pro-poor spending. The latter is also assumed to be achieved by improvements in public
financial management, including expenditure allocation in priority areas.

4

Estimates and projections are in CFA francs unless otherwise indicated. The baseline is consistent with the
latest IMF World Economic Outlook assumptions and projections.

6

Box 1. (Concluded) Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario
Current account deficit, including grants, is expected to rise in 2009-16 and narrow down
gradually afterwards by 2019. Overall exports are expected to decline in 2009-10, reflecting
lower external demand. The rate of growth of the nonoil export volume (rubber, cotton,
cocoa, coffee, and timber) is projected to remain high (7.7 percent in 2011–29), offsetting
petroleum exports gradual decline. Import volumes are projected to increase (by 5.4 percent
overall and 5.1 percent for

External borrowing is expected to rise gradually to about 1.1 percent of GDP in 2009-11
(compared to an average of 0.8 percent of GDP during 2001-08). IDA borrowing is assumed
to constitute 17 percent of new borrowing per year, with the remainder originating from other
multilateral and bilateral creditors on less concessional terms. Assuming that Cameroon will
cross the IDA-only threshold in 2015, disbursements from the Bank will also be on less
concessional terms.

III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

Baseline Scenario
7.
The analysis is guided by indicative, performance-based debt burden thresholds
for external debt. The LIC debt sustainability framework (DSF) is guided by countryspecific debt burden thresholds based on the strength of a country’s policies and institutions.
These thresholds reflect the empirical findings that sustainable debt levels for a low-income
country increase with the quality of its policies and institutions. Such quality is measured by
the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index, compiled annually by the

7
World Bank. Cameroon now ranks as a ‘weak performer’ under the joint IMF/World Bank
debt sustainability framework, based on its three-year moving average CPIA score.5 The
indicative external debt burden thresholds for countries in this category are a PV of debt-toexports ratio of 100 percent, PV of debt-to-revenue ratio of 200 percent, a PV of debt-toGDP ratio of 30 percent, and debt-service-to-exports and revenues ratios of 15 and
25 percent, respectively.
8.
Cameroon ’s external debt appears sustainable. Under the baseline scenario, all
debt indicators remain below their thresholds through 2029.

are declining. The
gradual and moderate rise in the PV of debt-to-exports ratio reflects the assumption that
Cameroon’s borrowing policy will continue to be prudent.

 The baseline scenario assumes concessional external borrowing (including the ESFRAC) to help fill the financing gaps associated with the global slowdown. Repayment
could cluster in 2014 as debt contracted in 2009 and 2010 matures. Figure 3 shows that
debt service ratios would peak in 2014–15 but the debt situation would still be
manageable.

Alternative Scenario and Stress Tests
9.
Alternative scenarios and bound tests show that debt indicators remain below
their thresholds through 2029.
 In the scenario where new borrowing occurs on less concessional terms, which assumes
5

Cameroon's CPIA declined from 3.3 to 3.2 between 2005 and 2006 and remained at that level in 2007, thus
the average CPIA rating for Cameroon for the last three years is 3.25—the rating for weak performers . The
downgrade is the result of a deterioration in the following criteria: business regulatory environment; policies
and institutions for environmental sustainability; structural policy cluster; and efficiency of revenue
mobilization.

8
that the interest rate on new borrowing through 2029 is 2 percentage points higher than in
the baseline, all debt ratios do deteriorate but stay below the thresholds. Deviations from
the baseline occur as repayments cluster.
 The historical average scenario, which is associated with past current account surpluses,
is unlikely to occur, as oil production is expected to taper off in the next 20 years. This
scenario shows a more optimistic debt ratio trajectory relative to the baseline. Thus, in
terms of the risk assessment the historic scenario is irrelevant and, as such, is therefore
omitted from Figure 3.
 Bound tests, including a one-time 30 percent depreciation, lead to similar conclusions.
The scenario of real GDP at the historical average minus one standard deviation in
2010-11, which implies 0.7 percentage point above the baseline projection, suggests that
government would close the implied financing need by borrowing at similar conditions as
in the baseline. As a result, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio starts rising moderately over
time and eventually levels off. However, the scenario where exports grow at the historical
average minus one standard deviation in 2010-11, suggests a more pronounced shift in
debt burden, and the PV of external debt reaches 94 percent of GDP in 2029 (below its
threshold of 100 percent).
IV. PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY6
10.
The DSA shows that public debt sustainability will be preserved. The nonoil
primary deficit is expected to deteriorate over the medium term in support of the country’s
development needs. New borrowing will amount to about 1 percent of GDP annually during
2009-16, consistent with the country’s absorption capacity and will then gradually decline
over the long term.7 In the baseline scenario, the debt ratio will rise gradually over the
long-term. The PV of debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratios is expected to rise over time,
with some reduction in outer years. Debt service will follow a similar pattern and stay at a
comfortable level through 2029.
11.
Stress tests indicate that all debt indicators (PV of debt-to-revenue ratio, PV of
debt-to-revenue ratio, and debt service-to-revenue ratio) remain on stable paths and do not
reveal particular vulnerabilities. However, the scenario of a contingent liability shock
amounting to 10 percent of GDP shows some more sensitive debt dynamic relative to the
baseline.

The historical average scenario, which is associated with past primary surpluses, is unlikely to occur, as oil
production is expected to taper off in the next 20 years. This scenario shows a more optimistic debt ratio
trajectory relative to the baseline.

Insufficient institutional and administrative capacity has so far kept Cameroon from scaling up foreignfinanced investment above 0.5 to 1 percentage point of GDP annually.

12.
Despite its low risk of debt distress, Cameroon has stepped up efforts to
strengthen its debt management framework. Following joint Bank-Fund technical
assistance, the authorities are working to implement a new debt management strategy aligned
with CEMAC guidelines. The authorities have themselves started producing a DSA and are
formulating a medium-term debt management strategy (MTDS) for central government debt,
using the Bank-Fund toolkit.
V. CONCLUSION
13.
Cameroon’s risk of debt distress remains low. All external debt ratios remain well
below the policy-dependent thresholds. However, because of the global financial crisis and
economic slowdown, debt indicators are somewhat higher than in the 2008 DSA. Debt
indicators rise under alternative scenario and bound tests, but not beyond country-specific
debt burden thresholds, when assessing external sustainability, and remain at a comfortable
level in regards to public debt sustainability.
14.
However, persistent weakness in public finance management and insufficient
data coverage remain areas of vulnerability in Cameroon’s assessment. In particular,
these vulnerabilities refer to quasi-fiscal liabilities of state-owned enterprises and a possible
build up of new arrears since the 2005 audit, for which available information is limited. The
authorities’ efforts to improve debt management could be reinforced by steps to ensure better
coverage of public sector liabilities and by a new audit to clarify whether new domestic
arrears have emerged since 2005. In addition, continued efforts to achieve greater nonoil
revenue mobilization and to widen the export base would be advisable, given the expected
long-run decline in oil revenue.

1

Includes both public and private sector external debt.

2

Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.

3

For 2009-2014, includes mostly changes in gross foreign assets and other valuation effects and contributions from prices. Marginal changes in the outer years include also exceptional
financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.

4

Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.

5

Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.

6

Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.

7

Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3
Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4
Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5
Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6
Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV)
terms at the completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is
expressed in NPV terms at the decision point. Hence these two amounts cannot be added.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point
corresponding to interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but
not disbursed during the interim period.

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for
the assistance. Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief
to cover the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the
time the member qualifies for such debt relief.
IX.

Safeguards Assessments:

The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of the Central
African States. The most recent safeguards assessment of the BEAC was completed on
August 30, 2004. The assessment found that the Bank has implemented a number of
measures to strengthen its safeguards framework since the 2001 safeguards assessment, and
recommended further enhancements in the areas of external and internal audits, and financial
reporting. Latest monitoring results indicate the existence of certain vulnerabilities including
in the system of internal controls. These and other aspects of the BEAC safeguards
framework will be reviewed in the context of the 2008 update safeguards assessment of
BEAC that is underway.
X.

Exchange Arrangements:

Cameroon participates in a currency union with five other members of the CEMAC and has
no separate legal tender. Cameroon’s currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at the
fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per euro. Local currency equivalent: CFAF 729=SDR 1, as of
June 17, 2009. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the CEMAC
countries has been reclassified to the category of conventional pegged arrangement from the
category of exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is
based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was
based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a
definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change
in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.

5
Cameroon maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for restrictions maintained for security
reasons that have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board
decision 144-152/51.
XI.

Article IV Consultation:

The last Article IV consultation with Cameroon was concluded by the Executive Board on
June 18, 2007.
An Article IV consultation mission visited Yaoundé, Cameroon during March 26-April 9,
2009.
XII.

FSAP Participation and ROSCs:

The Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) report of May 24, 2000 is based on the

Press Release No.09/250
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 2, 2009

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves US$144.1 Million Disbursement for Cameroon
Under the Exogenous Shocks Facility
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved an SDR
92.85 million (about US$144.1 million) disbursement under the rapid access component of
the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) to help Cameroon weather the effects of the global
shocks on its balance of payments. The approval enables the disbursement of the full amount
immediately.
The IMF financial assistance will help contain the decline in Cameroon’s foreign reserves
and ensure that priority outlays (investment, health, and education) are protected.
The ESF is designed to provide policy support and financial assistance to low-income
countries facing exogenous but temporary shocks. It is available to countries eligible for the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)—the IMF's main instrument for financial
assistance to low-income countries—but that do not have a PRGF-supported program in
place. Financing terms are equivalent to a PRGF arrangement and are more concessional than
under other IMF emergency lending facilities.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion of Cameroon, Mr. John Lipsky, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Cameroonian authorities are to be commended for their recent economic achievements.
Prudent management of oil windfalls under the recently completed PRGF-supported program
has allowed the authorities to accumulate government deposits at the BEAC and contribute to
the regional pool of foreign exchange reserves. These savings now provide some welcome
buffers that can be used to alleviate the impact of the global crisis.
“The global crisis is however presenting the Cameroonian authorities with a difficult set of
challenges. Lower oil prices are reducing exports and fiscal revenues. Considerably weaker
external demand is adversely affecting key exports. Tighter external financing conditions
have delayed important investment projects. As a result of these sizable shocks, growth is
expected to be slower, and the overall fiscal and external balances are projected to turn into a

2

deficit. In the absence of appropriate social safety nets, the social costs of the downturn could
be severe.
“Against this background, the authorities’ efforts to deal with the effects of the crisis with
Fund support under the rapid access component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility are
welcome. Their commitment to preserve macroeconomic stability and tackle structural
impediments to growth will contribute to making the country’s economy more resilient in the
future.
“The implementation of the 2009 budgetary priority spending plans will help to avoid a
public sector contraction in a year of slower economic growth. At the same time, efforts will
be stepped up to achieve greater nonoil revenue mobilization and strengthen public
expenditure management and transparency. Decisive actions are needed to improve
governance, make the business environment more attractive, and enhance the role of the
financial sector in the development of the economy. The authorities’ commitment to address
these challenges through a medium-term economic program in the context of a new Poverty
Reduction Strategy under preparation is welcome. Although tackling the structural
impediments to faster growth will be more challenging in a crisis environment, it will put the
country on a stronger footing to reduce poverty in a sustainable way.
“Continued vigilance will be required against downside risks to the financial sector, which
could be negatively affected by a protracted economic slowdown. Close monitoring of
developments in cooperation with regional supervisors will help ensure that corrective
actions are taken as needed,” added Mr. Lipsky.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Cameroon
July 2, 2009
On behalf of my Cameroonian authorities, I would like to convey my appreciation to the
Executive Board and Management for their continued support to Cameroon’s efforts to
achieve sustained growth and economic development. I would also like to communicate my
authorities’ appreciation to staff for their constructive policy dialogue and fruitful exchanges
in general and their recent visit to Yaoundé in the context of Article IV Consultations in
particular.
Cameroon’s macroeconomic performance was strengthened under the last PRGF
arrangement, which was completed in January 2009. Debt relief in 2006 under the HIPC
Initiative and the MDRI, coupled with prudent borrowing policies since that year, helped
bring and maintain the country’s debt to a sustainable level and create some fiscal space for
poverty-reducing spending. Prudent fiscal policy allowed a significant building up of
government deposits and an increase in Cameroon’s international reserves at the regional
central bank (BEAC), while enabling the authorities to raise investment and normalize
relations with creditors. At the same time, thanks to appropriate fiscal measures, the
authorities have succeeded to contain the social tensions that arose last year following food
and fuel price shocks.
Despite these important achievements, Cameroon’s economy remains vulnerable to
exogenous shocks, and the current global economic crisis is now compounding these
vulnerabilities. Lower oil proceeds, reduced exports and fiscal revenues along with tighter
financing conditions are delaying important investment projects and threatens employment in
key sectors, notably forestry and agriculture. As a result, growth projections, both this year
and in the medium-term, have been revised downward; the overall fiscal balance is projected
to turn into deficit; and the current account deficit will widen and remain large over the
medium-term.
Against this background, my authorities have already taken steps to deal with the current
shock, in particular by maintaining the 2009 budgetary priority spending plans to avoid
public sector contraction in a year of declining economic growth. This crisis is emerging
barely one year after the food and oil price shocks that provoked nationwide strikes and led
to catastrophic destruction of properties. My authorities want to act early and proactively in
order to avoid a similar situation. Thus, they are requesting assistance under the Exogenous
Shocks Facility (ESF). Given the balance of payments financing needs in 2009 resulting from
the global economic crisis, my authorities are requesting a disbursement of 50 percent of
quota under the Rapid Access Component (RAC) of the ESF.

2
I. IMPACT OF THE CRISIS AND POLICY RESPONSE
Impact of the Global Economic Crisis
The global financial crisis has started to affect the Cameroonian economy and is expected to
have a greater impact going further into 2009, notably through declining commodity prices,
slower external demand for some of the country’s main export commodities (cotton,
aluminum, timber, rubber), tight financing conditions and lower remittances. As a result,
economic activity is projected to slow by 1 percentage point to 2.4 percent in 2009. The
external and fiscal position will also be affected. Absent additional financing, foreign
exchange reserves as coverage for imports would decline sharply. The medium-term
economic outlook has also been revised downward, as delays in implementing important
infrastructure projects will continue to hamper economic growth. In this context, the key
challenge facing my authorities is to address the impact of the global crisis within a
framework that maintains fiscal and external sustainability, while leaving room to boost
growth. That is why they are responding with adequate policy measures while requesting
rapid assistance under the ESF.
Policy Response
To deal with the crisis, my authorities will use fiscal space to boost the economy, while
containing the overall fiscal deficit. In this regard, they are preparing a supplementary budget
which would allow for some targeted support, a minor increase in domestic investment and a
larger allocation for the clearance of arrears, while maintaining the initially planned priority
outlays to support economic growth. In this context, my authorities intend to eliminate
subsidies on fuel prices and resume implementation of the mechanism for adjusting
petroleum prices. To protect the most vulnerable segments of the population, the authorities
will strengthen social safety nets and provide assistance to sectors in distress, particularly in
order to help small producers in the timber and cotton sectors and provide input subsidies to
the agriculture sector. Should downside risks materialize, my authorities are prepared to
consider contingent measures to ensure fiscal consolidation.
The authorities are also responding to the crisis by implementing a medium-term threepronged strategy aimed at reducing the vulnerability of the economy to exogenous shocks
while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The first pillar of this strategy consists of
stepping up efforts to increase nonoil revenue through expanding tax revenues to make up for
declining oil receipts and the upcoming reduction of external tariffs. As regards internal
revenue, the authorities will simplify tax procedures to improve compliance, tighten tax
exemptions, finalize the computer connection between the ministry of Finance and the
ministry of Forestry, and update the fiscal cadastre in order to expand the property tax base.
Concerning customs, the authorities will enhance data sharing in the electronic one-stop shop
and improve computerized systems to combat fraud. They will also strengthen the tracking
system for merchandise, in particular for imported tobacco and alcohol.
The second pillar is to improve public expenditure management, in order to achieve savings
that can be reallocated to priority outlays. In this regard, the authorities will undertake a

3
quarterly revision of the reference prices for government orders to strengthen the
effectiveness of public spending. At the same time, they will step up capital spending to
reduce the severe infrastructure bottlenecks and provide renewed impetus for growth. They
will also improve fiscal transparency by publishing the quarterly reports on budget execution
and, more broadly, by implementing the new public finance system law which introduces
more stringent accounting and control rules.
The third pillar is to develop alternative sources of domestic financing by working with
relevant regional agencies and taking measures to speed up the development of the domestic
bond market, while strengthening the debt management capacity to preserve Cameroon’s
sustainable debt profile.
II. OTHER MEDIUM-TERM REFORMS
Beyond the fiscal policies and reforms laid out above, my authorities strive to reduce
impediments to stronger growth by promoting a healthy and stable financial sector and
ensuring an investment climate conducive to the expansion of the private sector.
Financial Sector
To assure the stability of the financial sector, my authorities will continue to work with the
relevant regional authorities to strengthen surveillance of the banking system, ensure
adequate provisions against nonperforming loans, enforce corrective actions in bank
regulatory compliance where needed, and limit any potential cost to the budget. At the same
time, they intend to accelerate the implementation of measures to deepen financial
intermediation by improving credit information, setting up a court dedicated to commercial
matters and settlements, and introducing financial instruments for SMEs.
Growth-oriented Structural Reforms
My authorities are committed to stepping up efforts to accelerate economic growth. In this
vein, priority will be given to private sector development to expand and diversify the
production base, in order to help reduce the vulnerability of the economy to exogenous
shocks.
In this endeavor, the authorities have initiated dialogue with the private sector and
development partners to identify concrete measures to improve the business environment and
streamline procedures for establishing companies. The authorities are also putting emphasis
on improving governance and combating corruption, building on the progress achieved in
recent years.
My authorities are cognizant that further progress in reforming public enterprises would also
help improve the business environment. They are taking steps to clarify reform strategies in
the telecommunications and air transport sectors and prepare for a new impetus to the
privatization program once international financial conditions improve.

4
The authorities are also planning further trade liberalization efforts, in order to stimulate
economic growth. In this context, they will continue to work with their regional partners to
further liberalize intra-CEMAC trade and finalize the regional economic partnership with the
EU.
III. CONCLUSION
My Cameroonian authorities have continued to make good progress in the implementation of
reforms in spite of a difficult international environment. To pursue their structural agenda,
my Cameroonian authorities intend to move rapidly to a new PRGF arrangement articulated
around the new PRSP which is being finalized, and they have initiated discussions with other
multilateral partners for additional financing. In the meantime, Cameroon is facing
immediate financing needs due to the global economic crisis. In view of the magnitude of the
shock, the resulting balance of payments needs, my Cameroonian authorities’ commitment to
maintain sound policies going forward, coupled with the country’s capacity to repay the
Fund, I would appreciate the Board’s support to my authorities’ request for disbursement
under the Rapid Access Component of the ESF.
