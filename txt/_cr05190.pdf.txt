EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Swiss economy returned to growth in 2004 with supportive external demand and
domestic policies. However, the recovery has been fragile. With inflation projected to
remain well inside the 0-2 percent range of price stability, the Swiss National Bank has been
pursuing an accommodative monetary policy. The general government fiscal deficit was
contained to 1 percent of GDP and the federal authorities are taking further steps under the
debt-brake rule to eliminate the structural deficit at the federal level.
Growth is projected to continue in 2005, albeit at a slower pace. Staff projects growth of
1¼ percent, from 1.7 percent in 2004, with some risks still on the downside. Potential growth
is estimated at 1½ percent and is projected to decline in the medium term to ¾ percent as a
result of population aging.
The SNB can afford to be patient in withdrawing monetary stimulus. With strong
credibility helping to anchor inflation expectations and the recovery in a soft patch, the SNB
has appropriately placed monetary policy on hold. The staff recommends maintaining this
accommodative stance until the recovery gains traction.
The public finances will need to continue improving, both at the federal and other
levels, including social security. The authorities plan to eliminate the structural federal
deficit in the short run while allowing automatic stabilizers to operate along this path. They
are undertaking a review of public expenditures to reduce the size of the government for
longer-lasting savings. The proceeds from gold sales are expected mostly to be applied
toward debt reduction. The cantonal governments, in particular, need to guard against
creating new permanent expenditures with the proceeds of gold sales. The new constitutional
structure for fiscal federalism improves the allocation of tasks between the levels of
government and removes some incentives for excessive spending.
More needs to be done to address the rising pressures on the public finances from
population aging. The sustainability of the first pillar pension system and healthcare
remains to be established. There is also a need to supplement the debt-brake rule with a longrun fiscal framework encompassing all levels of government and the social security system
that includes a path for the debt-GDP ratio consistent with long-term sustainability.
The financial sector appears healthy and dynamic although underfunding continues in
some second pillar pension funds. Supervisors remain appropriately vigilant and proactive.
Further reforms need to include the uniform rating of debtors, and the shift to actuarial and
risk-based assessments of second-pillar pension schemes.
The unfinished product market reform agenda remains long and the cost of inaction is
large—placing undue pressure on fiscal policies in the context of aging. Non-tariff barriers
are widespread and, despite some progress, agricultural protection remains very high.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Switzerland is affluent but slow-growing. Switzerland has an educated labor force,
technological prowess, and a business-friendly environment. Flexible labor markets have
kept unemployment among the lowest in international comparison. And skillful monetary
management has delivered excellent inflation results (Table 1). However, the slow pace of
structural reform is eroding economic dynamism and average growth is now among the
weakest and most volatile in industrial countries (Figure 1). This is producing strains in the
public finances. Staff estimates suggest that on current policies future potential growth will
decline to below 1 percent a year, with slowing demographics and tepid productivity gains.
Per capita growth has been volatile.

The main policy challenges are boosting potential growth and developing an
intertemporally consistent strategy to manage aging. Concerned about low growth, the
authorities launched last year a reform agenda to open sheltered sectors and bolster
competition in the economy. But the preparation for aging had a setback in 2004 with the
rejection in a referendum of measures to strengthen the social security finances. More than
half of the electorate will be over 50 years of age by 2010, swelling the constituency averse
to reform.

Box 1. Implementation of Fund Policy Advice
Implementation of Fund policy advice has been mixed. The authorities’ monetary, fiscal,
and financial sector policies have been well-aligned with Fund advice. However, Fund
recommendations to accelerate structural reform have met with less success. The federal
authorities have proposed reforms, but they face complacency afforded by the (still) high
living standard, reinforced by extensive vested interests. Also, political power in Switzerland
is particularly diffused among lower levels of government and the voters tend to call
referenda on reforms.
Recent Fund advice has centered on the monetary and fiscal frameworks, namely the shift
from targeting monetary aggregates to medium-term price stability and the debt-brake rule.
The monetary policy framework is evolving along the lines suggested in consultations and is
working well. The debt-brake rule has been fine tuned to allow greater cyclical
responsiveness. While the authorities’ efforts to restore balance in the federal finances have
been in line with Fund advice, important challenges remain in addressing aging-related
pressures. Also, strengthening competition in domestic markets through opening up sheltered
sectors remains a recurring and difficult theme.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: A MODERATE RECOVERY
3.
The economy has pulled out of recession, but the recovery is fragile and
dependent on external demand. A moderate recovery has been in place since mid-2003,
initiated by supportive monetary and fiscal policies, and growing external demand. In 2004,
investment and construction benefited from improving prospects and low interest rates, while
a soft labor market and rising energy costs held back household consumption. However, an
unexpected dip in investment contributed to a contraction of GDP in the last quarter. For the
year as whole, real GDP expanded by 1.7 percent, narrowing the output gap to 1 percent. In
early 2005, business indicators continued to be relatively weak (Figures 2 and 3).

The return to growth has not yet improved labor market conditions.
Employment was flat as enterprises improved productivity before stepping up hiring. In
manufacturing, which is more exposed to international competition, employment declined
(Figure 4). Simultaneously, labor supply growth was muted by workers moving into training
and retirement. As a result, unemployment rose to 3.9 percent in 2004.

Inflation remained low, the oil shock notwithstanding. In early 2005, headline CPI
inflation picked up to 1.4 percent and core inflation rose from ¼ to 1 percent (Figure 5).
Second-round effects have been virtually absent. Average wages rose by 0.9 percent in 2004
and are likely to increase by around 1¼ percent in 2005.
6.
Monetary conditions remained expansionary. With activity picking up in early
2004, the SNB raised the three-month policy rate in June and September 2004 by 25 basis
points each after having kept it historically low at 0.25 percent for more than a year. Still, the
three-month rate remained negative in real terms. Since markets remain confident about
inflation, long-term interest rates hardly moved (Figure 6). The rapid monetary growth of
previous years subsided—as shifting into liquidity ran its course—and credit expansion was
tame with increasing credit to households tempered by declining credit to enterprises
(Figure 7). Equity prices improved to 30 percent below their peak of end-2000, in line with
other markets. Average real estate prices remained subdued (Figure 8).
7.
The Swiss franc strengthened, removing some monetary stimulus. Since end2003, the franc has appreciated by 3.7 percent in real effective terms and by 1.2 percent in
nominal terms, reflecting an appreciation vis-à-vis the US dollar (the franc-euro rate
remained stable). The franc is now close to its long-term upward trend.1

Fiscal policy was slightly restrictive. The federal government deficit was below
budget because of tax buoyancy and lower interest payments. Subnational governments also
consolidated their finances. The general government deficit is estimated to have narrowed to
1 percent of GDP in 2004, despite some widening of the social security deficit (Tables 2
and 3).

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
10.
The consultations focused on the costs of inaction in bolstering long-term
growth, the need for sustained fiscal adjustment, and the appropriate current policy
stance. Staff estimates suggest that future potential growth will trend to below 1 percent a
year, driven by demographics, declining average hours worked and low TFP growth.
Moreover, absent measures, the public deficit would gradually rise to unsustainable levels.
Against this background of slow growth and challenging public finances, the discussions
focused on the need to accelerate product and labor market reforms, recalibrate the long-run
social security finances, and fine-tune the “debt brake” to anchor better the public debt. The
discussions addressed also the pace and timing of the withdrawal of the monetary stimulus
and progress in the adjustment of the financial sector. There was substantial agreement on
the general direction of policies, with the authorities striving to build consensus on steps to
bolster the social security accounts and to implement structural reforms.

A. Short-Run Outlook
11.
The authorities, staff, and private forecasters shared similar views on the shortrun outlook. The staff was cautiously optimistic that the easing of growth in late 2004
reflected a temporary soft patch that would be overcome in the course of 2005 with a
renewed pick up in external demand (as in the WEO), and continued support from monetary
policy. With improving corporate balance sheets and enterprise profitability, staff did not see
major domestic imbalances to hold back the recovery. However, because the carry-over in
growth from 2004 was weak, average growth would be somewhat lower at 1¼ percent in
2005, with activity gaining strength in the second half. The authorities were more sanguine
about domestic demand and projected growth at 1½ percent.
12.
The outlook is cautious, but there remain some downside risks. So far in 2005,
indications of an upturn are weak and the projections for euro area growth (comprising 60
percent of Swiss exports) are being trimmed. Moreover, the authorities noted that
Switzerland could be adversely affected if global imbalances were to unwind suddenly,
triggering a safe-haven appreciation of the franc. Also, corrections in international financial
markets could strain Switzerland’s important financial sector. Persistently high oil prices also
pose risks for Switzerland, despite its low oil dependency, because they could reduce further
partner countries’ growth.3

3

Switzerland is less dependent on oil than many industrial countries due to greater reliance
on alternative power and active energy conservation policies. Nevertheless, the SNB
estimated that a 40 percent increase in crude oil prices for a three year period would lower
growth by 0.4 percentage points and add 0.6 percentage points to prices.

13.
Inflation is projected to remain below 2 percent through 2006. This favorable
outlook reflects the SNB’s strong credibility, which has firmly anchored expectations, and
flexible labor markets, which reduces second-round effects.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy: Supporting the Recovery
14.
Monetary policy is applied pragmatically. With inflation projected to remain
moderate through 2006, even at the current very low interest rates, the SNB has maintained
its accommodative policy stance. On indications that activity eased again toward end-2004
and with the appreciating franc already slightly tightening monetary conditions, the SNB
paused raising the policy interest rate. Staff agreed that the lifting of the policy rate through
mid-2004 was opportune. This did not inhibit activity, but provided a useful signal of leaning
against the wind of oil prices—thus helping to anchor expectations. Also, the move created
some room for policy maneuver downward if that were necessary.
15.
The staff saw room for continued patience with policy rates until the recovery
regained traction. Patience was warranted by the negative output gap and the absence of
price pressures. The lagged effects from the appreciation of the franc would already
withdraw some stimulus. The SNB agreed, but would remain vigilant for signs of price
pressures. In its quarterly assessment of monetary policy in March, it left the policy rate
unchanged.

16.
Looking further out, the SNB and the staff agreed that further withdrawals of
monetary stimulus would be needed at some point. Real interest rates have been well
below neutral levels for two years and, until recently, broad money had been growing
rapidly. Given that monetary policy operates with long lags, the authorities were mindful of
the risks associated with unduly delaying a return to more neutral policies. Staff agreed that
the question was not whether monetary policy should move to a more neutral rate eventually,
but rather about the timing of this move. Markets expect little tightening in 2005.

17.
The authorities noted some concern about spillovers from global current
account imbalances. A rapid exchange rate appreciation of the franc against the U.S. dollar
could take inflation toward negative territory. With current low interest rates, the SNB would
have little room for maneuver and would include in its options some foreign exchange
intervention.

- 22 -

18.
On the exchange rate, the authorities shared the staff assessment that a gradual
appreciation of the franc along its long-run trend could continue. Staff estimates suggest
that the franc might be slightly undervalued, based on the macroeconomic balance approach,
fundamental equilibrium approach and panel estimates of purchasing power parity—adjusted
for factors such as terms of trade and net factor income. While the long-run trend
appreciation has resulted in a decline in manufacturers export market shares, this
development has been offset by improving terms of trade as Swiss firms increasingly focus
on high value-added markets. The trend appreciation was also seen as beneficial to the Swiss
financial sector. Lastly, the high domestic price level (compared to the EU) reflected weak
competition in sheltered sectors, for which the solution remained product market reform,
rather than depreciation.
19.
Private sector representatives commended the SNB’s communication strategy
and were supportive of the monetary policy framework. They valued the open
communications policy which avoided surprises on interest rate decisions. To fine-tune this
strategy, the SNB had started releasing quarterly its 3-year ahead inflation forecast together
with an assessment of monetary conditions. Moreover, to enhance public accountability, as
stipulated in the new National Bank Act, the SNB had started submitting to parliament an
annual report on the fulfillment of its tasks. Staff agreed that the monetary policy framework
was working well,4 having delivered average inflation of 0.9 percent since its inception in
2000 while steering clear of deflation, and thereby maintained strong credibility.
C. Fiscal Policy: Restoring Balance and Addressing Long-Term Challenges
20.
The public finances are managed carefully, but longer-term strains are
nevertheless visible. The general government deficit in 2004 was moderate and consistent
with approximate short-run stability in the debt ratio. However, strains are building up in the
pension and healthcare systems, which in recent years were running a combined deficit
(before budgetary subsidies) of over 5 percent of GDP. With unchanged policies, the
impending demographic shift and unabated rise in healthcare spending are projected to widen
the fiscal deficit, even increasing the public debt to unsustainable levels over the
medium-term—as shown in the extended debt sustainability analysis until 2060 in the
accompanying Selected Issues. The authorities explained that a public consensus how to
address these long-term fiscal challenges was still lacking, and that recent efforts to raise the
retirement age and increase the VAT rate to finance social security had been rejected in a
referendum.

4

The framework aims to keep the headline CPI inflation over a three year horizon “below
2 percent but positive”. Within this objective, the SNB calibrates its policy to avoid
disruptive exchange rate variations and a large degree of economic slack.

21.

The federal government is leading fiscal adjustment:

•

Federal fiscal policy was guided by the debt-brake rule.5 The authorities’ objective is to
eliminate the recent federal structural deficit in the short run, while allowing automatic
stabilizers to operate around this path. They had introduced two expenditure-based
consolidation programs (Entlastungsprogramme 2003 and 2004)—the second is now
passing through the legislature—based on slowing annual expenditure growth to
1.5 percent (slightly below nominal GDP growth).

•

The subnational governments had achieved consolidation in 2004 as well, but were
expected to spend a share of gold sales in 2005-06 (see below), and were facing
increasing spending pressures on health care. In additional, some measures may be
needed to offset spillovers from consolidation at the federal level.

5

The debt-brake rule requires the federal accounts to be in balance after adjusting for the
business cycle. Expenditure is set equal to projected cyclically-adjusted revenue.
Unanticipated deficits must be reversed in the following years. The debt-brake rule can be
relaxed in exceptional circumstances by a majority in both chambers of parliament.

- 24 -

22.
An important event in 2005 is the transfer to the government of 4.6 percent of
GDP in proceeds from SNB gold sales.6 The government decided that ⅓ of these proceeds
will be transferred to the federal government and ⅔ to the cantons. The staff strongly urged
the authorities to apply these amounts to debt reduction. The federal authorities indicated
their intention to do so, and they projected that cantons would use 80-85 percent of their
allocation for debt reduction as well. However, they underscored that they could not force the
cantons to do so. The staff agreed with the SNB that the gold sale is a one-time event that
reduces future SNB profit distributions, and that the proceeds should therefore be saved.

The authorities felt that risks to the medium-term fiscal outlook were
manageable. Staff cautioned that competition from other financial centers could erode
withholding taxes and stamp duties and that the current level of profit distribution from the
SNB would decline in future. The authorities acknowledged some pressures on financial (and
corporate) taxes and indicated that revenue losses would need to be compensated with

Between May 2000 and March 2005, and in coordination with other central banks, the SNB
sold 1,300 tons of gold. The SNB still holds 1,290 tons of gold, corresponding to ⅓ of its
foreign exchange reserves. There is no intention to reduce gold holdings further.

expenditure cuts. In a broader context, they noted that while the debt brake rule had been
very valuable as a guide for fiscal policy, the accompanying annual adjustment programs
were beginning to cause adjustment fatigue, and thus they were searching for structural
longer-lasting solutions to deficit pressures in an expenditure review for the federal
government.

The authorities shared the staff’s concerns regarding long-run fiscal pressures
from population aging. Switzerland’s old-age dependency ratio is projected to increase by
16 percentage points over the next thirty years and, under current policies, this puts the first
pillar of the pension system and the health care system (Box 2) on a path of sharply rising
deficits. Staff estimated the net present value of future liabilities of these programs at 180
percent of GDP, roughly the equivalent of a 7½ percentage point hike in the VAT. Cognizant
of these problems, the authorities were reviewing social security entitlements and had begun
to frame proposals to strengthen the finances of disability insurance.
25.
Officials agreed that long-term fiscal sustainability required a coordinated
strategy, embracing fiscal consolidation and reforms. Staff noted that the financing gap of
social security was too large to be closed by fiscal consolidation alone, especially since tax
increases could worsen distortions and adversely affect Switzerland’s already slow output
growth. On their part, the authorities felt that a potential rise in the retirement age would
need to be accompanied by the creation of work opportunities for older workers. There was
agreement that a viable strategy would involve a balanced mixture of pension and healthcare
reforms to reduce social security deficits; product market reforms to raise output and
employment growth; and expenditure-based fiscal consolidation to close any remaining gap.
In this regard, staff saw the need to aim fiscal policies at a downward path for the public
debt-to-GDP ratio beyond 2007. Staff also recommended the publication of comprehensive
periodic reports on the long-run sustainability of the public finances as a policy guide and to
improve public awareness and catalyze reform.

Box 2. The Challenge of Healthcare Costs1

High prices rather than large quantities
characterize the Swiss health sector, which
suggests distortions on the supply side. In
particular, the system suffers from regional
fragmentation with small units, financial
fragmentation, supply-pushed demand in
medications and treatments, and insufficient
competition.
Switzerland’s health care system is financed
largely by the private sector, much in contrast
to the rest of Europe. High growth in insurance
premia and out-of-pocket payments have a
regressive effect on income distribution, which
the government tries to counter by subsidizing
low-income households. This strategy has the
virtue of keeping non-wage labor costs low.

Swiss health cost are second highest in OECD.
Switzerland's rank in the OECD

Switzerland has become the second most
expensive country for health care in the
world. The ratio of health costs to GDP was
11.5 percent in 2003--more than double its
level in 1970. In real per-capita terms, health
expenditures grew by 3 percent per year.

However, because there is little cost control,
healthcare subsidies in the public finances
could grow rapidly in the future. Staff
calculations show that on present trends, the
share of subsidized households would rise from
34 now to over 60 percent in 2015 and
90 percent in 2050.

Proposals for overhauling Switzerland’s system of intergovernmental fiscal
relations were accepted in a referendum (Box 3). The staff shared the authorities’ view
that this reform has strengthened fiscal federal relations. Key elements were the improved
assignment of tasks and responsibilities between federal and subnational governments, and
improved inter-regional equity. The reform also sharply reduced perverse spending
incentives for poor cantons. Nevertheless, staff noted that, given the pronounced autonomy
of the cantons in the Swiss federal system, and the relatively small size of the federal
government (representing less than ⅓ of general government spending), it will remain
difficult for Switzerland to run a coordinated fiscal policy stance unless the cooperation
between federal and cantonal governments is further strengthened.
D. Financial Sector Stability
27.
The authorities underscored that the banking sector remained resilient,
adequately capitalized, and dynamic. In 2004, bank profitability has risen helped by cost
cuts and consolidation. Balance sheets have strengthened further (Tables 5-8, Figure 9). Low
interest rates have stimulated a rapid mortgage lending to households but supervisors’
simulations suggest that a rise in interest rates would not impair households’ ability to
service debts as loan-to-value ratios were moderate and price increases in the real estate
market had remained subdued. Lending to enterprises has been declining for several years.
Supply has declined as banks have tightened lending practices and introduced risk-based
interest rates, thereby increasing the intermediation spread. Demand has also moderated due
to lower investment and enterprises’ efforts to strengthen their balance sheets. The overall
decline has been mitigated by increased lending from regional banks, which does not appear
to have compromised their lending standards.
...and the shares of collateralized loans
has been rising.

Box 3. The New Financial Equalization Scheme (NFA)
In Switzerland, subnational governments enjoy a great degree of autonomy. The central
government is responsible mainly for foreign policy, defense, pensions, postal,
telecommunications and railways services and the currency. All other responsibilities are
handled by the cantons, in particular economic regulation, education, healthcare, and most of
the judiciary.
Regional autonomy coupled with
a mountainous topography has
led to large income disparities.
Most of Switzerland’s GDP is
produced in the prosperous
lowland cantons and differences in
cantonal tax revenue per capita
exceed a factor of 2.

The subsidies are often linked to
infrastructure projects, with the federal government contributing inversely to a canton’s income
level. This obscures the amount of regional transfers and creates incentives for poor cantons to
inflate the number of eligible subsidized projects.

The NFA (Neuer Finanzausgleich) will replace project subsidies by simple grants. The
grants take into account cantonal per-capita tax revenues and the extent of mountainous areas.
This will make the budget more transparent, as regional subsidies show up as individual items.
Expenditures should also decline with fewer incentives for unnecessary projects.
The NFA defines better cantonal and federal tasks. It envisages a broad-based shift from
joint financing towards a clear division of labor. Old age pensions, disability insurance,
military expenses, and interstate highways would be financed exclusively by the federal
government. Health care and airports would fall under the responsibility of the cantons. Also,
cantons would be encouraged to cooperate in areas with large economies of scale, such as
specialized medicine and universities.
Full implementation of the NFA will take another four years. In November 2004, a
referendum approved the necessary constitutional changes. Specific laws are planned to be
passed by parliament in 2006-07, and—if accepted in referenda—implemented in 2008-09.

28.
Supervisors viewed the capital base of the banking system as robust. Stress tests
suggested that internationally active banks were exposed to a depreciation of the dollar and a
correction in the US real estate market. For all banks, a domestic economic downturn and
stronger than anticipated interest rate increases were potential sources of stress. The tendency
of some institutions to increase their risk profile in search for yield was being monitored
closely.
29.
The authorities noted that financial conditions in the insurance sector had
improved with the recovery of global capital markets and cost cuts, but some
weaknesses remained. Among nonlife insurers, profitability had increased, reflecting better
underwriting performance and higher premia. Among life insurers, profitability had also
improved. However, low interest rates on assets vis-à-vis regulatory minimum guaranteed
returns on life insurance policies limited progress. The authorities saw scope for further
consolidation in the insurance sector. Risk management was being strengthened with a new
risk-based capital adequacy regime that anticipates the requirements of the EU Solvency II
framework.
30.
Despite improvement, underfunding remained a problem in second pillar
pension funds. In 2003, 12 percent of the funds were underfunded, with a total shortfall
equivalent to 6 percent of GDP. Some additional progress was made in 2004, helped by
higher equity prices and a reduction in the regulatory minimum return on assets. In addition,
undercapitalized funds were allowed to reduce further the return on assets and levy
supplementary contributions, including from pensioners. A number of pension funds reduced
the discount rate used to determine the present value of pension liabilities, providing a more
realistic measure of underfunding. Finally, parliament approved the gradual reduction from
7.2 to 6.8 percent of the rate at which accumulated savings are converted into annuities (thus
recognizing longer life spans) and requiring more transparent accounting standards for
pension liabilities. Further reforms were underway to harmonize supervision across cantons.
The authorities agreed that the supervisory system would benefit from a shift of emphasis
towards actuarial and risk-based assessments.
31.
The authorities highlighted progress toward strengthening the supervisory
framework. On July 1, 2004, the revised Banking Act was put into force, harmonizing under
the sole responsibility of the Swiss Federal Banking Commission the supervision,
reorganization and liquidation of banks. Officials reaffirmed their intention to make the
Financial Market Supervision Authority (FINMA) operational by the beginning of 2007.
They considered extending supervision to independent asset managers, brokers and foreign
exchange dealers, and improving coordination with the supervision of second pillar pension
funds, which remained separate. As from 2005, external auditors of banks and brokers were
required to prepare risk analysis/audit reports. The parliament adopted the revised Insurance
Supervision Act, which moved to risk-based supervision and aligned Swiss legislation with
EU directives. To implement the revised FATF recommendations, the authorities were
preparing amendments to the Money Laundering Act to extend its application to professions

- 31 -

and activities outside the financial sector, and improve the transparency of owners of bearer
shares. An evaluation by FATF was scheduled for 2005.
E. Structural Issues: Invigorating Growth
32.
The authorities agreed that improving Switzerland’s growth performance
remains a priority. Slow growth performance in the past quarter century has been eroding
Switzerland’s standing in terms of per capita GDP (Figure 10). Adjusting for terms-of-trade
gains and income from investments abroad reduces but does not eliminate the “growth
deficit”. The authorities acknowledged that multifactor productivity growth has been among
the lowest in industrial countries and, with the participation rate already high and working
age population set to decline, policies to spur productivity growth would be key to improving
growth performance. Earlier staff research suggested that reforms could add ½ percentage
points to growth7 and, more recently, the OECD has estimated similar effects from the
opening up of the health, agriculture, electricity, and gas sectors. These findings demonstrate
the high costs that are being incurred by the difficulties to implement far-reaching reforms
(Box 4).

Box 4. The Political Economy of Reform
The Swiss system of direct democracy is
strong and far-reaching. Voters can
challenge almost any legislation in
referenda, including structural reforms and
other policies. As voters can overrule
parliament, consensus is important. For this
reason, the federal government has included
the four main parties since 1959 and all law
proposals go through extensive public
consultation. However, laws may still be
rejected in a referendum if the electorate is
polarized, which has happened with some
frequency.

As a result, Swiss fiscal policy has been
procyclical. Fiscal adjustment occurred
mostly during recessions, and slippages
during booms. The recently introduced
debt-brake rule is an attempt to break this
pattern and, so far, the results are
encouraging. For the first time in decades
fiscal adjustment is taking place during an
upturn.

Structural reforms are hampered by a
status-quo bias, but can succeed under high economic pressure. The many checks and
balances make structural reforms difficult to pass and favor incremental progress. Nevertheless,
under pressure the system is able to change, and the prolonged recession in the mid-1990s
facilitated significant reforms. The recent recovery has once again slowed the reform
momentum.

33.
The authorities highlighted steps to implement their strategy for structural
reform. A growth package was adopted last year aiming at opening up sheltered sectors,
intensifying external economic relations, reducing the role of the state, raising further labor
market participation, and improving the education system. In this context, the authorities
prepared:
•

An amendment to the Internal Market Law that, if adopted, would (i) significantly
reduce the ability of cantons to impede cross-border supply of services and, (ii) empower
the Competition Authority to challenge at the Federal Court cantonal and local
governments’ rules and regulations that constitute barriers to market entry.

•

A bill for the liberalization of the electricity market in two steps. Commercial
consumers would be able to choose their supplier starting in 2007, and the rest five years
later. A previous liberalization effort was rejected in a referendum in 2002.

Staff welcomed these reforms and urged the authorities to supplement them with stronger
efforts to eliminate ubiquitous nontariff barriers for a host of services and products.
34.
The authorities negotiated some important bilateral agreements with the EU.
Membership in the EU is not on the horizon at the moment, but deepening commercial and
security ties are seen as effective instruments to foster reforms. A first package of bilateral
agreements, including the free movement of labor, took effect in June 2002. Their extension
to the new EU members, with transitional safeguards, has now been approved subject to a
referendum scheduled for September. A second package of agreements—including the EU
savings directive and associate Schengen membership—was signed in October 2004, and a
referendum on Schengen membership is scheduled for June.
35.
The Swiss labor market is quite flexible and not considered a main source of
distortions. Employment and participation ratios are at the top among OECD countries,
unionization is low, employment legislation is flexible, and active labor market policies
relatively effective (Figure 11). The opening up of the labor market vis-à-vis the EU could
attract skilled labor, which in previous upswings had been a drag on growth.8 Moreover, the
extension of free labor mobility to the new EU members could help to ameliorate the effects
of population aging.

8

The agreement stipulates the complete opening of the labor market by 2007 for existing EU
members and the gradual opening by 2011 for the new EU member countries. Switzerland
could impose restrictions until 2014 in case of a disruptive influx.

- 35 -

F. Other Issues
36.
Very high agriculture protection remains a notable feature of the Swiss trade
regime. Switzerland has the second highest level of export subsidies in the world.9 The
marginal tariff for some agricultural products is 700 percent and direct producer support
exceeds the value added of agricultural production. While price support is being dismantled
in favor of direct payments, staff noted that it would take years at the current pace before
protection dropped even to the high EU level. At the same time, the authorities
acknowledged that the public has been increasingly questioning the very high price level in
Switzerland relative to neighbors, for food products in particular.
ODA is about average.

Agricultural subsidies are very high.

countries.
38.
Despite welcome improvement, deficiencies remain in the quality and coverage of
economic statistics (Appendix II). The authorities explained that the pace of improvements
in this area is determined by budgetary constraints.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
The Swiss economy is wealthy and has a robust external sector, flexible labor
markets, and sound monetary and fiscal policy frameworks; however, some strains are
showing as a result of sustained slow growth. The public finances are difficult to manage
in a slow-growth environment, and the debt ratio is no longer low. In addition, efforts by the
authorities to advance structural reforms to boost growth have met with limited success.
While growth may not be a cure-all, a more dynamic output performance would appear
necessary to manage the challenges from aging and mitigate the burden on fiscal
adjustment—but building a consensus around such policies has proven difficult.
40.
Economic growth in 2005 is projected to continue, albeit at a slower pace.
Weaker demand in the euro area and the U.S. dollar depreciation have dented the modest
recovery. External factors are projected to improve again as the year unfolds but there remain
some downside risks to the outlook: persistent euro-area softness, higher oil prices, and
potential for a disorderly adjustment of international imbalances with especially marked
repercussions for a traditional safe-haven country. Inflation is expected to remain low,
despite higher oil prices.
41.
The SNB can afford to be patient with monetary policy. The Bank raised policy
interest rates slightly in the course of 2004 as economic activity accelerated. As the economy
hit a soft patch, monetary policy was appropriately placed on hold again and should remain
so until the recovery firms up. Inflation expectations are well anchored, with strong SNB
credibility, and inflation is projected to remain inside the price stability range until 2006,
underpinning the case for a continued accommodative stance.
42.
The monetary policy framework is working well and the SNB’s communications
strategy has been fine-tuned. The publication of quarterly monetary reports and inflation
forecasts is welcome.
43.
The franc’s gradual appreciation reflects a fundamental longer-term trend. This
trend has not been a drag on the external current account with manufacturers producing
higher value-added exports, the international financial system benefiting from the strong
currency, and net factor income being persistently very high.
44.
Public finances were stronger than expected in 2004, and need to continue
improving in the medium term. The objective to eliminate the federal government
structural deficit is well placed. Low average real GDP growth and mounting pressure on
social security require fiscal prudence. In this regard, the conduct of fiscal policy could
benefit from an in-depth analysis of the key public sector tasks, focusing resources on
priority activities and aiming at lasting structural adjustment. In an increasingly globalized
environment, the emphasis of fiscal adjustment will need to be on reducing expenditures.
45.
The proceeds from SNB gold sales are one-time flows and should be used to
reduce debt. Being a temporary source of income, the sales should not be used for
expenditure or for delaying reforms, which would make future fiscal adjustment more

- 38 -

difficult. The federal government’s decision to use the proceeds from the gold sales for debt
reduction is welcome, and should be replicated by the cantons.
46.
A considerable task remains to ensure the sustainability and efficiency of the
pension and healthcare systems. The affordability of first-pillar pension entitlements needs
to be reevaluated; parameters such as the retirement age and the replacement rate need to be
recalibrated as well as the roles of and relation between the first and second pension pillars.
In healthcare, the main challenge is to contain costs by using economies of scale and
encouraging competition for providers and pharmaceuticals.
47.
A multi-year fiscal framework is needed to ensure the intertemporal consistency
of policies to address population aging. It should encompass all levels of government,
including social security, stipulate a path for the public debt-to-GDP ratio consistent with
long-term fiscal sustainability, and include provisions for fiscal policy coordination among
the various levels of government. Representing less than one-third of general government
expenditure, the federal government is ill-equipped to face these tasks on its own.
48.
A significant effort will have to be made to impress upon the public the need for
such a long-run fiscal strategy. This requires putting the analytical issues in the public
debate, including a discussion of burden sharing. Fiscal consolidation is not a substitute for
reforms, and options will need to include different mixtures of revenue increases,
expenditure cuts, entitlement rationalization (keeping in mind the need to protect the most
vulnerable members of society), and structural reforms to bolster growth. The regular
publication of fiscal sustainability reports could enhance public awareness that delays in
addressing these challenges are likely to make the solution more painful.
49.
The new constitutional structure for fiscal federalism is welcome. It achieves a
better assignment of tasks between the levels of government and removes some incentives
for spending. This strengthens accountability and efficiency.
50.
The financial system appears to be generally healthy and dynamic, but
supervisors’ continued vigilance is important given the large size of this sector in the
economy. While banks are comfortably capitalized, they run some risks—especially if global
imbalances were to unwind suddenly and financial asset prices were to fall sharply. In the
domestic economy, lending to households has been strong, mainly for mortgages, but without
signs of pressure on real estate prices so far. The authorities’ proactive attitude in supervision
is commendable but efforts to bolster further the quality of external audits and facilitate
uniform assessments of debtors would be welcome. The switch to risk-based supervision
should bring considerable benefits to insurance.
51.
The second-pillar pension plans continue to show some strains which deserve
attention. It would be important to align the annuity conversion rate with its actuarially
neutral value, and the discount rate with market interest rates. If market interest rates stay
low, the regulatory minimum interest rate may need to be brought down further. In
supervision, the plans to harmonize standards across cantons are welcome and need to be

- 39 -

supplemented by a shift to actuarial assessments and a more timely disclosure of financial
statements.
52.
Additional resources need to be allocated to the improvement of economic
statistics. Although some welcome progress has been made, gaps, deficiencies and delays
remain that affect economic analysis and management.
53.
The authorities are encouraged to lower the levels of agricultural tariff and nontariff protection. Switzerland has well-targeted programs for ODA, but the poorest
countries would be greatly assisted also by efforts to eliminate trade barriers, including those
in agriculture under the Doha trade round.
54.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Switzerland be held on
the standard twelve-month cycle.

The Swiss National Bank does not maintain margins in respect of exchange transactions.
However, the Swiss National Bank has intervened when warranted by the circumstances.
Switzerland's exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. However, in accordance with UN Security
Council resolutions, Switzerland has frozen the financial assets and economic
resources of persons and entities associated with the Taliban, Osama bin Laden and Al
Qaeda, as well as those of the former regimes in Iraq and Liberia. Furthermore,
in accordance with identical measures taken by the European Union, Switzerland has
frozen the financial assets and economic resources of certain persons related to the former
regime in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as those of certain persons with
important government functions in Myanmar and Zimbabwe. In addition to the asset
freeze, the Swiss regulations usually also include a prohibition to make available to the
targeted persons or entities, directly or indirectly, financial assets or economic resources.
These restrictions have been notified to the Fund.

APPENDIX II

Switzerland: Statistical Issues
Switzerland publishes timely economic statistics and posts most of the data and the
underlying documentation on the internet. Switzerland is in full compliance with the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and its metadata are currently posted on the
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. However, a number of statistical gaps and
deficiencies remain, mainly reflecting a lack of resources and the limited authority of the
Federal Statistical Office (BfS) to request information:
•

the SNB does not compile a monetary survey;

•

wage statistics are available only on an annual basis;

•

reliable general government finance statistics appear with considerable lags, mainly due
to delays in compiling fiscal accounts at the level of cantons and communes;

•

internationally comparable fiscal statistics on an accrual basis are not available;

•

pension statistics are published with a long lag;

•

GDP by industry appears with considerable lag;

•

capital stock data and flow-of-funds statistics are not yet available.

•

The data on deposit money banks submitted by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to STA
for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS) lack adequate sectorization and
instrument breakdown. Adoption by the authorities of the Standardized Report Forms by
the authorities for reporting monetary data to STA will enhance the analytical usefulness
of the data.

To address statistical deficiencies, the authorities have recently taken or intend to take the
following steps:
The SNB launched in 2004 a monthly survey on the cost of borrowing and expected the
pilot phase to be completed by mid-2005. In Q3 2005, the SNB will introduce revised and
more comprehensive statistics on mutual funds. In October 2005 the SNB will publish, in
collaboration with the Federal Statistical Office, annual financial accounts for 1999-2003
(stock data only). Data for 2004 and flows will be published in the spring 2006.
Annual national accounts were upgraded in 2003 to the European System of Accounts 1995
(ESA95) and with the release of the Q4 2004 data, the Secretariat for Economics (SECO)
revised accordingly its quarterly national account estimates. In this connection, has started
also compiling a quarterly production account. The main innovations in the new national
accounts were in investment (which now provides detail on ICT), private and public
consumption (where hospitals were transferred to the private sector), and the use of chain
price indices (but without adjustment for quality).

- 50 -

APPENDIX II

In 2004, a statistical cooperation agreement was concluded with the European Union as
part of Bilateral II that will lead to the harmonization of several Swiss statistics with EU
standards.
The Federal Finance Administration has started preparations for revamping fiscal statistics
with the adoption of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 classification, the
reform of the accounting standards for cantons and communes (Weiterentwicklung der
Rechnungslegung der Kantone und Gemeinden) and the introduction of full accrual
budgeting and accounting at the level of the federal government (Neues Rechnungsmodell
Bund) along the lines of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).
Figures according to the new accounting standards are expected in 2008. In the interim,
government finance statistics for publication in the GFS Yearbook will be reported on a cash
basis but presented in the GFSM 2001 framework.
Balance of payments and international investment position data are compiled by the SNB
and meet international standards.

Statement by Fritz Zurbrügg, Executive Director for Switzerland
June 6, 2005

1.
On behalf of my Swiss authorities, I would like to thank staff for the constructive
policy discussions and the well written and comprehensive staff reports. They contain a very
accurate description of the economic situation, particularly of the main policy challenges in
the long run. My authorities largely agree with staff’s appraisal and welcome the appropriate
policy recommendations. They also welcome the shift of focus towards long-term issues and
are looking forward to similar analyses for other “mature” economy countries – large and
small.
2.
After a GDP growth rate of 1.7 percent over the whole year of 2004, the recovery of
the Swiss economy experienced a slight slowdown. Year-on-year growth in the fourth
quarter of 2004 was 1.2 percent and slowed to 0.7 percent in the first quarter of 2005.
However, compared to the last quarter, GDP growth recovered somewhat from a slightly
negative number to zero. Consumer demand strengthened further by 0.2 percent, while
investment was now able to hold its level. Exports decelerated by 1 percent (quarter-toquarter) from a high level and imports came down slightly more (1.1 percent). In April 2005,
the unemployment rate fell to 3.8 percent. The index of consumer sentiment remains
unchanged since January 2005, suggesting a possible decrease in the GDP growth rate for
2005.
3.
Downside risks mainly stem from Switzerland’s trading partners’ growth and from oil
prices. Lower than expected growth in the EU combined with high oil prices could have
unpleasant consequences for the Swiss economy.
Monetary policy
4.
Staff’s analysis of monetary conditions and monetary policy coincides with the view
of the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Monetary policy is still supporting the recovery despite
two rises in the short-term interest rate of 25 basis points. This was after the 3-months CHF
Libor had been kept at a historically low level of 0.25 percent for more than a year. However,
the fact that the current level of 0.75 percent remains negative in real terms indicates that the
current situation is not a steady-state equilibrium and cannot be maintained indefinitely
without threatening price stability in the medium-term, as shown by the SNB’s inflation
forecast.
5.
My monetary authorities welcome the fact that staff judged the lifting of the policy
rate through mid-2004 as appropriate. The SNB also agrees with staff’s analysis that the
main question will not be whether monetary policy should move to a more neutral rate, but
rather about the timing of this move. However, even though markets expect little tightening
in 2005, the SNB is more cautious than staff regarding the room for continued patience with
a further adjustment of the policy rate. Waiting until recovery regains traction may be
equivalent to waiting too long. It is true that the still negative output gap and well-anchored
price expectations will ensure the absence of price pressures for the time being. Nonetheless,

-2considering the particularly long transmission lag of monetary policy impulses to the real
economy and to prices in Switzerland, the room for continued patience concerning the timing
of the interest rate move of up to a more neutral level – particularly in a context of a
relatively strong rally of the dollar since the beginning of 2005 – might be somewhat smaller
than suggested by staff.
6.
The SNB welcomes staff’s support for its monetary policy framework and
communication strategy. Indeed, the communication strategy should contribute to avoid
surprises on interest rate decisions. In this respect the newly introduced quarterly publication
of three-year inflation forecasts, together with an assessment of monetary policy conditions,
has worked well. However, this does not in any way mean that the SNB unduly follows
market expectations. The SNB would not hesitate to take an interest rate decision called for
by economic analysis and the inflation forecast, even if markets – despite the generally
effective communication framework – would not expect it.
Fiscal Policy
7.
Staff notes that the fiscal position is relatively sound and that the management of
public finances has been reasonable. At the federal level, the fiscal balance has improved
markedly due to large expenditure cuts and, to a lesser extent, due to higher revenues. After
the consolidation program 2003, a second consolidation program 2004 is currently being
discussed in parliament. This program intends to further improve the federal budget by
CHF2.0 billion until the year 2008 mainly through lower spending. The 2005 federal budget
is the third to comply with the debt-brake, which so far has proven to be effective.
8.
In order to contain the subnational government deficits, many cantons have
introduced instruments that are more or less similar to the debt brake. However, as staff
rightly suggests, further efforts may be needed on the part of the cantons to offset the
spillovers from the reduction of federal transfers. On the expenditure side, better intercantonal cooperation, which is also promoted by the New Financial Equalization scheme,
will provide incentives for a better spending allocation. In a related vein, while staff
emphasizes the need for improving the coordination of fiscal policies among the various
levels of government, it should be noted that there are limits to this coordination in the
context of the Swiss system of fiscal federalism. In this respect, my authorities think that it
would be useful at the time of next year’s discussion to look in greater detail at
macroeconomic aspects of the interplay between the different levels of government.
9.
As in most countries, significant longer-term challenges remain for fiscal policy. Staff
rightly points out that the health system and the pay-as-you-go pillar of the social security
system will be strained due to an aging population. The authorities are very aware of these
challenges. As regards the pay-as-you-go pillar, the rejection by popular vote of the
amendments proposed last year was a setback. The authorities have now proposed a more
focused revision, which retains key parts of the former proposal, such as harmonizing the
pension age at 65. However, it is important to note that Switzerland's three pillar system
makes the social security system as a whole more resilient than in other countries, since the

-3funded mandatory second pillar plays a significant role. As regards the health system,
important reforms, particularly aiming at improving cost control, were sent to parliament.
10.
Staff argues that in order to ensure intertemporal consistency of fiscal policy, it may
be useful to supplement the current budgetary framework with an instrument such as a longterm fiscal sustainability assessment to capture the effects of aging. The Ministry of Finance
is considering the idea of a periodic long-run public finance sustainability report. In this
respect, staff’s analysis provides a useful guidance.
Financial Sector
11.
Further improving the financial sector regulatory and supervisory framework in line
with international standards and practices remains a priority for the Swiss authorities. The
reform initiatives underway have made considerable progress, and some important reforms
have been implemented during the last year, namely the revision of the Insurance
Supervision Act and the adoption of measures to tackle the problem of underfunding of
private pension funds. Other projects are at advanced stages of implementation. For example,
this applies to the revised rules for granting administrative assistance relating to stock
exchange dealings and the revised Act on Collective Investment Schemes. As for the draft
legislation on an integrated financial market supervisory authority, fundamental decisions
have been taken concerning the structure and organisation of the new authority. The
parliamentary process on the draft law will start in 2006.
12.
Switzerland is strongly committed to ensuring that its financial center is not abused
for criminal purposes, in particular for money laundering or terrorist financing. We are
currently drafting legislation in order to implement the revised recommendations of the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF). At the same time, Switzerland’s third mutual
evaluation by FATF members is currently underway.
13.
Efforts to improve the legal framework of the private pension system will further
strengthen the stability of the second pillar, given the anticipated demographic shifts. Reform
proposals, to be drafted by an expert commission, focus on strengthening supervision, the
recapitalization of public pension funds and assessing the need for a new legal form tailored
to pension funds.
Structural Issues
14.
Raising the growth potential is the biggest policy challenge for Switzerland. Two
major guidelines are at the center of the government’s growth strategy: a more efficient
domestic market and a more efficient public sector. In 2004, reforms have moved ahead at a
good pace. There will be a referendum on a second package of bilateral agreements including the extension of free movement of labor to the new EU members - in June and in
September.
15.
Staff mentions that agriculture protection remains very high. Here, it should be noted
that the agricultural policy enacted in 2003 has introduced an almost complete switch from

-4price support to direct payments. This direct payment system assures full compatibility with
strong ecological and animal welfare criteria. Moreover, total expenditures for agriculture are
projected to decline in nominal terms until 2007 and further reductions of support are to be
expected with the continuing reform of agricultural policies.
16.
Despite strong budgetary pressures, official development assistance remains high on
Switzerland’s agenda. My authorities are particularly focusing on increasing the
effectiveness of Swiss Official Development Assistance (ODA) and on harmonizing their
activities in low-income countries with other donors. The fiscal consolidation programs have
made a point to safeguard development outlays from spending cuts. After making the Swiss
calculation methodology more akin to that of other OECD countries, Swiss ODA for 2004 is
projected to be 0.41 percent of GNI. In terms of GNI, Switzerland's development
expenditures ranked 8th out of 22 OECD countries in 2003.
17.
With regard to the dismantling of trade protection as a contribution to helping poor
countries, the objective of my authorities is to provide duty-free and quota-free access for all
least developed country products. While most products of interest to least developed
countries are already duty-free, tariff reductions for the remaining ones, namely agricultural
products, amount from 55 to 75 percent. The work on the last phase of the preference
scheme’s extension to all least developed country products will start in early summer of
2005. Implementing the scheme will need parliamentary approval.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Switzerland
On June 6, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Switzerland.1
Background
The Swiss economy has returned to growth with supportive external demand and domestic
policies. However, the recovery has been fragile and business indicators suggest that activity
is currently experiencing a soft patch. Unemployment has crept up to 3.9 percent, which is low
by international standards. Despite the increase in oil prices, inflation remains well under
control and the current account is running a large surplus.
With inflation projected to remain inside the 0-2 percent range of price stability, and the
recovery still fragile, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) has maintained an accommodative
posture. Since raising the three-month policy rate to 0.75 percent in mid-2004, the SNB has
put on hold the return of interest rates toward a neutral level. Indeed, the strengthening of the
Swiss franc has already withdrawn some monetary stimulus. The general government deficit is
estimated to have narrowed to 1 percent in 2004, and the federal government is taking further
steps under the debt-brake rule to eliminate its structural deficit.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.
1

-2Growth is projected to continue, albeit at a lower pace. The staff projects growth of 1¼ percent
in 2005, from1.7 percent in 2004, with some risks on the downside if demand from partner
countries were to falter. Potential growth is estimated at 1½ percent and is projected to decline
in the medium term to ¾ percent as a result of population aging.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Switzerland’s sound macroeconomic management and
flexible labor markets, which have secured low inflation and unemployment and a high
standard of living. External demand conditions and accommodative domestic policies have led
to a rebound of economic activity. Also, the country’s external position remains strong, in part
reflecting investment income from Switzerland’s large net foreign assets. At the same time,
Directors noted the existence of downside risks to the economic recovery, stemming from
possible softening of demand in major trading partner countries, higher oil prices, and further
appreciation of the franc.
Directors observed that raising the economic growth rate and tackling the fiscal pressures
associated with population aging continue to be Switzerland’s main challenges. They attributed
the weak growth performance to the strong segmentation of internal product markets,
substantial non-tariff import barriers, and lack of domestic competition. They stressed the
importance of opening up sheltered sectors, intensifying competition in product markets, and
eliminating non-tariff barriers, and welcomed the authorities’ adoption last year of a growth
package of reforms in these areas. Directors underscored that higher growth will make it
easier to absorb the costs of population aging. They acknowledged the consensus-based
nature of economic policy-making in Switzerland, and in this context stressed the need for a
public education campaign to garner support for structural reforms.
Directors observed that the monetary policy framework has allowed the Swiss National Bank
(SNB) to respond flexibly to economic developments and deliver low inflation. They considered
that the current accommodative monetary stance remains appropriate. With inflation risks low,
output below potential, and the economic recovery still fragile, the current low level of interest
rates should be maintained for the time being. However, Directors noted that, with a narrowing
output gap, some monetary tightening will be needed sooner or later. They welcomed the
SNB’s intention to remain vigilant for signs of price pressures, and to be prepared to return to
more neutral interest rates as the recovery firms up, taking into account the lags in the
effectiveness of monetary policy in Switzerland. Directors commended the SNB’s effective
communications strategy, and welcomed the steps taken to increase transparency through the
quarterly publication of the three-year-ahead inflation forecast and the assessment of
monetary policy conditions.
Directors welcomed the improvement in the public finances in 2004. They supported the
authorities’ plans to phase out the federal structural deficit while allowing the full play of
automatic stabilizers around this path. They considered that the debt-brake rule provides a
solid anchor for fiscal policy over the business cycle, and reduces the procyclicality of such
policy. However, Directors stressed that the mounting pressure on the social security system

-3and the possibility of loss of financial tax revenue due to competition from other financial
centers require fiscal prudence and cooperation with cantonal governments. In this regard,
they called for a comprehensive evaluation of public sector activities, with a view to focusing
resources on priority activities and reducing expenditure, particularly expenditure on transfers
and subsidies. Directors welcomed the agreement for a new structure of fiscal federalism,
which should enhance coordination between the various levels of government, improve
transparency, and reduce incentives for spending on non-priority projects. They supported the
intention of the federal government to use the proceeds of gold sales exclusively for debt
reduction, and strongly encouraged cantons to do likewise.
Directors underscored the importance of early and decisive action to address aging-related
fiscal pressures and avoid an excessive burden on future generations. They encouraged the
authorities to monitor regularly the underpinnings of first-pillar pension entitlements, and to
recalibrate parameters such as the retirement age and the replacement rate.
They underscored the need to resolve the problem of underfunding of second-pillar pensions,
and welcomed plans to harmonize supervisory standards across cantons. Directors also
emphasized the need to check the rise of health care costs by exploiting economies of scale
and encouraging competition among providers, and welcomed the reforms that were sent to
Parliament.
Directors encouraged the authorities to develop a multi-year fiscal framework encompassing
all levels of government and social security, and to determine a path for the public debt-toGDP ratio consistent with long-term fiscal sustainability. They acknowledged that this is a
challenging task given the high degree of autonomy of the cantons and the small size of the
federal government relative to the general government. In this context, Directors considered
that the publication of periodic fiscal sustainability reports could raise public awareness of the
need for a comprehensive long-run fiscal strategy in the context of Switzerland’s moderate
long-term growth prospects.
Directors noted that the financial system appears to be healthy and dynamic.
They commended the efforts to strengthen further the supervisory framework, and stressed
the importance of continued vigilance in monitoring financial sector risks. They welcomed
steps to strengthen insurance supervision, including a switch to risk-based supervision.
Directors also welcomed the significant progress that has been made in recent years to bring
Switzerland’s anti-money-laundering and anti-terrorism-financing regimes in line with the
recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force, including the extension of the application
of the Money Laundering Act to professions and activities outside the financial sector.
Directors welcomed the agreement with the European Union on a package of bilateral treaties,
which could help advance the pace of reform and achieve greater integration with European
economies, thereby increasing economic efficiency. They also welcomed the planned
amendment of the internal market law and the liberalization of the electricity market to
stimulate competition. They noted the high level of protection and subsidization of agriculture,
and urged an accelerated pace of dismantling these distortions. Directors commended the

-4authorities for the effectiveness of their official development assistance, and encouraged them
to move closer to the United Nations target of 0.7 percent of gross national income.
Directors noted that available economic statistics are generally adequate for surveillance
purposes. However, they urged the authorities to correct the remaining data gaps,
weaknesses, and delays so as to improve the quality of economic analysis and policy
implementation.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
