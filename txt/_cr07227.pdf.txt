The 2006 Article IV consultation discussion were held in Gaborone during June 6–20, 2006.
The staff met with Minister of Finance and Development Planning Gaolathe, Bank of
Botswana Governor Mohohlo, and other senior officials. The mission also met with
representatives from the private sector, labor unions, civil society, and the diplomatic
community. The staff team comprised Mr. Dorsey (PDR, head), Messrs. Basdevant and Iimi,
and Ms. Kim (all AFR); Ms. Gesami (OED) joined the mission on June 19–20. Subsequent to
the mission, the discussions continued with substantive correspondence from the authorities on
monetary and exchange rate policies on October 6, and October 25.

•

At the conclusion of 2005 Article IV consultation on June 22, 2005, Directors noted that
Botswana’s sound macroeconomic policies and good governance had contributed to sustained
growth and low inflation, but emphasized the need to diversify the economy and allocate
adequate budgetary resources to combat HIV/AIDS while preserving macroeconomic stability.
In light of the adoption of the crawling peg exchange rate arrangement, Directors also stressed
the need to move quickly to put in place supportive monetary and fiscal policies that would
establish a clear nominal anchor and lend credibility to the new regime.

Botswana is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. Botswana has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII; Botswana maintains a multiple currency practice relating to
exchange rate guarantees on loans that will be outstanding until 2016 (see Appendix I).
Annexes on Botswana’s relations with the Fund, relations with the World Bank, statistical
issues, debt sustainability, and the PIN background section are included in Appendices I–VI,

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Botswana’s macroeconomic performance has been generally good over the last two
years, with the exception of inflation, which accelerated substantially following the
May 2005 devaluation. Real GDP growth was strong in 2004/05, the 2005 current account
surplus widened, and international reserves stood at the equivalent of 21 months of goods
and services imports.
Botswana’s growth has been fueled by continued increases in diamond production;
however, real diamond output is projected to level off and then decline sharply after
about fifteen years. Botswana’s economic progress could be eroded unless the authorities
successfully implement policies to diversify the economy. Botswana also has a very high
HIV/AIDS infection rate which will continue to place a burden on human welfare and public
finances.
The budget surplus for 2005/06 is estimated at more than eight percent of GDP, and the
2006/07 budget calls for another, albeit significantly smaller, surplus. These surpluses
are a prudent response to the declining share of diamond revenues in GDP that is likely over
the long-term, but the sharp drop in the 2006/07 surplus, due largely to projected expenditure
increases, could add to inflationary pressures.
At the time of the 2005 devaluation, Botswana adopted a crawling peg exchange rate
arrangement, which could provide the basis for a nominal anchor. However, because
Botswana’s inflation targets are very close to the inflation rates of countries represented in
the exchange rate basket, only a very modest rate of crawl would be consistent with the
authorities’ targets.
Diversification of the economy will require implementation of substantial structural
reforms, in particular the authorities’ planned reforms in labor markets, the
investment environment, and the role of parastatals.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Botswana has been among the world’s fastest growing economies over the past
40 years. Diamond-led growth combined with sound macroeconomic policies and good
governance has moved Botswana from being one of the poorest countries in the world to the
upper-middle income range and yielded the highest sovereign debt ratings and best
Transparency International anti-corruption rank in Africa.
2.
Nevertheless, Botswana faces serious challenges to continued economic
development. The country remains heavily dependent on diamond production, which
accounts for about threeIncome Level of Botswana and Comparator Countries

Botswana has had continuous democratic rule since independence in 1966. The
president and legislature were elected in 2004, and new elections are scheduled for 2009.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Botswana’s recent economic performance has also been generally good, apart
from an upsurge in inflation following the May 2005 devaluation. Real GDP growth has
rebounded to more than eight percent in 2004/05 (July-June), mainly due to growth in the
mining sector (Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 1). The current account surplus is estimated at
fifteen percent of GDP in 2005, mainly reflecting increased exports of both diamonds and
other goods.2 The capital and financial accounts continued to show a modest but declining
deficit, reflecting investments abroad by pension funds. International reserves increased to
the equivalent of 21 months of goods and services imports by end-2005 (Table 3).

The fiscal surplus rose sharply to more than eight percent of GDP in 2005/06. 3
Higher diamond revenues and lower-than-budgeted spending were the main factors behind
the increased surplus (Table 4 and Figure 2). The 2006/07 budget (April-March) projects a
much smaller surplus, with expenditures rebounding strongly and mineral revenue growth
slowing. However, data for the first quarter of 2006/07 show a revenue-to-GDP ratio broadly
in line with the first quarter of 2005/06 while expenditure-to-GDP ratio appears substantially
below the level seen in the same quarter of 2005/06, implying a surplus for the first quarter
of 2006/07 at an annual rate of five percent of GDP.
2

Non-diamond exports roughly tripled in dollar terms and nearly doubled as a share of GDP between 2001 and
2005, reflecting both increased commodity prices and increased export volumes.

3

Final data on the 2005/06 fiscal year are not yet available; estimates for 2005/06 are based on information for
eleven months and have been subject to large revisions after the close of the fiscal year.

The authorities announced a shift in the exchange rate regime from a fixed peg
against a basket to a crawling peg against a basket comprising the South African rand
and the SDR at the time of the May 2005 devaluation. According to the 2006 Monetary
Policy Statement of the Bank of Botswana (BoB), the rate of crawl is set at the difference
between the inflation targets and projections of countries in the basket and Botswana’s own
inflation objectives of 4–7 percent for 2006 and an average of a 3–6 percent range for the
2006-08 period; these objectives were reaffirmed in the August 2006 Mid-term Review of
the Monetary Policy Statement. 4 The weights and the rate of crawl have not been announced.
7.
Coinciding with the devaluation and the change in exchange rate regime,
inflation has accelerated (Figure 3). Inflation had been on a downward trend in early 2005,
but consumer price inflation accelerated from 6.3 percent in the 12 months to May 2005 and
peaked at 14.2 percent in the 12 months to April 2006. Inflation in the first nine months of
2006 has reached 7.8 percent and already exceeds the authorities’ objective of a 4 to 7
percent rate for the December 2005-December 2006 period. Monthly inflation rates between
May and September 2006 have been equivalent to annual rates in the 7 to 9 percent range.
Notwithstanding the crawl, the real effective exchange rate has appreciated since May 2005,
offsetting some of the real effect of the devaluation in the period through September 2006
(Figures 4 and 5).

4

Exchange rate policy is set by the President on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance and
Development Planning after consultation with the Bank of Botswana. See the supplement to the 2005 Article
IV staff report for more information on the May 2005 devaluation.

Money and credit trends have been mixed since May 2005 (Table 5). Real, domesticcurrency money demand appears to have fallen significantly. Notwithstanding cumulative
inflation of 15 percent in the fourteen months between May 2005 and July 2006, puladenominated broad money (M3) has been almost unchanged in nominal terms while foreign
currency deposits have more than doubled.5 Credit trends are less clear; real credit to the
private sector fell in the last seven months of 2005 but rose in the first seven months of 2006.
Interest rates remained broadly flat in nominal terms (Figure 6), and real interest rates are
now negative for most deposit rates. The BoB increased its policy interest rates by a
cumulative total of one percent since May 2005. However, banking system excess liquidity is
high; credit to non-government is less than the commercial banks’ holdings of Bank of
Botswana Certificates (BoBCs).6 Notwithstanding Botswana’s open capital account, interest
rates also have a limited relationship with the exchange rate; the absence of organized
forward markets in the pula and with very thin markets for pula-denominated fixed-income
securities that can be held by non-banks makes it difficult to engage in covered interest
arbitrage while prudential limits on banks’ open position constrain them from taking
advantage of interest differentials.
5

New regulations in early 2006 prohibiting non-banks from purchasing Bank of Botswana Certificates (BoBCs)
resulted in an increase in deposits at commercial banks (included in M2) offset by a decline in BoBCs held by
non-banks (included in M3 but not M2).

6

BoBCs are short-term securities issued by the BoB to absorb banking system liquidity and are the main puladenominated asset available to commercial banks for their excess liquidity.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
The policy discussion focused on how monetary/exchange rate policy, fiscal
policy, and structural reforms can address the inter-related challenges of diversifying

12

the economy, reducing unemployment and poverty, and caring for those infected with
or affected by HIV/AIDS, all within an increasingly constrained fiscal resource
envelope and while maintaining macroeconomic stability.
A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
10.
The authorities attributed the sharp rise in inflation since May 2005 to several
factors. They noted that administered price increases, the introduction of school fees for
secondary school students, and increased fuels costs were significant factors as well as the
devaluation. They were of the view that the devaluation contributed only about three to four
percentage points to 2005 inflation. The staff agreed that the devaluation was not the sole
factor behind the acceleration of inflation, but took the view that exchange rate pass-through
is likely to be very high in Botswana given the large share of imports in consumption. They
noted that empirical work by staff implied a large role for the exchange rate in the
determination of prices in Botswana and a more limited role for monetary aggregates and
interest rates.7 The authorities noted that the high share of imports in consumption did not
imply that there was no scope for demand management, and that data and methodological
limitations and structural and policy shifts might affect empirical results.
11.
The authorities indicated that, while their current monetary policy framework is
not equivalent to a full-fledged inflation targeting regime, the principal purpose of the
annual inflation objective is to serve as a nominal anchor for inflation.8 The authorities’
indicated that they will meet their inflation target by actively regulating demand through
interest rate changes. They noted that interest rate policy has been successful in regulating
demand and influencing inflation expectations and attributed the relatively slow growth of
private credit to the relatively high interest rates. The authorities further indicated that the
objective of the exchange rate policy and mechanism is to maintain a stable real effective
exchange rate as a way of achieving international competitiveness in support of the wider
objective of economic diversification.
12.
In the view of the staff, the authorities’ views on the appropriate nominal anchor
and the use of the exchange rate policy to target a real effective exchange rate objective
imply considerable tension between the authorities’ objectives. The staff take the view
that it is not possible to independently set the nominal exchange rate path, the inflation rate,
and the REER path for a sustained period. This is particularly true in a country like
Botswana, which is small, highly integrated with the South African and world economies,
and has open current and capital account regimes. In particular, given that the authorities are
7

See “A Note on Inflation” in the Selected Issues papers.

The authorities views on the appropriate nominal anchor were clarified through correspondence sent in
October 2006 following discussions in Gaborone. This staff report reflects the staff’s advice in light of this
correspondence.

13

adhering to a crawling peg regime for the nominal exchange rate, they can target the inflation
rate or the real exchange rate, but not both. If they are targeting the real exchange rate, then
the inflation rate is no longer constrained by a nominal anchor and may destabilize the price
level. Alternatively, if they are targeting the inflation rate, then the real effective exchange
rate must necessarily be allowed to vary.
13.
Furthermore, even if it is possible to target inflation through monetary policy
instruments in the context of Botswana’s crawling peg, achieving the authorities’
inflation target through interest rate management would imply a much more aggressive
policy of monetary restraint than has been observed to date. Nearly half of the CPI
basket consists of imported goods and less than three-tenths of the basket consisting of
nontradables. A rate of crawl that sets the inflation rate of imports (and tradable goods more
generally) above the authorities’ inflation target range would require a very tight monetary
policy to keep inflation in nontradable goods low enough to offset the impact of the exchange
rate on imports and domestically-produced tradables. However, notwithstanding the surge in
inflation following the devaluation and adoption of a crawling peg, policy interest rates have
been increased by only one percent, with the result that real interest rates in Botswana have
fallen significantly. Possibly as a result, credit growth has accelerated in the first seven
months of 2006; demand for pula-denominated money has weakened, and foreign currency
deposits have surged since the May 2005 devaluation. In this context, if the authorities are
determined to use monetary policy to achieve their inflation targets, the staff would urge a
much tighter monetary policy to control inflation and a reduction in the rate of crawl of the
exchange rate to allow a more balanced reduction in inflation across imports, domestic
tradables, and nontradable goods.
14.
More generally, the staff took the view that an exchange rate anchor is
appropriate for Botswana, given that the high levels of banking system liquidity and the
associated looseness of the relationship among monetary and credit aggregates and interest
rates would complicate the operation of a money-based anchor. In this context, the staff urge
the authorities to commit to using their crawling peg exchange rate regime to target the
inflation rate rather than the real exchange rate. However, given partner country inflation
targets and projections (i.e., a 3–6 percent target range for South Africa and projections for
inflation for industrial countries of about 2–3 percent), the implied rate of crawl consistent
with achieving Botswana’s inflation objective would be two percent a year or less.9
15.
Staff noted that the current level of the exchange rate is broadly appropriate in
light of the strong current account, growing non-diamond exports, and the high and
stable level of reserves. The authorities did not express a view on the appropriate level of
the exchange rate. Staff urged the authorities to announce the weights and rate of crawl for
the exchange rate regime to anchor expectations. The authorities appreciated that uncertainty
9

Inflation rates would have to fall to annual rates of no more than 4.5 percent for the remainder of 2006-08 to
stay within the upper bound of the 3 to 6 percent annual rate objective for the 2006-08 period as a whole.

14

about the parameters of the crawling peg mechanism might engender inflationary
expectations, and they indicated that announcement of the parameters of the regime has been
under review and might take place in due course.
B. Fiscal Policy and the Size of Government
16.
The authorities have maintained a conservative fiscal stance. However, the
2006/07 surplus is budgeted to be much smaller than the surplus in 2005/06, as the
authorities plan to increase development expenditure substantially and mineral revenue
growth is expected to slow. Staff analysis suggests that surpluses of this size are consistent
with a prudent medium-term fiscal position given the expected sharp decline in diamond
revenue after 2021 (see paragraph 17). However, in view of the strong positive fiscal impulse
(due to a possible 7 percentage point decline in the overall surplus) staff suggested that the
authorities slow the pace of expenditure growth below budgeted levels until there is evidence
that inflation pressures are abating.
17.
The discussions also covered the authorities’ medium-term plans (through FY
2008/09), as set out in the Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the Ninth National Development
Plan (NDP 9). These plans include a fiscal rule that sets a ceiling on expenditure and a target
for revenue and grants, both at 40 percent of GDP. Additional revenue from user fees and tax
administration improvements will be used to meet the projected revenue target and offset the
decline in the GDP share of revenues and grants resulting from a plateauing of diamond
production. Should revenues fall short of the target, the intention is to reduce expenditure in
order to maintain a balanced budget over the medium term, rather than raise tax rates.

18.
The authorities’ expenditure plans also envisage increased development
expenditure and HIV/AIDS-related expenditure. They intend to increase development
expenditure from 25 to 30 percent of total spending by 2008/09, although they noted that
expenditure might fall short of budgeted amounts because the government is unwilling to
compromise procurement standards or project quality to meet the development spending
targets. While HIV/AIDS-related costs are expected to continue to increase, the authorities
expect that international official and private financing will cover some of the costs.10
19.
The staff broadly agreed with these policies, but expressed the view that a
contraction of the relative size of government would be desirable, and is probably
inevitable. Medium-term (2006-11) baseline and alternative scenarios prepared by the staff
are based on the policies and growth assumptions of the MTR’s baseline and reform case
scenarios, respectively (Tables 7 and 8). The alternative scenario also assumes that central
10

The government provides free anti-retroviral drugs through its public health system and support to orphans
from HIV/AIDS (and other causes). Health care expenditures more than doubled as a share of GDP between
2000/01 and 2005/06, in substantial part because of HIV/AIDS-related spending.

16

government expenditure declines by one percent of GDP per year annually in addition to the
structural reforms envisaged by the authorities (e.g., removal of administrative bottlenecks to
business and investment, increased development expenditure, and parastatal reform),
resulting in the higher growth assumed in that scenario.
•

In the baseline scenario, the expenditure-to-GDP ratio declines due to the indexation
of the wage bill at half of the rate of inflation, but the revenue-to-GDP ratio declines
faster, creating budget deficits or necessitating new revenues to maintain a balance
budget. Maintaining revenue at the 40 percent of GDP objective would require much
larger increases in user fees or other non-mineral revenue.

•

In the alternative scenario, the declining expenditure-to-GDP ratio together with
faster growth are slightly more than enough to keep pace with the declining revenue
ratio and eventually lead to small fiscal surpluses.

20.
The discussions also looked forward to the post-diamond era.11 Based on
discussions with the authorities and Debswana (Botswana’s joint venture with DeBeers),
staff projections imply that government revenue from diamond production would decline
from approximately 20 percent of GDP in recent years to less than 15 percent of GDP by
2010 and stabilize at roughly that level before declining sharply to less than five percent of
GDP after 2021. The authorities noted that, while diamond production is likely to plateau at
current mining operations, there is significant prospecting activity underway for diamonds
and other minerals. Staff projections imply the need for a fiscal adjustment in other revenue
and expenditure items of at least 13 percent of GDP relative to 2006/07 to maintain balanced
budgets after 2021, although substantial fiscal surpluses over the next fifteen years could
ease the fiscal shock associated with the decline in diamond revenue. While Botswana’s
government-expenditure-to-GDP ratio is high for a middle-income country, the very large
reduction in government expenditure needed over the medium-term to offset declining
diamond revenue suggests that increases in tax rates (e.g., VAT rates) might contribute to
maintaining overall government expenditures.
21.
The authorities indicated that their economic policies recognize the need to
adjust to the decline in diamond revenues. Their efforts to diversify the economy (e.g., in
tourism, non-diamond mining, mineral-related manufacturing, and financial services) have
been undertaken to prepare for the depletion of the diamond resource as well as to achieve
broad-based development and growth in the economy and for the more immediate objectives
of reducing unemployment and poverty. The buildup of large foreign exchange reserves has
also been a response to the need to prepare for the post-diamond era. They recognized that
11

The sharp decline in revenue in revenue shares after fifteen years reflects both an expected lower yield of
diamonds and higher extraction costs as major mines shift from open pit to underground mining. The fiscal
implications of the long-term outlook for diamond revenue are discussed in more detail in the Selected Issues
paper “Are Diamonds Forever?”

17

reducing the share of government expenditure in GDP or changes in tax rates could offset
some of the decline in diamond revenues, but they intended to rely on broadening the tax
base through economic diversification to the maximum extent possible.
C. Structural Reforms
22.
There was agreement between the authorities and the staff that sustained
improvements in competitiveness and diversification of the economy -- and the
associated reductions in unemployment and poverty--will require substantial structural
reforms, in particular in labor markets, the investment environment, and the role of
parastatals in the economy.
Labor markets
23.
On labor market institutions, there was agreement that the large and relatively
well-paid government civil service in the non-professional ranks has created a situation
in which many potential employees have a reservation wage that is above market
clearing levels (the government accounts for two-fifths of formal sector employment in 2005
and central government wages exceeded those of the private sector by 62 percent in 2003).12
The authorities indicated that Botswana does not have stringent institutional or legal labor
market rigidities or cash assistance to the unemployed, although there are sector-specific
minimum wages that largely affect the behavior of some smaller employers. Nevertheless,
the government has taken or planned some new measures to improve the operation of labor
markets. The most recent public sector pay increase offset only half of the change in the cost
of living, and that policy is expected to continue for future pay increases. The government
plans to expand vocational training and increase the capacity of senior secondary schools
(i.e., grades 11 and 12) which currently have space for less than two thirds of the students
graduating from junior secondary schools. To help control the costs of education initiatives,
the government recently introduced means-tested school fees equal to five percent of
secondary school cost. The government decision to establish a second university, focusing on
science and technology, should also reduce the costs of tertiary education relative to study
abroad.
Investment environment and privatization
24.
The authorities have been implementing reforms to the investment environment,
where Botswana’s international rankings are broadly on par with other upper-middle
income countries. The backlog of applications for work and residence permits for investors,
a key concern of investors identified in a recent FIAS report, has now been eliminated.
However, less has been achieved on investor access to land serviced by utilities (another key
12

18

concern) due to the long time needed to develop and extend infrastructure to industrial land.
Some improvements have been observed in expediting company registration, streamlining
business licensing, ratifying international agreements on industrial property, and streamlining
the tax system, but more work is needed to achieve the authorities’ objectives in these areas.
25.
The authorities noted that privatization has been slower than originally
expected. However, the privatization of Botswana Telecommunications Corporation (BTC)
has been approved by Cabinet, and Botswana Power Corporation’s majority privatization
may now take place in the context of a public-private partnership to create substantial new
generating capacity. They hope that privatization of BTC and Air Botswana will take place
by the end of the next fiscal year. The authorities also noted that their privatization strategy
also includes outsourcing, which has progressed more rapidly.

Other issues
26.
Botswana’s financial sector regulation and supervision is being broadened to
cover new institutions and issues. Botswana’s banking sector has been relatively well
regulated and supervised, and it continues to be profitable. However, capacity to supervise
non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) has been limited, and comprehensive legislation to
establish a new regulator for NBFIs is being finalized by government. On anti-money
laundering and the combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), draft legislation has
been endorsed by the National Task Force on AML/CFT, and should be enacted before the
end of the year. The FSAP mission scheduled for early 2007 will provide an opportunity for
more detailed discussions on the financial sector, including on AML/CFT.
27.
Trade policy developments over the past year are largely developments in
ongoing negotiations. Negotiations between the EU and the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) group on an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) have continued
but are complicated by the diversity in levels of development among SADC members.
Negotiations toward a U.S.-Southern African Customs Union free trade agreement have
stalled, and both sides have agreed to consult on reaching a Trade and Investment
Cooperation Agreement instead.
28.
Botswana’s economic statistics are generally good and are adequate for
surveillance, but some weaknesses in national accounts have come to light. Most
importantly, recently published data show implausibly large inventory accumulation over the
last five years and anomalies in some deflators. The authorities agreed that these problems
are a serious concern and reported that the government has already allocated additional funds
to address this problem. Botswana’s data would also benefit more timely final data on the
fiscal accounts and from synchronization between the annual data for fiscal (April-March),
national accounts (July-June), and other, calendar year, data. In addition, the staff welcomes
the planned update to the weights in the CPI basket later this year.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Botswana’s macroeconomic performance has been generally good over the last
two years, with the exception of inflation, which accelerated substantially following the
May 2005 devaluation.
30.
The current level of the exchange rate appears broadly appropriate in light of
the strong current account, growing non-diamond exports, and the high and stable level
of reserves.
31.
Botswana’s crawling peg could provide the basis for a nominal anchor. However,
because Botswana’s inflation targets are very close to the targets and projected inflation rates
of countries represented in the basket, the annual rate of crawl needs to be consistent with the
authorities’ medium-term objective. Specifically, with inflationary pressures persisting, the
authorities should set the annual rate of crawl at one or two percent a year to improve the
chances of meeting their inflation targets. Announcement of the parameters of the regime

20

should also help to increase transparency and anchor exchange rate and inflation
expectations.
32.
However, the authorities’ announced policy of using interest rates and monetary
policy to achieve the inflation target while at the same time using the crawling peg
exchange rate regime to target a real effective exchange rate level imply considerable
tensions among policy objectives. In this context, the authorities should give priority to the
inflation objective in setting the rate of crawl and avoid trying to achieve a real exchange rate
target. Given the authorities’ intent to use interest rates and monetary policy to rein in
inflation, a much tighter monetary policy would be needed in the present circumstances.
33.
While the authorities’ policy of budget balance is prudent, they should consider
measures to put the share of government expenditure on a sustained, downward path to
anticipate the projected decline in diamond revenues. For 2006/07, in view of the large
fiscal impulse implied by the budget, the authorities should slow the pace of expenditure
growth below budgeted levels until inflationary pressures subside. For the medium-term,
fiscal surpluses associated with a declining expenditure path should be used to cushion the
long-term impact of declining diamond revenues unless alternate sources of revenue are
found. Efforts to broaden the tax base, improve tax administration, and implement user fees
are welcome, but increases in tax rates should not be ruled out in light of the scale of the
projected decline in diamond revenue.
34.
The authorities’ plans for labor market-related reforms, privatization, and
improvements in the investment environment are welcome and should help promote
competitiveness and diversification of the economy, and the associated reductions in
unemployment and poverty.
35.
Botswana maintains a multiple currency practice (MCP) relating to exchange
rate guarantees on certain loans. The authorities previously indicated that the scheme
applied only to loans undertaken before October 1990, the last of which would mature in
2006; on that basis, the Fund previously approved this MCP. However, a recent
communication from the authorities now indicate that the loans will be outstanding until
2016. Absent additional information on whether the conditions for Fund approval of the
MCP apply, in light of the recent communication, staff does not recommend approval of the
MCP.
36.

It is proposed that Botswana remain on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

Exchange rate arrangements

The exchange rate of the Botswana pula is crawling peg arrangement against a basket of
currencies. As of November 15, 2006, the exchange rate was US$1=P6.21, and the exchange
rate of the South African rand to the pula was R1=P0.852.
VIII. Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on June 22, 2005.
Botswana maintains a multiple currency practice (MCP) relating to exchange rate guarantees
on certain loans. The authorities previously indicated that the scheme applied only to loans
undertaken before October 1990, the last of which would mature in 2006; on that basis, the
Fund previously approved this MCP. However, a recent communication from the authorities
now indicate that the loans will be outstanding until 2016. Absent additional information on
whether the conditions for Fund approval of the MCP apply, in light of the recent
communication, staff does not recommend approval of the MCP.
With regard to the multiple currency practice, the Executive Board took the following
decision in the context of the 2005 Article IV consultation:

31

1.
The Fund takes this decision relating to Botswana’s exchange measure subject to
Article VIII, Section 3, in the light of the 1999 Article IV consultation with Botswana
conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted April 29, 1977, as amended
(Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies).
2.
As described in IMF Country Report No. 06/66, May 13, 2005, Botswana maintained
a multiple currency practice subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3
arising from the Foreign Exchange Risk-Sharing Scheme (FERS) applicable to outstanding
external loans obtained by certain public enterprises before October 1, 1990, In the
circumstances of Botswana, the Fund grants approval of the retention of this multiple
currency practice until June 30, 2006, or the conclusion of the next Article IV consultation,
whichever is earlier.

Appendix II: Botswana: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of July 13, 2006)
1.
Botswana became a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA) in 1968.
Cumulative commitments from IDA to Botswana include US$17 million for six development
credits for infrastructural development and the livestock sector. The last credit was extended
in 1974. Cumulative commitments from the IBRD to Botswana amount to US$281 million
for 22 loans, of which US$54 million was canceled. The loans were extended for
infrastructural development, the financial sector, land management and livestock
development, as well as for education and health projects. The last loan was extended in
1987. Since the late 1980s, the Government of Botswana has not required external borrowing
owing to its strong financial and international reserve position based on diamond mining
receipts. Currently, there are no active IBRD/IDA projects in Botswana. Therefore, the
Bank’s involvement in Botswana has shifted to analytical and advisory activities.
2.
Botswana joined the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in 1979. There has been
little private sector interest in Botswana in IFC financing as excess liquidity, brought about
by the inflow of foreign exchange resources from diamond exports, which has made it
relatively easy for the small private sector to raise funds in the domestic market. Cumulative
IFC equity and loan commitments to Botswana total US$10.72 million in five tourism,
financial, and mining enterprises. In FY99 and FY00, the IFC made two loan commitments
amounting to US$1.75 million to Abercombie and Kent (Botswana) for accommodation and
tourism services projects in the Okavango Delta. In FY01, the IFC made a quasi-equity
investment of US$3 million in the African Banking Corporation aimed at diversifying its
range of financial services and increasing its geographical coverage. In FY03, the IFC
approved a US$2 million equity investment in Kalahari Diamonds Limited for diamond
exploration in Botswana's Kalahari desert. The most recent IFC commitment, at the end of
2004, was an equity stake of US$3.97 million in a consumer finance company, which
provides short- to medium-term micro loans to employees of governmental, quasigovernmental and private sector companies in Botswana. The IFC rendered advisory services
to the Government of Botswana on privatization of enterprises, and in FY03/04, the Public
Enterprises Evaluation and Privatization Agency gave the IFC the privatization mandate for
Air Botswana. In 2004, the Foreign Investment Advisory Services completed a review of the
commercial legal framework, administrative and registration costs, and barriers to investment
in Botswana.
3.
Botswana joined the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in 1988;
MIGA has neither any exposure nor any active applications in Botswana. MIGA and the
Botswana Export Development and Investment Authority (BEDIA) signed a cooperation
agreement in July 2003. Specifically, BEDIA is providing investment information content to
MIGA for distribution to potential investors via the FDI Xchange and other MIGA online
services.

34

4.
An ESW on economic diversification and trade was initiated with the government
and a local research group, Botswana Institute of Development Policy Analysis, in 2003. The
report was completed and presented to the Government in 2005 and is due for publication
shortly. The Bank is providing technical support for the dissemination of the report in
FY2007. In mid-2004, the Government, with analytical and advisory support from the Bank,
launched a study on the viability and long-term development strategy for the livestock (beef)
sub-sector. The content and recommendations of the report are expected to be reviewed at
the Cabinet level during May/June 2006 to chart the outline of a new strategy for Botswana’s
livestock sector. At the Government’s request, the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory
Facility launched a study on reform of the regulatory framework for public utilities in
2003/04. The Government has also expressed interest in exploring Bank support for
infrastructure development. The Bank is actively engaged in trying to identify potential
scope and focus for support. At the request of the Government, the Bank will lead the work
on the mid-term review of the current National Strategic Framework for fighting
HIV/AIDS—a proposal for an IDF grant will be submitted to the Africa committee shortly.
The Bank is currently undertaking an Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) in the country
with a report due out in FY2007.
5.
Past analytic and advisory activities include: a review of Botswana’s experience in
economic management in 1999; an IDF grant for home-based care of AIDS patients, which
closed on August 5, 1999; an analysis of the development impact of HIV/AIDS on the
economy in 2001; and sharing of HIV/AIDS related information at technical meetings of the
multi-country HIV/AIDS Programs.

Appendix III: Botswana: Statistical Issues
1.
Data required for surveillance is reported to the Fund with an acceptable degree of
regularity and timeliness, and the overall quality is adequate to conduct surveillance.
However, some shortcomings remain. The accuracy of preliminary data, particularly in
national accounts and balance of payments, needs improvement. The time lag in compiling
the national accounts and labor market data could also be reduced. In addition, the current
arrangements—according to which the balance of payments statistics are compiled on a
calendar-year basis, and the national accounts and the budget on July-June and April-March
bases, respectively—impede the preparation of an integrated set of economic data. In
addition, the authorities have been slow in developing quarterly balance of payments
accounts, in large part because of delays in the availability of monthly trade data.
2.
The data module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)
was published in April 2002. Priority recommendations of general applicability included
strengthening data sharing and coordination among agencies, especially with a view to
reconciling major data sets with different accounting periods.13 A factual update to the data
ROSC and an update of the response by the authorities to the original data ROSC were
disseminated in March and July 2004, respectively.14 A new data ROSC reassessment
mission took place during October 31-November 13, 2006; the mission’s report and
recommendations will be published in due course..
National Accounts and Prices
3.
Annual and quarterly national accounts are based primarily on the concepts and
definitions recommended by the 1968 System of National Accounts (SNA) and are compiled
using the production and expenditure approaches. The authorities have indicated their strong
commitment to strengthening national accounts data, including migration to the 1993 SNA,
and have been receiving technical assistance from the Fund. Most importantly, recently
published data show implausibly large inventory accumulation over the last five years and
anomalies in some deflators. The authorities agreed that these problems are a serious
concern. Differences in the accounting periods and in the timing of recording between
national accounts, balance of payments, and government finance statistics impair the
13

Botswana participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) regional project for Anglophone
African countries that is funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID). The authorities
have prepared an initial set of metadata that include detailed plans for improvement over the short and medium
term; these were posted on the Fund’s Data Standards Bulletin Board in October 2002. Most of these metadata
were updated in May 2006.
14

In July 2004, the authorities provided an update of their initial response to the data ROSC that set out recent
actions taken to implement the staff recommendations; see:
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2004/cr04229.pdf.

36

usefulness and accuracy of estimates. Staff have encouraged the authorities to step up efforts
to harmonize the accounting periods over the medium term as planned. As a priority
measure, the 2001 data ROSC mission recommended advancing the work program for
implementing 1993 SNA with an increased focus on conceptual adherence, with
implementation initially limited to GDP estimates.
4.
The consumer price index is comprehensive and provides a breakdown of the index
between urban and rural areas, as well as between tradables (domestic and imported) and
nontradables. The base year has been changed to 2002/3 = 100 based on 2002/3 Household
Income and Expenditure survey (HIES). The old CPI, 1996 =100 is expected to be linked
with the new CPI 2002/3 =100, for November 2006. With respect to the producer price
index, the 2001 data ROSC mission recommended redesigning the producer price index to
conform to international standards regarding sample size and validation procedures. Efforts
should also be made to collect more comprehensive source data and adopt best practices for
data compilation.
Labor statistics
5.
Annual employment and wage information is available, but rarely reported to STA
for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). Employment data are collected
periodically through a variety of sources, such as the HIES, the Demographic Survey, and
the Labor Force Survey, covering formal and informal sectors with different levels of detail.
While the authorities have made efforts to standardize the surveys, more frequent and
coherent data provision is needed to analyze employment and unemployment trends on an
annual basis. For example, the latest 2002/03 HIES was published 15 months after the
fieldwork was completed. Indicators of wages, particularly average monthly earnings, have a
comprehensive coverage including sectoral data, but are provided with a considerable lag,
significantly diminishing their value for tracking recent developments. Over the medium
term, the authorities plan to increase the frequency of employment and unemployment data
from the present biannual basis to quarterly basis.
Fiscal accounts
6.
Central government finance data are produced monthly, with a lag of three to four
weeks, for use in the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP). However, the
level of accuracy is less than for audited annual fiscal data. Annual and quarterly central
government finance statistics (excluding extrabudgetary accounts) are published by the
authorities with a 9- to 12-month lag after the end of the reference year in the MFDP’s
Annual Statements of Accounts. The authorities report monthly data for publication in IFS.
7.
The compilation and dissemination of central government finance data are largely
based on the methodology of the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM
1986) and cover central government activities but not extrabudgetary accounts, and include
balances of financial assets and liabilities. The classification of revenue, expenditure, and

37

financing is broadly consistent with the GFSM 1986 methodology, with a few exceptions.
Most of the data are sufficiently detailed for GFS purposes, but source data could be
improved to allow coverage of all activities and consolidation of general government
statistics. In general, the published data have been audited by the Auditor General. Accuracy
and reliability are clearly favored at the expense of timeliness. The 2001 data ROSC mission
recommended the dissemination of monthly budgetary central government statistics within
one month of the end of the reference period and central government debt data within one
quarter of the end of the reference period.
Monetary accounts
8.
In compiling the monetary survey, the Bank of Botswana (BoB) broadly follows the
methodology recommended in the Fund’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual
(MFSM). Three STA technical assistance missions have visited the country in recent years
(August 2003, August 2004, and June 2005). Commercial banks classify their accounts into
resident and nonresident accounts according to the principle of center of economic interest.
Botswana has started compiling monetary statistics based on the Standardized Report Forms
(SFRs), which provide improved classification and sectorization of the accounts, and
reported these data to STA starting in 2001. The data reported include full coverage of the
depository corporations sector.
9.
Monetary data for publication in IFS are reported on a regular basis. Although the
timeliness of reporting has improved, data concerning the monetary authorities are still being
reported to STA with a longer lag (one additional month) than those for the other depository
corporations.
External sector statistics
10.
The BoB reports annual data on the balance of payments and the international
investment position. The most recent data reported to STA pertain to 2005. There are some
inconsistencies between the balance of payments and the IIP data.
11.
STA has provided considerable technical assistance to develop quarterly balance of
payments accounts. In March 2006, a technical assistance mission under the GDDS regional
project for Anglophone African countries found that the problems caused by the new
computer system have been solved and timely trade data of what seems to be an acceptable
quality are being produced. Quarterly balance of payments estimates are being compiled but
are not yet disseminated as they are not fully consistent with the annual data and there are
concerns about coverage.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
December 13, 2006
This statement provides an update on recent economic developments reflecting information
that has become available since the staff report was prepared. This information does not alter
the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Fiscal data for the full 2005/06 fiscal year (April/March) and the first half of the
2006/07 fiscal year have recently become available. The 2005/06 fiscal outturn was
broadly in line with staff estimates, with revenue and expenditure each roughly one-half
percent of GDP lower than projected and the overall surplus in line with projections at
8.5 percent of GDP. For the first half of 2006/07, expenditure is running below budgeted
levels and the overall surplus is approximately 3.4 percent of projected full-year GDP.
2.
The inflation outturn for October 2006 at 0.6 percent continues recent trends,
bringing the twelve month rate to 9.2 percent (8.4 percent for the first ten months of
2006). Also, starting with October 2006, monthly inflation data are calculated with the
updated weights in the CPI basket that are referred to in the staff report (see ¶28 of the staff
report). Some historical price data have been revised. However, the changes in the weights
are minor and the revised series do not change any of the inflation rates referred to in the text
of the staff report.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Botswana
On December 13, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Botswana.1
Background
Botswana has been among the world’s fastest growing economies over the past 40 years.
Diamond-led growth combined with sound macroeconomic policies and good governance has
moved Botswana from being one of the poorest countries in the world to the upper-middle
income range. Nevertheless, Botswana faces serious challenges to continued economic
development. The country remains heavily dependent on the diamond production, which
accounts for about three-fourths of exports, one-third of GDP, and half of government revenue.
However, diamond output, which almost doubled over the past decade, is projected to plateau
roughly at current production levels for the next decade and a half and decline sharply
thereafter. Notwithstanding past efforts by the authorities to diversify the economy, activity in
non-mining sectors remains weak and, as a result, unemployment and poverty rates remain
high. The share of households below the poverty line stood at 30 percent in 2002/03. Botswana
also has one of the world’s highest HIV/AIDS infection rates (estimated by UNAIDS at over

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

35 percent of the adult population), which places a burden on human welfare and public
finances.
Botswana’s recent economic performance has been generally good, apart from an upsurge in
inflation following the May 2005 devaluation and adoption of the crawling peg regime. Real GDP
growth has rebounded in 2004/05 (July-June), mainly due to growth in the mining sector. The
current account surplus has expanded in 2005, and international reserves rose to the equivalent
of 21 months of goods and services imports. The fiscal surplus rose substantially in 2005/06 as
a result of higher diamond revenues and lower-than-budgeted spending. (The authorities
maintain a fiscal rule that sets a ceiling on expenditure at 40 percent of GDP.)
At the time of the May 2005 devaluation, the authorities announced a shift in the exchange rate
regime from an adjustable peg against a basket to a crawling peg against a basket comprising
the South African rand and the SDR. According to the 2006 Monetary Policy Statement of the
Bank of Botswana (BoB), the rate of crawl is set as the difference between Botswana’s inflation
objectives (4–7 percent for 2006 and an average of a 3–6 percent range for the 2006-08 period)
and forecast average inflation of the trading partner countries. The weights and the rate of crawl
have not been announced.
Coinciding with the devaluation and the change in exchange rate regime, consumer price
inflation accelerated from about 6 percent on a year-on-year basis to May 2005 and peaked at
about 14 percent in April 2006. It began declining and was leveling off at about 8 percent in
October 2006, above the authorities’ objective range of 4 to 7 percent inflation for the
December 2005-December 2006 period. The real effective exchange rate has appreciated with
the increase in inflation, offsetting some of the real effect of the May 2005 devaluation in the
period through September 2006.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Botswana’s impressive record of prudent macroeconomic
policy making, sound management of its diamond resources, and good governance, which has
moved Botswana from one of the poorest countries in the world to the upper-middle income
range. Directors noted that macroeconomic performance has continued to be strong over the
last two years, with the exception of inflation, which accelerated substantially, partly as a result
of the May 2005 devaluation and the introduction of a crawling peg. The current level of the
exchange rate was also seen as broadly appropriate in light of the strong current account,
growing non-diamond exports, and the high and stable level of reserves.
Notwithstanding this positive performance, Directors noted that Botswana still faces serious
challenges to continued economic development and poverty reduction. Of particular importance
are the country’s heavy dependence on diamond production, which is projected to plateau over
the next fifteen years and decline sharply thereafter, and the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS
infection rates. Against this background, Directors stressed the need for vigorous efforts to
diversify the economy and to continue the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic, while
preserving macroeconomic stability.

Directors cautioned that the authorities’ announced policy of using interest rates and monetary
policy to achieve the inflation target while using the crawling peg exchange rate regime to target
a real effective exchange rate level could generate conflict among policy objectives. In this
context, most Directors recommended that the authorities give priority to meeting their inflation
objective in setting the rate of crawl and not seek to achieve a real exchange rate target.
Announcement of the parameters of the regime should also help to increase transparency and
anchor exchange rate and inflation expectations. Further, given the authorities’ intention to use
interest rates and monetary policy to rein in inflation, Directors thought that a tighter monetary
policy would be needed if inflation does not soon decline.
Directors considered the authorities’ policy of maintaining a balanced budget to be prudent but,
to anticipate the projected decline in diamond revenues, recommended that the authorities
pursue measures aimed at putting the share of government expenditure on a sustained,
downward path. For 2006/07, in view of the large fiscal impulse implied by the budget, Directors
called on the authorities to maintain the pace of expenditure growth below budgeted levels until
inflationary pressures subside, and for the medium term to target fiscal surpluses associated
with a declining expenditure path. Reducing the size of government and the public sector wage
bill should remain a priority, while preserving HIV/AIDS-related and development spending
through reallocation from nonpriority areas as well as revenue increases. To this end, Directors
welcomed the efforts to broaden the tax base, improve tax administration, and implement user
fees, but advised that increases in tax rates should not be ruled out in light of the scale of the
projected decline in diamond revenue.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans for labor market-related reforms, privatization, and
improvements in the investment environment, which should help promote competitiveness and
diversification of the economy with attendant reductions in unemployment and poverty.
Directors considered the banking sector sound, profitable, and generally well supervised, while
welcoming the planned strengthening of supervision of the non-bank financial institutions. They
looked forward to a further analysis of financial sector issues in the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) slated for early 2007, and welcomed the planned adoption of the
Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) legislation.
Directors noted that Botswana maintains a multiple currency practice (MCP) relating to
exchange rate guarantees on one loan, and urged the authorities to take early action to remove
the practice.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's views and
analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries) concerned, PINs
are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of
developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries
with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy
matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
