IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2016 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of
Croatia
On June 22, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Croatia.
Croatia has been gradually recovering from a six year recession, mostly on the back of strong
exports, tourism activity, and private consumption. These factors, as well as better absorption
of EU structural and investment funds are expected to give a further moderate boost to
economic growth in 2016. However, GDP remains well below its pre-crisis level and
unemployment is very high. Inflation was negative over the past two years, mainly due to
lower energy and food prices. The current account surplus increased significantly in 2015,
but almost half of this increase was due to a one-off decline in profits of foreign-owned
banks related to the conversion of Swiss franc loans. Vulnerabilities remain high due to
elevated public and external debt levels.
The 2015 general government deficit was substantially smaller than anticipated. This was
due to a cyclical upturn in revenue, under-execution of public enterprise investment in the
fourth quarter during the care-taker government, and some consolidation efforts. A further
reduction in the deficit is targeted in 2016, reflecting a combination of a cyclical revenue
upturn and across-the-board freeze of expenditure, excluding items that are funded by the
EU.
Monetary policy has remained relatively accommodative within the limitations of the quasipeg, which does not have a viable alternative at this juncture given the high degree of
euroization. The Central Bank has continued to reduce its key policy rates and ensure ample
liquidity in the banking system. Bank lending, nevertheless, has contracted further, as
enterprises and particular households continued to deleverage.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's
economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board.

2

The banking sector has remained stable and, on average, liquid and well-capitalized. The
system remained profitable during the recession, with the exception of 2015 due to losses
from the Swiss franc loan conversion. The non-performing loan ratio seems to have
stabilized, albeit at a still high level. In 2015, one small, but regionally important, bank began
the resolution process in accordance with the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive.
Although some modest structural reforms have been implemented in recent years, Croatia is
still lagging most EU countries, when comparing standard business environment indicators.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Croatia’s ongoing economic recovery and the reduction of the
fiscal deficit in 2015. Nonetheless, important challenges remain, including high public and
external debts and elevated unemployment. Directors emphasized that decisive and timely
implementation of the new National Reform Program will be crucial to further reduce
vulnerabilities and boost growth and job creation.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue fiscal consolidation in a more
growth-friendly manner. They suggested avoiding reliance on across-the-board expenditure
cuts and focusing on durable and targeted measures. They welcomed the plan to simplify the
tax system, but stressed that any tax reduction should be implemented after making progress
on fiscal consolidation. Directors supported plans to introduce a modern real estate tax,
implement pension reforms, streamline social benefits, improve the efficiency of the
healthcare system, and make part of civil servants’ compensation performance-based.
Directors encouraged the authorities to increase the absorption of EU structural and
investment funds to mitigate any adverse effect of fiscal consolidation on growth.
Directors agreed that monetary policy is appropriately accommodative within the limitations
of the quasi-peg exchange regime, which remains an adequate monetary anchor at this
juncture in the context of euroization. They called for continued efforts to achieve gradual
de-euroization and to safeguard financial stability until the euro can be adopted. Directors
encouraged the Croatian National Bank (CNB) to smooth any sharp fluctuations in the
foreign exchange market and look for opportunities to boost reserves. Directors underlined
the importance of preserving the central bank’s independence.
Directors commended the CNB for maintaining banking system stability and stressed the
need for continued supervisory vigilance. They recommended additional efforts to clear
impaired bank assets to improve credit creation. Directors noted that across-the-board
bailouts similar to the conversion of the Swiss franc loans in 2015 should be avoided in the

future, as they increase the risk of moral hazard and could adversely affect investor
confidence.
Directors urged the authorities to accelerate structural reforms to boost growth and
employment creation and facilitate income convergence with the EU. They highlighted the
need to advance privatization and enhance the efficiency of the public sector, while removing
bureaucratic impediments to doing business. In this regard, they underscored the need to
reduce red tape and streamline overlapping layers of government and public agencies. Other
priorities include further enhancing labor market flexibility to increase labor participation.
Directors noted the importance of building political consensus to ensure broad support for the
reforms.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: The economy is gradually recovering from a six year recession, mostly on the
back of strong exports, tourism activity, and private consumption. Public and external
debt levels and financing needs remain high. Real GDP is still about 11 percent lower
than in 2008, unemployment is high at about 16 percent, and merchandise exports are
low, although improving following EU accession. A new coalition government was
formed in January with a narrow majority and has passed a tight budget and announced
a wide-ranging National Reform Program (NRP) that will require decisive implementation
to achieve Croatia’s economic potential.
Key policy recommendations: Economic priorities in the period ahead are to: (i) reduce
vulnerabilities through fiscal consolidation; and (ii) boost growth and employment
creating by accelerating structural reforms and utilization of EU structural and
investment funds.


Fiscal policy: Adopt a growth-friendly fiscal consolidation strategy to put public
debt firmly on a downward path, advance privatization, and improve the efficiency of
the bloated public sector.



Monetary policy: At this juncture, given the high degree of both deposit and loan
euroization, there is no viable alternative to the quasi-peg to the euro. Within the
limits of this framework, continue to maintain an accommodative monetary policy
stance as long as inflationary pressures and financial stability risks remain subdued.
Ensure adequate international reserve coverage to safeguard monetary and financial
stability and consider options to gradually reduce euroization.



Structural policies: Improve the business climate and further reform the labor
market to strengthen competitiveness and reduce unemployment. Enhance policy
predictability to help improve confidence and investment. Streamline social benefits
that are inefficient and poorly targeted. Address overlaps between different layers of
ministries, agencies, regions, and municipalities to reduce red tape.

Previous staff advice: Deficit reduction in 2015 exceeded staff’s advice, largely due to a
stronger than projected recovery and lower investment in the fourth quarter under the
care-taker government. No major additional progress has been made on structural
reforms since the 2015 Article IV consultation, with the exception of the new Consumer
Bankruptcy Law that came into force in January 1, 2016.

BACKGROUND
A. Context
1.
Croatia has begun since the last quarter of 2014 to gradually recover from a six-year
recession. In 2015 real GDP grew by 1.6 percent,
driven by strong exports and tourism, a revival of
private consumption, and higher public
investment.1 Private investment growth also finally
turned positive. The general government deficit
narrowed due to both a cyclical upturn in
revenues and some consolidation efforts. The
external current account balance also improved
due to strong export growth, a record tourism
season, and low oil prices. Since February 2014,
CPI inflation has largely been in low negative
territory, mostly due to declining energy and food

prices.
2.
Nevertheless, the economy remains rigid
and vulnerabilities are high. Both public and
external debt financing needs are large (about 16
and 19 percent of GDP, respectively in 2016).
Structural reforms have been lagging.
Unemployment remains high and the participation
rate low. Medium-term annual growth is projected
at 2 percent, significantly lower than peers, and per
capita income has a long way to catch up with the
EU average.

below 3 percent of GDP, contain public debt, and thus ultimately exit the Excessive Deficit Procedure
(EDP). The coalition’s election platform included numerous structural reforms as well as populist
measures, although the latter have been scaled back. The recently launched National Reform
Program (NRP) includes wide-ranging reforms, many of which will require political consensus.2

B. Recent Developments
4.
The fledgling recovery has gained traction during 2015, notwithstanding a slowdown
in the last quarter (Figure 1 and Table 1). The external
environment was supportive with strong trading partner
growth, particularly in Italy, Slovenia, and Germany; lagged
effects of full access to EU markets; low energy prices; and
ample global liquidity. Private consumption also began to
recover, aided by an increase in disposable income due to
an upward shift in the income tax thresholds and low
energy costs. Public investment grew, in particular in SOEs,
while private investment growth finally turned positive, in
part reflecting a mild improvement in business confidence.
Growth was broad based with relatively strong performance

transportation, and accommodation and food services.
Trade, transportation, accommodation and food service
5.
Consumer prices have largely been declining
over the past two years, mainly due to lower energy and
food prices. Non-food and non-energy inflation has been
steady, although low by historical standards.
6.
Unemployment declined only slightly since 2014
and remains very high. Both structural and cyclical
unemployment rates—estimated at 11½ percent and 5
percent respectively—are much worse than in peers.
Unemployment is particularly high among the youth and
low-skilled workers, and in less-developed regions. The
participation rate (close to 50 percent) is also lower than in
most peers. Nevertheless, some employers reportedly have
difficulties in attracting seasonal workers, particularly in retail
and catering.

In May 2016, the EC published its country-specific recommendations to address Croatia’s macroeconomic
imbalances (http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/macroeconomic_imbalance_procedure/index_en.htm)
and its assessment of the Convergence Program (http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/country-specificrecommendations/index_en.htm).

7.
The external current account moved further into surplus in 2015, and external debt
declined somewhat (Figure 2). Export growth was about 12 percent in real terms and was broad
based. Moreover, Croatia experienced a record tourist season—with an increase in the number of
tourist arrivals and nights of 9.1 percent and 7.6 percent, respectively. Although import growth
accelerated toward end-2015, the current account surplus increased from 0.9 percent of GDP in
2014 to 5.2 percent of GDP. However, almost half of this increase was due to a one-off decline in
profits of foreign-owned banks (about 2 percent of GDP) related to the conversion of Swiss franc
loans (Annex I). Deleveraging continued and contributed to a reduction in external debt to about
104 percent of GDP from 108 percent of GDP a year earlier.3
8.
The 2015 general government deficit was substantially smaller than anticipated. The
deficit declined to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2015 from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2014 (ESA2010 definition).
This was due to a cyclical upturn in revenue (estimated at 0.5 percent of GDP) and under-execution
of public enterprise investment in the fourth quarter during the care-taker government (estimated at
0.8 percent of GDP). There were also some consolidation efforts, including an increase in excises on
fuel and tobacco, the full-year effect of the 2014 increase in health insurance contributions, and
improved tax administration. On the expenditure side, measures were taken to contain the wage bill
(mainly amending seniority bonuses) and subsidies (as some agricultural subsidies are now being
paid directly by the EU Agricultural Guarantee Fund). As a result, public debt finally stabilized at
close to 87 percent of GDP.

lending has nevertheless remained subdued (Figure 4). The interest rates of some standing facilities
were reduced6 and several measures were taken to ensure ample liquidity. These measures included
broadening the list of securities eligible for CNB facilities, adjusting required reserves,7 and a
quarterly four-year structural reverse repo facility was introduced in February 2016. However, banks’
claims on non-financial enterprises and households declined further by 4.7 percent and 8.0 percent
from March 2015 to March 2016.8
11.
The stability of the banking sector has been maintained despite the drawn-out
recession. On average, the banking system, which is primarily foreign-owned (Austrian and Italian),
is liquid and well-capitalized (21.0 percent CAR at end-2015). Banks remained profitable during the
recession, with the exception of 2015 due to losses from the Swiss franc loan conversion. With the
continued buildup of deposits and subdued lending, deleveraging has continued. The nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio seems to have stabilized, but remains high (16.3 percent of loans).
Nonetheless, NPLs are fairly provisioned. In 2015, one small, but regionally important, bank began
the resolution process in accordance with the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. Outlook
12.
Staff projects growth to strengthen slightly to about 1.9 percent in 2016 and then
stabilize around 2–2¼ percent over the medium term. The growth projections are based on an
anticipated solid export and tourism performance and a continued recovery in domestic demand
(Table 2). Private consumption is expected to be aided by recovering wages, better employment
prospects, and the deleveraging process gradually coming to an end. Both private and public
investment will benefit from larger EU funds absorption. Reduced policy uncertainty, following the
ongoing fiscal consolidation and the launch of the NRP, is expected to encourage both domestic
and foreign investment. Export growth is anticipated to remain strong, but to decelerate, as benefits
from EU accession peter out (Annex II). However, net exports will only contribute moderately to
growth given the increasing imports. Inflation is projected to return to positive territory in late 2016,
with the anticipated increase in energy prices.

6

In 2015, effective October 31, the Lombard rate was halved from 5.0 percent to 2.5 percent, the CNB discount rate
reduced from 7.0 percent to 3.0 percent, the rate on short-term CNB liquidity credits cut from 6.0 percent to 4.0
percent, and the penalty rate on required reserves was lowered from 12.0 percent to 8 percent. The CNB overnight
deposit rate has been zero since April 24, 2013.
7

Effective October 7, 2015, the CNB revoked the regulation relating to compulsory CNB bills. Effective January 13,
2016, the requirement to maintain part of the statutory reserves in foreign exchange was abolished hence providing
banks more flexibility in managing their liquidity and reducing their regulatory costs.
8

However, adjusted for exchange rate movements and write-offs of non-performing loans, the decline of bank
claims on non-financial enterprises and households were much smaller (1.3 and 1.1 percent, respectively).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

13.
Staff projects the 2016 general government deficit at 2.8 percent of GDP, with a
further steady decline to 2.3 percent of GDP over the next few years (baseline scenario). The
2016 budget targets a deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP. The targeted deficit reduction in 2016 reflects a
combination of a cyclical revenue upturn and across-the-board freeze of expenditure, excluding
items that are funded by the EU. However, absent concrete measures to underpin some of the
planned reforms, staff projects a slightly higher deficit in 2016 and a slower pace of consolidation
over the medium term. The cyclically-adjusted primary balance is estimated to improve in 2016 by
about 0.3 percent of potential GDP.
14.

Vulnerabilities remain high due to elevated debt levels:



Public debt, which stood at only 37 percent of GDP in 2007, is projected to stay high at over 86
percent of GDP during 2016–17, although the recent increase is exaggerated due to definitional
changes.9 It will then slowly decline to 82 percent of GDP over the medium term, aided by fiscal
consolidation, low interest rates, and sustained GDP growth (Annex III).



External debt is expected to substantially decline from about 104 percent of GDP in 2015 to a
still high 84 percent of GDP in the medium term, aided by the ongoing private sector
deleveraging and fiscal consolidation. The current account surplus is projected to decline
gradually over the next few years, while foreign reserves would continue to grow slowly
(Annex IV).

B. Risks to the Outlook
15.
The risks to the forecast continue to be tilted to the downside (Annex V). Upside risks
include a return to very low energy prices that would have a favorable impact on production costs
and purchasing power. An acceleration of reforms could also further support growth and
competitiveness, as well as reduce vulnerabilities, and help to unleash the large unutilized potential
of the economy. However, there are substantial downside risks. External demand could slow due to
remaining economic uncertainties in the EU. A normalization of global monetary conditions could
lead to higher costs for the large public and private financing needs. Border disruptions associated
with the refugee crisis could hamper trade and tourism. Fiscal risks include delays in reforms,
including of the public wage system and social benefits, as well as slower absorption of EU structural
and investment funds. Furthermore, domestic political conditions remain challenging with possible
adverse implications for the implementation of the NRP.

9

In 2014, for instance, the inclusion of HBOR (Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development) into the general
government added 4.4 percent of GDP to the public debt. Further widening of the general government debt
coverage would likely be limited.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy
16.
The authorities’ reform program contemplates steady consolidation to reduce the
headline deficit to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2016 and 1.0 percent of GDP by 2019. The authorities
expressed their strong commitment to achieve their deficit target to facilitate exiting the EDP. The

structural measures planned under the NRP.
17.
Staff noted that the NRP will require implementation of specific measures, many of
which involve legislative changes. Furthermore, the CP projects a gradual decline in revenue as a
result of an anticipated lowering of some of the existing high taxes.10 Staff stressed that any tax
reduction should be contingent on progress in expenditure consolidation and success in achieving
the targeted fiscal deficit. Given the substantial downside risks outlined earlier, and absent concrete
measures to fully support the NRP, staff’s baseline scenario reflects only partial implementation of
reforms. Accordingly, staff projects that in this scenario the fiscal deficit would decline to 2.8 percent
of GDP in 2016 and to 2.3 percent of GDP starting in 2019 (Table 3).
18.
Staff viewed the NRP adjustment path as adequate, and encouraged them to achieve it
by decisive implementation of the required reform measures. Staff, therefore, recommended an
adjustment scenario that is similar to the NRP’s path of fiscal consolidation, but that is somewhat
different in the composition of that consolidation. Most importantly, staff recommended less
reliance on across-the-board expenditure reduction and that more focus be placed on streamlining
the high social spending. Staff also stressed that achieving the targeted deficit path would only be
possible by decisively implementing the needed underlying reforms in a timely fashion. In addition,
staff encouraged the authorities to achieve their 2016 deficit target (2.6 percent of GDP), including
by implementing components of the NRP that can be readily introduced in the short run such as
making part of civil servants’ compensation performance based and streamlining some of the
overlapping social benefits. Furthermore, preparatory work for some of the more substantial reforms

The size of government in Croatia has necessitated high tax rates. The standard VAT rate is 25 percent, and the
income tax rate on earnings starting at about €1,800 monthly net of personal allowances is 40 percent. In addition
there are pension, health care, unemployment, and injuries insurance contributions.

(such as improving land registration and the cadastre, which are required for a modern real estate

Advancing civil service and social benefits reforms would be essential to achieve the
fiscal targets, which improve both efficiency and equity. Staff welcomed the consensus reached
between the authorities and social partners to contain the relatively large public sector wage bill and
further postpone increases in public wages.12 Staff also welcomed the plan to make part of the

11

Staff’s advice, including improving the quality of consolidation and an annual deficit reduction of about 0.6 percent
of GDP (which translates to 1.5 percent of GDP total adjustment in the structural balance), are broadly in line with
those of the EC, both with regards to the recommended adjustment path and reform measures. Assuming a smaller
output gap than that estimated by staff, the EC recommends fiscal adjustment that is above 0.5 percent of GDP.
12

In 2009, in reaction to the recession, the authorities and the public sector unions reached an agreement to
postpone public sector wage increases until growth recovered. The trigger was supposed to be activated in the third
quarter of 2015. The estimated budget impact of the wage increase is about 0.5 percent of GDP. An agreement was
recently reached to further postpone any wage increase in view of the lack of fiscal space.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

compensation performance-based in order to improve efficiency and the quality of public services.
With regards to social benefits, staff noted the large size of social spending in relation to GDP (16.5
percent) and recommended accelerating the implementation of the one-stop shop for the
numerous benefits to avoid duplication, while enhancing means-testing to improve targeting.
Furthermore, staff pointed out that reforming the health sector—which currently suffers from large
arrears,13 inefficient use of some hospitals, etc.—is key to reduce costs, while improving the quality
of service. Staff welcomed the recent announced reform of the pension system, which has expedited
the phasing of the increase in the retirement age and raised the early retirement penalty, in line with
EC recommendations.
21.
The authorities expressed their determination to improve the absorption of EU
structural and investment funds to boost growth. This will require improving implementation
capacity and simplifying administrative procedures. Staff supported this intention and highlighted
the need to maintain transparency to reduce the risk of irregularities. Staff also encouraged the
authorities to expedite the transposition of the procurement directive in order to facilitate faster
absorption of EU structural and investment funds.
22.
A determined effort to strengthen public sector management and advance the
planned privatization—specially of inactive assets—in a transparent and fair fashion would
help improve the efficiency of the economy and also put the large public debt on a steeper
downward path. Staff noted that past experience would suggest that receipts from privatization
might take longer to materialize than what is projected under the CP. In addition, staff pointed out
that amending the Fiscal Responsibility Law, in line with best international practice, would be useful,
including strengthen the link between annual budget planning and the multi-year fiscal strategy.

B. Monetary Policy
23.
The Central Bank and staff agreed that at this
juncture there is no viable alternative monetary
anchor to the quasi-peg to the euro, given the high
degree of euroization. Staff encourages the CNB to
continue to smooth sharp exchange rate fluctuations,
while expediting structural reforms in order to enhance
competitiveness. Staff estimated that the REER remains
marginally overvalued by about 3 percent (Annex VI).
24.
Staff encouraged the CNB to continue to accumulate international reserves to cushion
potential shocks. The reserve coverage is still somewhat below the IMF’s ARA (Assessing Reserve
Adequacy) metric. The authorities noted that the virtual absence of foreign investors in the kuna
securities market reduces the risk of destabilizing sell-offs. Moreover, the regulatory regime still
13

The health sector arrears stood at kuna 2.5 billion (0.76 percent of GDP) as of end-2015, a slight decline from kuna
2.8 billion at end-2014.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

mandates banks to maintain sizable FX liquidity buffers, which also alleviate risks. The CNB rarely
purchases FX in the spot market except receipts from eurobonds issued by the government. Staff
welcomes the CNB’s openness to look for further opportunities to boost reserves—given the strong
current account surplus and the recent appreciation of the kuna/euro rate (about 2.8 percent from
February 2015 to April 2016).
25.
Staff supports the CNB’s relatively accommodative stance within the limitations of the
monetary regime. The CNB has adequately responded to the drawn-out recession and the loose
global monetary conditions by gradually reducing interest rates and easing of required reserves.
Staff welcomed the introduction, in February 2016, of a four-year structural reverse repo facility that
is intended to provide stable long-term kuna funding. In principle, this should contribute to a
gradual reduction of the high degree of euroization.
26.
Staff explored with the authorities the reasons behind the traditional high degree of
euroization. Both loans and deposits denominated in foreign currency (FX) or indexed to FX have
for decades fluctuated around 70 percent. The high degree of euroization is primarily supply driven
by persistent preferences to save in FX—likely reflecting the experiences of hyperinflation in the
1990s—in spite of interest differentials. Banks, with a view to avoid having a net open position, have
accordingly issued FX loans, including to un-hedged borrowers. Over time, the authorities have
taken several measures to reduce euroization, including macro-prudential tools, some of which were
given up with EU accession. Since mid-2015, banks have been required to offer alternative kuna
loans to un-hedged households and to illustrate the potential impact of exchange rate changes.
Staff pointed out that differentiating macro-prudential tools or increased capital requirements for
more risky lending practices (pillar II) could prove beneficial for financial sector stability until Croatia
adopts the euro in line with its intention.
27.
Staff stressed the importance of preserving the independence, accountability, and
transparency of the CNB in line with Croatia’s commitment to the Statute of the European
System of Central Banks. The Parliament has been seeking to increase its oversight of the CNB,
including by considering amendments to the Law on the CNB.14 The authorities concurred with staff
that the independence of the CNB must be protected, while maintaining its accountability and
transparency. Staff underlined that the wording of the proposed amendments to the Law on the
CNB need to be carefully calibrated to avoid any unintended consequences.

C. Financial System
28.
Staff encouraged the CNB to continue its conservative prudential policies and
supervisory vigilance. The CNB has used the flexibility of the EU rules to maintain high capital
buffers, which, on average would be sufficient to cover the un-provisioned part of NPLs.
14

The current proposal includes three amendments: (i) the Parliament may approve the annual report of the CNB,
rather than only discuss it; (ii) the six-year terms for board members would be limited to two terms; and, (iii) in
addition to the current requirement of an independent external audit, the CNB would also be audited by the State
Auditor.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

29.
The apparent stabilization of NPL levels is encouraging. The CNB noted that the
strengthened provision requirements, introduced in 2013, have encouraged banks to sell NPLs or
write them off. However, tax issues remain an obstacle, but the NRP includes measures to address
these concerns and thus facilitate resolving the debt-overhang of many corporations. Staff also
welcomed the objective of the new Consumer Bankruptcy Act, which came into force in January 1,
2016, and the incorporation of the Pre-Bankruptcy Settlement Law into the bankruptcy legislation.
However, it is too early to tell if these changes will reduce the costs and uncertainty about future
debt recoveries.
30.
Staff expressed concerns about the handling of the conversion of Swiss franc
household loans into euros and advised against future across-the-board bailouts. As argued in
the 2015 Article IV consultation, staff would have preferred that pertinent parties would have found
a more balanced solution with a view to prevent moral hazard problems, while seeking other means
to assist the neediest borrowers.
31.
Staff explored with the authorities underlying factors that may explain the continued
subdued bank lending. The CNB and market observers believe that subdued lending is primarily a
demand rather than a supply challenge. An exception to this view concerns small and medium-sized
companies without sufficient collateral or a long track record to mitigate their, typically, higher risk.
32.
The Croatian Development Bank (HBOR) is filling an important gap in supporting
exporters and SMEs, but is not subject to the CNB’s supervision. The authorities stressed that
HBOR does not accept deposits from the general public and should thus not be subject to
supervision by the CNB. Moreover, HBOR is subject to audits by independent external auditors and
the State Audit Office. Staff acknowledged that HBOR’s main activities are different from commercial
banks—it functions as an export credit agency, export bank, and as a development bank—but also
noted that its direct lending is growing and may merit supervision similar to commercial banks. The
authorities are considering an independent asset quality review of HBOR’s credit portfolio, which
would be an important step to address this concern.

D. Structural Reforms
33.
Advancing structural reforms is crucial to boost growth and employment creation and
to enhance competitiveness. Staff welcomed the progress made with implementing structural
reforms in recent years. The labor law was amended to reduce the cost of workforce restructuring
and increase the flexibility of working hours. Furthermore, some central government social benefits
were streamlined and became means-tested, and the regime for special pensions was tightened. In
addition, the performance of some SOEs improved following restructuring and stricter oversight.
The government also started a pilot program to review the administrative burden on businesses
with a view to reduce it in the services sector by at least 20 percent by end-2016.
34.
Standard business environment indicators suggest significant room for further
improvement (Figures 6 and 7). Although real labor market productivity has improved, peers have
performed better. In addition, SOEs continue to play a substantial role in the economy; red tape
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

remains substantial, especially at the local government level; and a weak business environment has
been discouraging private investment, including FDI. Business surveys and interviews have
highlighted the need for: (i) improving policy transparency and predictability; (ii) strengthening anticorruption efforts and the judiciary system in general; (iii) reducing the regulatory burden and the
large number and multiple layers of municipalities and public agencies; (iv) and further improving
the ease of paying taxes. Implementing such reforms would be crucial to help increase Croatia’s
ease of doing business compared to other EU countries. Streamlining the large number of
municipalities and public agencies would also help reduce red tape and the high administrative
burden on businesses, while facilitating an improvement in the capacity to provide higher quality
public services.
35.
Given the high unemployment and low participation rates, more ambitious labor
market reforms are needed. Recent gradual reforms have increased flexibility and reduced
restructuring costs. However, some areas of employment protection, including the regulation on
temporary forms of employment and the amount of severance payments and notification period for
dismissal, remain restrictive compared to peers. Furthermore, there is a need for achieving a better
balance between social protection and incentives to work. Staff encouraged the authorities to
address these issues in order to increase labor force participation rates, which remains significantly
below EU averages.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Croatia’s recent economic recovery is encouraging, but the return to a sustained and
strong growth path is not yet assured. Real GDP is still about 11 percent lower than it was in
2008, and the medium-term growth prospects remain shy of converging towards EU average
income levels. Unemployment and regional disparities within Croatia also remain high.
37.
Structural rigidities and the large public and external debt increase the economy’s
vulnerability. Substantial structural and fiscal reforms have been lagging, undermining the business
climate and placing Croatia on an unsustainable debt path. The recent fiscal consolidation and the
newly launched NRP set the stage for promising reforms. Decisive implementation of these reforms
will be critical to reduce vulnerabilities and boost growth and employment creation, as well as to
facilitate an earlier exit from the EDP.
38.
Fiscal policy has been reoriented with the firm intention to reduce the deficit and
large public debt. However, the largely ad-hoc nature of the structural fiscal adjustment in 2015 is
suboptimal. Furthermore, the 2016 budget’s across-the-board expenditure control should be clearly
viewed as a second-best approach. It is important that a more growth-friendly consolidation start
next year.
39.
The plan to simplify the tax system and possibly reduce some of the high taxes, is
welcome, but would be premature if implemented before making progress in fiscal
consolidation. The ongoing comprehensive tax review will also help design reforms to simplify the
tax system. The adoption of a modern real estate tax in line with past TA recommendations would
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

also be crucial to create fiscal space. Its success is contingent on timely implementation of required
improvements in land registration and the cadastre.
40.
The intentions to reduce inefficient public expenditures and to streamline the
extensive and overlapping system of local government and public agencies are also
encouraging. Reforming the public sector wages system and the complex regime of the various
transfers and subsidies would help promote efficiency and equity, while generating fiscal savings.
Advancing such reforms in the health sector in cooperation with the World Bank is particularly
important in view of its large arrears and existing inefficiencies. Accelerating the absorption of EU
funds would also support growth and employment creation in the context of the fiscal
consolidation.
41.
Monetary policy has been appropriately accommodative within the limitations of the
exchange rate anchor. Maintaining an accommodative stance would be useful to support growth,
as long as risks to financial stability and inflation remain subdued. At this juncture, there is no viable
alternative to the quasi-peg given the high degree of euroization. The CNB is encouraged to
smooth sharp fluctuations in the foreign exchange market and to look for further opportunities to
boost reserves, in view of the relatively low level and strong balance of payments position.
42.
The banking sector has remained robust throughout the long recession. To preserve
this impressive record, it would be important to continue to exercise conservative prudential
policies and supervisory vigilance, and to take prompt action when capital requirements are
breached. Across-the-board bailouts similar to the conversion of the Swiss franc loans should be
avoided in the future as they increase the risk of moral hazard and can affect Croatia’s investor
confidence. It is also critical to preserve the independence of the Central Bank, while maintaining
transparency and accountability.
43.
Decisive implementation of structural reforms is crucial to reduce the high
unemployment and raise income levels towards the EU average over time. Key reforms include
enhancing the efficiency of public administration and SOEs, and removing bureaucratic impediments
to doing business. In this regard, it is very important to streamline the overlapping layers of
government and public agencies. Strengthening the targeting of social benefits and improving the
regulations governing seasonal hiring may reduce the reservation wage and increase labor market
flexibility, which would help reduce unemployment and increase the low labor participation rate.
44.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Croatia be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Annex I. Conversion of Swiss Franc Loans to Euro1

The Swiss franc appreciation vis-à-vis the kuna (about 55 percent from September

2008 to September 2015) caused problems for many un-hedged Croatian households. Loans

clients to retroactively convert their clients’ Swiss franc denominated or indexed loans to
euro. Past principal and interest payments on Swiss franc loans were recomputed as if borrowers
had been indebted in variable rate euro loans. By April 2016, about 5,000 loans were reportedly still
in the process of conversion, although almost 94 percent (amount) had been converted. The cost to
banks has been estimated at about 2 percent of GDP by the CNB. Banks have on average remained
profitable, even during the prolonged recession, but the conversion resulted in their making a loss in
2015. Although sizable, this was manageable from a financial stability perspective due to the high
bank capitalization (CAR of 20.9 percent at end-2015). Households with Swiss franc loans reduced
their debt and substantial uncertainty was removed. Currency risk, however, has been substituted by

interest risk. Following the decision, the CNB intervened in the FX market (€268 million) and
provided domestic liquidity with a view to prevent excess volatility. The government is also facing a
revenue loss, as banks can deduct these losses from future profits.2 Moreover, the decision has been
challenged in the Constitutional Court and some banks are contemplating filing complaints at the
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. The EC is closely following the situation
and is encouraging a balanced solution.

The estimated revenue losses in 2016 (0.2 percent of GDP) has been included in the baseline fiscal projection.
Further losses in 2017 and onwards are not expected by the authorities and staff.

Annex II. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis1
Public debt has started to stabilize, albeit at a still elevated level. It stood at 86.7 percent of GDP
at end-2015. The gross financing needs are also high, almost 19 percent of GDP, reflecting large
rollovers of existing debt. Under the baseline, debt will begin to gradually decline starting 2016, and
will continue declining at a moderate pace over the medium term. However, this projection is
vulnerable to growth prospects turning out to be less favorable than expected. The most recently
available data reveal that the outstanding government guarantees to state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
amount to 3–4 percent of GDP. These are not included in the public debt statistics, and could be
another source of risks to debt sustainability. On the other hand, the authorities announced intentions
to sell state assets for the purpose of public debt reduction. The analysis includes a conservative
estimate for the expected proceeds.

The baseline scenario incorporates the newly passed 2016 budget, the most recent

Convergence Program and the National Reform Program.

percent of GDP. The deficit is projected to further decline to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2016, and to
2.3 percent of GDP over the medium term.
Growth: Real GDP growth is estimated at 1.6 percent for 2015, with Croatia finally exiting the six



year-long recession. Going forward, the recovery is expected to gradually gain momentum,
converging to a potential real growth rate of about 2 percent.
2.


Risks to the baseline come mainly from less favorable growth prospects
Croatia’s real GDP growth forecast has been optimistic since 2009—reflecting mostly premature
expectations of recovery—and the median forecast error is in the top decile of surveillance
countries with market access. This points to a need for growth shocks in the stress tests.



The 3-year adjustment of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance in Croatia is relatively sizable,
but far from extreme in cross-country comparison. Going forward, fiscal consolidation is also
assisted by the ongoing economic recovery, thus the risks that consolidation is not carried out
with sufficient pace become less significant compared to previous assessment.

3.

There are risks to debt sustainability. Staff projects that the debt-to-GDP ratio will start to

gradually decline in 2016, and be slightly below 82 percent of GDP by 2021. This development
mainly reflects a neutral interest rate-growth differential and the consolidation efforts. Gross
financing needs are projected at 17 percent of GDP in 2021, due to the large fiscal deficits
accumulated since 2009, and the relatively short maturity of public debt.
4.


Shocks and Stress Tests
Slower output growth is the main risk to debt sustainability. Underperformance of real GDP
growth by one standard deviation in 2016 and 2017 would lead to a deterioration of the primary
balance, as nominal revenues fall against unchanged spending. The primary deficit would
deteriorate to about 3½ percent of GDP in 2017, before improving over the medium-term. The
primary balance leads to a slight increase in risk premia and a sharp increase in public debt,
which peaks at over 100 percent of GDP in 2018 before heading downwards. Gross financing
needs will also increase to close to 23 percent of GDP in 2018.



A combination of macro-fiscal shocks further highlights the sensibility of public debt and
gross financing needs to adverse scenarios. Assuming that shocks to real GDP growth, the
primary balance, real exchange rate, and real interest rate occur simultaneously, public debt
would increase sharply and reach almost 105 percent of GDP at its peak. Gross financing needs
would approach 22½ percent of GDP in 2021.

Annex IV. Risk Assessment Matrix1
Source of Risks
More volatile global financial conditions:
Sharp asset price decline and decompression of credit
spreads as investors reassess underlying risk and
respond to unanticipated changes in growth and
financial fundamentals in large economies, Fed policy
rate path, and increases in U.S. term premia, with poor
market liquidity amplifying volatility.
Surge in the US dollar. Improving U.S. economic prospects
versus the rest of the world leads to a further dollar
surge, boosting non-U.S. trade but creating balance
sheet strains.
Structurally weak growth in key advanced and
emerging economies. Weak demand and persistently
low inflation from a failure to fully address crisis
legacies and undertake structural reforms, leading to
low medium-term growth and persisting financial
imbalances in the Euro area and Japan. Easy global
financial conditions coming to an end and insufficient
reform progress undermining medium-term growth
prospects in emerging markets and suppress
commodity prices.
Heightened risk of fragmentation/security dislocation
in part of the Middle East, Africa, and Europe,
leading to a sharp rise in migrant flows, with negative
global spillovers

Persistently lower energy prices, triggered by supply
factors reversing only gradually.

Domestic political risks: further delays of fiscal
consolidation and structural reforms depressing business
and consumer confidence.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view
of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a
probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM
reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive
risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and
3 years, respectively.

Annex V. National Reform Program1
1.

The objectives of the 2016 National Reform Program (NRP) are to: (i) maintain

macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability; (ii) improve the business environment; (iii)
increase the effectiveness and transparency of the public sector; and, (iv) enhance education
and training to better support the labor market. Key measures are summarized below.
Perform a comprehensive review of the tax system in 2016, with a view to simplify



administration and compliance, as well as to consider lowering some of the high rates over the
medium term, while compensating part of the potential tax revenue loss by broadening the tax
base.
Introduce a modern value-based real estate tax. During the first phase (2018), the land



registry and cadastre will be modernized, and the coverage broadened, while replacing tax
breaks granted by local governments with ones regulated by national law. During the second
phase (2020), a tax based on property valuation (rather the physical characteristics and location)
will be introduced.
Strengthen expenditure control. This would be achieved mainly through introducing a freeze



on new hires, reducing of bonuses for years of service, introducing performance-based
compensation for civil servants, and improving public procurement procedures.
Streamline social benefits. This will involve systematic introduction of means/income testing,



unification of all social benefits records at the national level, and establishing a guaranteed
minimum standard for the various benefits/services. The authorities plan to start expanding
means testing to child allowances by September 2016 and adopt a new Social Welfare Act that
establishes a one-stop-shop for benefits administration by March 2017.
Reduce healthcare costs and arrears. Emergency medicine will be reformed with a view to



reduce the number of unnecessary visits, the hospital network will be rationalized, and
procurement procedures for medicine, equipment, and services will be improved.
Improve the sustainability of the pension system. The authorities will speed up the planned



increase of the minimum retirement age for women by 6 months in each of the coming years
until 2023 (instead of the originally planned 3 months in each year until 2030). Between 2024
and 2027, the minimum retirement age for both men and women will increase by six months per

year, up to 62 years for early retirement and 67 years for normal retirement (instead of the
originally planned 3 months per year until 2038). In addition, the authorities plan to further
increase the penalty for early retirement.


Reduce administrative barriers to doing business. This will be achieved by developing
electronic procedures for starting a business and introducing as a pilot standard administrative
cost assessment system with a view to cutting regulatory burden on businesses by 20 percent
for the pilot sectors by the end-2016, and by 25 percent by mid-2018. Furthermore, the NRP
aims to reduce the number of administrative bodies at the central government level and
improving the organizational model of local self-government operations.



Harmonize educational programs with needs of the labor market at both vocational and
higher education levels.

Annex VI. Real Exchange Rate Assessment and Competitiveness1
1.

Most assessment methods suggest a marginal overvaluation of Croatia’s real effective

exchange rate (REER). According to the EBA-lite methodology, the overvaluation is estimated at
about 3.1 percent. EBA-lite estimates a country’s current account (CA) norm based on economic
fundamentals (similar to the macro balance approach), cyclical factors, and desirable medium-term
policy levels. The present-year CA was adjusted to account for a one-off decline in profits of foreignowned banks related to the conversion of Swiss franc loans affecting the primary income balance
(2.0 percent).2 The exchange rate
misalignment is defined as the
adjustment necessary to bring the
CA back to its norm. Using the EBA
approach, the adjusted CA balance
in 2015 is somewhat below the

norm, with the policy gap mostly explained by the large fiscal deficit in 2015.
2.

In addition, the index REER EBA-lite model (that compares staff’s projected REER in

2015 with its norm, both expressed in logs) signals an overvaluation of about 2.6 percent.
Finally, the EBA-lite External Sustainability (ES)
approach—that compares Croatia’s projected
net IIP position with a sustainable level, and
computes the REER revaluation needed for
this—points to an overvaluation of about 3.2

percent in a scenario stabilizing the net IIP at 40 percent.
3.

A measure comparing Croatia’s unit real labor cost (ULC) with peers points to an

overvaluation of about 5.8 percent, suggesting that Croatia has made progress in reducing its
ULC in recent years. Although real labor market productivity per hour has improved, peers have
performed better. While Croatian goods exports are no longer losing market share, the current
account remains highly dependent on tourism. This together with red tape, especially at the local
government level, and a weak business environment has discouraged FDI, which has been
instrumental to develop export-oriented sectors in peer countries.

As in the 2015 Art IV assessment, an adjustment was done for temporary factors due to import compression in
response to extraordinary weak demand while Croatia’s private sector draws down excess debt levels.

Annex VII. Reducing Fiscal Fragmentation1
1.

Despite the limited degree of expenditure and revenue decentralization,

fragmentation of the subnational government structure in Croatia is high. Croatia has a twotier subnational government structure consisting of 21
counties and 555 municipalities. All municipalities and
cities are assigned the same spending responsibilities
regardless of their fiscal and administrative capacity to
provide a comparable range and quality of public service
and social protection. Subnational government spending
has been increasingly tilted towards wages and
operational costs, which results in low public investment
compared to peers. Subnational governments have limited
own revenue, constituting only one third of their total
revenue. The rest of their revenue comes from the shared taxes and grants provided by the central
government. Subnational governments are not allowed to borrow freely, but their financial linkages
with the local utility companies pose fiscal risks.
2.

While there is no “one size-fits-all” model for the optimal subnational government

structure, there are established good practices. It is necessary from an ex ante perspective to
broadly match the spending responsibilities to the overall resources available at each level of
government. Revenue arrangements should conform to the general principle that funds follow
functions. The
specific design of
the fiscal
decentralization
should take into
account the
geographic,
historical, sociopolitical, and
economic setting. However, a sound and transparent public financial management (PFM) framework
is always necessary to support successful decentralization. Such framework usually includes an

1

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

adequate accounting system, a timely and realistic budgeting procedure, and an effective audit and
control mechanism.
3.

Croatia’s fiscal decentralization structure lacks a clear concept and a regional

development strategy. The number of municipalities in Croatia is on the high side, in view of the
size of population and implementation capacity as well as the equally large size of public agencies. It
would be useful to review this structure to take into account the administrative capacity and to
avoid excessive disparities in the scope and quality of the various services and to reduce the red
tape they create and quasi fiscal charges they levy on businesses and citizens. Furthermore, some
form of shared provision of public services between municipalities and closer collaboration with the
central should be encouraged. Subnational governments should also increase their reliance on a
limited and well-defined number of own-source taxes such as a modern property tax, and the ability
to freely impose charges or require local permits should be limited.

When a member has overdue financial obligations outstanding for more than three months, the

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
In December 1991, Croatia adopted the Croatian dinar as its sole legal tender. The Croatian dinar
was replaced by the Croatian kuna on May 30, 1994. The exchange rate of the kuna is determined by
supply and demand in the interbank market, with tight management of the kuna-euro exchange
rate by the Croatian National Bank (CNB). Croatia’s de jure exchange rate is a managed float without

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

a predetermined path. Croatia’s de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like
arrangement from April 30, 2011. The CNB transacts only in euros, U.S. dollars, and SDRs. On
May 26, 2016, the official exchange rate was kuna 7.489778 per euro (middle rate).
Exchange Restrictions:

Croatia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2–4 and maintains an exchange
system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions, except for restrictions that Croatia maintains solely for the preservation of national
or international security that have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board
Decision 144 (52/51).1
Article IV Consultation:

The previous Article IV consultation with Croatia was concluded on June 24, 2015 (IMF
Country Report No. 15/163: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=43037.0).
Croatia is on the 12-month consultation cycle.
FSAP:

An FSAP Update mission took place in October–November 2007. The FSSA Update was
published (IMF Country Report No. 160: http://www.imf.org/external/country/hrv/index.htm)
The original FSAP was concluded with the completion of the 2002 Article IV consultation on
August 5, 2002 on the basis of missions that took place in April 2001 and September 2001. The
FSSA was published (IMF Country Report No. 02/180:
http://www.imf.org/external/country/hrv/index.htm).

1

On January 23, 2015, the Croatian Parliament amended the Consumer Credit Act, temporarily freezing for one year
the HRK/CHF exchange rate for interest and installment payments on consumer loans indexed to or denominated in
Swiss Francs. The Croatian National Bank informed Fund staff that interest and installment payments of CHFdenominated loans are always made in kuna, and accordingly that the frozen exchange rate is used only for
accounting purposes and not for actual foreign exchange transactions. Accordingly, staff does not find this
amendment to give rise to a multiple currency practice subject to Article VIII, Section 3.

WORLD BANK RELATIONS
1.
The World Bank’s Board endorsed the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Croatia for
fiscal years (FY) 2014–17 in June 2013, with the goal to assist Croatia's convergence with the EU
through an engagement that is focused on key reform-based outcomes. For the World Bank Group
(WBG), priority will be placed on aspects of the Europe 2020 “smart, sustainable and inclusive
growth” strategy; and the government’s new reform agenda that focuses on the economic
management, state institutions, business environment, and responsibility toward shared regional
assets. In pursuing these goals, the WBG program aims at contributing in the following three areas:


Fiscal adjustment through reforms at the sector level;



Innovation and trade competitiveness for growth and shared prosperity; and,



Helping maximize the economic benefits of becoming an EU member state.

2.
The CPS envisages an indicative base-case lending envelope of about US$800 million. For
the FY14–17 lending program, DPLs will continue to play an important role based on the need to
combine policy reform with budget finance. At the same time, Croatia and the Bank, explored the
use of new investment financing instruments like results-based operations, as the share of
traditional investment financing should decrease during the CPS period. The lending program has
been based on and complemented by analytical work, particularly in the areas of public expenditure
reform, governance, EU preparedness, investment climate, higher education, and trade
competitiveness.
3.
In FY15, the Bank’s Board approved two loans amounting to US$278 million including
Croatia Railway project (US$183.35 million) and Social Protection System Modernization Project
(US$95.55 million). In FY16, the Board approved a loan toward Entrepreneurship Venture Capital
project (US$21.92 million). Currently, the World Bank finances 11 operations in a wide range of
sectors totaling US$876.27 million. In FY15, IFC invested up to US$45million in Rudine Wind Power
Plant in Croatia. Currently, IFC’s investments portfolio consists of 7 projects across a variety of
sectors including in the financial sector, renewable energy, infrastructure, agribusiness, life sciences,
and general manufacturing. Across all sectors, IFC prioritizes investment in Croatia’s less-developed
regions and in projects that contribute to greater economic diversification and regional integration.
MIGA's outstanding gross exposure in Croatia as of June 30, 2015 was US$525 million in support of
financial institutions and a retail sector.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Croatia—Statistical Issues
(As of April 30, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, with shortcomings related to data
coverage and reliability, especially for national and fiscal accounts. Progress to resolve these
shortcomings are impeded by insufficient resources and a lack of coordination among government
agencies.
National Accounts: The national accounts have undergone substantial improvements in recent years.
The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) publishes constant and current price data compiled in
accordance with the ESA 2010 standard. However, a breakdown of gross fixed capital formation into
private and public components is not yet published. Discrepancies exist between nominal
government consumption in national accounts and government consumption reported in
government ESA 2010 accounts. Quarterly GDP estimates are disseminated at current prices and at
prices of the previous year for the main categories of expenditures and main economic activities.
Nonetheless, shortcomings remain. Discrepancies exist between expenditure-based and value-addedbased GDP data, stemming from: (i) incomplete coverage of unincorporated businesses and the selfemployed (farmers, traders, and craftsmen); (ii) inadequate data for measuring changes in inventories;
(iii) incomplete coverage of the informal sector; and (iv) a lack of quarterly data for the seasonally
volatile agricultural sector.
Wages and Employment: The CBS produces data on average net and gross earnings per person and
employment by sector. Currently, the CBS is in the process of reviewing the data series.
Earnings data include bonuses (in sums that are subjects to contributions, taxes, and surtaxes), sick
pay, and meal allowances. They are based on monthly surveys covering 70 percent of workers in
permanent employment in each division of NKD 2007 (NACE Rev. 2). They do not cover a significant
part of the working population, including persons employed in trade and crafts, contract workers, and
farmers.
The number of registered unemployed overstates the actual level of unemployment. However, the
discrepancy has significantly diminished in 2014. A preliminary Labor Force Survey, which meets ILO
standards, was conducted for the first time in 1996 on 7,200 households. The sample was
subsequently expanded and the survey is now being conducted on a regular basis. Semi-annual
results have been released since 1998, and quarterly results since 2007, with a lag of about four
months.
Price Statistics: The CBS produces a monthly consumer price index, with expenditure weights
(updated every five years) derived from a Household Budget Survey. Between rebasing, the weights
are price-updated annually to December of the previous year. Data are collected at different time
periods in the month for different product groups, but in most cases between the thirteenth and the
twenty-third day of each month. (Prices of agricultural products sold in market places are recorded on
the first and third Friday in a month and prices of fuel for passenger cars weekly.) The indices are
released around the fifteenth day of the following month. The price collection is confined to nine
towns, but the weights are based on a sample of households in the whole country.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

Croatia—Statistical Issues (Continued)
(As of April 30, 2016)
A harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) is also calculated in line with Eurostat methodology.
A core CPI is calculated based on a methodology developed by the Croatian National Bank (CNB).
The CBS also releases a monthly producer price index (PPI), usually on the eighth day of the following
month. The weighting system of the PPI is based on the 2000 Annual Report of Industry and is
changed every five years, while weights are partially corrected every year.
Government Finance Statistics: The authorities have started presenting some budget plans based
on the ESA 2010 framework. However, the State Budget and the local budgets are based on the
national Chart of Accounts. Historical general government data based on ESA 2010 definitions are
published nationally by the Croatian Bureau of Statistics and by Eurostat, but are frequently revised
due to methodological and data source improvements. Additional analysis has been initiated in order
to assess whether some enterprises owned by local government units should be included in the
government sector according to the ESA 2010 criteria.
Budget execution (cash) data are produced on a monthly basis on the GFSM framework (GFS 2001)
and are available in the Monthly Statistical Review of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and in the timeseries database, both published on the website of the MOF. Central government data normally come
with a lag of about six weeks, but end-of-year data often with much longer lags. Revenue data are
reliable, and expenditure data on a cash basis are available according to GFS classifications (economic
and functional) for the central budget and extra-budgetary funds. However, changes of institutions
included in the central government are not always clearly indicated, hence central government figures
are not fully comparable over time.
Cash data for the operations of local governments and the consolidated general government are
available on a quarterly basis, but for end-of-year data with long lags. Starting from the JanuaryMarch 2015 period, data for local and regional self-government units (local units), instead of former
53 largest, include all 576 local units and the local units' extra-budgetary users - county road
administrations.
According to the latest Agreement on cooperation in the field of national accounts of general
government and related statistics (signed on July 31, 2013 between the Croatian Bureau of Statistics,
Croatian National Bank (CNB), and Ministry of Finance), the CNB took over the responsibility for the
compilation of general government debt statistics. The CNB is compiling general government debt
according to ESA 2010 and EDP definitions and publishes these data in the CNB Monthly Bulletin.
Data showing the level of central government guaranteed debt are presented as a part of the
reporting table in the CNB Monthly Bulletin.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Beginning 2015, the CNB has started published monetary
statistics using the ESA 2010 framework, with some backward revisions of historical data series. Since
June 2013, the IMF’s Statistics Department receives monetary statistics on Croatia directly from the
European Central Bank.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

Croatia—Statistical Issues (Continued)
(As of April 30, 2016)
Previously, the CNB compiled and reported monetary data for publication in International Financial
Statistics (IFS) in accordance with the 1995 ESA standards and the European Central Bank’s framework
for monetary statistics using the national residency approach. For December 2001 to June 2013,
monetary statistics in IFS were based on the Standardized Report Forms developed by the IMF’s
Statistics Department, in accordance with the concepts and definitions in the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual, 2000. For December 2010 through June 2013, the CNB has reported revised data for
other depository corporations covering money market funds in addition to the licensed banks,
savings banks, and housing savings banks, which represent other monetary financial institutions in
accordance with the 1995 ESA standards.
Financial Sector Surveillance: The CNB is the banking supervisor and publishes selected financial
soundness indicators (FSI) on its website, reports to the IMF’s Financial Soundness Indicator Database,
and provides IMF staff with a broad range of FSIs. A general description of the stress testing
methodologies used on the Croatian banking system is included in the Financial Stability Report,
published by the CNB twice a year. Summary balance sheets and profit and loss statements of
individual banks are reported in the Banking Bulletin, published twice a year, with a lag of six to nine
months.
The Croatian Financial Services Supervisory Agency (HANFA) publishes monthly reports and monthly
summary statistics on the sectors it regulates and supervises (capital markets, investment funds,
private pension sector, insurance, leasing, and factoring companies).
External Sector Statistics: Quarterly balance of payments and international investment position data
are compiled broadly in accordance with the sixth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual
(BPM6). Data are generally available with a lag of three months and are subject to revisions in
subsequent releases. Net errors and omissions have ranged from 1 to 3½ percent of GDP since 2005,
and are negative. The coverage and quality of portfolio investment data are reasonably complete and
accurate.
Croatia participates in the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) and plans to participate in the
Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) after the new security database becomes operational.
Data on the International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity (Reserve Data Template) are
available with a lag of one to two months.
Croatia compiles external debt data according to the requirements of External Debt Statistics: Guide
for Compilers and Users, 2013.

since May 1996, and met all SDDS requirements
in March 2001.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director for the Republic of Croatia
and Tsvetan Manchev, Advisor to Executive Director
June 22, 2016
The Croatian authorities highly appreciate the constructive policy dialogue with the IMF mission
during the 2016 Article IV Consultation, and thank staff for the appraisal and policy
recommendations. They also welcome the staff analyses in the Selected Issues paper. The
authorities are committed to prudent macroeconomic policies which properly address
vulnerabilities in line with the country specifics and promote sustainable growth. They believe
that the policy discussions with the Fund will help to set the appropriate policy mix needed to
strengthen the economic recovery and achieve goals of the Government’s National Reform
Program (NPR) presented in May.
Recent economic developments and outlook
Staff and the authorities share views on the recent developments, outlook and risks. The
economy has finally bottomed out in 2015, which is expected to strengthen public support for the
reform agenda. The recovery has gained some more traction in Q1 2016 when GDP growth
reached 2.7 percent y-o-y. Growth also becomes more broad-based since all the elements of final
demand have registered a positive contribution for the first time in many years. Exports grew by
7.1 percent y-o-y, gross fixed capital formation by 4.3 percent, personal consumption by 3.1
percent, and the government consumption by 0.6 percent. In April, adjusted industrial output was
up by 4.9 percent y-o-y and retail trade growth was positive for the 21st consecutive month, with
nominal sales growth at 0.7 percent y-o-y.
The recovery of economic activity in 2015 and early 2016 reflected a favorable labor market.
The positive trends will continue, although at slower pace, along with projected employment
growth and a decreased unemployment rate. The number of unemployed declined and is trending
below the 2015 minimum ahead of the peak of the tourist season. Despite unfavorable
demographic trends, economic recovery will also have certain positive effects on the rate of
labor force participation.
Fiscal policy and debt management
Like staff, the authorities see that growth recovery provides an excellent window of opportunity
to progress with the additional fiscal consolidation and debt restructuring, successfully exit from
the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure, and put the public debt on a sound footing over the
medium term. In line with macroeconomic projections for the period 2016-19, and based on the
implementation of structural reform measures, the fiscal consolidation strategy of the new
government launched with the NRP aims to reduce the planned budget deficit on a consolidated
basis to 1 percent of GDP in 2019. These positive trends regarding the significant reduction of
the budget deficit, and taking into account the privatization incomes and a change of government
deposits, will lead to a reduction of the public debt to GDP ratio in 2016 to 85.9 percent, after
several years of strong increase. It is expected that the public debt to GDP ratio will be gradually
reduced to 80 percent of the GDP by 2019.
A balanced approach to the fiscal consolidation for the 2016-2019 is envisaged, including
measures on both the revenue and expenditure side in order to minimize the negative impact on
growth. The recently updated NRP presents in details the key fiscal reforms which are focused

2
on: (1) introduction of a modern real estate tax by January 2018; (2) reform in public
administration by making part of public servants’ compensation performance-based; (3)
streamlining social benefits; (4) reforming the pension system; and (5) activation of state
property. The NPR implementation, however, requires important legislative changes and in the
current domestic political juncture, and some more time is needed to build the necessary
consensus to reforms. In line with that, the largest structural measure in 2016 on the revenues
side is to further enhance the tax system and strengthen the tax administration, while
implementing the required improvements in land registration and the cadaster to lay ground for
successful introduction of the property tax in January 2018. On the expenditure side, the fiscal
consolidation in 2016 will focus on further rationalization of current spending to provide
sufficient space for growth-enhancing expenditures in the medium term. The government is
advancing with the introduction of performance based public servants’ compensation scheme.
In consultation with the European Commission, a new Fiscal Responsibility Act is proposed to
strengthen the independence of the existing Fiscal Policy Committee and ensure the full
compliance of national fiscal rules with the relevant EU framework. Among other things, the Act
establishes mechanisms for compliance and the sanctioning of non-compliance with the planned
budget limits for all the layers of the government. Adoption of the Act is planned by September
2016.
Monetary policy and financial stability
The monetary authorities remain firmly committed to exchange rate stability as a proven policy
anchor for inflation expectations and financial stability. This exchange rate regime has served the
country well and the authorities welcome staff recognition in this regard. They agree with staff
that gradual de-euroization would be desirable. However, irrespective of the authorities’
continuous efforts to increase the attractiveness of savings in domestic currency, including
maintaining the positive interest differential on domestic currency deposits and informing the
public about potential risks of FX borrowing, deposit euroization has remained deeply
entrenched against the background of past episodes of monetary instability in the 1980’s and
early 1990’s.
In the given environment, the monetary authorities have managed to maintain a highly
accommodative monetary policy stance, thus creating favorable financing conditions for all
domestic sectors and supporting the economic activity. Since the beginning of the year, banks’
credit activity has started to recover following a pick-up in economic activity. In particular,
credit to the corporate sector increased by 3.8 percent in the first four months of this year. An
accommodative stance was further strengthened with the introduction of a new instrument: a
four-year structural reverse repo facility, which provides banks with long-term funding in local
currency. Although still high, the NPL's started declining, and their provisioning increases,
reaching almost 60 percent thanks to the earlier CNB policies. The planned changes in the tax
treatment of write-offs, as outlined in the authorities’ NRP, could additionally help the swifter
unwinding of the banks’ stock of NPLs, as well as, the reinforcement of the pre-insolvency and
insolvency frameworks for businesses and adopting a personal insolvency procedure.
Concerning the international reserves, the authorities agree that the existing external
vulnerabilities require adequate buffers and they continue to be dedicated to their enhancement.

3
However, they emphasize that aside from the CNB's international reserves, the commercial
banks also hold an additional buffer in line with the CNB's prescribed macro-prudential
regulation. When these two are taken together, Croatia's reserve buffer is comfortably in the
recommended range of 100-150 percent of the IMF's RAM metric. The sizable share of affiliated
bank debt and FDI-related short-term liabilities in total debt liabilities also serves as a mitigating
factor against risks in times of financial distress. Nevertheless, CNB remains open to look further
for opportunities to continue accumulating international reserves, as was the case in May 2016,
when 84 million euros were purchased through the FX interventions.
The Croatian banking system continues to demonstrate high resilience thanks to the solid
fundamentals and sound macroprudential policies of the CNB. The system-wide capital
adequacy ratio remains robust, close to 21 percent at end-2015. In 2015, the profit and loss
accounts of banks were temporarily, but strongly affected by the legislative amendments aimed
at facilitating the position of debtors with loans in Swiss francs and with foreign currency clauses
in Swiss francs. Banks' operational profitability was, however, even slightly higher than a year
before. As a result of that operation, the total capital adequacy ratio declined by 0.5 percentage
points compared to the end of 2014.
Competitiveness and structural reforms
The Croatian authorities are well aware that the productivity-enhancing fiscal and structural
reforms are essential to improving competitiveness. Starting from the premise that the public
administration reform is a key prerequisite for creating a supportive institutional framework for
the implementation of all relevant reforms, the government is taking steps to improve the
efficiency of the public sector, while reducing overlaps between different layers of the
administration, improving the management practices and revising the wage policy.
The restructuring and preparation for privatization of the state-owned enterprises is also
progressing. The government is redefining their policy on public companies by setting harsher
requirements on the quality of operations, planning and realization of business objectives, and
improving operational control to facilitate ongoing privatization endeavors. In particular, the
government is examining the justification of ownership over companies of strategic interest in
order to reduce their number. Privatization of the government minority stockholdings is also
being stepped up. As part of these efforts, in May 2016, 20.4 percent of the government shares in
electronic industries Končar were sold to the institutional investors.
A comprehensive set of measures to streamline social benefits, reform the pension system, and
improve the healthcare system is also being considered. Significant progress has been made with
regards to the establishment of a single center for social welfare benefits with integrated data and
benefit administration (one-stop-shop). Measures to encourage a longer working life and increase
penalization for early retirement are also considered. The government also seeks a consensus to
implement the necessary changes in the primary healthcare and health insurance system,
emergency medicine reform, and hospital network reorganization, including rationalization and
reorganization of non-medical services in the hospitals. In the context of improving the business
environment, the authorities are re-examining the para-fiscal charges for the private sector.
Despite the many challenges ahead, the Croatian authorities are confident that these measures
will help improve competitiveness, and pave the road to sustainable and more inclusive growth.
