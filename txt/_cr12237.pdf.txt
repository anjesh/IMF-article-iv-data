STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy continues to recover from the impact of the 2008–09 global
crisis. Growth reached 4.2 percent in 2011, as a result of the rebound of the global
economy, increased public investment, and measures to boost agricultural production.
Inflation has been contained below 3 percent. Despite an oil-revenue windfall, the fiscal
situation deteriorated in 2011, mostly owing to pressure from past payment
obligations, overruns on current expenditure, and the rise in the cost of fuel subsidies.
The President was re-elected for a seven-year term in October 2011. Legislative
elections have been postponed to 2013.
Outlook and risks. Economic growth is expected to increase gradually to 5½ percent
by 2016. This outlook is driven by the projected increase in oil production, the ongoing
public investment program, and initiatives to improve the business climate. However,
the increasing stock of domestic arrears, the depletion of fiscal buffers, contingent
liabilities arising from distressed banks and public enterprises, and the slow progress in
improving non-oil revenue mobilization and public expenditure management threaten
medium-term fiscal sustainability. There are risks to growth if the external environment,
particularly in the euro area, further weakens.
Safeguarding financial sector stability and fostering financial intermediation.
Banking sector vulnerabilities generated by the delayed resolution of troubled banks,
financial distress in an additional bank, the repercussions of mounting domestic
government arrears on banks, and insufficient regional supervisory resources threaten
financial sector stability. Financially weak banks need to be rapidly restructured, in
cooperation with the regional supervisory body as appropriate, and access to credit
should be improved through measures aimed at deepening of financial intermediation.
Promoting higher and inclusive growth. Relatively moderate economic growth has
led to almost stagnant growth in per capita income over the last five years, despite a
diversified productive base. To launch the economy on a path of higher and inclusive
growth, it is imperative to address the severe infrastructure gaps, promote sectors with
high employment potential, improve the business climate, promote access to financial
services, and strengthen public institutions.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

BACKGROUND
1.
In recent years, Cameroon has
maintained macroeconomic stability but its
growth performance has been insufficient
to improve social indicators. Macroeconomic
stability has been preserved, and debt relief
under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Relief (MDRI)
Initiatives considerably reduced the debt
burden (Figure 1). However, there has been
almost no growth in per capita income during

the last five years, despite a relatively
diversified productive base (Text Table 1 and
Figure 2) Poverty rates have stagnated at close
to 40 percent, with 87 percent of the poor
living in rural areas (Figure 3).
2.
Recent and forthcoming elections
have a bearing on the political economy.
The President was re-elected for another
seven-year term in October 2011. Legislative
elections have been postponed to 2013.

3.
Data provision is broadly adequate
for surveillance, but important gaps exist.
Government financial operations on a
commitment basis are not available. The
quality and timeliness of balance of payments
statistics need to be improved. Monetary data
availability is subject to long delays. The
authorities recognize the need to improve data
collection and dissemination and are
implementing, with outside technical

assistance, a strategy for improving national
accounts statistics.
4.
The response to past IMF advice has
been mixed (Box 1). Fiscal policy has been
saddled with the problems of domestic arrears
and the high cost of fuel subsidies. Efforts
were made, however, to improve the business
climate and develop a government securities
market.

Fund Advice

Response

Address the risks to the 2011
budget through tight treasury
management, reduction of fuel
subsidies, and spending
reprioritization.

Treasury management was constrained by
past payment obligations, overruns on
current expenditure, and the delay of a
planned bond issuance. Fuel subsidies
were not reduced; and no significant
spending reprioritization was undertaken.

Improve non-oil revenue by
broadening the tax base,
streamlining exemptions, and
increasing the efficiency of tax and
customs administration.

Non-oil revenue was lower than expected,
mostly because of lower-than-budgeted
VAT collection. Measures to increase the
efficiency of tax and customs
administration are being implemented.

Implement the planned measures
to prevent new arrears.

Domestic arrears problems continued
with the accumulation of unsettled
payment obligations and arrears to the
national oil refinery.

Rebuild fiscal buffers, strengthen
the budget execution process, and
accelerate efforts to operationalize
the medium-term expenditure
framework.

Usable deposits were almost depleted;
progress in strengthening budget
execution was limited; and an operational
medium-term expenditure framework is
not yet in place.

Work closely with regional
institutions in developing a
government securities market.

Cameroon was the first issuer of treasury
bills on the regional market.

In collaboration with the regional
bank supervisor, monitor
vulnerabilities through regular
analysis of banking sector
soundness; press ahead with bank
restructuring plans; and promote
the reform of the bank resolution
framework.

Little progress has been made in dealing
with troubled banks, partly reflecting lack
of cooperation between national and
regional authorities. Regular analyses of
banking sector soundness are conducted,
but bank supervision continues to be
hampered by inadequate resources at the
regional level; a new crisis resolution
framework is not yet in place.

Address the severe infrastructure
gap and improve the business
climate and competitiveness by
raising the execution rate of public
investment projects, deepen the
dialogue with the private sector,
and improve public institutions and
governance.

Public capital expenditure reached the
budgeted level. Efforts to improve the
business climate were pursued by
intensifying the dialogue with the private
sector and implementing an agreed on
action plan. Progress in improving
institutions and governance was
moderate.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS: ECONOMIC
RECOVERY BUT CONTINUED WEAKNESSES
A. Moderate Economic Recovery in 2011
5.
The economy continues to recover
from the global crisis, and inflation remains
contained (Tables 1–6 and Figure 4). The
economic rebound observed in 2010
strengthened in 2011, with growth reaching
4.2 percent (compared with 2.9 percent in
2010), despite a continuing decline in oil
output (Text Table 2). This decline reflected
shrinking reserves, aging equipment, and
postponement of some investments following
the 2008–09 global financial crisis. Average
inflation edged up to 2.9 percent in 2011 (from
1.3 percent the year before) mostly reflecting a
rise in food prices (Figure 5). However, the
freezing of retail prices for petroleum products
and subsidized imports of food contributed to
containing measured inflation.1

External balances in 2011 benefited
from positive developments in commodity
prices. The rebound in international oil prices
more than compensated for the drop in the
volume of oil exports, leading to an increase in
the value of oil exports. Non-oil exports
1

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

benefited from the rise in international
commodity prices. The volume of imports
grew by almost 16 percent as a result of
greater domestic demand and imports of
capital goods for large public infrastructure
projects.
7.
The moderate money supply growth
in 2011 coincided with a strong expansion
of bank credit to the private sector and a
drop in net foreign assets. Broad money and
credit to the private sector increased by 11
percent and 28 percent, respectively, while net
foreign assets dropped by 12 percent,
reflecting a surge in imports. Credit to the
private sector expanded as a result of a surge
in bank borrowing by companies involved in
public investment projects and by the national
oil refinery to compensate for delayed
payments of fuel subsidies by the government.
Despite the decline in net foreign assets
imputed to Cameroon, the Central African
Economic and Monetary Community’s
(CEMAC) official reserves, at about 5 months of
total imports or nearly 100 percent of broad
money, comfortably exceeded standard
benchmarks.

B. Continued Fiscal and Financial Sector Weaknesses
8.
The government’s fiscal situation
remained difficult in 2011. Non-oil revenue
performance was characterized by lower-thanbudgeted value-added tax (VAT) receipts,
mostly caused by parastatals not being able to
meet their VAT obligations. The shortfall in
non-oil revenue was offset by an oil revenue
windfall generated by the surge in
international oil prices (Text Table 3). On the
expenditure side, budget execution was
affected by the need to settle past unsettled
payment orders (UPOs), pressure from fuel
subsidies, and overruns on other current

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

transfers. Consequently, the non-oil primary
deficit (NOPD), on a cash basis, deteriorated
from 5.7 percent to 8.5 percent of non-oil GDP,
and the overall fiscal deficit was 0.8 percentage
point of GDP higher than forecast in the
budget. This additional deficit and the
deferment of a planned bond issuance
(CFAF 150 billion—1.3 percent of GDP) were
compensated by a drawdown of government
deposits at the regional central bank (BEAC),
including those held by public institutions.

9.
Budget execution was hampered by
some of the same problems as in previous
years. Despite efforts to settle past payment
obligations to the National Oil Refinery
(SONARA), new arrears were accumulated. The
government settled some of its obligations to
SONARA through a combination of cash
payments, cancellation of taxes, and
securitization, but it still owed SONARA
CFAF 163 billion (1.4 percent of GDP) at
end-2011, thus increasing the stock of
government arrears. The government cleared a
large amount of previous years’ UPOs
(CFAF 295 billion—2.5 percent of GDP), but
also accumulated new ones (CFAF 110 billion).
However, these regularization efforts resulted
in eroded fiscal buffers and potential liquidity
problems for public institutions, whose
compulsory deposits were largely run down.
10.
Conditions in the banking system
remained worrisome (Appendix I). This
reflects (i) financial distress of 4 (and possibly

5) banks out of the 13 commercial banks—the
5 banks account for 26 percent of total bank
assets; (ii) excessive concentration in bank
credit to SONARA; (iii) inadequate resources
for the regional supervisory agency (COBAC);
and (iv) weaknesses in the current framework
for dealing with distressed banks. Financial
sector soundness indicators deteriorated in
2011 and nonperforming loans (NPLs)
increased by about 17 percent. At the same
time, the number of banks in violation of the
main prudential ratios continued to increase.
11.
Cameroon complied with all four of
the regional convergence criteria in 2011.
These are a non-negative basic fiscal balance;
consumer price inflation not higher than
3 percent; a level of public debt not higher
than 70 percent of GDP; and nonaccumulation
of government arrears. The fourth criterion is
only related to audited arrears and does not
encompass all government payment
obligations.

MEDIUM-TERM ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
Economic growth is expected to
increase moderately under current policies
(Figure 6). Staff projects real GDP to increase
gradually from 4.2 percent in 2011 to
5½ percent in 2016. The authorities are slightly
more optimistic on growth prospects on hopes
of faster execution of large infrastructure
projects.

is expected to be financed mainly by new
public external borrowing and private capital
inflows.



Non-oil growth is to be supported by
ongoing efforts to boost agricultural
productivity and competitiveness; major
public investment projects; and measures
to improve the business environment.

15.
The medium-term fiscal outlook is
predicated on ongoing efforts to improve
revenue mobilization and address
infrastructure gaps. A gradual strengthening
in non-oil revenue mobilization is expected to
improve the ratio of non-oil revenue to non-oil
GDP by about ½ percentage point from 2011
to 2017. Efforts to tackle infrastructure gaps
will require a high level of public capital
spending (6½–7 percent of GDP).



The oil sector is expected to boost real
GDP growth in 2012–17, with projections
of the National Oil Company (SNH)
pointing to a sizeable increase in
production. The increase reflects the
coming on-stream of ongoing
investments, following successful
exploration efforts.

16.
Risks to the medium-term outlook
include (i) a downturn in the external
environment, particularly in the euro area,
which is still Cameroon’s main trade partner;
(ii) negative spillovers from the government’s
continued accumulation of arrears; and (iii) a
vulnerable banking sector that may generate
fiscal liabilities and affect the real sector.

13.
Inflation is expected to remain
below the regional convergence criterion of
3 percent. Initiatives to boost agricultural
production, subsidize food imports, build and
maintain stocks, and improve the provision of
information on food market conditions are
likely to moderate the impact of a possible
increase in world food prices.
14.
The external current account deficit
is projected to remain sustainable. It is
projected to decrease from 4.7 percent of GDP
in 2012 to about 3.5 percent in 2017. The
combination of a steady rise in non-oil exports
and a sustained resumption in oil exports is
expected to offset broadly the projected
increase in imports. The current account deficit

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17.
The risk of debt distress remains
low, but external borrowing commitments
continued to increase sharply in 2011. The
debt sustainability analysis (DSA; see
companion paper) shows that all external debt
ratios would remain below their respective
policy-dependent thresholds, including under
stress conditions. However, there are signs of
vulnerabilities emerging from increasing
domestic borrowing and accumulation of
domestic arrears, which push total public debt
indicators to levels significantly higher than in
the 2011 DSA. Quasi-fiscal liabilities of stateowned enterprises and distressed banks, if
they materialize, could lead to further
deterioration of debt indicators.

In addition, much of the increase in external
borrowing commitments over the last two
years was on nonconcessional terms. If this
trend were to continue, it could compromise
future debt sustainability. Moreover,
incorporation of arrears into the DSA has a
marked adverse impact on the domestic debt
profile and results in a sharp increase in the
overall debt-to-GDP ratio, from 13.7 percent in
2011 to 31.8 percent in 2017.
18.
Staff and the authorities discussed
how Cameroon would be affected by a
protracted and severe downturn in the euro
area. Given that Cameroon still has a non-oil
export exposure of more than 60 percent to

the euro area, staff prepared a downside
scenario showing that a downturn in the euro
area would have negative spillover effects on
Cameroon’s economic activity, public finances,
and gross domestic investment (Box 2). In case
of significant adverse spillover effects, the
2012 consultation report with CEMAC
recommends a temporary monetary easing for
the region. Increasing trade and investment
relations with emerging markets would also
help mitigate the latter risks. Staff concurred
with the authorities that the currently low level
of integration of Cameroon’s financial sector
with international financial markets limits its
exposure to global financial turmoil.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: PRESERVING
MACROECONOMIC STABILITY AND PROMOTING
HIGHER AND MORE INCLUSIVE GROWTH
The authorities recognized that the pressures on the 2012 budget, the erosion of fiscal
buffers, continued weaknesses in public financial management (PFM) and the financial
sector had increased risks to macroeconomic stability. Policy discussions therefore
centered on (i) containing risks to the 2012 budget and ensuring fiscal sustainability over
the medium term; (ii) improving PFM; (iii) safeguarding financial stability; (iv) fostering
financial sector development; and (v) promoting higher and more inclusive economic
growth, while preserving debt sustainability. However, pending forthcoming
parliamentary elections, the authorities were generally not in a position to discuss specific
corrective measures.

A. Containing Risks to the 2012 Budget
19.
The 2012 budget is based on
unchanged revenue policies, but channels
more expenditure toward capital spending.
The budget assumes a consolidation of
ongoing reforms in tax and customs
administration, projecting non-oil revenue to
remain close to 13 percent of GDP. It projects

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

current expenditure to be about
0.7 percentage point of GDP lower than in the
2011 budget and capital expenditure to be
0.5 percentage point of GDP higher. The
budget foresees an overall fiscal deficit, on a

CAMEROON

Box 2. Cameroon: Downside Scenario
This downside scenario incorporates an additional 5 percent depreciation of the euro/US dollar exchange
rate and a 5 percent decrease in the international oil price in 2013, compared to the April 2012 World
Economic Outlook’s downturn scenario. For the specific variables affecting Cameroon’s economy, the
following deteriorations are assumed for 2012 and 2013, compared to the April 2012 WEO baseline scenario.



GDP growth rates in Cameroon’s trading partners are lower by 0.5 and 1 percentage points in 2012 and
2013, respectively;



Oil prices per barrel are lower by US$10 in 2012 and in 2013;



Non-oil export prices are lower by 5 percent in 2012 and 10 percent in 2013; and



The nominal exchange rate of the CFA franc against the US dollar is higher by 5 percent (depreciation) in
2012 and 10 percent in 2013.

Compared to this report’s baseline scenario, these assumptions lead to the projections presented below.

cash basis, of 2.5 percent of GDP. This deficit is
expected to be financed in large part by the
issuance of securities on the regional market
(CFAF 250 billion; 2 percent of GDP).
20.
Although the 2012 budget is
expected to benefit from windfall oil
revenue, it is facing pressure from multiple
factors. Crude oil production and international
prices are projected to be higher than
assumed in the budget and thus are expected
to result in higher oil revenue (1 percentage
point of GDP). The budget is, however, under
pressure from:


Higher-than-budgeted fuel subsidies. At
current world market prices, maintaining
the present retail fuel price policy will
require a subsidy of about CFAF 400 billion
(3 percent of GDP), CFAF 230 billion more
than budgeted (Appendix II).



Uncertainty regarding the capacity of the
regional market to absorb the planned
securities issuance. This absorption
capacity is limited by the prudential norms
of risk concentration and liquidity.



Contingent claims from the restructuring
of distressed banks and public
corporations in financial difficulty, which
could require higher spending than the
budget provision.



Resources needed to clear UPOs. The
budget does not include provisions for

their clearance, which could require
additional resources as high as
CFAF 130 billion (1 percent of GDP).
21.
Incorporating these factors in the
fiscal projections results in a financing gap
of up to 1.6 percent of GDP. To prevent this
gap from leading to further accumulation of
domestic arrears, staff advised the authorities
to (i) step up implementation of administrative
reforms to improve non-oil revenue collection;
(ii) implement a strict cash flow plan and curb
non-priority spending; and (iii) screen the
launch of new public projects carefully and
secure concessional financing to the extent
possible.
Authorities’ views
22.
The authorities saw lower risks for
this year’s budget. They acknowledged that
the fuel subsidy was likely to exceed its budget
allocation, but said that various options to
reduce it were being explored. The authorities
remained confident that (i) the banking system
has the capacity to fully absorb the planned
securities issuance; (ii) ongoing negotiations
with reputable investors and asset recovery
efforts will help minimize contingent liabilities
in the distressed banks; and (iii) improved cash
flow management and the possibility of
issuing Treasury bills had lessened the
pressure resulting from UPOs.

B. Medium-Term Fiscal Sustainability
23.
Continuing arrears accumulation
threatens medium-term fiscal
sustainability. Arrears and UPOs reached
about 4.5 percent of GDP at end-2011
(Figure 7). The baseline medium-term
projections assume a small improvement in

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

revenue mobilization; a continued freeze in
retail fuel prices; and execution of the
government’s ambitious public investment
program. On this basis, the NOPD is forecast
to remain in the range of 8.5 to 9 percent of
non-oil GDP, while financing gaps remain

CAMEROON

around 3 percent of GDP. The projected
financing gaps would contribute to further
accumulation of domestic arrears in future
years, up to 16 percent of GDP by 2017
(Table 6).
24.
Staff called for a gradual
adjustment of pump prices to international
prices, accompanied by targeted social
programs. Although recognizing the political
difficulty associated with raising prices at the
pump, staff highlighted that projections of
world petroleum prices at high levels over the
medium term would entail sizable fuel
subsidies—on average, about 12 percent of
total annual expenditure. Staff recommended
an intensification of the public information
campaign to explain the cost of the current
policy in terms of foregone social and
infrastructure spending. At the same time,
staff called for the adoption of a plan to
phase out fuel subsidies through gradual
adjustments of pump prices to international
oil prices. The plan could call for a reduced
adjustment on kerosene, used primarily by the
most vulnerable segments of the population,
and a targeted safety net to ease the impact
of price adjustments on them.
25.
Staff recommended the following
measures to ensure fiscal sustainability
over the medium term:


Accelerate the implementation of ongoing
administrative reforms to widen the tax
base, particularly by (i) rationalizing tax
exemptions and tax incentive schemes;
(ii) completing the reform of the unique
tax payer identification number;
(iii) strengthening tax centers for mediumsize enterprises and those for small
taxpayers; and (iv) simplifying tax and
customs procedures.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT



Adopt a tighter path for the NOPD, taking
into account public investment needs for
infrastructure, leading to a more
sustainable fiscal situation over the
medium and long term. Thus, the reform
scenario discussed with the authorities
(Section F) generates a lower NOPD
compared to the baseline scenario.



Raise fiscal buffers to build a security
margin to mitigate exogenous shocks.



Avoid a reemergence of debt vulnerability
by contracting new external debt on
concessional terms, to the extent possible.



Strengthen public debt management by
(i) enhancing the capacity of the national
public debt committee; (ii) monitoring
contingent liabilities from public
enterprises; and (iii) conducting periodic
audits of domestic arrears.

Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities concurred with staff
on the need to ensure fiscal sustainability
over the medium term. They emphasized
that ongoing efforts to improve non-oil
revenue mobilization and strengthen debt
management will be pursued and that
additional measures will be incorporated in
future budgets. The authorities did not see,
however, an urgent need to follow a tighter
NOPD rule given the large public
infrastructure gaps and basic public services
needs. They agreed on the importance of
gradually rebuilding fiscal buffers. They
recognized that a gradual increase in pump
prices was a desirable policy path in the
medium term, but argued that it was
incompatible with social peace in the short
run.

C. Improving Public Financial Management
27.
Staff encouraged the authorities to
strengthen PFM and improve expenditure
efficiency. The authorities are working toward
the implementation of program budgeting in
the 2013 budget. Over the medium-term, their
reforms will be guided by the six PFM
directives adopted by the CEMAC in
December 2011. These reforms will address
medium-term budget sustainability objectives;
alignment with Government Financial Statistics
Manual (GFSM) 2001 standards (Tables 7 and
8); and strengthened external controls and
parliamentary oversight.
28.
For the containment of arrears and
other payment obligations, staff
recommended the following actions:


18

Complete the ongoing audit of arrears and
other UPOs before end-2012 and adopt a
plan for the settlement of the audited
arrears.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Implement the recommendations of recent
IMF technical assistance on moving from
the current cash-based budget system to a
payment-order system as an interim step
towards accrual budgeting.



Strengthen public expenditure
management and transparency by
(i) strengthening the management of the
expenditure chain, especially to avoid
derogatory spending commitments, to
ensure the execution of the budget within
the fiscal year; and (ii) improving the
information management system to track
the flow of funds throughout the
expenditure chain.

29.
Staff thinks there is further scope
for improving cash management. The
authorities made important progress in this
respect through the issuance of two- and fourweek Treasury bills through the BEAC. Staff

CAMEROON

reiterated the need to abide by the single
Treasury account rule, notably by eliminating
the use of SNH as a payment window for
government operations.
30.
The implementation of the PFM
modernization plan, adopted in 2009,
should be accelerated. Because progress so
far remains insufficient, staff underscored the
need to:




Implement a concrete strategy to improve
absorptive capacity for public investment
programs, and build continuity for
investment financing through multiyear
commitment appropriations. Staff thus
welcomed the authorities’ plan to establish
a central unit for project feasibility studies
and evaluation.
Ensure that the public procurement
process is competitive and minimizes the
incidence of single-source contracts. Staff
welcomed the new ministry dedicated to
procurement, but cautioned that its
budgetary implications should be reduced
to the minimum.



Prepare the transition from a line-item
budget to program-based budget by
adopting sound management rules and
establishing an organization of the
financial function within line ministries.



Improve the presentation of the fiscal
reporting table by including revenue and
expenditure on a gross basis, so the

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

budgetary impact of off-setting
tax/subsidy transactions between the
government and public enterprises is
clearly reflected.


Pursue efforts to make the medium-term
expenditure framework operational to
facilitate the translation of the Growth and
Employment Strategy Paper’s (GESP)
priorities into annual budgets.

Authorities’ views
31.
The authorities noted the
preparations for the full implementation of
the Budget Framework Law, to start on
January 1, 2013. The focus has been on
readying the budget for the move towards
budget programming, with the 2012 budget
already incorporating parts of the new
presentation. The authorities explained how
this move is also expected to improve the
management of the expenditure chain.
32.
The authorities recognized the need
to deal with arrears, while stressing that
important progress has been made. The
stock of UPOs has come down substantially in
2011 thanks to improvements in cash
management. Further, the authorities
indicated that budget execution reports on a
commitment basis will be available quarterly
with the 2012 budget. The comprehensive
arrears audit is expected to be available at
the end-of 2012 including a plan for their
eventual settlement.

D. Safeguarding Financial System Stability and Fostering Financial
Intermediation
33.
Banking sector vulnerabilities have
significantly increased since the last Article
IV consultation. These vulnerabilities reflect,

in particular (i) delayed restructuring or
dissolution of banks in financial distress;
(ii) further deterioration in financial soundness

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CAMEROON

indicators; (iii) an increasing number of banks
failing to comply with prudential
requirements; and (iv) accumulation of arrears
and UPOs by the government, which
pressures public enterprises into increasing
their bank borrowing.
34.
The number of financially troubled
banks has increased from three to four
since the last Article IV consultation. The
number of distressed banks is likely to
increase to five, as an additional bank is also
reported to be in difficulty. No credible
restructuring plans have emerged for any of
the three banks reported to be in distress in
the 2011 staff report. A fourth bank has
moved into a position of negative net worth
since the last consultation. Preliminary reports
indicate that a fifth bank also has negative net
worth and that its portfolio contains a high
proportion of NPLs (almost 40 percent of total
credit). At end-2011, the five banks concerned
accounted for 29.2 percent of deposits and 28
percent of total bank credit.
35.
Staff emphasized the need to take
swift action to resolve the troubled banks,
in close collaboration with COBAC. Failure
to address the situation of these banks
increases the potential fiscal costs of their
resolution and the risks to the economy.
Troubled banks with no credible restructuring
plans should be liquidated as soon as
possible. In parallel, the authorities should
continue to monitor the liquidity conditions of
these banks, set short deadlines to reach an
agreement on recapitalization plans with
shareholders, and limit the impact on the
public finances by requiring full loss
absorption by previous shareholders.
36.
Staff expressed concerns about the
weakening of the overall compliance of

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

banks with the regional prudential norms.
It stressed the need to avoid further
accumulation of UPOs by the government,
which is the main cause of the current high
concentration of risk in the banking sector. In
line with the recommendations of the 2012
consultation report with CEMAC, it called on
the authorities to engage CEMAC members in
(i) strengthening COBAC’s resources;
(ii) bringing the regional prudential
regulations up to international standards and
best practices; and (iii) closely collaborating
with COBAC in monitoring banking sector
vulnerabilities and enforcing prudential
requirements in line with the recommended
benchmarks of the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision, especially regarding
credit concentration risk.
37.
The protracted failure to address
the situation of troubled banks points to
the need to strengthen the regional bank
crisis prevention and resolution
framework. As noted during the recent
consultation with CEMAC, weaknesses in the
current framework for dealing with distressed
banks have become increasingly apparent
with respect to (i) delays in the coordination
between regional and national authorities on
corrective measures; (ii) the lack of clear rules
and triggers for intervention; (iii) long delays
in legal procedures; and (iv) the significant
opportunity for interference afforded to
shareholders of insolvent banks. Staff
emphasized the need to engage CEMAC
members in adopting the new regional
regulation on crisis resolution, prepared with
IMF assistance. This regulation is expected to
(i) allow the authorities to intervene early to
resolve banks in crisis; (ii) define the
responsibilities of regional and national
bodies and the scope of judicial review; and
(iii) prevent shareholders of a troubled bank

CAMEROON

from participating in its restructuring. It is
critical that the authorities provide full
support for the early adoption of these
reforms.
38.
Staff pointed to the need to
promote financial deepening. Access to
credit in Cameroon remains lower than the
SSA average, according to the World Bank’s
“Doing Business Indicators.” The penetration
rates, defined as the number of borrowers
from banks or depositors to banks per
1,000 adults have remained well below the
average for SSA (Figure 8). At the same time,
credit to the private sector, in percent of GDP,
has remained lower than the SSA average.
39.
There has been some progress in
improving access to bank credit in recent
years. The authorities have been
implementing an action plan to enhance
financial deepening, which includes the
following ongoing measures


Facilitating greater access to retail
banking services and diversifying the
range of available financial instruments;



Enhancing the availability of information
on the cost of credit and payment default;



Reinforcing the legal framework of
collateral guarantees for securing loans;



Reinforcing the supervision of
microfinance institutions;



Establishing a commercial court and a
central bank credit registry; and



Enacting a law on leasing.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

payments registry; setting up a framework for
monitoring the microfinance sector;
establishing mechanisms for the financing of
exports; and improving regional regulations
on new financial products.
Authorities’ views
41.
The authorities agreed with the
need to resolve the situation of distressed
banks quickly. Although restructuring plans
are under consideration, they are mired in
difficulty. Because of substantial delays in
dealing with these banks, which have
increased the potential contingent liabilities
associated with resolution, the authorities
would consider liquidation only in the event
that agreement is not reached by
shareholders on a restructuring plan within
the established deadlines. The authorities
agreed on the immediate need for monitoring
the liquidity of these banks to avoid a
suspension of payments.
42.
The authorities agreed that the
issue of inadequate resources in COBAC
has yet to be addressed. This constraint
limits the frequency of on-site inspections,
and may have resulted in a failure in early
detection of problems in the distressed banks.
43.
The authorities concurred that the
bank resolution framework needs to be
strengthened. The authorities thought that
COBAC’s ongoing consideration of reforms to
the bank resolution framework should focus
on (i) the appropriate division of
responsibilities between the regional and
national authorities; (ii) setting out clear
procedures; and (iii) reducing the excessive
delays before key decisions can be made.

40.
Staff welcomed the authorities’
agenda to deepen financial intermediation.
This includes reactivating a delinquent

The authorities underscored to the
need to continue the implementation of the
action plan for the development of the
financial sector. One of the primary objectives
involves addressing continuing problems in
accessing credit. The authorities agreed that

2004

the establishment of the commercial court and
the central credit registry for banks; and the
enactment of leasing laws were important
steps toward improved financial
intermediation, particularly for small- and
medium-size enterprises.

E. Reducing Constraints to Higher and More Inclusive Growth
45.
Inadequate infrastructure and an
unfavorable business environment remain
key structural weaknesses hampering faster
economic growth. Efforts are underway to
alleviate critical infrastructure bottlenecks.
22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Large public infrastructure projects in ports,
energy, roads, telecommunications, mining,
and water supply have already been launched.
Financing for most of them has already been
mobilized or is under negotiation with external

CAMEROON

lenders; 55 percent of external commitments
signed in 2011, were for large infrastructure
projects. The projected issuance of
government bonds in 2012 is also intended to
finance these projects.
46.
Staff emphasized the need to
improve the effectiveness of capital
spending. Cameroon faces the twin problems
of the low level and low quality of public
investment. The average execution rate of
public investment was below 70 percent
during 2005–10, and Cameroon’s ratings on
the Public Investment Management Index
(PIMI) and the Country’s Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) lag behind the
SSA average. Staff welcomed the improved
execution rate in 2011, but cautioned the
authorities on the risks of debt and fiscal
sustainability if the envisaged scaling up of
public investment is not accompanied by
improved effectiveness in capturing the
expected growth payoff (Appendix III).
47.
Staff estimates for Cameroon do not
provide compelling evidence of substantial
real effective exchange rate (REER)
misalignment (Appendix IV). The REER
depreciated by about 7 percent in 2010–11,
following the depreciation of the euro against
other major currencies. This depreciation did
not, however, offset the cumulative
appreciation of the REER in 1994–2009
(24 percent). Various model-based estimates
suggest that Cameroon’s REER was overvalued
by about 8 percent at end-2011. This estimate
is close to the findings of the recent Article IV
consultation with CEMAC.
48.
Cameroon’s external
competitiveness has continued to be
hampered by structural constraints. These
constraints are mostly related to an

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

unpropitious business environment,
substantial bottlenecks to trade, and high
costs of services compared to other
developing countries. Survey-based data
presented by the World Bank and the Global
Economic Forum rank Cameroon close to the
bottom on most dimensions of business
environment and external competitiveness.
49.
Staff welcomed the initiatives to
improve Cameroon’s external
competitiveness and its business
environment. Efforts are under way, in
particular, to improve basic public
infrastructure, strengthen the dialogue with
the business community, implement judicial
reform, modernize tax and customs
administration, simplify export and import
procedures, and improve the functioning of
the main port.
50.
Progress on removing barriers to
regional and international trade is
constrained by a lack of progress at the
regional level. External trade remains
constrained by high customs duties, nonuniform implementation of regional trade
regulations and significant physical and nonphysical barriers. The planned reduction in the
common external tariff, which is higher than in
most SSA countries, is awaiting an economic
impact study. A regional infrastructure
program integrating national infrastructure
projects has been developed, but is awaiting
implementation.
Authorities’ views
51.
The authorities concurred with the
need to strengthen Cameroon’s external
competitiveness and remove obstacles to
trade. The real exchange rate remains, in their
view, in line with fundamentals and it could

even help improve the external
competitiveness of the economy were the euro
to depreciate further. They intend to pursue
regular assessment of the implementation of
recommendations made by the Cameroon

Business Forum on measures to improve the
business climate (Box 3). They regretted the
slow progress in coming to an agreement with
regional partners on issues related to internal
and external trade liberalization.

Box 3. Cameroon: Ongoing Initiatives to Improve the Business Climate
The authorities’ actions have focused on (i) implementing an action plan agreed on with the private
sector; (ii) fighting corruption; and (iii) pursuing public enterprise reforms.
Implementing action plans to improve the business climate. The government and private sector
established the Cameroon Business Forum (CBF) in 2009 as a platform for public-private sector dialogue
on improving the country’s business climate. The forum was tasked with identifying obstacles to private
sector development, proposing annual action plans to remove these obstacles, and monitoring the
execution of those plans. For the fiscal years 2009–2012, reforms have mostly focused on removing
obstacles to starting a business, registering property, ensuring property rights, enforcing contracts,
paying taxes, trading across borders, and obtaining construction permits. The first business forum was
held in February 2010 and the second and third ones in March 2011 and March 2012, respectively. The
second forum concluded that 12 out of its previous 27 recommendations had been implemented. The
third forum found that 35 out of its 48 previous recommendations had been executed or are close to
being completed. Progress made in implementing these reforms allowed Cameroon to improve its
ranking slightly in the World Bank 2012 Doing Business Indicators.
Fighting corruption. Efforts in this area have intensified since 2009, leading to the prosecution of highlevel officials charged with misappropriation of public funds. A specialized court to handle economic
crimes was created in December 2011. The authorities also stepped up an anticorruption campaign.1
These efforts have still to generate tangible results in terms of improved international rankings.2
Utilization of the anti-money laundering framework can further help combat corruption and thus improve
the business climate.
Public enterprise reforms. Progress has been mixed. The sale of 51 percent of the telephone company
(CAMTEL) and the selection of a strategic partner were inconclusive, and a new divestiture strategy is still
being prepared. The restructuring of the postal service company (CAMPOST) is ongoing, through a
partnership agreement signed with a foreign company in March 2010. The liquidation of the old public
aviation company (CAMAIR) is nearing completion.
________________________________________________

The adoption of the national anticorruption strategy is, however, pending.
Cameroon’s rank on the Corruption Perceptions Index of Transparency International moved from 146 out of 178 countries in 2010 to
134 out of 182 countries in 2011. The World Bank Governance Indicators continue to rank Cameroon in the bottom quartile on most

2

indicators.

F. Macroeconomic Policy Reform Scenario
52.
A reform scenario, incorporating the
impact of the key policy recommendations
identified above, was discussed with the
authorities. The scenario, presented in Text
Table 4 and Tables 9–11, assumes gradual
adjustments of pump prices to international oil

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

prices; acceleration of the implementation of
ongoing administrative reforms to widen the
tax base; improved absorptive capacity and a
higher growth pay-off of public investment; no
financing gap or further accumulation of
domestic arrears beyond 2012; and a gradual

CAMEROON

buildup of fiscal buffers to about one month of
expenditure by 2017. This scenario leads to
greater fiscal sustainability over the medium
term, accompanied by slightly higher growth
and inflation.2

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

substantially over the medium term (Table 11).
This is also in tune with the ongoing public
investment scaling up as envisaged in the
GESP (Appendix III).
Authorities’ Views

53.
The reform scenario provides a path
towards fiscal sustainability over the
medium term. Compared to the baseline
scenario in which debt increases
monotonically, the debt-to-GDP ratio stabilizes
at around 25 percent in 2017 as there is no
accumulation of domestic arrears in the reform
scenario. Correspondingly, the NOPD improves

54.
The authorities welcomed the
reform scenario. They indicated that, if the
financing gaps projected in the baseline
scenario were to materialize, they would take
corrective action in line with the
recommendations contained in the reform
scenario.

STAFF APPRAISAL
55.
The economy continues to grow at a
moderate pace, and measured inflation
remains within the regional convergence
limit of 3 percent. There are however
significant risks to the outlook arising from
(i) uncertainty surrounding the strength of the
global recovery, particularly in Europe; (ii) the
impact of the increase in fuel subsidies and the
stock of domestic arrears on fiscal
sustainability; (iii) increasing financial sector
vulnerabilities; and (iv) reduced momentum for
reform following the postponement of
legislative elections to 2013.
56.
Substantial risks to the 2012 budget
need to be urgently addressed to prevent a
further deterioration of the fiscal situation.
The fiscal situation worsened in 2011 owing to
pressure from past payment obligations,
overruns on current expenditure, the rise in the
cost of fuel subsidies, and the deferment of
budgeted domestic financing through a bond
issuance. The risks for the 2012 budget result
from underbudgeting fuel subsidies, further
arrears accumulation in 2011, limited capacity
of the regional market to absorb the full
amount of the planned securities issuance, and
contingent liabilities of public enterprises and
distressed banks.
57.
Safeguarding fiscal sustainability
over the medium-term will require
corrective measures. These include improving
non-oil revenue mobilization; avoiding
accumulation of domestic arrears; rebuilding
fiscal buffers; and tackling the infrastructure
gap through significant public investment
spending, which will need to be
counterbalanced by containing current
expenditure, particularly on fuel subsidies.

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

58.
Strengthening PFM remains critical
to maintaining fiscal sustainability. The
authorities are encouraged to complete the
ongoing audit of arrears and adopt a plan for
the settling of audited arrears. Public
expenditure management should be
reinforced by strengthening control of the
expenditure chain and better tracking of the
flow of funds. The implementation of the PFM
modernization plan should be accelerated, and
efforts be made to implement the CEMAC PFM
directives in a timely manner.
59.
Financial sector stability needs to be
restored in the face of increasing risks. The
rising number of distressed banks and the
delays in restructuring them, the concentration
of bank credit to the national oil refinery, and
the spillover from arrears accumulation
combine to threaten financial sector stability.
The necessary reforms require both a
resolution of ailing banks and the
implementation of the corrective fiscal
measures to avoid further quasi-fiscal losses
from excessive lending to state-owned
enterprises.
60.
Lasting financial stability can only
be achieved through a more effective
regional framework and better cooperation
between national and regional bodies. The
difficulties in addressing Cameroons’s financial
sector problems have revealed the weaknesses
in the current regional arrangement, which is
handicapped by a lack of resources. They also
show that insufficient cooperation between
national and regional bodies can lead to
stalemate. As the largest economy in the
CEMAC region, Cameroon should take a
proactive stance in pressing toward the
necessary regional reforms in the financial

CAMEROON

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

sector, and in other relevant areas to enhance
the efficiency of the regional framework.

diversification and productivity growth in
Cameroon’s non-oil sector.

61.
Higher and more inclusive growth
requires addressing the significant
infrastructure gaps and improving the
business climate. Accelerating Cameroon’s
recent moderate economic growth
performance will require the full
implementation of a major program of public
investment. This scaling up of public
investment will need to be accompanied,
however, by improved project selection to
enhance the quality and effectiveness of
expenditure and limits on the scale of external
nonconcessional borrowing. Competitiveness
in Cameroon remains challenged mainly by
structural factors. Improving the business
climate will require that the authorities tackle
governance issues, deepen dialogue with
private sector interests, take measures to
increase the level of financial intermediation,
and improve access to credit. Renewed efforts
to reach agreements on trade liberalization
among CEMAC countries would also support

62.
Containing domestic arrears and
maintaining a prudent borrowing policy is
necessary to preserve debt sustainability.
The DSA shows that Cameroon’s risk of debt
distress remains low. Total public debt
indicators are worse than in the 2011 DSA
owing to the impact of domestic arrears on
domestic debt and the need to cover fiscal
financing gaps through increased
securitization. There are further signs of
vulnerabilities emerging from increasing
quasi-fiscal liabilities of state-owned
enterprises and distressed banks, and external
borrowing at nonconcessional terms. Reform
of the fuel subsidy mechanism, improved
commitment control, and external borrowing
at concessional terms to the extent possible
would help to maintain domestic debt at
sustainable levels.
63.
Staff recommends that the next
Article IV consultation take place on the
12-month consultation cycle.

1.

A partial audit conducted in 2010 revealed a stock of about CFAF 18 billion in new arrears, which are included in the end-2010 stock. A new audit is being conducted in 2012.
The end-of year stock of UPOs is assumed to stay at CFAF 131 billion beyond 2011, implying that UPOs will be slowly going down as a percentage of total expenditures.
3.
The authorities securitized CFAF 80 billion of arrears to SONARA in 2011 and plan to securitize some of the end-2011 outstanding stock of obligations to SONARA (CFAF 38.1 billion) in 2012. The projection of flows for 2012
onwards assumes that annual obligations to SONARA will remain at about CFAF 400 billion and the authorities will continue to pay about CFAF 170 billion per year as budgeted in 2012. Amortization of the securitized part (for
2011 and 2012) is over 10 years with a 2-year grace period.
2.

4.

The residual financing gap is different from the financing gap in Table 2, as the net payment of arrears need to be subtracted to avoid double counting. For 2012, treatment of the settlement of 2011 arrears needs to be taken into
account which is equal to CFAF 26 billion (audited arrears) plus CFAF 38.1 billion (cash payments). The amount securitized does not need to be subtracted as it figures both above and below the line and thus does not affect the
financing gap. It is further assumed that the residual financing gap is financed ex post by accumulation of domestic arrears.

CAMEROON

Appendix I. Cameroon: Issues in the Banking System
A.

Structure of the Banking System

1.
The Cameroonian banking system
has a diversified ownership structure.1The
13 commercial banks in the sector comprise
(i) subsidiaries of international banking groups
based outside sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
(five banks); (ii) banks controlled by groups
headquartered in SSA (five banks) ; and
(iii) domestic banks (three banks). Together,
they represent more than 40 percent of
banking assets in the Central African Economic
and Monetary Community (CEMAC; Table 1).
2.
The large international groups based
outside SSA dominate the Cameroonian
banking sector. By end-2011, these groups
accounted for 57.3 percent of the credit
market, an increase of 1.3 percentage point
from 2010. French affiliates dominated this
sub-group, controlling more than 40 percent
of the credit market. Domestic banks had a
total share of 24 percent of the credit market.
The government has significant shares in both
French affiliates and in the Moroccan bank
recently acquired from another French group
active in Cameroon until last year.
3.
The remaining 19 percent of the
credit market was covered by four relatively
small subsidiaries of Nigerian, Togolese,

B.

4.
The microfinance sector in
Cameroon is of significant size, equal to one
of the country’s medium-sized banks. The
regional bank supervisory agency, the Central
African Banking Commission (COBAC), is
responsible for supervising the sector but is
unable to fulfill its mandate because of
capacity constraints and the large number of
entities involved, which totaled 495 institutions
at end-2010. A large number of these are
reported by the regulatory authorities to be in
financial difficulty.

Banking System Vulnerabilities

5.
There has been a significant increase
in banking sector vulnerability in Cameroon
since the last Article IV consultation. There

and Gabonese banking groups. Ecobank, the
fifth-largest bank in Cameroon (10 percent of
the credit market), belongs to the Togo-based
Ecobank group, which has recently purchased
the Nigerian Oceanic Group, parent of the
Union Bank of Cameroon (2.1 percent of the
credit market). A new Gabonese affiliate,
Banque Gabonaise et Française Internationale,
which entered the sector in 2011, has
established a 2.5 percent share in the credit
market. The remaining banks are the
Togolese-owned Banque Atlantique du
Cameroun (1.6 percent of the credit market)
and the Nigerian affiliate United Bank for
Africa (2.2 percent of the credit market).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

are now four banks facing insolvency and a
fifth one reportedly also in difficulty
(compared to three at end-2010) reflecting
(i) mismanagement issues at individual banks,
particularly related to connected lending;
(ii) continued failure to assemble viable
restructuring plans for the banks already in
distress; and (iii) inadequate human resources

CAMEROON

in some banks to deal with the requirements
of changing market conditions. The net
negative equity related to losses on
nonperforming loans (NPLs) associated with
one of the larger domestic banks has been
estimated at CFAF 60 billion (compared to
assets valued at CFAF 113 billion), in addition
to an estimated CFAF 20 billion for the other
troubled banks. The number of banks in
difficulty and the significant share of the retail
market under their control constitute a risk.
While the virtual absence of interbank lending
reduces the risk of contagion, the failure of
one bank could precipitate a loss of
confidence in other undercapitalized banks.
The principal risk attached to eventual bank
closures is thus reputational via faltering public
confidence in the banking system and the
authority of the regulators.
6.
Financial soundness indicators in
Cameroon have deteriorated further since
the last Article IV consultation. The number
of banks exceeding the limit on single large
exposure has risen to 9 (out of 13 banks) from
5 (out of 12) in 2010 (Table 2). At the
aggregate level, there has been a sharp decline
in capital adequacy ratios (CARs) with the
average falling from 7.4 percent of riskweighted assets in 2010 to 5.2 percent in 2011
(Table 3). The statutory limit is 8 percent. This
decline in the overall CARs results from the
increased number of banks in distress and the
need for increased provisioning for NPLs. The
overall CAR numbers mask major divergences
in the positions of international banks and
regional and domestic banks, with the former
keeping buffers well in excess of the statutory
limit, while the majority of regional and
domestic banks either have low buffers or hold
negative equity.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

7.
Cameroon’s fulfillment of all the
CEMAC convergence criteria in 2011 has
resulted in a downward revision of its
sovereign debt risk premium. The scale of
this revision is reported to be from 85 percent
to 0 percent. Banks’ holdings of government
bonds accounted for 6.9 percent of total assets
at end-2010. Although the absence of
confirmed data makes it difficult to assess the
impact the revision has on bank prudential
ratios, the reduction in the risk premium would
likely improve the CARs of the banks which
hold government bonds. This improvement is,
however, contingent on the condition that
Cameroon meets the CEMAC criteria every
year in the future.
8.
Nonperforming loans have
continued to increase as the number of
banks in the sector facing insolvency rises.
NPLs grew by a further 17.5 percent in value
relative to 2010, although the rapid increase in
gross lending means the share of NPLs in total
loans remains practically unchanged at
12.3 percent. Provisioning for NPLs has
increased to 96.7 percent of gross NPLs from
89.2 percent in 2010, although the infrequency
of on-site supervisory visits may affect the
reliability of these data. Rules, which allow for
up to four years for provisioning NPLs, may
also be an explanatory factor—the improved
coverage of NPLs may therefore also relate to
delayed provisioning of loans that were made
in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
9.
There has been a marked increase in
risk concentration. Data on prudential ratios
indicate that 9 of the 13 banks are in breach of
the limit on single large exposure. In the
majority of cases, credit concentration risk is
primarily linked to the national oil refinery
(SONARA). Large common borrowers,
confronted with liquidity problems because of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CAMEROON

protracted delays in receiving government
payments, continue to represent a serious
threat to the banking system. Moreover, public
enterprises forced to finance operating needs
through bank borrowing crowd out private
sector borrowing and constrain growth. Recent
stress tests at the regional level suggest that

C.

Dealing with Distressed Banks

10.
It is critical that restructuring or
resolution of distressed banks is carried out
promptly. The necessary arrangements should
be put in place immediately. Ongoing efforts
to identify new investors to recapitalize the
banks concerned and avoid closures should
continue aggressively. Restructuring plans are
under consideration for the troubled banks.
However, in many cases these plans are mired
in difficulty.


the banking system is particularly vulnerable to
credit risk and that the concentration of
lending to a few large borrowers and to the
public sector is a major source of risk. It also
constitutes a potential liquidity risk for the
banks concerned.

For one of the banks concerned, the next
steps comprise (i) finalizing the details of
the recapitalization plans; (ii) reaching a
decision on government participation in
the recapitalization of the bank; and
(iii) submitting a restructuring plan to the
COBAC for approval.
Another bank is in the process of finalizing
preparations and will shortly seek
shareholder approval for a revised
restructuring plan.
The intentions of the parent group
regarding the onward sale or absorption
need to be confirmed for a third bank. This
will enable shareholders to reach an early
decision on the restructuring plan and seek
COBAC approval as soon as possible.
A COBAC decision on a fourth bank’s
restructuring plan submitted in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

March 2012 should be finalized as soon as
possible.


A timetable for discussions on the
capitalization needs of a fifth bank
reported to be in distress should be
established as soon as possible.

There have been substantial procedural delays
in dealing with these banks, which have
increased the potential contingent liabilities
associated with resolution.
11.
The government should, in close coordination with COBAC, also take the
following immediate measures:


Closely monitor the liquidity of the
troubled banks to avoid a suspension of
payments.



Set short deadlines for specific prior
actions in the case of each bank to reach
an agreement on their restructuring plans.
The authorities should consider liquidation
in the event that agreement is not reached
with shareholders on the restructuring
plans within the established deadlines.



Require credible full loss absorption by
previous shareholders to reduce the
impact of the restructuring on public
finances.

CAMEROON

D.

Issues in the Regulatory Environment

12.
The regulatory environment is the
source of a number of concerns. The 2012
consultation report with CEMAC refers to the
need to strengthen the common institutional
framework. Prudential regulations related to
provisioning for NPLs and exposure to single
creditors need to be reviewed urgently. The
bank resolution framework needs to be
strengthened as a matter of priority as part of
broader reform efforts to enhance crisis
management frameworks at CEMAC level. The
increase in risk concentration and the high
level of NPLs suggest moreover that the
statutory limit of 8 percent for capital
adequacy is insufficient in terms of building
buffers against emerging risks, and could be
increased in line with the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision guidance already being
adopted elsewhere. There is also a need to
strengthen the institutional framework of the
financial sector to facilitate access to financial
services.

E.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

13.
COBAC lacks sufficient resources.
The lack of adequate resources, highlighted in
the 2006 Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) report as a constraint to COBAC’s
fulfilling its supervisory mandate, has yet to be
addressed. This resource constraint limits the
frequency of on-site inspections and hinders
early detection of problems in distressed
banks. It also severely restricts COBAC in its
activities as the supervisory authority for the
microfinance sector. Staffing levels continue to
be low and this lack of resources does not
allow COBAC to conduct on-site examinations
with sufficiently in-depth assessments of loan
portfolios with appropriate regularity. These
can instead take two to four years per bank
resulting in the inability of COBAC to enforce
provisioning standards. Accordingly, and in
line with the 2006 FSAP report, COBAC’s
capacity needs to be reinforced urgently.

Improving the Regulatory Framework

14.
Deficiencies in key prudential
regulations need to be addressed.
Provisioning rules that allow for up to four
years for provisioning NPLs need to be
tightened because of COBAC’s limited capacity
to enforce regulations. In addition, the
45 percent regulatory capital limit on
exposures to a single borrower is extended to
up to 90 percent for large public enterprises,
although the suggested BCBS benchmark is
15–25 percent. For off-site supervision,
although there is a well-developed reporting
platform, the rating system needs updating
and is subject to maintenance delays.

15.
There is a need for consolidated
banking group surveillance. COBAC
assessment of restructuring plans for
international banks is impaired by the absence
of a mandate to carry out consolidated
surveillance of international banking groups.
16.
The bank resolution framework
needs to be reinforced to deal with
insolvency cases. This applies particularly to
the need for the establishment of clear rules
and time bound procedures, and greater
cohesion between COBAC and local authorities
in enforcing regulations. COBAC’s ongoing
consideration of reforms to the bank
resolution framework should focus on (i) the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CAMEROON

appropriate division of responsibilities
between the regional and national authorities;
(ii) setting out clear procedures to be followed;
and (iii) reducing excessive delays in decision
making. Although a special resolution regime
has been drawn up as a crisis management
tool, it still needs to be formally adopted by
CEMAC. More effective tools are also needed
at the CEMAC level to handle problem banks,
particularly regarding mandatory
recapitalization, transfer of assets and
liabilities, and orderly winding up. It is critical
that the authorities fully support these reforms

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

in view of the importance of the Cameroonian
banking system to the CEMAC region.
17.
A regional deposit insurance scheme
was established in 2009. The Fonds de
Garantie des Dépôts en Afrique Centrale
(FOGADAC) started accepting contributions in
March 2011. The FOGADAC is supervised by
COBAC, under the oversight of BEAC and
banking sector representatives. The scheme,
funded by fees from financial institutions, will
insure deposits up to CFAF 5 million once it
becomes operational.

Appendix II. Cameroon: Fuel Subsidies
A.

Current Issues Regarding Fuel Subsidies

1.
Application of an automatic fuel
pricing formula to reflect international
market conditions was halted in February
2008.1 Pump prices remained constant from
February to December 2008, when they were
adjusted downward. They have been frozen
since then. The freeze was accompanied by a
decision to compensate the national oil
refinery (SONARA) for the difference between
the notional retail price derived from the oil
pricing formula adopted in 2007 and the
administratively fixed pump price.2
2.
Cameroon produces the bulk of its
domestic consumption of refined oil
products. SONARA’s current processing
capacity is 2.1 million tons of light crude oil
per year.3 Because its current technology is
unsuitable for using Cameroon’s crude oil,
about 90 percent of processed crude oil is
imported from Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea.
The refinery worked at full capacity in 2011
and exported 44 percent of its production
(mostly to other CEMAC countries).
____________________________________________
1
This is an updated and shortened version of a
similar appendix in the 2011 staff report. It was
prepared by Fabien Nsengiyumva.
2

SONARA is the only significant supplier to the
local market. There is a quota of 20 percent
reserved for other importers in place since 2000.
However, less than one-fourth of the import quota
has been used so far owing to the monopolistic
position enjoyed by SONARA and the difficulties
faced by importers in recovering fuel subsidies.

3

It is useful to compare SONARA’s output of
refined oil products with that of the Ivory Coast’s
refinery, which produces 4 million tons a year, and
the smallest French refinery, which produces
10 million tons.

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

3.
Fuel subsidies impose a heavy
burden on the budget. Required subsidies
reached CFAF 146 billion (1.3 percent of GDP)
in 2010 and CFAF 309 billion (2.5 percent of
GDP) in 2011 (Figure 1). In 2011, subsidies
represented about 29 percent of the notional
retail prices for gasoline, 32 percent for diesel,
and 49 percent for kerosene.
4.
The government has accumulated
substantial arrears to SONARA since 2008.
Those amounted to CFAF 98 billion
(0.9 percent of GDP) at end-2009. Required
fuel subsidies amounted to CFAF 146 billion in
2010. The government paid the refinery
CFAF 107 billion, of which CFAF 90 million
were from the proceeds of the 2009 SDR
allocation. This payment, however, left a stock
of payment obligations amounting to
CFAF 136 billion (1.2 percent of GDP) at
end-2010.
5.
Budget constraints in 2011 led the
government to securitize its payment
obligations to SONARA. Cumulative
obligations to SONARA at end-2011, including
the end-2010 stock of arrears, were
CFAF 445 billion (3.7 percent of GDP). The
government settled these obligations by
(i) cash payment (CFAF 97 billion);
(ii) cancellation of tax due from SONARA
(CFAF 105 billion), and (iii) issuance of
securities (with a maturity of 10 years) in favor
of SONARA (CFAF 80 billion). These operations
left a stock of CFAF 163 billion of payment
obligations at end-2011.

The government agreed with SONARA in

the second half of 2011 (CFAF 87 billion);
(ii) cash payment (CFAF 38 billion); and
(iii) additional securities (CFAF 38 billion).
6.
In line with the recommendations of
the 2011 Article IV consultation, the
authorities included a number of measures
in the 2012 budget aimed at reducing fuel
subsidies. These measures, which were made
effective in March 2012, include (i) a reduction
from 10 to 5 percent in the tariff rate on
imports of crude oil from non-CEMAC
countries; (ii) a decrease in the margin for
SONARA (“adjustment coefficient”) from 15 to
12 percent; and (iii) elimination of the “dead
freight” in the calculation of the import parity
price (Box 1).4 The authorities estimated that

these measures would reduce the required fuel
subsidies by about CFAF 50 billion in 2012.
Taking into account the projected savings, the
authorities project required fuel subsidies to
reach about CFAF 400 billion (3.1 percent of
GDP) in 2012. The required fuel subsidies in
2012 will be equivalent to 20 percent of total
projected current expenditure and about
three-fourths of domestically financed
government capital expenditure. Staff’s
estimates, based on current WEO oil price
projections and a growth rate of 6 percent in
the volume of domestic consumption, indicate
that the required fuel subsidies would average
CFAF 415 billion (2.6 percent of GDP) per year
in 2013–17, under the assumption of
unchanged retail fuel prices.
__________________________________________________________

The dead freight was previously fixed at US$10 per ton.
It was supposed to cover the cost of transboarding
imported fuel from large ships into smaller ones when
approaching the port of Douala.

Box 1. Cameroon: Calculating the Fuel Subsidy
The fuel subsidy is calculated through a pricing formula in place since 2007 (Box Table).1 The formula is designed to
reflect the notional retail prices of imported refined oil products, assuming that any private importer will require a
profit margin (adjustment coefficient). The formula calculates a local wholesale price for final products (f) by adding
to the prevailing import parity price of imported refined products: (i) a profit margin (or a producer subsidy to
SONARA) of 12 percent; (ii) value added taxes (VAT); and (iii) coastal navigation costs.
The notional retail price, that would prevail if there was no fuel subsidy, is calculated from the wholesale price by
adding taxes levied by the port, distribution costs, a contribution to the anti-smuggling fund, and a special tax on
petroleum products (earmarked for road maintenance). The formula calculates the shortfall (subsidy) per liter of final
product as the difference between the notional retail price and the fixed pump price.

The formula was developed in collaboration with the IMF and is applied to three products: gasoline, kerosene, and diesel. The subsidy per
liter is recalculated on a monthly basis.

7.
The fuel subsidy is not targeted, and
the associated resources could be
redeployed to generate significantly higher
benefits for the poor. A 2007 IMF assessment
showed that more than 70 percent of fuel
price subsidies accrue to the richest 40 percent

of households. The study also showed that the
poorest 20 percent of households receive less
than 1 percent of the subsidy for gasoline.
Even in the case of kerosene subsidies, which
are typically assumed to be pro-poor, the
poorest 20 percent of households receive only

CAMEROON

13 percent of the subsidy. In addition, the
consumption of kerosene is small compared to
the consumption of gasoline and diesel. Out of
the CFAF 309 billion of required fuel subsidies
in 2011, the share of kerosene was only
12.5 percent, equivalent to 0.3 percent of GDP.
Eliminating subsidies on gasoline and diesel
only would free resources equivalent to
2.3 percent of GDP annually in 2013–17 for
alternative use.

The fuel pricing formula raises two

government transfers to SONARA as
international fuel prices increase.


The formula could be made simpler and
more transparent. In particular, it is not
clear why and how customs duties on
crude oil imported by SONARA from nonCEMAC countries are included in the
calculation of the import parity price of
refined products. There seems also to be
double counting between the distribution
and the price equalization costs.

The margin for SONARA increases with
world market prices. Setting the margin on

9.
Further modification of the pricing
formula could help reduce the level of the
fuel subsidy. Options for consideration
include (i) in the short term, delinking the
supplementary margin for SONARA from
international fuel price levels by setting a
specific nominal transfer per liter of final
product; (ii) over the medium term, estimating
the wholesale price (item f in Box 1, Table 1)
on the basis of SONARA’s production costs,
taking into account efficiency gains from
SONARA’s investments; and (iii) reassessing
the distribution and price equalization costs
and margin to bring more efficiency into the
sector.

10.
Staff has recommended that a
comprehensive reform of fuel pricing be
adopted. A plan aimed at gradual adjustments
of pump prices to international prices should
be implemented. The adjustment could be
reduced for kerosene, which is a product used
primarily by the poorest segments of the
population. At the same time, targeted safety
net programs aimed at easing the impact of
price adjustments should be put into place.
Such programs could be designed and carried
out with support from donors, including the
World Bank.

Appendix III. Cameroon: Public Investment and Fiscal Sustainability1
Cameroon’s fiscal sustainability is confronted with dwindling oil reserves while the
country has embarked upon an ambitious investment program of “grands projets
structurants” 2 in the face of large infrastructure needs. To finance these, Cameroon uses
oil revenue when it becomes available in contrast to Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH)
recommendations. A dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model is developed
to assess the impact of the public investment scaling up fully on growth and fiscal
sustainability. The model shows that unless Cameroon manages to improve the
effectiveness of its public investment, the envisaged capital spending increase will not be
sufficient to lift Cameroon’s growth above its historical average. Fiscal sustainability
deteriorates significantly under this baseline scenario, but does not become alarming
because Cameroon starts from very low debt levels due to previous debt relief.

A.

Introduction

1.
A case can be made for Cameroon,
which recently has had low public
investment, to invest more of its natural
resource income in the near future,
compared to what the permanent income
hypothesis (PIH) would recommend. In
2001–12, the public-investment-to-GDP ratio
in Cameroon averaged 3.5 percent, compared
to 10 percent in the Central African Economic
and Monetary Community (CEMAC) and more
than 7 percent for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).3
Further, over the past decade, capital spending
has been driven by the cyclicality of oil-related
revenue. Lack of adequate infrastructure is a
key bottleneck to Cameroon’s economic
growth. Dominguez-Torres and Foster (2011)
1

This appendix, which was prepared by Bruno
Versailles, summarizes the findings of a forthcoming
IMF Working Paper by I. Samake, P. Muthoora (both
WHD) and B. Versailles (FAD). It was discussed with the
Cameroonian authorities during the 2012 Article IV
consultation and incorporates some of their
observations.
2

This expression refers to large infrastructure projects.

3

This is also below what researchers have found to be
optimal. Fosu, Getachew and Ziesemer, (2011), for
example, put the optimal level of public investment in
SSA between 8 and 11 percent.

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

estimate that to reach the infrastructure level
of Africa’s middle-income countries, Cameroon
would need to invest an additional
US$350 million a year. The same authors
estimate potential efficiency gains from
reforming infrastructure related utilities at
$586 million annually.4 Taken together, if such
an increase in both the quantity and quality of
public investment were to be sustained over
15 years, Cameroon would enjoy an increase in
its long-run per capita GDP growth rate of
about 3.3 percentage points.
2.
Public investment budgets have not
been fully spent in recent years because of
implementation problems. This is related to
low administrative capacity and recurring
governance problems, as acknowledged by
recent initiatives including the setting up of a
new ministry for public procurement in 2012.
Hence, preliminary results from the Public
Investment Management Index (PIMI) show
Cameroon lagging behind the SSA average.
The World Bank’s Country Policy and
4

A large contributor to these losses is the power
sector, owing to underpricing of power and
distributional losses.

Institutional Assessment (CPIA) corroborates
this finding.5 In what follows, ‘quality’ and
‘effectiveness’ of public investment are used
interchangeably, denoting everything related
to the mechanisms for screening, monitoring,
and oversight of investment decisions
(Chakraborty and Dabla-Norris, 2009, page 5).
This twin problem of low quantity and quality
of public investment is the focus of this paper,
which is structured as follows. Section B
provides a benchmark for the discussion by

B.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

looking at the fiscal implications of applying
the PIH approach to Cameroon. To explore the
scaling up of public investment and its impact
on growth and fiscal sustainability, a fully
specified DSGE model is introduced in
Section C. The model focuses on the
importance of public investment effectiveness
for growth and fiscal sustainability. Section D
explores policy implications for Cameroon.

Applying the Permanent Income Hypothesis

3.
A simple application of the PIH
approach to Cameroon suggests a
sustainable non-oil primary deficit (NOPD)
of just below 3 percent of non-oil GDP.6
The standard PIH implies that oil revenue is
mostly saved during high production years,
with the proceeds from the savings drawn
down in later years to ensure a smooth public
spending profile. Figure 1 applies this
reasoning to Cameroon. Oil wealth is
gradually depleted between 2012 and 2032.
Net assets, defined as the government’s net
position with the central bank minus the total
___________________________________________________________

The PIMI is a multidimensional index of public
investment management efficiency. Introduced in
2011 by IMF and World Bank staff, its first
assessments were based on 2008 data (see
Dabla-Norris, et al., 2011). The Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability (PEFA) diagnostic tool
shows a similar assessment for Cameroon.

debt stock, initially increase, as some of the oil
wealth is invested in the early years, before
declining from 2020 onwards, as oil wealth
declines and proceeds from the assets are
spent. By 2032, it is assumed that the
government exhausts its oil revenue and that
net assets return to their initial value of
-13.5 percent of non-oil GDP. Other
assumptions made are (i) the oil price follows
the World Economic Outlook (WEO)
projections, with a small discount for the
lower quality of Cameroon’s crude oil;
(ii) non-oil revenue increases from 14 percent
of non-oil GDP in 2011 to 16 percent in 2032;
(iii) the average nominal annual discount rate
is 5.5 percent; (iv) the average nominal annual
growth rate is 4.5 percent; and (v) oil revenue
remains at its historical level of 65 percent of
oil GDP (for 2002–10).

6

We consider the NOPD a better fiscal anchor than
the CEMAC fiscal convergence criterion of the basic
fiscal balance (which excludes foreign-financed
capital spending). The latter would allow countries
to spend oil revenue windfalls, and could thus
accommodate procyclical fiscal policies while not
taking into account the temporary nature of oil
revenue. See Iossifov, et al. (2009) for a discussion in
the context of CEMAC.

4.
Assuming a continuation of current
fiscal policies, staff estimates the average
NOPD to be around 9 percent of non-oil
GDP over the medium term.7 This is much
higher than the PIH benchmark and thus, the
current path of the NOPD is unsustainable.
This conclusion does not depend
fundamentally on the level of net assets
reached by the end of the time horizon. For
instance, if the target for net assets is set at
-30 percent of non-oil GDP by 2032, the
‘allowed’ constant NOPD for 2012–32 would
be around 3.5 percent, still much lower than
the staff estimates mentioned above.
_____________________________________

This assumes that currently projected financing gaps
are closed by financing. If the adjustment would fully fall
on revenue or expenditure, the average NOPD would still
be a sizeable 6.3 percent of non-oil GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5.
Recent research8 shows that the PIH
may not be optimal for resource-rich lowincome countries (LICs). First, the PIH does
not answer the question whether resources
should be saved in financial assets abroad or in
domestic physical capital. Second, it may be
optimal to alter somewhat the shape of the
spending path implied by the PIH to speed up
the rate of public capital investment, especially
in capital-scarce countries. The PIH is silent
however, on possible links between public
investment and growth. To address the latter
issue, we need to integrate the main features
of the PIH with public investment and growth.

Adding the Public Investment and Growth Link

6.
Compared to historical levels,
Cameroon is increasing its public
investment. Cameroon is effectively
frontloading public investment, increasing it
from below 4 percent of GDP in the previous
decade to 6.4 in 2011 and maintaining it at this
level in the medium term—as projected in the
Growth and Employment Strategy
Paper (GESP). At the same time, current
spending is also up, from 11.6 percent of GDP
in 2006 to more than 15 percent in 2011. To

18

finance public investment and current
spending, all oil revenue is being spent as it
becomes available (Figure 2). Accordingly,
Cameroon is currently not following the PIH
approach. This also suggests that shifting from
current to capital expenditure would improve
growth prospects and fiscal sustainability—if
projects are carefully chosen. To analyze the
links between these issues, a more formal
modeling approach is adopted.

and its effect on growth and fiscal
sustainability. The model explicitly takes into
account the growth impact of public
investment and fiscal sustainability. There are
two sectors: oil and non-oil. The model is
calibrated using behavioral equations based
on Cameroon’s recent economic performance.

The main characteristics of the model are as
follows:


The economy consists of representative
households who maximize intertemporal
utility according to the following utility

downturn is expected.

Where Ct, It, CAt, Yo,t and Yno,t are domestic
consumption, investment, the current
account, oil and non-oil GDP, respectively.


The government chooses the level of
public investment, which has a positive
relationship to non-oil growth. The
relationship depends on a key parameter,
φ, which captures the level of efficiency of
translating public investment into public
capital (following Hulten, 1996). Public
investment crowds in private investment:

Kpt and Kgt are the public and private



The potential for extra growth via
increased public investment is balanced
by a reaction function governing the
NOPD. This function, incorporating how
the authorities have adjusted the NOPD in
the past, effectively limits the level of debt

Firms have access to technology that
evolves over time and they hire capital
and labor to produce non-oil goods
(maximizing their profits). Oil resources
belong to the government, whereas
non-oil goods are produced by firms
owned by households. The latter
optimally choose their intertemporal
consumption levels and the level of
private investment. The rest of the world
finances government financing gaps.

The model shows Cameroon will
need to improve the effectiveness of its
public investment to capture the expected
growth pay-off from the grands projets
structurants. We consider two DSGE
scenarios with the same public investment
path, but with different values for the
parameter φ (Figure 3). In both scenarios,
public investment gradually increases from
4.1 percent of GDP in 2010 to 6.6 percent by
2018, before coming down to 5.6 percent by
2032 (following the debt sustainability
analysis projections). The values for φ for the
“baseline“ and “optimistic” scenarios are taken
from Hulten (1996), who shows the lower
value to be more typical for African LICs.
Hence, this is the scenario that we consider
currently valid for Cameroon. This seems
reasonable because projected annual real
growth in the ‘baseline’ scenario is similar to
the historical average of 3.3 percent. If public
capital can be made more effective, average
annual growth increases to 5 percent. The
growth pay-offs assumed in the GESP
scenarios are much higher, even though the

CAMEROON

public investment paths are very similar to
those of the DSGE model (Figure 4), because
the GESP assumes the impact of the public

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

investment increase to be much more
significant.

In the baseline scenario, the fiscal
consequences of the muted growth
response to the public investment increase
causes fiscal indicators to deteriorate
substantially. The NOPD increases
substantially in the medium term in both DSGE
scenarios, but recovers much better under the
optimistic scenario in the long run (Figure 5).

private investment. Elements linked to the
former would typically include better project
management, development of capital markets,
reform of public utilities, and improvement of
public financial management. Issues related to
the latter include taking measures aimed at
creating an improved business climate.

Conclusion and Policy Recommendations
Cameroon’s challenge is how to increase much needed public investment, using inter alia
oil revenue, while remaining fiscally prudent.

11.
Assuming no substantial change to
the structure of the Cameroonian economy
or public finances, the current scaling up of
public investment will result in a lowgrowth trajectory in line with Cameroon’s
historical performance. Both the PIH and the
DSGE baseline show that the planned public
investment increase results in high NOPDs and
fast-accumulating debt. Hence, for the current

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

scaling-up effort to be effective, the
effectiveness of the public investment program
needs to increase substantially and an
enabling environment for private sector
investment needs to be created. The optimistic
scenario shows that if these conditions were
fulfilled, growth would reach a long-run level
of around 5 percent, with debt indicators
becoming more sustainable.

12. Cameroon is currently spending all its
oil revenue in a way that could jeopardize
future fiscal sustainability. Even though
there is a case for frontloading public
investment, this does not imply that the
precautionary rationale behind the PIH
approach becomes invalid. The NOPD should
be used to guide future changes in the design
and management of Cameroon’s public
finances while taking into account the
depletion of oil reserves. Without an

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

improvement in the effectiveness of public
investment, the public investment scaling-up
will not generate the growth needed for a
sustainable NOPD path. In the current highoil-price environment, at least some of the oil
revenue should be saved, and released for
public investment in future years as its
effectiveness picks up. This would be in tune
with the optimistic DSGE scenario which also
sees the non-oil primary balance turn positive
by the end of the projection period.

Appendix IV. Cameroon: External Competitiveness1
The results of the Consultative Group on Exchange Rates Issues (CGER) model-based
approaches suggest that Cameroon’s real effective exchange rate (REER) was overvalued
by some 8 percent at end-2011. These results are consistent with the findings of the 2012
Article IV consultation with the Central African Economic and Monetary Community
(CEMAC), that concluded that the REER for the aggregate CEMAC group was overvalued
by about 11 percent. The analysis of key relative price indicators suggests that the
environment for Cameroon’s exportables has improved since 1994, but price incentives
currently discourage the production of importables. Available survey data indicate that
Cameroon’s competitiveness remains particularly hampered by a weak business
environment, substantial obstacles to trade, and high costs of services.

A.

Developments in the Real Effective Exchange Rate

1.
Cameroon’s REER has remained on a
slightly increasing trend since the 1994
devaluation, suggesting that some of the
competitiveness gained with the
devaluation has eroded (Figure 1).1 In
2010-11, the REER depreciated by 6.6 percent,
mostly as a result of the depreciation of the
euro against other major currencies, mirroring
the evolution of the nominal effective
exchange rate (NEER). This depreciation did
not, however, offset the cumulative
appreciation of 1994–2009 (24 percent).
2.
Two approaches for assessing the
REER could be followed. A first approach is
to assume that the REER was close to its
long-run equilibrium level (LREER) during a
base period, defined as the two years
following the devaluation, and measure the
misalignment as the difference between the
actual REER and this base-period value, on the
implicit assumption that the LREER has
remained at its base-year level. An alternative

approach considers the sample mean of the
REER at its long-run equilibrium. Application of
the first approach suggests that the REER was
overvalued by about 10 percent at end-2011.
Using the sample mean in 1994–2011 indicates
an overvaluation of 1.5 percent at end-2011.
The utility of these two approaches is,
however, limited by the underlying assumption
of a constant LREER and their inability to allow
for permanent changes in the LREER that could
have been generated by changes in its
determinants. The overall declining trend of
the terms of trade (TOT) since 1994 (and their
strong volatility) is one of the fundamentals
suggesting that the LREER may have shifted
during the period under review.

Model-Based Assessments

We use the three CGER approaches
to assess the REER— the equilibrium real
exchange rate (ERER) approach; the
macroeconomic balance (MB) approach;
and the external sustainability (ES)
approach.2 We complement these approaches
with an adjusted macroeconomic balance
approach taking into account Cameroon’s oil
wealth and the projected exhaustion of oil
resources in estimating a current account
norm.

The ERER approach models the
medium-run equilibrium value of the REER
as a function of fundamental factors that
cause persistent deviations from long-run
purchasing power parity. It involves three
steps. First, a reduced-form equation relating
the REER and a set of relevant fundamentals is
estimated. Second, the medium-term
equilibrium level of the REER is constructed by
multiplying the estimated coefficient from the
reduced-form equation by the medium-term
forecasts of the fundamentals. Finally, the
exchange rate adjustment needed to restore
equilibrium over the medium term is
calculated as the difference between the
estimated equilibrium real exchange rate and
its current value.

CAMEROON

5.
The ERER approach indicates that
Cameroon’s REER was undervalued by
about 3 percent at end-2011.3 However, the
90 percent confidence interval is wide (from an
undervaluation of about 14 percent to an
overvaluation of 8 percent) and includes zero
(Figure 2). Forward-looking estimates obtained
using for the fundamentals the values
projected in the macro framework presented
in this report show that the REER would be
overvalued by about 7 percent in 2016 (again
with a wide margin including zero) if the
benchmark REER stayed at the 2011 level.
6.
The MB approach estimates the
exchange rate adjustment needed to close
the gap between the current account (CA)
balance projected over the medium term at
the prevailing exchange rate (the
“underlying” CA) and an estimated
equilibrium CA balance (or “CA norm”),
based on economic fundamentals.
Cameroon’s oil trade surplus is one of the
determinants used to estimate this norm. The
approach again consists of three steps. First,
panel regressions estimating the current
account balance as a function of a set of
macroeconomic fundamentals are run. Second,
current account norms are computed as a
function of the levels of fundamentals
projected over the medium term, using the
coefficients estimated in the first steps.
Cameroon’s oil trade surplus is one of the
determinants used to estimate this norm.
Third, the degree of exchange rate
misalignment is inferred as the proportional
change in the real exchange rate needed to

close the gap between the underlying CA
balance and the CA norm, using the
country-specific elasticity of the CA with
respect to the real exchange rate.
7.
The MB approach indicates that
Cameroon’s REER was overvalued by about
13 percent at end-2011. The CA norm for
Cameroon is estimated at about 2 percent of
GDP and the underlying CA deficit is about
3 percent.4 With an elasticity of the CA balance
with respect to the real exchange rate of -0.4
(deduced from estimates of export and import
elasticities for similar countries), the approach
suggests that the real exchange rate would
need to depreciate by about 13 percent to
close the external CA gap (with lower and
upper bounds of 4 and 22 percent,
respectively).5 Forward-looking calculations
resulted in an underlying CA deficit close to
4.5 percent in 2017 and a CA norm close to
0.5 percent of GDP, implying almost the same
CA gap as the backward-looking approach.
8.
For oil-producing countries, the MB
approach has been adjusted to take into
account the expected return on oil wealth
and the projected depletion of oil reserves
in deriving the CA norm. The 2012 Article IV
CEMAC consultation team applied one of
those methodologies6 to the whole CEMAC

The estimation considers the following
macroeconomic fundamentals: fiscal balance, old-age

The higher the elasticity is (in absolute value), the
lower the degree of REER overvaluation. Recent REER
assessments for SSA countries use elasticities of the
current account to the REER ranging from -0.3 to -0.6.

group, and to individual CEMAC countries, and
found that Cameroon’s REER was overvalued
by about 15 percent, based on an estimated
CA norm of 2.3 percent, an underlying CA
deficit of about 3 percent of GDP, and an
elasticity of the CA to the REER of -0.37. An
elasticity of -0.40 would have given an
overvaluation of about 13 percent.
9.
The ES approach calculates the
difference between the actual CA balance
and the CA balance that would stabilize the
net foreign asset (NFA) position at some
benchmark level. On the basis of the
estimated elasticity of the CA balance to the
REER, this difference is translated into the real
exchange rate adjustment that—over the
medium term—would bring the CA balance in
line with its NFA-stabilizing level, under a
particular assumption about the economy’s
medium-term nominal growth rate. Based on
an estimated NFA-stabilizing CA balance close
to 1 percent of GDP over the medium-term, as
well as the same elasticity of the CA to the

REER as in the MB approach (-0.40), the ES
approach finds that the REER was overvalued
by about 9 percent at end-2011 and would be
overvalued by about 13 percent by 2017 under
the baseline scenario.
10.
In summary, the estimation results
point to an overvaluation of Cameroon’s
REER in three out of the four approaches
used. The average overvaluation for the four
methods is about 8 percent, indicating that
Cameroon’s external competitiveness has
deteriorated. These results, however, have to
be interpreted with caution. First, they are
sensitive to a wide range of assumptions made
in the construction of the baseline scenario for
Cameroon. Second, structural differences
between Cameroon and many countries in the
panel make the panel regressions less
meaningful. Third, the estimates are highly
sensitive to the assumed elasticities of exports,
imports, and CA with respect to the real
exchange rate.

Alternative Indicators of External Competitiveness

11.
The REERs discussed above measure
the relative domestic and foreign price
levels expressed in a common currency. The
economic literature on developing countries
considers, however, that the “internal” real
exchange rate (IRER), defined as the relative
price of nontradable to tradable goods, is a
more appropriate measure of competitiveness
because it is the key relative price influencing
resource allocation, the production and
consumption of tradables and nontradables,
and thus ultimately, external balance. Although
the theoretical concept of the IRER is
straightforward, its empirical measurement
raises the problem of finding operational
counterparts for the required price indices of
tradable and nontradable goods. As a result,
the literature uses a variety of proxies. We
depart from a two-good framework by
dividing the economy into three categories of
goods: exports, imports, and domestically
produced and consumed goods. We consider
that aggregating imports and exports into one
composite tradable good blurs the effects of
changes in the terms of trade and constitutes a
price index that does not adequately translate
the incentive effects of a change in IRER either
on the supply side or on the demand side of
the economy.
12.
The three-good framework
produces two IRERs, corresponding to the
relative prices of exportables and
importables in terms of domestically
produced and consumed goods:

IRERx  Pd / Px
IRERm = Pd / Pm
Where Pd is the price of the domestic goods,
and Px and Pm the domestic prices of

exportables and importables, respectively,
measured in domestic currency terms. IRERx
could be considered as an indicator of the
internal price competitiveness of exports
relative to domestic goods. A decline in IRERx
would indicate a gain in competitiveness for
the export sector. IRERm is similarly an
indicator of the internal price competitiveness
of domestic goods relative to importables (or
imported goods). A rise in IRERm indicates a
loss in competitiveness for importables.
13.
Figure 3 compares the evolution of
the four categories of relative prices in
1994–2011. They include the (external) REER
used above in the model-based assessment,
the relative price of domestic goods to imports
(IRERm), the relative price of domestic goods
to exports (IRERx), and the relative price of
nontradables to tradables published by the
Cameroonian National Institute of Statistics
(IRERn).7 Four observations can be drawn from
Figure 3:


IRERx and IRERm have been more volatile
than the external real exchange rate
(REER). This higher volatility increases
uncertainty that is not captured by the
external real effective exchange rate
discussed in Section I and is detrimental to
externally oriented sectors in the economy.

IRERx has been on a declining trend since
1998,8 suggesting that the exportable

sector has been gaining competitiveness
against domestically oriented sectors. This
evolution reflects the rise in oil and non-oil
commodities’ international prices in the
period considered, the overall containment
of prices of domestic goods through fiscal
and monetary policies, and actions to raise
the supply of agricultural commodities.


By contrast, IRERm has been on a rising
trend,9 which is an indication of a general
gradual loss in competitiveness for
production oriented toward import
substitution and an overall gain in

competitiveness for imports in domestic
consumption.


IRERn, which is calculated using the
authorities’ price series of tradable and
nontradable commodities, tracks quite well
the evolution of the external REER,
suggesting that analysis based on it would
also not adequately capture price
incentives affecting production and
consumption and ultimately external
balance assessment of competitiveness not
based on real exchange rate measures.

Assessment of Competitiveness not Based on Real Exchange Rates

14.
Many factors beyond prices have a
bearing on national competitiveness. The
2011–12 World Economic Forum’s report on
global competitiveness defines
competitiveness as the set of institutions,
policies, and factors that determine the level of
productivity of a country. This section presents
available survey data that compare Cameroon
with its external competitors on the structural
determinants of competitiveness.

reforms implemented by the government
under a public-private dialogue launched in
2009. However, Cameroon still ranks below the
SSA average of 137. According to the 2012
World Economic Forum’s report on global
competitiveness, firms identify access to
financing, corruption, inadequate
infrastructure, tax regulations, and government
bureaucracy as the five major constraints to
doing business in Cameroon (Figure 4).

15.
The 2012 Global Competitiveness
Index (GCI) ranks Cameroon 116 out of
142 surveyed countries, with a score of
3.7 out of 7 (Table 1). Cameroon ranks lower
than the sub-Saharan African (SSA) average on
institutional environment and infrastructure,
but higher on macroeconomic environment,
health, and primary education. Its overall rank
on efficiency enhancers (including higher
education and training, goods and labor
market efficiency, financial sector
development, technology readiness, and
market size) is 120 out of 142, which compares
to the SSA average of 111.

On trade, the 2012 Enabling Trade
Index (ETI) published by the World
Economic Forum ranks Cameroon 118 out
of 132 with an overall score of 3.3 out of 7
(Table 3). Among the pillars of the ETI,
Cameroon scores the lowest on availability and

Cameroon slightly improved its
ranking in the 2011 World Bank Doing

161 (from 168 in 2011) by getting a higher
rating on dealing with construction permits,
getting credit, and staring a business (Table 2).
This improvement was possible because of

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By

Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf and
Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
and Jeffrey D. Lewis and
Marcelo Giugale (World
Bank)

Prepared by the IMF African Department and the
International Development Association

This joint IMF-World Bank low-income country debt sustainability analysis (LIC-DSA) for
Cameroon follows up on the LIC-DSA prepared in 2011. It concludes that Cameroon continues
to face a low risk of debt distress insofar as all external debt ratios remain well below the
policy-dependent indicative thresholds under the baseline scenario, as well as under all stress
tests. However, total public debt indicators are markedly higher than in the 2011 DSA, largely
because of the impact of the projected accumulation of payment arrears on domestic debt, and
higher issuance of government securities to cover part of the fiscal deficit. The projected large
increase in domestic debt calls for the reform of the fuel subsidy mechanism and a
strengthening of commitment controls to limit the accumulation of domestic arrears.
Moreover, there has been acceleration in nonconcessional borrowing commitments since the
2011 DSA, which warrants a cautious approach to borrowing. Enhancing non-oil revenue
mobilization and widening the export base in light of the anticipated long-run decline of oil
revenues would help mitigate the projected increase in debt service.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

CAMEROON

BACKGROUND
1.
This report follows up on the debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) prepared in
2011 (IMF Country Report No. 11/116).1
The macroeconomic framework supporting
the present analysis reflects the outcome of
the 2012 IMF Article IV discussions with the
authorities and is based on end-2011 data.
The debt data cover central government
external debt and guaranteed debt of public
entities, as well as an estimate of domestic
debt. Despite efforts to improve debt
statistics, the coverage of liabilities of public
enterprises and municipalities, contingent

liabilities of financial institutions, and
government obligations to parastatal entities
remains uneven.
2.
The impact of the Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) and the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)
resulted in a marked improvement in
Cameroon’s debt position. Following HIPC
and MDRI, the public debt-to-GDP ratio
declined from 52 percent in 2005 to
10 percent in 2008. Since 2008, however,
domestic and external borrowing has been
rising (Text Table 1).

The rise in external debt has been generated
by an increase in external borrowing by the
central government and public enterprises.
External public debt represented more than
half of total public debt at end-2011. Its
composition is skewed toward multilateral
debt, but the share of non-Paris Club bilateral
debt is expected to increase over the forecast
period as a result of growing nonconcessional

borrowing.2 Domestic debt has increased
significantly since 2008 as a result of the
completion of audits of government arrears,
and the issuance of government bonds and
treasury bills on the regional market in 2010
and 2011,3 respectively, and the securitization
of arrears to the national oil refinery (Société
Nationale de Raffinage; SONARA) in 2011 (Text
Table 2).

BASELINE SCENARIO
Relative to the 2011 DSA, the baseline
scenario incorporates somewhat higher oil
prices, higher new domestic borrowing
through issuance of government securities,
and faster accumulation of domestic arrears
(Text Table 3 and Box 1). Projections for real
GDP growth, government revenue, and exports
remain broadly close to those underlining the
2011 DSA. Oil prices for 2012-17 are based on
the latest World Economic Outlook (WEO)
assumptions and are assumed to remain
constant beyond 2017. 1011 The government’s
10

Agreements were also finalized with most London
Club commercial creditors, whereby the stock of debt
was reduced to US$1.24 million (0.005 percent of GDP)

intentions to issue securities in 2012 and to
remain active on the regional bond market
afterwards result in a forecast of higher

in 2009. The authorities are making every effort to
settle the outstanding debt, but are experiencing
difficulties in engaging with some creditors either
because of a lack of response from them or because
they no longer exist as ongoing commercial entities.
11

Bond purchases taking place externally are treated
as external debt by the authorities even if the debt is
denominated in local currency. Of the CFAF 200 billion
issued in 2010, CFAF 42 billion was sold externally.
Staff has accepted the authorities’ convention for the
purposes of the 2012 DSA but will treat it as domestic
debt going forward. Staff considers it to have the same
level of risk as domestic debt.

issuance of treasury bills and bonds than in the
2011 DSA (CFAF 750 billion over the projection
period versus CFAF 250 billion in the previous
DSA). The scenario further assumes no change
in fuel pricing policy (i.e., a price freeze) and
projects annual fiscal financing gaps. In order

CAMEROON

to capture the full debt vulnerabilities
associated with the projected financing gaps,
the DSA assumes that these gaps will be
covered by issuance of interest-bearing
government securities, resulting in higher
domestic interest payments.

Public investment projects are the
centerpiece of the government’s growth
strategy. Closing the infrastructure gap,
particularly in transportation and power
generation, is considered to be critical to
achieving the faster economic growth rates
needed to reduce poverty. Financing for the
additional public spending is expected to
come from budget resources and a
combination of domestic and external
borrowing. Although the authorities will
continue to seek concessional borrowing,

nonconcessional financing is likely to be
required to meet financing needs.
4.
Overall outstanding debt is
projected to be markedly higher than in
the previous DSA throughout the
projection period. The higher level of debt
reflects mostly the increase in domestic debt
arising from the higher issuance of
government securities to cover budgetary
commitments and financing gaps.

During January 2011–April 2012, the authorities
contracted 30 borrowing agreements, equivalent to
almost 6 percent of 2011 GDP. At least 15 of these
loans were nonconcessional, with an average grant
element of 21.3 percent. Future nonconcessional
borrowings are assumed to have an average grant
element of 20 percent.
5

Nonconcessional new borrowing commitments are
projected at CFAF 746 billion in 2012. This DSA will
provide input to World Bank staff in establishing
ceilings for nonconcessional borrowing in 2012, under
the International Development Association’s
nonconcessional borrowing policies.

These commitments aim at alleviating
infrastructure bottlenecks in energy, roads,
ports, communications, and water supply.
Information provided by the authorities
indicates that 75 and 70 percent of the new
commitments in 2012 and 2013, respectively,
would be nonconcessional.5 Staffs assume that
new borrowing commitments after 2013 will
decline gradually to 2.4 percent of GDP by
2017. A rate of disbursement from outstanding
commitments of about 14 percent has been

assumed for 2012, mostly based on the
external project loan disbursements foreseen
in the budget. For 2013–17, disbursements are
projected to increase gradually from CFAF 250
billion to around CFAF 400 billion in light of
the country’s implementation of major
infrastructure projects (Text Table 5) and to
remain at that level for the rest of the
projection period.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario1
Medium Term, 2013-17
The forecast of an average 5 percent GDP growth rate for the medium term is underpinned by assumptions
of continued recovery in non-oil exports following the global crisis, a rebound in oil output, and increased
capital spending. Data on the volume of oil production were obtained from the national hydrocarbon
company, (Société Nationale des Hydrocarbures; SNH). They indicate that production will gradually expand
from 69 thousand barrels a day in 2012 to 103 thousand barrels in 2017. Average annual consumer price
inflation is expected to stabilize at 2.5 percent over the medium-term, in line with historical trends and the
Central African Economic and Monetary Union (Communauté Economique et Monétaire de l’Afrique
Centrale; CEMAC) convergence criteria.
Non-oil revenue is forecast to average 14.5 percent of non-oil GDP in 2012-17, as the authorities consolidate
the reforms in tax and customs administrations. Oil revenue is estimated to decline gradually from
5.5 percent of GDP in 2012 to 4.1 percent of GDP in 2017, mostly owing to the projected fall in international
oil prices (Text Table 3). The non-oil fiscal primary deficit is projected to remain close to 9 percent of non-oil
GDP during 2013–17 on the basis of continued acceleration in the implementation of major public
investment projects and continuation of the existing fuel price policy, giving rise to continued accumulation
of domestic arrears.
The external current account deficit is projected to decline from 4.7 percent of GDP in 2012 to 3.3 percent of
GDP in 2017. The volume growth of non-oil exports is forecast to increase from 7 percent in 2012 to above
8 percent in 2017. The growth in import volume is projected to reflect the acceleration of real GDP growth
during 2013-17, and takes into account the increase in imports of equipment and intermediate goods for
infrastructure projects. The current account deficit is expected to be financed through foreign direct
investment, external public borrowing, and other private capital inflows.
Long Term, 2018-32
Growth is expected to average 4.6 percent in 2018–32 and will be driven by the expansion in the non-oil
sectors. Growth of non-oil exports volumes is projected to remain around 8 percent over the long term.
Oil revenue is projected to decline from 4.0 percent of GDP in 2017 to 0.3 percent of GDP by 2032, following
the depletion of oil reserves. Non-oil revenue is projected to rise from 14.6 percent of non-oil GDP in 2017
to 16.0 percent by 2032, reflecting sustained implementation of measures to strengthen tax and customs
administration. The non-oil primary deficit is projected to decline gradually, reaching about 3 percent of
non-oil GDP towards the end of the forecast period. This path is consistent with assumptions of greater
control of current spending, increasing allocations for public infrastructure, and improved expenditure
execution in priority areas.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT
G. Baseline Scenario6
6.
The LIC debt sustainability
framework is guided by country-specific
indicative debt burden thresholds for
external debt. These thresholds reflect the
empirical findings that sustainable debt levels
for a LIC increase with the quality of policies
and institutions. Such quality is measured by
the Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) index, compiled annually by
the World Bank. Cameroon ranks as a ‘weak
performer’ under the joint IMF/World Bank
debt sustainability framework (Text Table 6).

Although it is at the sub-Saharan African (SSA)
average and above the CEMAC average,
Cameroon ranks as a weak performer based on
its three-year moving average CPIA score. The
indicative external debt burden thresholds for
countries in this category are a present value
(PV) of the debt-to-exports ratio of 100
percent; a PV of the debt-to-revenue ratio of
200 percent; a PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio of
30 percent; and debt service-to-exports and
revenue ratios of 15 percent and 18 percent,
respectively.

projection period up to 2025 before they level
off. The increase in external debt is a result of
the acceleration in borrowing required for the
government’s infrastructure program. The
terms on which such borrowing takes place
will have a major bearing on the long-term
profile of the external debt. Increased new
external commitments on nonconcessional
terms could represent a threat to debt
sustainability in the longer term.

H. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
8.
Alternative scenarios and bound
tests show that debt indicators remain
below their thresholds over the projection
horizon. The historical scenario, which is
associated with past external current account
surpluses, is unlikely to occur, as oil production
is expected to begin to taper off within the

next 10 years. This scenario shows a more
optimistic debt ratio trajectory relative to the
baseline. Thus, in terms of the risk assessment,
the historical scenario is not relevant and the
related graphs are not presented in Figures 1
and 2.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9.
An export shock would be a source
of increased debt vulnerability. The export
stress test (exports growth in US dollar terms
in 2013–14 at one standard deviation below
the ten-year historical average) could be
associated with a large drop in oil prices or in
external demand for non-oil exports coming
from a deepening of the global crisis. The
stress test assumes a drop of 5.2 percent in the
value of exports in both 2013 and 2014 and a
return to the growth rates assumed in the
baseline scenario thereafter. The magnitude of
the shock is somewhat lower than in the 2011
DSA because of the stronger historical average
growth of exports over 2002-11 than in the
2001-10 period. Hence, in contrast to the 2011

CAMEROON

DSA, the amount of new borrowing required
to compensate for the effects of the shock
does not give rise to a breach in the threshold.
10.
A bound test capturing debt
vulnerabilities that may be generated by
already identified contingent liabilities is
also conducted. The test takes into account
the potential contingent claims from
restructuring a number of distressed banks
(estimated at CFAF 60 billion for one major
bank) and negative equity (CFAF 28 billion) in
the balance sheet of a recently-audited stateowned enterprise. The amounts involved are
however not significant in terms of having an
impact on long-run debt sustainability.

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT
11.
The DSA baseline shows that there is
a marked upward trend in public sector
debt ratios which could threaten long-term
debt sustainability (Figure 2). The PV of
debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase
from 16 percent of GDP in 2012 to 48 percent
of GDP in 2032, while it was expected to
remain in the range of 12-15 percent of GDP in
the previous DSA (Table 1). A substantial
increase is also recorded for the PV of debt-torevenue ratio. Much of the increase in debt
levels results from the assumption that new
domestic debt will be generated by the
issuance of government securities,
securitization of arrears to SONARA and the
accumulation of further domestic debt related
to the financing of projected fiscal financing
gaps. By contrast, the 2011 DSA was calibrated
on a policy reform scenario.8

12.
Alternative scenarios and bound
tests indicate that debt vulnerabilities reemerge under certain scenarios (Table 2
and Figure 2). An alternative downside
scenario assuming a growth rate of 0.2
percentage point below the baseline is
considered for all the projection period
(Scenario A3 in Table 2). This scenario could
reflect a situation in which the additional
infrastructure investment financed in part
through an increase in nonconcessional
borrowing, does not produce a substantial
impact on growth. It results in a PV of debt-toGDP ratio of 54 percent by 2032, which is
higher than the baseline scenario (48 percent).
This highlights the need for rigorous project
selection to maximize potential returns on
2012 and increased public investment shows that the
overall debt-to-GDP ratio is slightly lower than in the
baseline scenario. The reform scenario was not
retained for the 2012 DSA because the postponement
of legislative elections to 2013 is likely to result in
reduced momentum for reform in the near future.

investment. Under the scenario of an
unchanged primary deficit from 2012, all key
debt ratios remain below the baseline
reflecting the increasing projected primary
deficit in the baseline scenario that would
result from increased public investment and
the cost of fuel subsidies.
13.
Cameroon continues to strengthen
its debt management framework, though
more efforts are required going forward in
view of emerging vulnerabilities. The
authorities are implementing a new debt

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

management strategy aligned with the CEMAC
guidelines. Since 2009, a quarterly report has
been published on the country’s debt
situation. The authorities produce an annual
DSA and update the medium-term debt
management strategy for central government
debt, which are annexed to the annual budget
law. The National Debt Committee, instituted
in 2008, is now in place, and the audit of
domestic arrears is ongoing. These efforts will
need to be reinforced if long-term debt
sustainability is to be preserved.

CONCLUSION
14.
Cameroon’s risk of debt distress
remains low, but there are signs of
vulnerability emerging from increasing
domestic debt. All external debt ratios remain
well below their respective policy-dependent
thresholds. However, ongoing and projected
new domestic borrowing and accumulation of
domestic arrears will push debt indicators to
levels significantly higher than in the 2011 DSA
throughout the projection period,
underscoring the need for the adoption of
prudent fiscal policies. Moreover, while some
uncertainty exists regarding the amounts and
the terms, the quite rapid pace of
accumulation of nonconcessional borrowing
commitments in 2011-12 is a source of
concern. Stress tests assuming export and
growth shocks indicate that all debt indicators
remain below their thresholds through 2032,
but there are signs of emerging vulnerability.
For this reason, borrowing should be
contracted on concessional terms to the extent
possible and be contingent on thorough
project evaluation. Staffs remain of the view
that continued efforts to improve non-oil
revenue mobilization and to widen the export
base would help mitigate emerging debt
vulnerabilities.

15.
The authorities broadly shared the
risk assessment, while pointing to the
scarcity of concessional financing for the
key infrastructure projects underpinning
the growth strategy. The authorities see the
current debt vulnerability level as providing
some space for a reasonable increase in debtfinanced investment. However, they are
cognizant of the need to finance infrastructure
projects with concessional financing to the
extent possible. They consider that a more
appropriate assessment of debt vulnerabilities
would be based on a reform scenario
assuming lower accumulation of domestic
arrears in line with the authorities’ intention to
maintain medium- and long-term fiscal
sustainability.
16.
Persistent weakness in public
financial management and insufficient data
coverage underline the need for caution in
assessing Cameroon’s debt sustainability.
Vulnerabilities include quasi-fiscal liabilities of
state-owned enterprises and distressed banks,
and further build up of domestic arrears. The
authorities’ efforts to improve debt
management could be reinforced to ensure
better coverage of public sector liabilities and
by a new and more comprehensive audit of all
government payment obligations.

1/ Includes both public and publicly-guaranteed external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the
assistance. Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover
the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the
member qualifies for such debt relief.
__________________
Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country qualifies
for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at
the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as
defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of
pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).

Safeguards Assessments:

The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank. The most recent
safeguards assessment of the BEAC was completed on July 6, 2009. The findings of this assessment
indicated that implementation of previous safeguards recommendations on financial reporting,
internal audit, and internal control was limited, and that the changing risk profile of the BEAC
foreign exchange holdings required further actions to strengthen safeguards at the BEAC.
Subsequent to the revelation in the Paris office, a series of initial measures and longer-term reforms
was agreed between the IMF and the BEAC in order to continue with country programs. The BEAC
adopted an action plan for 2010 with the aim of reforming its own governance and strengthening
key safeguards. Implementation delays and additional safeguards concerns raised in the first special
audit triggered a suspension of IMF disbursements to CEMAC countries from June to early August
2010, after which they resumed. In addition, since 2010, the BEAC and the IMF agreed on additional

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMEROON

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

periodic measures to address the weaknesses highlighted by the special audit and to strengthen
governance bodies. A recent safeguards monitoring mission identified a new series of rolling
benchmarks to address outstanding safeguards concerns going forward.
XI.

Exchange Arrangements:

Cameroon participates in a currency union with five other members of the CEMAC and has no
separate legal tender. Cameroon’s currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at the fixed rate of
CFAF 655.957 per euro. Local currency equivalent: CFAF 792.68=SDR 1, as of June 14, 2012. Effective
January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the CEMAC countries has been reclassified to the
category of conventional pegged arrangement from the category of exchange arrangement with no
separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of the common currency,
whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new
classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has
been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its
members.
Cameroon maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for restrictions maintained for security reasons
that have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board decision 144 152/51.
XII.

Article IV Consultation:

The last Article IV consultation with Cameroon was concluded by the Executive Board on
June 24, 2011.
XIII.

FSAP Participation and ROSCs:

A Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) report was issued in May 2000. An update of the
FSSA was completed in February 2009, based on the work of a joint IMF-World Bank mission that
visited Cameroon as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in June 2007, itself
building upon the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) regional FSAP that
was conducted in 2006.
The first Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on fiscal transparency and
transparency of monetary and financial policies for Cameroon was issued in June 2000.
A fiscal ROSC reassessment mission visited Yaoundé, Cameroon, during May 6-18, 2009. Its report
was issued in June 2010.

World Bank program
Strategy: The World Bank Country Assistance Strategy for 2010-2013 aims to stimulate growth by improving
governance, competitiveness, and service delivery. The World Bank will help stimulate more inclusive growth
by improving competitiveness through (i) increased infrastructure investment in the energy, transport, and
telecommunications sectors; (ii) activities geared toward ensuring the transparent, equitable, and sustainable
use of natural resources; and (iii) promotion of high potential value chains and improved business climate.
For service delivery, the emphasis is on (i) human development (education, health); (ii) social protection to
help develop an effective safety net system based on targeted programs; and (iii) local development, where
the focus will be on increasing access to basic services through infrastructure upgrading and capacity
building for improved local governance. The Bank’s engagement in Cameroon will be examined and any
adjustments reflected formally in a 2012 Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report, which is scheduled for
Board presentation at the end of September 2012.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes. There
is scope for improvement in quality, coverage, and timeliness in most macroeconomic datasets. In recent
years, the authorities have taken the initiative to improve the macroeconomic database, particularly the
national accounts and balance of payments statistics.
Real sector statistics: The Institut National de la Statistique du Cameroun (INS) has compiled a revised set
of national accounts estimates based on the 1993 System of National Accounts (1993 SNA). Updating to the
2008 SNA is ongoing. The framework for the collection and production of business enterprise statistics was
found to be weak, creating difficulties for gauging the structure of the economy and current industrial
activity. Particularly serious difficulties affect data quality in the following key sectors: agriculture,
manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade, local government, and services. The production index should be
overhauled and integrated with the corresponding components of the annual national accounts. Other
areas for concern include a limited selection of price indices for deflation of national accounts concepts and
the lack of information on employment. In light of these shortcomings, technical assistance will remain
essential in the coming years. The STA missions in 2009, 2010 and 2011 sought to support the compilation
of improved national accounts statistics, including the development of quarterly national accounts.
Government finance statistics: The quality of fiscal data is broadly adequate for surveillance, but has some
shortcomings in coverage, periodicity, timeliness, and accessibility. Quarterly reports on the overall budget
execution, and the investment budget execution have been produced on a continuous basis. Despite this
progress, data on the public finances are still in need of improvements in quality, coverage, timeliness, and
dissemination of data based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) Weaknesses in
the fiscal data include: (i) incomplete compilation of budget implementation data on a commitment and, to
some extent, on a cash basis; (ii) a lack of information on the financial information of local governments; (iii)
poor monitoring of cross-liabilities in the public sector and of public enterprise debt; and (iv) lack of
information on the financial information of public enterprises more generally. The authorities plan to
establish comprehensive fiscal accounts on a commitment basis, a functional classification of the budget
and will strive to monitor the float. Moreover, the ongoing audit of government domestic debt, which will
cover cross-liabilities in the public sector and public enterprise external debt, is expected to strengthen debt
data. Efforts to enhance transparency of financial operations in the oil sector should also improve overall
fiscal reporting. Efforts are also underway to collect data on the operations of the largest 20 public
enterprises.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary statistics are reported to the Fund by the Banque des États de
l’Afrique Centrale (BEAC) on a monthly basis in the format of the standardized report forms (SRFs), with
delays of up to two months. A key shortcoming of monetary and financial statistics is the lack of data for
interest rates offered by the financial institutions sector to non-financial entities on deposits and loans. In
addition, the depository corporation survey does not include data from deposit taking microfinance
institutions, a growing sector in the country.
Balance of payments: Since March 2006 STA technical assistance, the authorities have started to produce
higher quality data within a reasonable time period but there are still some significant delays. Balance of
payments data are reported annually to STA albeit with some lags. The latest reported data refer to 2010.
External debt data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but are comprehensive only for public and publicly
guaranteed debt. Data are collected by the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA), which is responsible
for signing international loan agreements and servicing the government's external debt obligations. The
CAA's database is fairly comprehensive and up-to-date, and contains accurate stock data, and produces
projected debt-service flows on a loan-by-loan basis, but regular statements are not received from
creditors.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Cameroon
On July 13, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Cameroon on a lapse of time basis.15
Background
The economic rebound observed in 2010 strengthened in 2011, with growth reaching 4.2
percent (compared with 2.9 percent in 2010), despite a decline in oil output. This decline
reflected aging equipment and postponement of some investments following the 2008–09 global
financial crisis. Average inflation edged up to 2.9 percent in 2011 (from 1.3 percent the year
before) mostly reflecting a rise in food prices. External balances in 2011 benefited from positive
developments in commodity prices, but the current account deficit (including grants) widened
from 3.0 percent to 4.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), following a 16 percent
increase in the volume of imports.
The government’s fiscal situation remained difficult in 2011. Non-oil revenue performance was
characterized by lower-than-budgeted value-added tax (VAT) receipts, mostly caused by
parastatals not being able to meet their VAT obligations. The shortfall in non-oil revenue was
offset by an oil revenue windfall generated by the surge in international oil prices. On the
expenditure side, budget execution was affected by the need to settle outstanding payment

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for consideration by the
Executive Board. The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse of time procedure when the
Board agrees that a proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.

orders from previous years, pressure from fuel subsidies, and overruns on other current
transfers. Consequently, the non-oil primary deficit, on a cash basis, deteriorated from 5.7
percent to 8.5 percent of non-oil GDP, and the overall fiscal deficit, on a cash basis, reached 3.4
percent of GDP versus 2.3 percent the year before.
Conditions in the banking system remained worrisome. This reflected financial distress in four
(and possibly five) of the country’s 13 commercial banks, excessive concentration in bank
credit, inadequate resources for the regional supervisory agency, and weaknesses in the
current framework for dealing with distressed banks. Financial sector soundness indicators
deteriorated in 2011 and nonperforming loans increased by about 17 percent. At the same time,
the number of banks in violation of the main prudential ratios continued to increase.
Over the longer term, Cameroon has maintained macroeconomic stability, and debt relief under
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Relief (MDRI) Initiatives
considerably reduced the debt burden. However, there has been almost no growth in per capita
income during the last five years, despite a relatively diversified productive base.
Economic growth is now expected to increase moderately under current policies which would
imply positive per capita growth of over 2 percent in 2012. Staff projects real GDP to increase
gradually from 4.2 percent in 2011 to 5½ percent in 2016. Non-oil growth is to be supported by
ongoing efforts to boost agricultural productivity and competitiveness; major public investment
projects; and measures to improve the business environment. The oil sector is expected to
boost real GDP growth in 2012–17, reflecting the coming on-stream of ongoing investments,
following successful exploration efforts. Inflation is expected to remain below the regional
convergence criterion of 3 percent.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2012 Article IV consultation with Cameroon, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Economic growth continues at a moderate pace, and measured inflation remains within the
regional convergence limit of 3 percent. There are, however, risks to the outlook arising from a
potential downturn in the global economy, particularly in Europe; increasing financial sector
vulnerabilities and the impact of the increase in fuel subsidies and the stock of domestic arrears
on fiscal sustainability.
There is a need to address the substantial challenges facing the 2012 budget if a further
deterioration of the fiscal situation is to be avoided. These result from underbudgeting fuel
subsidies, further arrears accumulation in 2011, and contingent liabilities of public enterprises
and distressed banks. Safeguarding fiscal sustainability over the medium-term will require

corrective measures including improving non-oil revenue mobilization; containing expenditure
on fuel subsidies and avoiding accumulation of domestic arrears; and rebuilding fiscal buffers.
There is continuing concern regarding public financial management performance. The ongoing
audit of arrears should be finalized and a plan adopted for the settling of audited arrears. Public
expenditure management should also be reinforced by strengthening control of the expenditure
chain and better tracking of the flow of funds.
There are risks to financial sector stability arising from the increasing number of distressed
banks and the delays in restructuring them, the concentration of bank credit to the national oil
refinery, and the spillover from arrears accumulation. Lasting financial stability can only be
achieved through an effective regional framework and better cooperation between national and
regional bodies. As the largest economy in the CEMAC region, Cameroon should take a
proactive stance in pressing toward the necessary regional reforms in the financial sector.
A key policy priority for Cameroon is achieving higher and more inclusive growth through
addressing the significant infrastructure gaps and improving the business climate. Accelerating
Cameroon’s recent moderate economic growth performance will require the full implementation
of a major program of public investment. Competitiveness in Cameroon remains challenged by
structural factors. Improving the business climate will require that the authorities tackle
governance issues, deepen dialogue with private sector interests, take measures to increase
the level of financial intermediation, and improve access to credit.
Cameroon’s risk of debt distress remains low. Nonetheless, reducing domestic arrears and
maintaining a prudent borrowing policy are essential to preserving debt sustainability. Total
public debt indicators have deteriorated since 2011 owing to the impact of domestic arrears on
domestic debt and the need to cover fiscal financing gaps through increased securitization.
There are further signs of vulnerabilities emerging from increasing quasi-fiscal liabilities of stateowned enterprises and distressed banks, and external borrowing at nonconcessional terms.
Reform of the fuel subsidy mechanism, improved commitment control, and external borrowing
at concessional terms to the extent possible would help to maintain overall debt sustainability.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
