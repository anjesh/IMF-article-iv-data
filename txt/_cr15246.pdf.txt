IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Philippines

On August 26, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Philippines.1
The Philippine economy continues to expand strongly in line with potential growth. Real GDP
grew by 6.1 percent in 2014, driven by household consumption, private construction, and exports
of goods and services. Economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2015, due mainly to
temporary factors, including the effects of dry weather on agricultural production, weak global
demand for exports, and slow budget execution. Inflation fell below the bottom of the BSP’s
target band (3±1 percent) in June 2015, led by lower fuel and food prices. As the economy is
growing broadly at potential, there is no evidence of price or wage pressures, and considerable
slack in the labor market remains. The current dry weather associated with El Niño conditions
has not yet resulted in higher inflation. The external and fiscal positions are strong, with a 2014
current account surplus of 4.4 percent of GDP, gross international reserves of $79.5 billion (or
406.5 percent of short-term debt by residual maturity), a national government fiscal deficit of
0.6 percent of GDP, and general government debt at 36.4 percent of GDP.
The outlook for the Philippine economy remains favorable despite uneven and generally weaker
global growth prospects. Real GDP is projected to grow by 6.2 percent in 2015, as lower
commodity prices lift household consumption and improved budget execution raises public
spending. Lower fuel prices, partly offset by somewhat higher food prices due to assumed
moderate El Niño conditions, should help keep inflation in the bottom half of the BSP’s target
band. The current account surplus is expected to rise in 2015 due to lower oil prices and
continued inflows from business process outsourcing and remittances. Fiscal policy is expected
to remain prudent. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. The Philippine authorities are

particularly given the strong fundamentals and ample policy space.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the Philippine authorities for their prudent macroeconomic
management, which has delivered strong outcomes and has set the stage for favorable growth
prospects despite external headwinds. Looking ahead, Directors encouraged continued vigilance
in managing risks, and supported the authorities’ focus on infrastructure investment, structural
reforms, and on improving living conditions and achieving more inclusive growth.
Directors welcomed the government’s plan to step up infrastructure investment and social
spending, and return to the medium term fiscal deficit target of 2 percent of GDP. They noted
that the planned increase in public expenditure in 2015 is appropriate from both cyclical and
development perspectives, given the current low inflation, large infrastructure and social needs,
and low and declining public debt. Directors also encouraged further efforts to strengthen public
financial management and budget execution, and to mobilize revenue to meet the large social
and infrastructure needs.
Directors considered the current monetary policy stance as appropriate in view of the low
inflation, moderating and more balanced credit growth, and moderating—albeit still robust—
economic activity. They encouraged continued vigilance, in particular if inflation or credit
growth were to accelerate with signs of potential overheating. Directors supported the central
bank’s plan to implement an interest rate corridor to improve monetary policy transmission, and
encouraged the passage of the central bank charter that would authorize the issuance of central
bank bills and increase minimum capital. Directors also emphasized continued exchange rate
flexibility, with participation limited to smoothing excessive volatility.
Directors noted that the financial system remains sound. They welcomed the use of targeted
prudential policies to limit financial excesses and strengthen resilience, and noted that more
stringent prudential regulations may be needed should any systemic risks become apparent.
Directors encouraged the passage of the draft law that broadens the central bank’s financial
stability mandate, and welcomed the central bank’s efforts to enhance access to information on
conglomerates’ finances.
Directors supported the authorities’ medium term priorities that would allow the country to reap
the dividends from its young and growing population. These priorities should include raising
infrastructure spending, facilitating public private partnerships, improving the business climate,
and enhancing human capital and social services for the poor. Directors also welcomed the focus

on financial deepening and inclusion as essential elements of the authorities’ inclusive growth
strategy. They noted that alternative means of financing and hedging, such as bond and equity
markets, could help finance large infrastructure needs. Directors welcomed the recent release of
the national strategy for financial inclusion.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 24, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context: The Philippine economy is expected to grow in line with potential, at around
6½ percent per annum. Inflation is projected to remain within the BSP’s target band
(3±1 percent). The external position is strong and fiscal policy is prudent, with a declining
public debt ratio. Its small, bank-centric financial system has strong buffers, and risks
associated with bank-corporate-real estate linkages are currently contained.
Poor infrastructure has constrained private investment and job creation. Public investment
continues to be low due to weak implementation capacity despite an increase in the
investment budget and progress on fiscal transparency. Investment in human capital has
been raised but needs to be stepped up. Financial development and inclusion, as well as
structural reforms to foster competition and diversification, are essential for inclusive
growth.
Risks: Tilted to the downside; tighter global financial conditions and a surge in financial
volatility leading to sharp capital outflows; continuing weak budget execution; and severe
El Niño conditions.
Macrofinancial linkages: This consultation aimed at enhancing macrofinancial
surveillance, with a focus on balancing the need for financial deepening and inclusion
against the need to safeguard financial stability, through the following:


Analysis of global spillovers onto real and financial variables, corporate sector
vulnerabilities, and corporate-real estate linkages.



Analysis of real and financial cycles and their interrelations.



Integration of the depository corporations survey into the macro framework.



Modeling the impact of alternative public investment funding on interest rates and the
economy.



A framework for financial development and inclusion.

Policy recommendations:


Fiscal policy should focus on improving social services and infrastructure quality.
Additional revenue is needed to scale up public investment and social spending while
ensuring debt sustainability.



Monetary policy should continue to focus on price stability and avoiding excessive
credit growth.



Macroprudential policy should continue to guard against systemic risks to financial
stability, including in specific sectors.



Structural reforms and financial deepening will be critical to benefit from the
demographic dividend and to make growth more inclusive.

CONTEXT
1.
Addressing the large infrastructure gap is needed to raise potential growth and reduce
poverty and external imbalances, supported by financial deepening while safeguarding
financial stability. This necessitates revenue mobilization and capital market development. The
latter is important to provide an alternative source of financing for Public Private Partnership (PPP)
projects, and private investments including small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Monetary
and macroprudential policies should aim at
avoiding excessive credit growth and balance
sheet mismatches. All this comes at a time of
heightened global financial uncertainty that
could spill over to emerging market economies
(EMEs) like the Philippines.
2.
The remarkable improvement in the
Philippine economy since 2010 reflects
prudent macroeconomic policies, as well as
the favorable global financial cycle. Achieving
the authorities’ growth target of 7‒8 percent per
annum will require tackling long-standing
barriers to investment and broad-based growth.

3.
The current administration, whose term ends in June 2016, should continue to
institutionalize governance reforms and fiscal transparency and initiate economic reforms
that the next government can take forward to lift the country’s growth potential. In particular,
economic policy should focus on scaling up infrastructure and human capital investment and
spending for social needs to reduce poverty. This would help ensure that the Philippines’ young and
growing population has adequate job opportunities at home, reducing labor migration, especially of
skilled labor.

4.
At the conclusion of the 2014 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors commended
the authorities’ prudent policies that had delivered strong macroeconomic outcomes and set
the stage for favorable growth prospects. However, they noted potential risks from tighter global
financial conditions, and therefore stressed the importance of continued prudent macroeconomic
policies while stepping up reforms to sustain strong growth and reduce poverty.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
A. Recent Developments
5.
Real GDP grew by 6.1 percent in 2014 but
slowed to 5.2 percent in the first quarter of 2015.
The main growth drivers in 2014 were household
consumption, private construction, and exports of
goods and services. The first quarter 2015 slowdown
was due mainly to temporary factors, including the
effects of dry weather on agricultural production,
weak global demand, and slow budget execution.
6.
Inflation fell below the bottom of the
BSP’s target band (3±1 percent) in May 2015, led
by lower fuel and food prices. After reaching
4.9 percent (y/y) in August 2014, inflation fell to
1.2 percent in June 2015. As the economy is growing
broadly at potential, there is no evidence of price or
wage pressures, and considerable slack in the labor
market remains. The current dry weather associated
with El Niño has not yet resulted in higher inflation.
7.
The fiscal deficit was smaller than the
2 percent of GDP target in 2014 due to slow
budget execution. Revenue increased as a share of
GDP due to improvements in tax administration.
Expenditures, especially capital spending, fell short
of the budget largely due to weak implementation
capacity and slow adjustment to reforms in some
line ministries, and delayed post-typhoon
reconstruction. A Supreme Court ruling that made
aspects of the administration’s Disbursement
Acceleration Program unconstitutional further

PHILIPPINES

slowed budget execution in 2014. Budget execution remained slow in the first quarter of 2015,
particularly for capital spending. However, momentum is building on the implementation of PPP
projects.
8.
Credit growth was strong in 2014 but
slowed and became more balanced in the first
five months of this year. While broad based, the
slowdown was sharper for those sectors that saw
faster credit growth in the recent past, including
construction and real estate. Banks remain well
capitalized, with low levels of nonperforming loans
and abundant liquidity.
9.
The current account surplus rose in 2014
against the backdrop of lower oil prices, subdued
import volumes, and robust export growth. Gross
foreign reserves were US$81 billion in June 2015.
While the peso has remained stable vis-à-vis the
U.S. dollar since early 2014, it has appreciated
significantly in effective terms along with the
U.S. dollar.

B. Outlook and Risks
10.
Economic growth is expected to pick up
slightly in 2015, with credit growth and inflation
remaining moderate and the current account surplus rising. Real GDP is projected to grow by
6.2 percent in 2015 as lower commodity prices lift household consumption and improved budget
execution raises public spending. Consistent with projected investment growth, credit is expected to
grow at about 15 percent (or about 2 percentage points of GDP) in 2015, in line with what appears
to be a sustainable pace of financial deepening, although this warrants close monitoring on an
ongoing basis. Lower oil prices, partly offset by somewhat higher food prices deriving from El Niño
conditions, should keep inflation near the bottom of the BSP’s target band. The current account
surplus is expected to widen to 5.0 percent of GDP in 2015 due to lower oil prices and continued
inflows from Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and remittances.
11.
Over the medium term, economic growth is projected at 6.5 percent, in line with
potential growth (Box 1). Public and private investments are projected to lead the growth, as
increased public infrastructure spending and implementation of PPP projects should crowd in
private investment. Inflation is expected to increase as oil prices rise but is projected to remain
within the BSP’s target range. The pickup of public and private investments, together with a trend
real effective appreciation of the peso, is expected to narrow the current account surplus and relieve

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES

pressure on domestic capacity constraints going forward, with higher U.S. interest rates tending to
tighten lending conditions consistent with moderate credit growth going forward.
12.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside (Appendix 1). An upside risk is a stronger
lift to demand from lower oil prices. On the downside, tighter global financial conditions and a surge
in financial volatility, amplified by low market liquidity, could lead to sharp capital outflows and
tightening of domestic financing conditions, with significant macrofinancial spillovers on the
economy, but the Philippines’ strong macroeconomic fundamentals should provide a cushion
(Box 2). Continued weak budget execution could slow down needed improvements in public
infrastructure, while the risk of a larger than budgeted deficit due to election spending is limited
given the government’s strong commitment. Finally, there is a downside risk associated with severe
El Niño conditions, leading to a poor harvest regionally and a rapid run-up in food prices. This could
induce inflation to rise sharply and breach the target band, affecting the poor quite severely. The
Philippine authorities are well equipped to respond as needed with suitable policies should any of
these risk scenarios materialize, particularly given the strong fundamentals, ample policy space, and
strong foreign reserve position.

C. External Sector Assessment
13.
The Philippines’ external position strengthened significantly since 2010. The current
account has moved to a structural surplus and gross international reserves increased to
US$80 billion (28 percent of GDP) or 217 percent of the IMF’s metric of reserve adequacy at
end­2014, well in excess of the 100‒150 percent suggested range. The external sector is moderately
stronger than warranted by fundamentals and desired policies, consistent with moderate currency
undervaluation, reflecting mainly the low level of investment.


Current account: The IMF External Balance Assessment (EBA) model places the predicted current
account at 7.8 percent of GDP below the actual current account in 2014, although Philippines
specific factors such as natural disaster risk and remittances could explain up to 4 percentage
points of GDP of the residual (see Appendix 2). The recent appreciation of the peso could help
narrow the current account gap over time, but
lower oil prices are likely to more than offset
this effect in 2015.



Addressing imbalances: The Philippines’ current
account gap is attributable to its low level of
investment compared with other EMEs. Raising
the investment rate and thus boosting potential
growth, by improving the business environment
and infrastructure, would help reduce external
imbalances. The current account gap would also
decrease as budget execution improves.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

PHILIPPINES



International reserves. Reserve accumulation since 2010 has reflected current and financial
account surpluses. The BSP accumulated sizable reserves in 2010–12 when ultra accommodative
monetary policies in the advanced economies (AEs) stimulated large capital flows into the
Philippines and other EMEs. Since the taper tantrum in mid­2013, there have been large capital
outflows triggered in part by a tightening of eligibility for the Special Deposit Account (SDA)
facility, which led to an exodus of foreign funds; however, foreign reserves have remained
broadly stable supported by current account surpluses. Staff continues to recommend that the
exchange rate be allowed to move freely in line with market forces with intervention limited to
smoothing excessive volatility in both directions.

Authorities’ Views
14.
The authorities emphasized the structural causes of the current account surplus and
unique role of worker remittances, which are not well captured in the EBA model. They
observed that the peso has been broadly unchanged vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar since early­2014 while
the gross international reserves have been broadly stable. The problem of low investment is likely to
be addressed going forward given the large pipeline of infrastructure projects. The exchange rate
continues to be market determined, with foreign exchange intervention limited to smoothing
excessive volatility.

POLICIES FOR MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL
STABILITY
A. Fiscal Policy
15.
Fiscal policy should focus on supporting infrastructure investment and inclusive
growth. Returning to the authorities’ medium-term deficit target of 2 percent of GDP by increasing
public infrastructure spending and implementing much-needed post-typhoon reconstruction and
social spending in the 2015 budget is appropriate given the needs in these priority areas and on the
back of expenditure under-execution in 2014. It is also consistent with debt sustainability as the
2 percent of GDP deficit target would steadily reduce the general government debt-to-GDP ratio
over the medium term to below 30 percent (from 36.4 percent of GDP in 2014). Staff’s fiscal
projections are in line with this, but less ambitious than the authorities’ in 2015 in light of limitations
in current execution capacity. Going forward, the authorities plan to increase infrastructure spending
from 3 percent of GDP in 2014 to 5 percent by 2016, including by facilitating PPP projects. Staff
projects public capital expenditure at 3.8 percent of GDP in 2016, while PPP projects could amount
to 1 percent of GDP, bringing overall infrastructure investment to 4.8 percent of GDP in that year. An
increase in public investment, combined with improvement in efficiency, would contribute to higher
economic growth in the medium term (Box 3).
16.
Public expenditure management needs to be strengthened further. Sustained efforts to
improve the investment selection and implementation processes will be required. Moreover, a better

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES

system for projecting and tracking spending is needed to strengthen budgeting and cash
management. Staff urges the passage of the Public Financial Management (PFM) bill to further
strengthen the overall PFM governance framework and supports the authorities’ continuing effort to
improve PFM, as acknowledged in the Fund’s Fiscal Transparency Evaluation (FTE). Regarding the
PPPs, amendments to the Build Operate Transfer (BOT) law and Right of Way Bill will institutionalize
the progress that has been made so far and further strengthen the legal framework, which will in
turn help ensure robust implementation of projects.
17.
There is limited scope to cut other expenditure to support budgetary spending on
infrastructure and social needs. At less than 20 percent of GDP for the general government, total
expenditure is lower than the average for the ASEAN­5 and much lower than the emerging and
developing countries average. Moreover, the Philippines does not have energy subsidies, the public
wage bill is small, and key public services like tax collections and customs enforcement are facing
large manpower shortages.
18.
The authorities’ initiative to strengthen revenue collections is welcome. Additional
revenue will be needed to support higher spending on infrastructure and social needs. Congress has
already passed the Tax Incentives Management and Transparency Act (TIMTA), which would provide
for regular reviews of tax incentives and make them more transparent. Staff supports ongoing tax
administration reform that has improved arrears collection, VAT compliance including through
targeted audits, and filing rates for large taxpayers. These gains should more than offset the
negative effects from the lower oil prices and slightly increase the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio in 2015.
19.
Staff strongly encourages a tax reform package that is net revenue enhancing. This
would entail, for instance, rationalization of tax incentives, reducing certain VAT exemptions, and
increases in fuel excises, that more than compensate for any revenue-losing measures in the
corporate and personal income tax reform.1 The authorities are crafting a tax reform package that
appears to be net revenue enhancing and have requested Fund TA on some aspects. Even in the
current pre­election context, staff strongly urges the authorities to avoid any tax package that would
entail a net revenue loss. In this regard, it is encouraging that Congressional leaders have vowed not
to reduce taxes before compensatory measures are enacted. Staff also supports the Department of
Finance’s efforts to amend the bank secrecy law to allow the tax authorities' access to individual
bank deposit information and make tax evasion a predicate crime for money laundering in order to
improve the efficiency and equity of revenue collection. Staff simulations indicate that a tax-financed
public investment increase would result in a more favorable public debt trajectory, which would
translate into superior output growth over the medium term (Box 3).
Authorities’ Views
20.
The authorities acknowledged the sizeable challenges involved in getting the spending
agencies to accelerate infrastructure project implementation. Their own investigation shows that
1

staff report.

capacity constraints had played a major role in implementation delays in 2014. The authorities are
addressing the procurement issues by requiring strengthening of procurement units at spending
agencies and revising operational regulations. A Presidential order has been issued to create a
Delivery Unit in major departments to monitor closely, trouble shoot, and report on implementation
delays. The authorities noted their commitment to improving infrastructure, including by increasing
the share of infrastructure in the budget and the implementation of several PPP projects. Revenue
targets are challenging but they provide incentives for increased collections and administrative
reforms as shown by the steady increase in revenue under the current administration. There is a
need for comprehensive tax reform to widen the tax base. Allowing tax collectors access to bank
deposits and making tax evasion a predicate crime are needed to improve compliance. The
authorities value IMF TA highly and hope to benefit from additional TA going forward.

B. Monetary Policy
21.
Current monetary settings are
appropriate judging from: inflation projections
within the target band; estimates of the output
gap near zero even with financial variables
added (Box 1); and credit growth within normal
metrics. Credit growth was strong in 2014,
including in the construction and real estate
sectors, spurring concerns about rising
macrofinancial imbalances. The BSP’s tightening
measures last year (the banks’ required reserve
ratio was increased by 200 basis points,
to 20 percent, and policy rates were increased by
50 basis points), and autonomous tightening since then due to rising real interest rates and an
appreciating REER, has succeeded in moderating credit growth, making it more balanced, and
bringing inflation down, by the first half of 2015. One-off effects of lower oil prices are expected to
dissipate by late 2015, following which inflation is still expected to remain comfortably within the
target band. Moreover, significant slack remains in the labor market.
22.
Nevertheless, the BSP should remain vigilant and be ready to tighten policy if signs of
rising inflation pressure and accelerating broad-based credit growth were to emerge going
forward. However, rapid food price increases due to El Niño related drought should be addressed
by allowing food imports in a timely manner and would not justify monetary tightening unless
second round effects were to appear.
23.
Monetary transmission has improved as the structural liquidity overhang has been
reduced but more work is needed given that the pass-through from policy rates to retail rates
remains weak. A liquidity overhang persists, although this has declined significantly from last year,
reflecting the BSP’s preemptive tightening in 2014 and capital outflows. Staff supports the BSP’s
efforts to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission through the implementation of

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES

an interest rate corridor, following up on Fund TA, and supported by implementing deposit auctions
and reforming the reverse repo auction mechanism, and passage of the BSP charter that authorizes
the issuance of central bank bills and a minimum capital level. With the greater use of open market
operations to manage liquidity, the required reserve ratio can be lowered over the medium term to
reduce intermediation cost and improve efficiency.
Authorities’ Views
24.
The BSP views the current monetary policy stance as appropriate. The authorities see no
need to adjust monetary policy at the moment as inflation is in the lower end of the target band,
credit growth is moderating, and economic growth is still robust, but agree that they will remain
vigilant.
25.
The BSP shared the staff’s assessment that El Niño effects could pose a major risk to
food prices in 2015. The National Food Authority council has authorized an additional
500 thousand metric tons of rice imports in 2015, which should mitigate the effects of El Niño
conditions on rice prices and inflation.

C. Financial Cycles, Systemic Risks, and Macroprudential Policies
26.
Given the Philippines’ bank-centric financial system and high concentration of
conglomerates, macrofinancial linkages have largely taken the form of corporate leverage
cycles financed by banks. In the boom phase of the global financial cycle, this led to leveraged
investment in the construction and real estate sectors, with rising capital market issuances, although
banks were constrained by their 25 percent single borrower limits in some cases. As the BSP
tightened monetary policy and used its macroprudential tools to target risky activities, credit has
moderated and the sectoral composition has become more balanced. Wholesale bank funding from
abroad is minimal and subject to strict limits. At 7 percent of GDP, household debt does not appear
to pose systemic risks.
27.
Credit growth since 2010 has been rapid but has been below typical metrics of credit
booms. In 2014, credit growth came close to exceeding some of these metrics but prompt BSP
action brought it back down (Box 1). Going forward, credit is expected to increase by about
2 percentage points of GDP per year, a rate of financial deepening that appears to be sustainable
based on cross-country studies. However, its sustainability will need to be assessed carefully on an
ongoing basis in view of concentration and other risks identified below. Credit growth to real estate
and construction has moderated. As noted above, projected credit growth is consistent with
investment and economic growth.
28.
Nonfinancial corporates appear broadly resilient to shocks but a definitive assessment
requires finer data. Staff encourages the authorities to work further on filling these data gaps,
particularly concerning intra-group linkages. Nonfinancial corporate debt is low but rising and
leverage is unevenly distributed, making some firms vulnerable to a rise in interest rates (Box 2).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

PHILIPPINES

Foreign exchange exposure appears low given moderate foreign exchange debt and existing natural
hedges.
29.
Bank and nonfinancial corporate exposure to real estate has risen but risks are still
moderate. Nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) remain small but are growing rapidly. Existing data
on the exposure of NBFIs to real estate are scarce but a plan has been developed to fill data gaps
with IMF TA.2 An official residential price index is currently under construction by the BSP and
Philippines Statistical Agency, while the few commercially available measures show modest price
growth in most segments.
30.
Macroprudential policies should continue to play an important role by limiting any
buildup of systemic vulnerabilities, including due to excessive credit growth in specific
sectors.3 In light of the acceleration in credit growth in 2014 and risks of domestic asset price
booms, the BSP conducted stress tests on banks’ real estate loan exposures and required corrective
actions, enhanced monitoring of banks’ exposures to all types of real estate, and provided guidance
on real estate mortgage loans, setting their maximum loan value at 60 percent of the appraised
value. These measures have helped to restrain credit growth to the real estate sector. Single
borrower limits (set at 25 percent of core capital) should be strictly enforced with the additional
25 percent allowance for exposures to PPPs allowed to lapse. Staff encourages ongoing efforts to
strengthen the financial stability supervisory framework, including by capacity building and
enhanced coordination among the stakeholders of the Financial Stability Coordinating Council. In
particular, staff supports the draft bill broadening the BSP’s financial stability mandate and providing
it with greater access to nonbank financial information that is currently being discussed in Congress.
The SEC has taken steps to enhance its corporate data collection efforts and promote capital market
development, and staff encourages further efforts in this direction.
Authorities’ Views
31.
The BSP views credit expansion by banks, in concert with other forms of financial
deepening and inclusion, as needed to support growth over the medium term. They welcomed
the recent shift in credit growth away from real estate into productive areas like manufacturing. The
Philippines cannot rely solely on banking to finance its ambitious infrastructure investment. Financial
market development is needed to help finance large forthcoming PPP projects. The BSP had already
liberalized entry for foreign banks and five foreign banks have been approved for entry, which is a
major step because it increases competition, reduces concentration risks, and eases the constraints
that single borrower limits impose on aggregate financing of infrastructure investment.

2
Banks account for nearly 80 percent of financial system assets. The BSP also supervises NBFIs accounting for a
further 4 percent of the system. The insurance industry, which accounts for 7 percent of assets, is supervised by the
Insurance Commission, while the remainder largely fall under the supervisory purview of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). Important supervisory gaps in the financial system relate to: (i) real estate financing provided by
developers and conglomerates; (ii) bank secrecy laws; (iii) legal restrictions on interagency information sharing; and
(iv) mapping conglomerate exposures.

INVESTMENT, FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND
INCLUSIVE GROWTH
A. Investment and Social Needs
32.
Boosting the level of investment is a
major structural challenge. Public and private
investment rates in the Philippines are well below
regional peers, as reflected in its low capital stock
and infrastructure quality. The main impediments
to private investment are inadequate
infrastructure, a weak investment climate, and
restrictions on foreign direct investment.
Immediate priorities include implementation of
the transport system in Manila (Manila Dream Plan
approved by NEDA) and improvements in airports,
road connectivity, and seaports across the country.
33.
Another key structural challenge is to make growth more inclusive. Although poverty
has fallen, it remains high (see selected issues paper, Chapter 6). Given that rice is an important item
in household consumption, staff urges the authorities to proceed with the reform of the National
Food Authority and ease quantitative rice import restrictions to lower rice prices. Faster employment
creation would also help alleviate poverty, including by developing the agribusiness, tourism and
mining sectors, which can be labor intensive and have a comparative advantage. Addressing the
uncertainty and non-transferability of property rights on agricultural land would support its use as
collateral for bank loans and improve access to financing. The recent amendments to the cabotage
law (that reduces the high cost of inter-island shipping) and enactment of a competition law would
help spur a level playing field but the costs of doing business would need to be reduced particularly
for micro- and small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Expanded education and training
programs, such as those conducted by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority,
would address skills mismatches. Job opportunities would be created through the further expansion
of BPOs by moving to higher value added segments, and promotion of light manufacturing for
under-skilled workers.
Authorities’ Views
34.
The government has augmented a number of growth-inclusive budgetary
expenditures. This includes expansion of the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program to high
school students, indigenous peoples, homeless itinerants, and families; strengthening of
kindergarten and high school education as part of the K to 12 program; and expanding the health
insurance program to cover the poor and the informal sectors, hiring and assignment of doctors and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

PHILIPPINES

nurses to rural areas, and the construction and equipping of rural and barangay health stations.
Many of these initiatives have been financed by revenue from “sin taxes.”
35.
The government agreed that the phasing out of quota restrictions on rice importation
with adequate support for farmers is important for poverty reduction. The worsening of
poverty indicators in 2014, despite income growth among the low income segments, was
attributable to the sharp rice price increase caused by the delay in rice imports and distribution. By
allowing the market to determine the level of rice importation, rice prices are expected to become
less susceptible to supply shocks, and in turn, more favorable to the poor.

B. Financial Development and Inclusion
36.
There is a tension between the important goals of financial deepening and inclusion
and financial stability. Financial development in the Philippines is progressing broadly in line with
its income level but considerable growth potential remains. Recent efforts to advance financial
development as a means of promoting faster and more inclusive growth should be encouraged and
focused on expanding the role of the capital markets, with particular emphasis on long-term
financing for infrastructure investment (PPPs), and expanding the existing set of financial inclusion
initiatives. World Bank and other metrics underscore the need for financial deepening and inclusion
(see selected issues paper, Chapter 5).
37.
The capital markets could facilitate better risk sharing and open up new sources of
long-term financing for both SMEs and infrastructure development projects (see selected
issues paper, Chapter 5). The latter function is especially relevant given the low investment rate in
the Philippines and the banking sector’s preference for financing working capital and short-term
loans. More generally, the development of a broader set of long-term financial securities (project
bonds, asset backed securities, etc.) would better allow issuers to align funding needs with the
duration, income, and diversification needs of investors like pension funds and insurers.
38.
A more stable macroeconomic environment has supported capital market
development in recent years but more can be done. Key policy priorities include developing an
organized market for repo and risk management instruments, a smoother liquidity profile across the
government yield curve, establishing guidelines for structured credit issuance, and revitalizing the
‘second board’ for SME equity listings by lowering listing and transaction costs. The enabling
environment could be made even more conducive to capital market development if taxation policy
incentivizes greater activity from both issuers and investors.4 Full engagement by regulators and
industry participants in the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum would also be welcome as a means of
better integrating and deepening the Philippines’ securities markets over time.
39.
A new national financial inclusion strategy, focused on access, education and
consumer protection, was recently released. There is a strong need to increase the provision of
4
Some measures that could be helpful in this regard include concessionary tax treatment for long-term savings
vehicles, streamlining the withholding tax registration process, and reducing taxes on initial public offerings.

PHILIPPINES

banking and payment services, particularly outside the heavily urbanized regions. Formal microlending initiatives should also be encouraged. The notable increase in micro-insurance penetration
in recent years should continue given that coverage in the Philippines remains low.
Authorities’ Views
40.
Capital market development and financial inclusion are essential to promote financing
for PPPs and wider access to finance. The BSP agreed that capital market development is needed
given the inherent difficulty that banks have in providing long-term financing for PPPs while
mitigating concentration risk. Integration with ASEAN capital markets should be pursued. The new
national financial inclusion strategy provides a framework for bringing much-needed financial
services to all. Policy frameworks in the areas of micro health insurance and agriculture micro
insurance are under consultation, while the blueprint for a movable collateral registry covering an
expanded list of financial assets is being finalized.

STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
The Philippine economy has continued to perform strongly. Sound macroeconomic
policies and prudent financial sector supervision, combined with strong macroeconomic
fundamentals, have delivered solid economic growth, low inflation, and financial stability.
42.
The macroeconomic outlook is expected to remain favorable. Despite the temporary
slowdown in the first quarter of this year, the economy is expected to grow at a robust 6.2 percent
in 2015, with credit growing at a moderate pace, and inflation in the lower half of the target range.
43.
This favorable outlook faces several downside risks. Tighter global financial conditions
and a surge in financial volatility could lead to sharp capital outflows, continued weak budget
execution could slow down much needed improvements in infrastructure, and more severe El Niño
conditions could lead to higher inflation and affect the poor severely.
44.
Staff supports the government’s plan to raise infrastructure investment and return to
its medium-term fiscal deficit target of 2 percent of GDP. The increase in public spending in
the 2015 budget is appropriate from a cyclical and development perspective, given the low inflation
environment, large infrastructure and social needs, low and declining public debt, low long-term
interest rates, and post-typhoon reconstruction needs.
45.
Public expenditure management should be strengthened further. Staff urges the
passage of the PFM bill, more efficient expenditure tracking and cash management, and
amendments to the BOT law and Right of Way bill to strengthen the implementation of PPPs.
46.
Additional revenue is needed to finance large infrastructure and social needs. The
authorities are urged to ensure net revenue enhancement in their tax reform package by
rationalizing tax incentives, streamlining VAT exemptions, and raising fuel excises, to offset the
losses from the proposed reductions in corporate and personal income taxes. To strengthen tax

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

PHILIPPINES

collection, the tax authorities should be given access to individual bank deposit information and tax
evasion should be made a predicate crime.
47.
Monetary policy is currently appropriate. Nonetheless, the BSP should remain vigilant and
be ready to tighten if inflation or credit growth were to accelerate and there are signs of
overheating. The BSP is encouraged to implement the interest rate corridor to improve monetary
policy transmission, to be supported by the passage of the BSP charter that authorizes the issuance
of central bank bills and a minimum capital level. With official reserves more than adequate, the
exchange rate should continue to be allowed to move freely in line with market forces, while
smoothing excessive volatility in both directions.
48.
Macroprudential policies should be used to guard against systemic risks to financial
stability, including in specific sectors. Staff supports the authorities’ use of targeted prudential
policies to tame financial excesses and strengthen resilience. More stringent prudential regulations
may be needed if any systemic risks become apparent. Broadening the BSP’s financial stability
mandate remains a priority, and staff supports the draft law being discussed in Congress. Staff also
supports the authorities’ efforts to be allowed better access to information on conglomerates’
finances.
49.
The authorities are encouraged to focus on key medium-term priorities to allow the
country reap the dividends from its young and growing population. This will involve increasing
infrastructure spending, facilitating PPPs, and improving the investment climate. Staff supports the
government’s plans to improve human capital and social services for the poor.
50.
Financial deepening and inclusion are also essential elements of the authorities’
inclusive growth strategy. While expanded bank lending in productive sectors will facilitate
growth, the composition of credit growth should be closely monitored on an ongoing basis to avoid
risks from credit booms. Staff believes that further development of alternative forms of financing
and hedging, such as corporate bond and equity markets, is needed to support infrastructure
investment, and welcomes the recent release of the national strategy for financial inclusion.
51.
The Philippines’ strong growth performance in recent years is attributable to prudent
macroeconomic policies, strong capital inflows from the expansion phase in the global
financial cycle, and the boom in the BPO industry, but it has the potential to perform even
more strongly. Poverty incidence needs to fall more, infrastructure quality and financial market
access for poor households and SMEs need to improve, and the financial sector needs further
development. With the strengthened governance structure, the government is advised to push
economic reforms firmly to reach its growth targets in the context of a turn in the global financial
cycle while maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability.

Box 1. Philippines: Real and Financial Cycles
The output gap is near zero in 2015 even if measures are augmented by financial variables. Following the tightening of monetary
policy in 2014, the credit gap is also near zero in 2015, with credit growth below typical metrics of credit booms.
Staff estimates of the real cycle indicate that the output gap is near zero in 2015. The Hodrick-Prescott filter, a multivariate
filter, and a production function were used to estimate the Philippine output gap (see the selected issues paper, Chapter 2).
Actual data up to 2014 and staff projections for 2015‒20 were used. All approaches yield remarkably similar results, with
potential output growth accelerating to 6.5 percent in 2015‒16, and the output gap closing in 2015.

Alternative estimates of the financial cycle suggest that, after the tightening of monetary policy in 2014, the credit gap
is zero or slightly positive in 2015. The approach of Mendoza and Terrones (2008), which looks at cycles in real credit per
capita compared to its trend, suggests a slightly positive credit gap in 2015‒16, but below the credit boom threshold. Dell’Aricia
and others (2012) look at deviations of credit-to-GDP from a backward looking trend. A credit boom is identified when the
deviation from trend is larger than a threshold and growth of credit-to-GDP is larger than 10 percent, or when the latter is larger
than 20 percent. This approach shows that the deviation of credit-to-GDP from trend was zero in 2014, below the threshold for
credit booms, but growth of credit-to-GDP was close to 10 percent.

Financial variables contain useful information concerning the
business cycle position. Expansions that coincide with rapid
credit and asset price growth are stronger, while recessions
coinciding with credit and asset price busts are longer and deeper.
We used the BIS approach to integrate financial variables (real
credit and stock prices), into a broader measure of the output gap.
Results indicate that the output gap in the Philippines in 2015‒16
is slightly larger when financial variables are included, consistent
with a slightly positive credit gap. However, even in this case the
output gap is very small.

Box 2. Global Financial Cycle and Nonfinancial Corporate Sector Vulnerabilities
Higher U.S. interest rates would likely tighten financial conditions in the Philippines significantly, particularly
if accompanied by higher volatility. Despite recent borrowing, nonfinancial corporates appear resilient.
Staff analysis suggests that the surge in capital inflows between 2010 and mid­2013 can largely be
explained by global financial factors such as the VIX and U.S. short-term interest rates, with exchange
rate expectations and domestic fundamentals playing a supporting role. Moreover, local bond yields and
retail bank rates seem to be driven largely by the same global factors and U.S. term premia.
Higher U.S. bond yields coupled with bouts of global volatility could tighten domestic financial
conditions and lower Philippine growth. A BVAR model shows that the VIX affects domestic demand via
capital flows and asset re-pricing, whereas U.S. 10-year T-bond yields affect bank credit and investment
(see selected issues paper, Chapter 1).

Box 2. Global Financial Cycle and Nonfinancial Corporate Sector Vulnerabilities (Concluded)
Given expected tighter financial conditions and resulting balance sheet effects, staff found
moderate but concentrated leverage (see selected issues paper, Chapter 2). Nonfinancial corporate debt
grew substantially since 2007 yet total debt is still low compared to peers. Turning away from aggregated
data, which potentially masks pockets of vulnerability, and using firm-level data reveals that leverage and
debt-at-risk vary significantly across sectors and that small firms, although more leveraged, do not pose
systemic risks given their small debt share.

The Philippine nonfinancial sector seems resilient to
large shocks compared to other EMEs. Firms are
more sensitive to interest rate shocks compared to FX
shocks, due to low FX debt and natural hedges. Some
real estate developers may be more vulnerable, in
particular those involved in the rising unregulated
shadow banking activity. Thus, firm-level developments
should be closely monitored.

Box 3. Philippines: Improving Public Infrastructure
Improving public infrastructure would result in a sustained output increase and external rebalancing. Tax
financed infrastructure yields better results in the long run. The effect is augmented when combined with
increased efficiency.
While a need to increase public investment spending is clear, its efficiency should also be
enhanced. Reflecting the persistently low level of public investment, public capital in the Philippines
remains among the lowest in ASEAN, at about 35 percent of GDP (Figure 1). Thus there is a clear need to
increase public investment. Better planning, better budget allocation, and more efficient implementation
should improve public investment efficiency, as it would translate the same level of public investment
into higher access to quality public infrastructure services (see selected issues paper, Chapter 4).
Figure 1. ASEAN: Public Investment and Public Capital Stock

Model simulations suggest that improving public infrastructure would result in a sustained output
increase (Figure 2). Two scenarios are considered using the IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal
Model (GIMF): (i) a permanent increase in public investment from 3 percent to 5 percent of GDP in all
subsequent years, financed by borrowing; (ii) the same increase in public investment, financed by an
increase in consumption taxes. Then, each is divided into sub scenarios, with and without a gradual
improvement in public investment efficiency.1/ All scenarios exhibit sustained output increases because
the public infrastructure improvement amounts to a permanent improvement in the general productivity
of the economy, which crowds in private investment.
Each scenario affects the economy differently. The debt-financed scenario results in a substantial
increase in the public debt-to-GDP ratio, increasing the borrowing cost and constraining investment. In
contrast, consumption is initially subdued in the tax-financed scenario because of the lower disposal
income. Both scenarios benefit from increased efficiency.

Index (PIMI) developed in Dabla-Norris and others (2012).

Box 3. Philippines: Improving Public Infrastructure (Concluded)
Public infrastructure improvement influences the current account and inflation as well. It worsens
the current account, helping with external rebalancing. It also generates additional domestic demand
initially and thus creates inflationary pressures. Over time, the increase in supply capacity alleviates the
inflationary pressures.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative
likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the
time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk
could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Appendix 2. Philippines—External Sector Assessment
Current Account
1.
The Philippines’ current account balance (CAB) has recorded significant surpluses in the last
decade, with strong remittances and service exports more than offsetting persistent trade deficits
(Figure 2.1). After being in deficit during most of the 1990s, the CAB turned into surplus since 2003,
peaking at 5.7 percent of GDP in 2006. Initially this reflected growing remittances, but later it also
reflected lower trade deficits and higher net service exports due to business process outsourcing.
The CAB increased to over 4 percent of GDP in 2013‒14 mainly due to smaller trade deficits.
Figure 2.1. Philippines: Current Account Balance

2.
The strengthening of the CAB since the late‐1990s mainly corresponds to a sustained fall in
the investment-to-GDP ratio since the Asian financial crisis. Gross capital formation declined from
above 25 percent of GDP in the pre­Asian crisis period to below 20 percent of GDP since 2006.
National saving also rose, but only by about 1 percent of GDP. The recent increase in the CAB
in 2013‒14 has reflected a faster pickup in saving than in investment.
3.
Relative to GDP, the Philippine CAB was similar to that of other emerging market economies
(EMEs) in the 1990s, but larger than most peers in the 2000s (Figure 2.2). This change corresponds
to a shift in the Philippines’ investment-to-GDP ratio, which before the Asian financial crisis was
above the average ratios of Latin American or other EMEs, but has been below these comparators
since 2006. Relative to the average Asian EME, the Philippines has always had a lower investment
ratio, especially since 2003. At the same time, the Philippine national saving ratio has risen only
marginally over time, and has consistently been somewhat higher than the ratios in Latin America
and other regions, but lower than those for Asian EMEs.

Effective Exchange Rate
4.
After declining continuously since the Asian financial crisis, the Philippines’ real effective
exchange rate (REER) has been on an upward trend since 2004 (Figure 2.3). The post Asian crisis real
depreciation was mostly due to a fall in the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER). The early part of
the post 2004 real appreciation was also associated with nominal appreciation, but since 2007 it has
been due to the inflation differential between the Philippines and its trading partners, with the NEER
remaining stable. The post­1998 real depreciation was stronger in the Philippines than in Malaysia
and Thailand, but the post­2004 appreciation has also been stronger in the Philippines (46 percent
in the Philippines, against 26 and 9 percent, respectively in Thailand and Malaysia).

Reserve Accumulation, Reserve Adequacy and Net International Investment Position
5.
The Philippines has accumulated sizable international reserves since the Asian financial crisis,
and especially since the global financial crisis (Figure 2.4). The balance of payments surplus reflects
mainly current account surpluses, but the financial account also contributed to reserve accumulation
in 2010−12. As a result, the stock of foreign reserves has risen by 18 percent of GDP since 1997. The
fast pace of reserve accumulation in 2010‒12 slowed in 2013 and reversed in 2014 due to capital
outflows. At end 2014, reserves were 28 percent of GDP and 2.2 times the IMF’s reserve adequacy
metric (against the benchmark of 1 to 1½ times). Reserves were also 3½ times short-term external
debt on a residual maturity basis and 11 months of imports of goods and services. This suggests
that the Philippines holds more reserves than is warranted to meet normal contingencies.
Figure 2.4. Philippines: Balance of Payments and International Reserves

6.
The Philippines’ net international investment position (NIIP) has improved sharply mirroring
sustained current account surpluses. The NIIP rose from－49 percent of GDP in 2001 to －14 percent
in 2014. Three-fifths of this increase was due to the fall in other investment liabilities, with the other
two-fifths due to increased assets, mostly official reserves and foreign direct investment. Reserve
assets accounted for 54 percent of total assets (US$149 billion) in 2014, while portfolio investment
and other investment liabilities amounted to 43 percent and 26 percent of total liabilities
(US$189 billion).
External Balance Assessment (EBA)
7.
The IMF assesses the external sector of its member countries using the External Balance
Assessment (EBA) model. EBA comprises four approaches to assess the CAB and REER compared to
their norms based on the country’s fundamentals and desired policies (Table 2.1 and Figure 2.5).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

PHILIPPINES



The EBA’s Current Account Regression approach suggests that a current account deficit—rather
than a surplus—is appropriate for the Philippines. This reflects the economy’s low per capita
income, fast growing population, and strong growth prospects, despite sizable institutional risk.1
The gap between the actual and the fitted CAB turned positive since 2002, reaching a peak of
6.1 percent of GDP in 2014. The gap rises to 7.8 percent of GDP when deviations of domestic
and foreign policies from their desired levels are considered, with about half of the deviation
due domestic policies (mainly a too tight fiscal policy stance in the Philippines), and the other
half due to policy deviations abroad.



The External Sustainability approach suggests that the Philippines’ medium-term CAB is larger
than the CAB needed to stabilize the NFA-to-GDP ratio.



The EBA’s REER index approach suggests that the REER was slightly stronger than warranted by
fundamentals and desired policies in 2014.



The EBA’s REER level approach also suggests that the REER was stronger than warranted by
fundamentals and desired policies, with a larger degree of overvaluation than for the EBA’s REER
index approach.

Institutional/political risk increases the Philippines’ predicted CAB by about 2 percent of GDP.

Figure 2.5. External Balance Assessment (EBA): Actual and Fitted Current Account
and Real Effective Exchange Rate

8.
Technical factors suggest that the current account regression approach is preferable to the
other approaches. The EBA REER index approach is less reliable in countries with large structural
changes and short data spans. This method cannot use cross-country information as the REER
indexes are set equal to 100 for all countries in a given year regardless of their external position. By
using country fixed effects, this approach forces gaps for each country to average to zero over time,
which tends to understate the REER gaps. The EBA REER level approach tackles this issue by relying
on purchasing power parity prices to construct REER levels. However, this method depends on price
level data collected under the International Comparison Program (ICP), both for the construction of
the level of the REER and the relative prices of tradable to non-tradable goods. Despite recent
progress in ICP’s sampling and methodology, overall data quality is still a concern. The current
account regression approach, on the other hand, does not have price measurement issues and takes
full advantage of cross-country information. The External Sustainability approach does not assess
the appropriateness of the level of the NFA that is being stabilized. In the Philippine case, arguably a
more negative NFA position and a lower CAB would be consistent with the country’s stage of
development and population dynamics.

Extensions to EBA and Other Considerations
9.
The EBA current account regression approach does not take account of several specific
factors relevant for the Philippines’ CAB:


Risk of natural disasters: Natural disasters are a significant uninsurable risk for the Philippines.
This could lead to higher precautionary saving and lower investment (owing to reduced
risk­adjusted returns). While post-disaster reconstruction may boost investment spending, in
practice, such effects have been limited.



Worker remittances: The increase in the Philippines’ CAB coincided with a raise in remittances,
which have been relatively resilient to changes in the external environment. As a result,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

PHILIPPINES

Philippine gross national income (GNI) is about 15 percent above GDP.2 This increase in income
may have pushed up the equilibrium real exchange rate by raising prices of nontraded goods
and services, thereby weakening the trade balance. However, spending from remittances could
be lower than that from other types of income if remittance income is perceived as more
uncertain. If there is a high risk that contracts abroad may not be renewed, the saving rate out of
remittances may be higher than from other types of income, which would tend to raise the CAB.
Impediments to investment: The strengthening of the Philippines’ CAB since the late­1990s
also coincided with a marked fall in the investment-to-GDP ratio. Balance sheet repair in the
aftermath of the Asian financial crisis could have depressed investment on a persistent basis. A
weak business environment and inadequate infrastructure could also be restraining investment.



GNI versus GDP
10.
Using GNI instead of GDP in EBA leads to a smaller gap between the CAB and its norm for
the Philippines. While GNI is similar to GDP for most countries, GNI is nearly 15 percent larger than
GDP in the Philippines due to worker remittances. GNI is a better measure of income and the basis
for saving-investment decisions, implying that the CAB should be scaled by GNI instead of GDP.3
Moreover, some explanatory variables in EBA should also be scaled by GNI, including income per
capita, net foreign assets to GDP, public health spending to GDP, the cyclically adjusted fiscal
balance to GDP, the change in foreign reserves to GDP, and credit to private sector to GDP.4
Rescaling the CAB and relevant explanatory variables with GNI reduces the current account gap by
about 1.5 percentage points to 6.3 percent (Table 2.2). It also reduces the contribution of policy
gaps by about 0.3 percentage points to 1.4 percent.

2 While official data indicate that in 2014 remittances were equivalent to 9½ percent of GDP, survey based data
indicate that unregistered remittances are about 50 percent larger than those coming through official channels and
captured in official statistics. Therefore, in calculating GNI, staff assumes that total remittances are 1½ times the
officially reported amount (i.e., 15 percent of GDP). This GNI concept differs from the one of the National Statistics
Office, which assumes that all overseas foreign workers are residents, and includes all their income earned abroad in
GNI, resulting in GNI exceeding GDP by about 21 percent in 2014. However, this overstates disposable income for
people residing in the Philippines as overseas foreign workers consume much of their income abroad.

We assume that underreporting of remittances is offset by underreporting of net imports, implying that the current
account is correctly measured. This accords with anecdotal reports of customs underreporting and the findings of
Global Financial Integrity’s “Illicit Financial Flows to and from the Philippines: A Study in Dynamic Simulation, 1960‒
2011” (February 2014), which finds that underreporting of net trade in 2011 (correcting for entrepot trade with Hong
Kong SAR) amounted to 8 percent of GDP.

As EBA is estimated on a large set of countries for which GDP is close to GNI, the EBA coefficients remain valid.

Role of Natural Disasters, Infrastructure, and Remittances
11.
Cross-country empirical analysis suggests that precautionary saving and disincentives to
investment due to exposure to natural disasters—including through low infrastructure quality—has
a significant impact on the CAB, but worker remittances do not (see 2014 Staff Report). Using a
CGER-type macro-balance model covering a wide range of countries, last years’ staff report showed
that worker remittances did not have a statistically significant effect on the CAB.5 However, the
Country Risk Index from the World Risk Report had a significant impact, indicating that exposure to
natural disasters raises the CAB for high-risk countries.
12.
As the Philippines has the third highest global risk ranking, these results increased its CAB by
3½ percent of GDP due to the country’s risk of natural disasters. The world risk index consists of two
parts—exposure and vulnerability—and the Philippines scores high on both. High exposure reflects
the Philippines’ geography, while high vulnerability reflects low infrastructure quality and lagging
coping and adaptive capacities. Vulnerability to natural disasters is thus amenable to improvement.
Reducing vulnerability (by improving infrastructure quality) to the level of Malaysia, while keeping
exposure unchanged, would lower the predicted CAB by 1 percent of GDP (i.e., a net rise of
2½ percent of GDP relative to the cross-country average), while reducing vulnerability to the level of
Japan would lower the CAB by about 2 percent of GDP (i.e., a net increase of 1½ percent of GDP).
13.
Because the estimates of the impact of natural disasters on the CAB were obtained outside
EBA, we are conservative and assume that the impact of high exposure and vulnerability to natural

5 Based on ”Exchange Rate Assessments: Tools for Advanced, Emerging, and Developing Economies” by Francis Vitek
(2014), which covers 184 countries with annual data between 1973 and 2012. While this paper finds that worker
remittances do not have a significant impact on the CAB, it finds that worker remittances are associated with a
significantly more appreciated REER. Taken together, these results suggest that the stronger REER brought by
remittances weakens the trade balance, with the decline in the trade balance fully offsetting the amount of
remittance inflows, and thus leaving the CAB unchanged.

disasters on the Philippine current account is 2½ percent of GDP. This corresponds to the case in
which vulnerability (infrastructure quality) is improved to the level of Malaysia.
Overall Assessment
14.
Several Philippine specific factors may have strengthened the Philippines’ current account
balance. These include heightened exposure to natural disaster risk, understating national income by
using GDP instead of GNI, low infrastructure quality and a weak investment climate. While reliable
quantification of impacts is problematic, their total contribution could approach 4 percentage points
of GDP. This would reduce the current account gap to 3.8 percent of GDP, of which 1.4 percentage
points of GDP corresponds to deviations of policies from desired levels (Table 2.3).
15.
Staff is of the view that the external sector is moderately stronger than warranted by
fundamentals and desired policies, implying moderate currency undervaluation. With official
reserves more than adequate for precautionary purposes, sustained gradual real appreciation and
stepped up imports of investment goods over the medium term are expected to narrow the current
account gap and bring the external sector toward its multilaterally consistent equilibrium.

Appendix 3. Philippines—Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
Public debt in the Philippines is sustainable. Staff’s baseline scenario projects that the general
government debt-to-GDP ratio will continue its downward trend started in the last decade, falling from
36 percent of GDP in 2014 to 27 percent in 2020. Primary surpluses are the main factor behind this
projected decline. The authorities’ commitment to the 2 percent of GDP overall deficit target at the
national government level implies an average annual primary surplus of well over 1 percent of GDP at
the general government level. This exceeds the debt-stabilizing primary balance by about 2 percentage
points of GDP, based on the assumption of 6.5 percent real GDP growth and 3.5 percent average
inflation in the medium term. Moreover, the growth-interest rate differential will also contribute to debt
reduction, with robust real GDP growth offsetting gradually increasing interest rates. Gross financing
needs will remain comfortably around 4 percent of GDP throughout the projection period. The debt
composition is also projected to remain stable with a relatively low share of short-term debt and foreign
currency-denominated debt, in line with the authorities’ debt management policy.
2.
Alternative scenarios indicate that staff’s baseline is conservative. The Philippines achieved a
large scale public debt reduction in the past decade, supported by primary surpluses, high output
growth, and exchange rate appreciation. The historical scenario, in which real GDP growth, real interest
rates, and primary balances are equal to their 2005‒2014 averages, leads to faster reduction in debt and
gross financing needs than in staff’s baseline. The scenario with a constant primary surplus at
projected 2015 level of 2.3 percent of GDP also leads to lower debt-to-GDP ratios and gross financing
needs than in staff’s baseline scenario.
3.
Overall external debt in the Philippines is also sustainable. External debt fell sharply in the 2000s,
from a peak of 76 percent of GDP in 2001 to 27 percent in 2014, due to sustained current account
surpluses, strong output growth, and peso appreciation. Under staff’s baseline scenario, these trends
are projected to continue, with external debt expected to fall to 16 percent of GDP in 2020. Alternative
scenarios suggest that staff’s baseline is conservative. The historical scenario, in which real GDP growth,
real interest rates, and the non-interest current account balance are equal to their 2005‒2014 averages,
leads to faster reduction in external debt than in staff’s baseline. Moreover, debt dynamics appear
resilient to various shocks: one-half standard deviation shocks to interest rates, growth, and the current
account lead to only modest hikes in external debt ratios over the medium term. However, exchange
rate volatility remains a vulnerability as a one-time real depreciation of 30 percent in 2015 would raise
the external debt-to-GDP ratio by about 11 percentage points.

Exchange Arrangement
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating, while the de facto exchange
arrangement is classified as floating. The value of the Philippine peso is determined in the interbank
foreign exchange market; the Bangko Sentral intervenes in the spot and forward markets in order to
smooth undue short-term volatility in the exchange rate and to strategically build forex reserves.

PHILIPPINES

The Philippines maintains an exchange system that is free of multiple currency practices and
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions except
for exchange restrictions maintained for security reasons and notified to the Fund pursuant to
Executive Board Decision 144-(52/51).
Article IV Consultation
Philippines is on the standard 12˗month cycle. The 2014 Article IV consultation was held on
July 8, 2014 (IMF Country Report No. 14/245).
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Report on Standards and Codes (ROSC)
Participation:
MCM: A FSAP was conducted during the fourth quarter of 2001; FSAP missions visited Manila in
October and November–December 2001. The final version of the report was discussed with the
authorities in June 2002. The associated FSSA was discussed by the Executive Board together with
the Article IV staff report in September 2002. The FSAP report was published in March 2004. The
FSAP update mission took place in November 2009, and the report was published in April 2010.
FAD: Discussions on fiscal transparency were held in Manila in September 2001. The ROSC report
was discussed by the Executive Board in September 2002 together with the Article IV staff report,
and published in October 2002. The update to the ROSC report was published in June 2004. In
addition, a pilot Fiscal Transparency Evaluation mission took place in February 2014 and the report
was published in June 2015 (IMF Country Report No. 15/156).
STA: A ROSC Data Module mission was conducted in September 2003, and the report was published
in August 2004.
Technical Assistance
The Philippines is an intensive user of IMF technical assistance (TA), particularly in fiscal and financial
areas. Improvements have been made in all areas, but the translation of recommendations into law
has lagged.
FAD is executing a TA project financed by the Millennium Challenge Corporation to improve the
basic functions of tax administration by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, in line with
recommendations made by FAD TA missions in 2005, 2008, and 2009. The project provides for a
resident tax administration advisor and an extensive program of short-term expert visits. A series of
TA missions on collection enforcement, compliance improvement, program governance, taxpayer
services and VAT audit took place in 2014 and early 2015. Progress has been made in VAT audit,
arrears management and compliance improvement strategy. Seeking a pro-growth and equitable
tax system, TA on tax policy in 2013 aimed to rationalize tax expenditures. FAD’s past TA missions on
tax policy provided advice that constituted the basis for the reform of excises on tobacco and
alcoholic beverages implemented in early 2013. TA on public financial management (PFM) seeks to
establish effective and efficient budget and treasury management. In addition to the Fiscal
Transparency Evaluation, TA on medium-term budget framework, government cash management,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES

formulation and drafting of the PFM bill, and contingent liabilities management took place in 2014
and 2015. In line with past PFM advice, the government introduced a Treasury Single Account and is
reviewing its cash management and planning. It now produces a midyear report on the
macroeconomic and fiscal outlook and midyear budget execution. In addition, the revenue and
expenditure from off budget accounts are now presented in budget documents. Moreover, the PFM
bill has been submitted to the Congress.
On the legal area, LEG provided TA to the Philippines on Central Banking Legislation in 2012, and
provided advice on the amendment to the Philippines’ Central Banking Law in November 2013. In
April 2013, LEG also provided TA on Implementation of Targeted Financial Sanctions Obligations
under UN Security Council Resolutions Relation to Terrorism Financing.
MCM TA activities in the Philippines have mainly focused on developing and implementing a riskfocused supervisory approach in keeping with the Basel Core Principles and other key international
supervisory practices. In terms of outcomes, the authorities adopted Basel II in 2005, and began
implementing Pillar 2 (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)/supervisory review of
capital adequacy) in 2011. In 2010–11, a more concerted effort was made to enhance enforcement
and clear a backlog of problematic institutions; the policy on cease & desist orders (CDO) was
approved in August 2011, and this was followed by the issuance of internal procedural guidance in
October 2011. Another key outcome has been the implementation of the supervisory core training
initiative that began in late 2010. More than ten committees have developed content for new
courses, with initial rollout of the courses in 2011. In 2013, the implementation of the overall
program deepened in supervisory capacity building. The in-house training initiative is now selfsustaining, with some 16 courses developed, and the quality of the supervisory reports has shown
considerable improvement. A series of TA missions on risk-based banking supervision, including on
supervisory enforcement, bank resolution and training took place in 2013, 2014, and early 2015.
In addition to the TA program on supervision and problem banks, two TA missions on liquidity
management and forecasting and on the implementation of an interest rate corridor took
place 2013-2014. A workshop on the deepening of government securities market was also held
in 2014. Lastly, in February 2015, a staff-led TA mission visited Manila to discuss a road map for a
comprehensive financial stability framework, focusing on the institutional setup, monitoring and
tools, and crisis management.
A series of STA TA missions on Government Finance Statistics took place in 2012 and 2013 to assist
the authorities in compiling and disseminating government finance statistics in accordance with
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. Additionally, during 2012 STA provided TA to the
Philippines in the areas of Balance of Payments Statistics, Data Dissemination Standards, National
Accounts, and producer and consumer price indices. In late 2014, a TA mission worked with the
Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) on source data and compilation procedures of quarterly
accounts, and the implementation of the new System of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA).
Resident Representative
A Resident Representative has been stationed in Manila since January 1984. Mr. Shanaka Jayanath
Peiris has been the Resident Representative for the Philippines since September 2012.

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
(As of June 26, 2015)
Background
The Bank and the Fund country teams for the Philippines exchanged views to coordinate the teams’
work during 2015‒16 through the resident representative’s office and headquarters missions. The
teams agreed on the Philippines’ main macroeconomic challenges to navigate the uncertain global
environment to maintain macroeconomic stability, create policy space to meet future potential
shocks, and build the foundations for faster and more inclusive growth. Based on this shared
assessment, the teams identified three structural reform areas as macro­critical, in view of their
central role in achieving sustained inclusive growth: (1) raising investment, including public sector
capital spending; (2) strengthening public finance and social safety nets; and (3) financial sector
development. Table 1 details the specific activities planned by the two country teams during
June 2015˗May 2016, along with their expected deliverables, and the division of labor.
The Key Areas with Joint Programs
Strengthening Public Finance
The continued focus on mobilizing fiscal revenue to help fund spending in support of sustained and
inclusive growth, while strengthening the resilience to shocks. The Fund and the Bank have a long
standing program of support for strengthening public finance and involves close coordination in tax
policy reform including fiscal incentives rationalization and monitoring of the sin tax
implementation; management of fiscal risks and reporting; debt management strategy;
strengthening the fiscal unit in the Department of Finance (focused on assessing and strengthening
customs and BIR performance); assisting the Department of Budget and Management in improving
public financial management and support for the Bureau of Treasury’s lead role in implementation
of a Single Treasury Account (TSA) and cash management.
Financial Sector
A joint Bank/Fund Financial System Stability Assessment took place in 2009, following up on the
initial joint FSAP in 2002. Following the FSAP recommendations, the Fund has focused on technical
assistance in bank supervision and resolution. The Bank has taken the lead in the nonbank financial
sector and crisis simulations. Joint areas of interest are banking sector soundness and resolution,
financial inclusion and capital market development.
Broad agreement among the two teams emerged on the key issues and challenges, and on the
division of tasks to tackle these. It was agreed that further details on collaboration, as necessary,
would be agreed at the technical level as work progresses. The teams have the following requests
for information and collaboration from their counterparts:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES



The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in World Bank’s discussions with the
government on financing of infrastructure, PPPs, and implementation of the development policy
loan. Review and sharing of analytical work, in particular the Philippine Development Report
(PDR) series, would be welcome, in addition to follow up from the 2010 FSAP, and on work
related to the reform of social safety nets, public expenditure reviews, and public financial
management.



The Bank team requests to be kept informed of the Fund’s assessments of macroeconomic
policies and prospects and to coordinate closely the technical assistance work, especially in
areas such as budget reform, tax policy and administration, financial sector development and
soundness as well as in public expenditure analysis and management, where extensive Bank
work is ongoing.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of July 1, 2015)
Since joining the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1966, the Philippines has received 223 sovereign
loans and grants financed by ADB Special Funds for a total of $14,792.12 million including
nonsovereign financing amounting to $887.15 million. Public sector management, energy,
agriculture and natural resources, and transport account for the largest proportion of ADB lending
(combined 69.77 percent of the total) (Table 2). As of July 1, 2015, cumulative direct value˗added
cofinancing for the Philippines amounted to $3.4 billion for 53 investment projects and $84.9 million
for 68 TA projects.

ADB’s private sector operations in the Philippines began in 1986. As of 1 July 2015, cumulative
approvals in 29 projects amounted to $887.20 million. ADB’s private sector operations in the
Philippines include financing for power plants, roads, and air transport, and investments in banks
and private equity funds. In December 2014, ADB approved a $75 million (₱3.375 billion) loan for
the expansion and renovation of the Mactan Cebu Airport terminal (the first large-scale PPP project
awarded under the Aquino government's PPP program). Another loan was approved for $20 million
in January 2015 to support the 150-Megawatt Burgos Wind Farm Project.

The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2011−2016 was endorsed by the ADB Board of Directors on
October 26, 2011. The CPS is aligned with the government’s Philippine Development
Plan 2011−2016 and ADB’s Strategy 2020. The key objective of ADB support will be to help
Philippines achieve, high, inclusive, and sustainable growth. The intended outcomes of the CPS are:
(i) improved investment climate and private sector development; (ii) more efficient, effective, and
equitable social service delivery; (iii) reduced environmental degradation and vulnerability to climate
change disasters; and (iv) strengthened governance and reduced corruption. A CPS Final Review is
underway, the results of which will inform the next CPS. The Country Operations Business Plan
(COBP) 2014–2016, the third under the CPS 2011–2016, was approved on October 1, 2013. The next
COBP is expected for ADB Management approval by October 2015.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 10, 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National accounts: As part of a World Bank-funded project, Improving the Quality and Usefulness of the Philippine
System o f National Accounts, the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) rebased the national accounts
from 1985 to 2000. Continuing improvements include ongoing efforts to fully implement the System of National
Accounts, 2008. Despite the authorities’ efforts to improve quality, weaknesses remain in the national accounts.
These include the coverage of the GDP and the statistical discrepancies in the GDP estimates between the
expenditure and production sides. The authorities are working on improving (i) the accuracy of the GDP volume
measures; (ii) the coverage of the public corporations sector; (iii) the accuracy of the quarterly GDP data; and (iv)
the adoption of benchmark techniques to reconcile quarterly and annual national accounts estimates. The NSCB is
currently participating in the IMF Statistics Department’s Project on the Implementation of the System of National
Accounts and the International Comparison Program, funded by the Government of Japan. This three-year
technical assistance project provides assistance to improve the quality of the national accounts and price statistics.
National accounts are expected to be revised in the near future based on the recently released 2012 Census of
Philippine Business and Industry (CPBI).
Price statistics: In July 2011, the National Statistics Office introduced a rebased consumer price index (CPI). The
updated CPI is compiled using weights based on the 2006 Family Income and Expenditure Survey. Data from
the 2008 Commodity and Outlet Survey were used to augment the provincial market baskets. One important
methodological change implemented in the updated CPI is the adoption of the internationally recommended
Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP) for the classification of all items. As noted in the
above section, assistance will be provided to improve the quality of price statistics in Philippines.
External sector statistics: The BSP has completed the final-stage implementation of BOP compilation to BPM6
framework in March 2014. The compilation of IIP data based on BPM6 framework was completed in
September 2014. Steps have been taken to improve the quality of balance of payment statistics. In 2005, the
Central Bank of Philippines (BSP) created a Department of Economic Statistics, with one of its units to concentrate
on compiling, analyzing, and publishing the balance of payments and the international investment position. Since
deregulation in the early 1990s, international transactions have increasingly flowed through nontraditional
channels that are not adequately covered by the statistical reporting system. The authorities have introduced new
data sources, including the Cross Border Transactions Survey and administrative-based reporting systems to
address coverage issues, but challenges remain. The Foreign Currency Deposit Units (FCDUs), which account for
about 70−75 percent of foreign exchange settlements, are exempt from reporting requirements because of strict
banking secrecy rules.
Monetary and financial statistics: Compilation of monetary and financial statistics (MFS) largely conforms to the
Fund’s methodology. A joint effort between the Insurance Commission, SEC, GOCs, BSP to gather data and publish
the Other Financial Corporation’s Survey is ongoing.
Government finance statistics: Provision of fiscal data is broadly adequate for surveillance. Major areas for
improvement include detailed data for levels of the public sector beyond the national government as well as
transition of fiscal data reporting to the GFSM 2001 format. Fiscal Transparency ROSCs were conducted in 2002
and 2004.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Philippines subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards
(SDDS) in August 1996.

A data ROSC was published in
August 2004.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Mr. Marzunisham Omar, Executive Director and Mr. Thomas
Benjamin Marcelo, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
August 26, 2015
1.
The Philippine authorities express their strong appreciation to staff for the
constructive engagement and policy dialogue that took place during the 2015 Article IV
Consultation. The discussions focused on macroeconomic and financial sector policies
and structural reforms to sustain the economy’s drive towards strong, balanced and
inclusive growth. We are encouraged by staff’s recognition that the authorities’ sound
macroeconomic management and prudent financial sector supervision, alongside strong
macroeconomic fundamentals, have delivered solid economic growth, low inflation and
financial stability. The authorities also thank the Fund for its ongoing support through
invaluable technical assistance. They also greatly value the continued support of the
Fund’s management and the Executive Board. The authorities broadly concur with the
thrust of the staff appraisal and would like to provide the following updates on recent
macroeconomic developments and policies.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
2.
The Philippine economy continued to grow strongly amid a challenging external
economic environment, aided by low and stable inflation, a favorable external payments
position, and a sound, stable and liquid banking system. Real GDP grew by 6.1 percent
in 2014. The favorable growth performance was supported by household consumption,
private construction, and exports of goods and services. Growth moderated to 5.2 percent
in the first quarter of 2015 due mainly to temporary factors, including the lower-thanprogrammed pace of public spending, effects of dry weather on agricultural production
and slower export growth. Headline inflation continued to decelerate to 0.8 percent in
July 2015 from 1.2 percent in June 2015 due to the slower increases in food prices and
lower fuel prices. The headline inflation for the first seven months of 2015 averaged
1.9 percent, which is slightly below the government’s inflation target of 2.0-4.0 percent
for the year.
3.
The robust economic performance was supported by a sound and stable banking
system, characterized by a steady growth of resources, healthy balance sheets and low
non-performing loan ratios of below 2 percent for universal and commercial banks. The
banking system is well capitalized with a capital ratio of 16.2 percent, which is well
above the national requirement of 10 percent and twice the Basel standard of 8 percent.
There was also a healthy increase in loans going to the key productive sectors which
stood at 14.5 percent in June 2015. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ (BSP) survey of
Senior Bank Loan Officers has consistently indicated that the lending standards of banks
remain high.

4.
The Philippines has continued to record current account surpluses in the past 10
years, supported by sustained overseas Filipino remittances, tourism receipts and business
process outsourcing revenues. The country’s balance of payments position registered a
surplus in the first quarter of 2015 on account of the rising current account surplus and
lower capital outflows. This has enabled the Philippines to maintain ample gross
international reserves of US$80.4 billion as of July 2015, which is more than 10 months
of imports of goods and services.
5.
The authorities view the key risk factors to the outlook as emanating from the
divergent monetary policy in the advanced economies, weaker growth prospects in Asia
and volatility in oil prices. The authorities welcome staff’s view that the Philippines’
strong macroeconomic fundamentals should provide a cushion to withstand these risks.
6.
The authorities target a GDP growth of 7.0-8.0 percent for 2015. Several
developments should boost economic performance in 2015. Ample domestic liquidity as
well as planned higher public infrastructure and social spending, in particular in view of
the May 2016 general elections, are expected to support domestic economic activity. In
addition, sustained growth in remittances would provide additional boost to domestic
consumption. The government initiatives to mitigate El Niño dry weather conditions will
support the agriculture sector, while FDI inflows associated with the liberalized entry of
foreign banks and their corporate investors should also benefit the manufacturing and
construction sectors. Lower oil prices, partly offset by the impact of stronger El Niño
conditions on food prices and utility rates, should keep inflation in the lower half of the
BSP target range of 2.0-4.0 percent.
Macroeconomic Policy Framework and Structural Reforms
Fiscal Policy
7.
The authorities agree with staff’s recommendation that fiscal policy should focus
on supporting infrastructure investment and inclusive growth. The 2015 national budget,
including the supplemental appropriations, provided increased allocations for public
infrastructure spending, and for implementing typhoon Yolanda reconstruction and social
spending. These budget priorities continue to be the focus in the proposed 2016 national
budget.
8.
Consistent with the Philippine Development Plan’s (PDP) medium-term targets,
the authorities have set the fiscal deficit target at 2.0 percent of GDP for 2016. The
proposed expenditure program for 2016 amounts to PhP3 trillion, 15.2 percent higher
than the 2015 expenditure program and corresponds to 19.5 percent of GDP (2015:
18.7 percent of GDP). The budget priorities include: (a) pursuing good governance
through curbing corruption, and public financial management reform; (b) making
growth inclusive through increasing the provision of basic education, universal health
care and socialized housing, and expanding targeted conditional cash transfer programs

to benefit 4.6 million poor households, including victims of typhoon Yolanda and other
calamities; (c) sustaining growth through strategic infrastructure development,
strengthening tourism and agricultural development, reviving industrial development,
and expanding tertiary and technical and vocational education and training programs;
and (d) managing disaster risks through reforestation, water supply development, flood
mitigation and drainage programs/projects. The proposed budget allocation for capital
spending has been increased by 30 percent to provide for the construction of more
schools, health facilities and the transport and road infrastructure programs. Similarly,
the proposed budget allocation for social spending has been increased by 16 percent to
support basic education, housing programs for the poor and health care provision.
9.
To ensure the timely implementation of government programs and projects, the
authorities have reduced lump sum funds and instead, channeled these into specific
programs and projects. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has made
the majority of funds available to government agencies at the start of the year. As of
June 2015, 95 percent of agency budgets have already been released. An administrative
order from the President was issued in March 2015 that directed agencies to adopt
measures to clear procurement bottlenecks, improve reporting on project implementation,
and complete documentary requirements for allotment release. The DBM also issued a
budget circular in June 2015 strengthening the organizational structure of procurement
units at spending agencies, and providing these units with additional staff to support their
bids and awards committees. The authorities have also introduced cashless and checkless
disbursement schemes, which have resulted in about 80 percent of payments to
government suppliers being done through bank-to-bank transactions. The latest report
from the DBM shows continuing improvement in national government disbursements,
with capital outlays and maintenance, and other operating expenditures increasing
by 20.1 percent in May 2015. Total year-on-year spending was also higher by 9.2 percent
in May 2015.
10.
Under the PDP, the overall strategy for infrastructure development is to increase
public infrastructure spending to at least 5.0 percent of GDP in 2016 in order to support
the growth requirements in the coming years. Government spending will be
supplemented by private sector investments through public-private partnerships (PPPs),
allowing public resources to be freed up for social spending. Over the years, PPPs have
become an increasingly important tool for accelerating infrastructure development. At
present, there are 50 PPP projects in the pipeline worth over US$23 billion. Since 2011,
ten PPP contracts, totaling over US$4 billion, have been successfully awarded to the
private sector.
11.
To strengthen transparency and accountability, the authorities issued guidelines
in July 2015 to implement the government’s open data program and promote the use of
digital payments in government transactions.

12.
The authorities are also focusing on further improving tax administration and
compliance, broadening the tax base and reducing exemptions to raise tax efforts to
levels at par with regional peers in order to sustain higher public infrastructure and
social spending.
Monetary Policy
13.
The authorities reaffirm that monetary policy will remain focused on achieving
the inflation target of 2.0-4.0 percent in 2015-2016. The authorities have also approved
the medium-term inflation target of 2.0-4.0 percent for 2017-2018. The BSP’s monetary
policy actions in 2014 to act preemptively to address potential risks to price and financial
stability have given the BSP sufficient policy space to consider measures that may be
required by emerging monetary conditions. The BSP is committed to provide timely and
calibrated responses, using its enhanced tool kit and sharpened surveillance capacity, to
unfolding external events to ensure that the liquidity conditions do not become overly
tight and interest rates do not get excessively volatile. At the most recent meeting of the
Monetary Board (MB) on 13 August 2015, the MB decided to maintain the key policy
interest rates at 4.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP)
facility and 6.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest
rates on term RRPs, RPs and special deposit accounts were also kept steady. The reserve
requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The policy decisions were based on the
assessment that prevailing price and output conditions support maintaining current
monetary policy settings.
14.
To further improve the transmission of monetary policy, the BSP launched in
February 2015 the RRP e-Trading System, a web-based system that will provide greater
efficiency, security and flexibility in the BSP’s RRP transactions.
15.
The BSP is studying the adoption of an interest rate corridor framework, with
technical assistance from the IMF, in implementing monetary policy to strengthen the
transmission of policy rate adjustments to money market rates and the effectiveness of
monetary policy on the whole.
16.
To preserve the integrity of the Philippine currency, the BSP has continued the
demonetization process for the old banknotes, which started in January 2015. The old
banknote series launched in 1985 can still be used for payment transactions up to 31
December 2015. The new banknotes, which were issued in December 2010, use new and
enhanced security features to protect against counterfeits.
17.
On assessing the external sector, the authorities welcome the constructive
assessment but stress the need for staff to be cautious with the application of the External
Balance Assessment (EBA) approach in light of its limitation in the methodology. It is
important to capture country-specific factors that are relevant to the Philippines, such as

the role of remittances, to ensure a consistent and comprehensive analysis prior to
drawing possible policy implications.
18.
The authorities will continue to adhere to a market-based exchange rate policy,
with scope for occasional presence to maintain orderly conditions in the foreign exchange
market.
Financial Sector Policy
19.
The authorities continued to undertake supervisory and regulatory reforms to
further ensure the continued soundness and stability of the financial system. The
authorities are strengthening the financial stability supervisory framework, including
through capacity building and enhanced coordination among the stakeholders of the
Financial Sector Forum and the Financial Stability Coordinating Council. On enhancing
financial stability, the recent policy measures and initiatives include: (a) enhanced
reporting requirements on licenses that banks have acquired from or are renewing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory authorities to perform
securities-related operations; (b) establishment of a cross-border liquidity arrangement
between the BSP and the Bank of Japan; (c) strengthened internal control and internal
audit standards for financial institutions; (d) adoption of Basel III leverage ratio
requirements; and (e) identification of domestic systemically important banks.
20.
To support financial deepening through capital market development, the
authorities issued: (a) enhanced rule on delivery of securities; (b) amended Unit
Investment Trust Fund regulations to allow for a unit-paying feature; (c) revised
guidelines on the listing of long-term negotiable certificates of time deposits in an
accredited exchange to promote transparent pricing in financial instruments; (d) new
guidelines on the establishment and operation of trust corporations; (e) new guidelines to
segregate clients’ assets from bank assets under a securities brokering arrangement; and
(f) revised implementing rules and regulations of the Securities Regulation Code. The
authorities also approved further amendments to foreign exchange regulations.
21.
In pursuit of financial inclusion, the authorities have undertaken various
initiatives on: (a) policy, regulation and supervision; (b) financial education (through the
intensified economic and financial learning program) and consumer protection; (c)
advocacy programs (such as the development of credit surety funds to broaden access by
small and medium enterprises to collateral-free loans); and (d) financial inclusion data
and measurement. The authorities also introduced regulation offering incentives for
banks to extend their reach into unbanked areas of the country and launched a
consolidation program for rural banks to promote mergers and consolidations and expand
market reach.
22.
To further the financial inclusion agenda, the authorities recently launched the
National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (NSFI) to achieve sustained and broad-based

inclusive growth. The NSFI provides a framework for the government and the private
sector to take a coordinated and systematic approach toward the development of a
financial system that is accessible and responsive to the needs of the entire population.
Structural Reforms
23.
The authorities continued to demonstrate strong commitment and ability to deliver
on its structural reform agenda with the passage of several key legislations in 2014
and 2015, in order to boost productivity and competitiveness. On competition, the
Competition Act provides for a national competition policy prohibiting anti-competitive
agreements, abuse of dominant position and anti-competitive mergers and acquisitions.
The law also establishes a Competition Commission to police the market for unfair trade
schemes like cartels, price-fixing and other market-distorting practices. On foreign
investment liberalization, a law allowing the full entry of foreign banks in the Philippines
increased the ownership ceiling of foreign banks to 100 percent from 60 percent and
liberalized branching requirements. The liberalization of the entry of foreign financial
institutions positions the Philippines well for the ASEAN Banking Integration
Framework.
24.
On shipping, the Cabotage law was amended to allow foreign ships to transport
import or export cargo directly to and from any local port other than the Port of Manila,
which is expected to lower the cost of shipping in the Philippines. On agriculture
development, a law on the sugarcane industry mandates the allocation of resources for the
development of the industry through infrastructure development, product diversification,
increased access to finance, and human resource development. On enterprise
development, a law on the development of micro, small and medium enterprises
(MSMEs) mandates the establishment of MSME support centers that will provide
business registration assistance, business advisory services, business information and
advocacy, and monitoring and evaluation of business processes for MSMEs. These
structural reforms are expected to further strengthen competitiveness and improve the
business environment for private investment.
25.
On education, three new laws were introduced: (a) law on open distance learning,
which expands access to quality tertiary education through the promotion of open
learning and distance education programs in the country; (b) law establishing a college
scholarship program for top graduates of all public high schools in state universities and
colleges; and (c) law on ladderized education, which institutionalizes a ladderized
education program that would formalize a system of accreditation and interface between
technical-vocational education and training and higher education. On health, a law
mandates that all senior citizens shall be covered by the national health insurance of
PhilHealth. On taxation of income, a law raised the tax exemption ceiling on bonuses
benefiting around half a million private and government employees. On veterans’ affairs,
a law increased the burial assistance provided for veterans. And on governance, the law

strengthening the functional and structural organization of the Sandiganbayan, an antigraft court, allowed the creation of more divisions in the court, to speed up the resolution
of corruption cases.
26.
The authorities are also prioritizing the passage in 2015 and 2016 of the following
legislative measures: (a) Tax Incentives Management and Transparency Act to enhance
the transparency, efficiency and accountability in the grant and administration of tax
incentives; (b) Fiscal Incentives Rationalization Bill to provide competitive incentives to
investors; (c) Amendments to the BSP charter, which includes increasing the minimum
capital of the BSP, allowing the BSP to put up reserves against foreign exchange
fluctuations, and allowing the BSP to issue its own debt securities for open market
operations; (d) Amendments to the Build-Operate-Transfer Law to strengthen the legal
framework and help ensure effective implementation of PPP projects; (e) Amendments to
the law on right-of-way acquisition that would address bottlenecks in infrastructure
provision, including implementation delays in PPP projects; (f) Public Financial
Management (PFM) law that consolidates all PFM reforms initiated by the authorities,
supported by IMF technical assistance, in order to establish a transparent, accountable,
and efficient government financial system to allow for more efficient expenditure
tracking and cash management; and (g) Unified Uniformed Personnel Pension Reform
Bill to establish a sustainable pension system for the country’s uniformed services.
Final Remarks
27.
Going forward, the Philippine economy should be able to sustain successive years
of strong growth performance over the medium term. This growth has been and will be
supported by sound and strong economic fundamentals, characterized by low and stable
inflation, ample fiscal policy space, a sound and responsive banking system, an
increasingly inclusive financial system, and a healthy external position, that have
strengthened the robustness and resilience of the Philippine economy, in particular to
external volatilities. Apart from the country’s strong fundamentals, the authorities’
commitment toward sustaining its structural reform agenda would lend critical support to
lifting the country’s growth potential.
