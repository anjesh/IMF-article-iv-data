Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation and Third Review Under the
Stand-By Arrangement and Request for Modification of Performance Criteria
Prepared by the European Department in Consultation with Other Departments
Approved by Poul M. Thomsen (EUR) and James Roaf (SPR)
September 13, 2010
Stand-By Arrangement. A 24-month SBA in an amount equivalent to SDR 1.4 billion
($2.1 billion, 1190.5 percent of quota) was approved by the Executive Board on
November 19, 2008 (Country Report No. 08/362). A first purchase of SDR 560 million was
made following the Board meeting. The first review, along with an extension of the
arrangement to May 31, 2011 and rephasing of access, was completed by the Executive Board
on October 28, 2009 (Country Report No. 09/306). The second review, along with an extension
of the arrangement to August 30, 2011 and rephasing of access, was completed by the
Executive Board on April 16, 2010 (Country Report No. 10/95). Second and third purchases
equivalent to SDR 105 million each were made following the completion of these reviews. The
fourth purchase, equivalent to SDR 105 million, would become available upon completion of
the third review.
Summary. Iceland is expected to begin to rebound from its deep post-crisis recession helped by
program policies (and all relevant performance criteria for the third review have been met).
Still, there remain considerable risks to the outlook, including new challenges created by the
June Supreme Court ruling declaring foreign exchange indexation clauses in loan contracts to
be illegal. Program discussions focused on defining a process to recapitalize banks (taking into
account the uncertain impact of the court ruling), the budget for 2011, and the pace of capital
control liberalization (which was slowed down to support continued financial system stability).
Article IV consultation discussions also illuminated medium-term challenges, including the
overall growth strategy, medium-term fiscal consolidation options, and needed changes to
Iceland’s policy framework.
Discussions. See Fund Relations Appendix.
Previous Article IV Consultation. Discussions for the 2008 Article IV Consultation were held
in Reykjavik during June 23–July 4, 2008. The Staff Report (Country Report No. 08/367) was
considered by the Executive Board on September 10, 2008.
Data. Iceland subscribes to the SDDS; data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly
adequate for surveillance (Appendix III).
Exchange rate arrangements. Iceland has a de jure free floating exchange rate, and the krona
was defacto floating during the last 16 months. Iceland has accepted Article VIII, Sections 2(a),
3, and 4 obligations, but maintains an exchange restriction arising from limitations imposed on
the conversion and transfer of interest on bonds, whose retention has been approved by the
Executive Board until the earlier of twelve months from the date of the Board Decision or the
completion of the next Article IV consultation (Decision No. 14445-(09/106). The authorities
are requesting Board approval of further retention of this exchange measure.

I. CONTEXT
1.
From 2004–07, Iceland’s economy boomed, driven by capital inflows (Table 1;
Figure 1). Early in the decade, the newly privatized and deregulated banks rapidly expanded
their lending and balance sheets, facilitated by easy access to foreign funding. The abundant
and cheap credit fueled a domestic investment and consumption boom, rapid growth of asset
prices, rising inflation, and a burgeoning current account deficit. This pattern was common to
many countries, but the boom in Iceland stood out for its magnitude.
2.
Policies failed to counter the growing imbalances, and vulnerabilities built up.
Financial sector supervision did not detect growing banking sector risks.1 Fiscal policy fed
the boom through a series of tax cuts, which reduced the structural fiscal balance. The central
bank responded by raising interest rates, which helped contain inflation by appreciating the
krona, but this also contributed to a carry trade and induced households and enterprises to
borrow in foreign currencies. Towards the end of the boom period, gross external debt had
increased to over 600 percent of GDP, Iceland’s net international position turned negative,
and corporations and households faced heavy debt burdens, with elevated exposure to foreign
exchange and inflation risks. Short-term external obligations had soared, and the CBI was
unable to keep up, with reserve coverage falling under 10 percent of short term debt by 2007.
3.
The global banking crisis in late 2008 rapidly exposed Iceland’s vulnerabilities,
leading to a deep financial and economic crisis (Figure 2). The three large commercial
banks had insufficient liquidity to cope with global interbank funding pressures. They proved
too big to save, and collapsed in the span of a week. Investors rushed to exit, the krona
tumbled, inflation soared, domestic demand and output collapsed, and imports shrank
abruptly. The remaining large financial institutions in Iceland would ultimately fail, along
with a number of firms in the non-financial sector.
4.
The crisis left Iceland saddled with high external and public debt, threatening a
debt crisis. Iceland emerged from the crisis with external debt of 300 percent of GDP, down
from 605 percent pre-crisis, but still very high. Projected public sector debt soared from 30 to
over 125 percent of GDP, mainly because of the impact of the recession on public finances,
the need to recapitalize the banking system, crisis-related central bank losses, and foreign
deposit insurance requirements (which the authorities have agreed to cover pending
agreement on details, but have not accepted as sovereign debt; this still unresolved “Icesave”
dispute is now with the European Surveillance Authority, which has issued a preliminary
finding that there is a sovereign obligation, but the dispute is expected to continue up to the
EFTA court). With the impact of the crisis on debt, CDS spreads initially soared to close to
1000 bps, reflecting market fears.

5.
Iceland’s Fund-supported program, initiated after the crisis, has cushioned the
economy and allowed for a gradual unwinding of imbalances. Indeed despite the severity
of the shock, the recession in Iceland has been less severe than expected, and no worse than
in other hard-hit countries (Figure 3). A brisk response of net exports has been key, and to
this end a combination of interest rate policy, capital controls and private sector wage
restraint has helped stabilize the exchange rate at a competitive level, and tame the
overshooting that could have worsened balance sheet impacts. Private consumption has also
held up better than expected supported by an informal payment freeze on mortgages, and the
operation of automatic fiscal stabilizers (supported in turn by a stable market for government
debt, with capital controls making an important contribution to this end).
6.
The program has also rebuilt financial sector stability, and deflected a
government debt crisis:


In the financial sector, deposit runs have been avoided, helped by the government’s
explicit full deposit guarantee and the capital controls regime. New banks have been set
up with the domestic assets and liabilities of the failed banks. They have been
recapitalized, with the exception of Byr and Keflavik savings banks (which were only
intervened in April), and a few small savings banks. The process has taken longer than
expected due to difficulties in valuing assets transferred (a necessary input for
determining compensation to the old banks’ resolution committees, and establishing the
balance sheets of the new banks). A process of restructuring and some downsizing lies
ahead, called for by lingering imbalances and high levels of non-performing loans on
banks’ books. Iceland also remains overbanked, with the core of the problem in the large
number of inefficient smaller savings banks (Figure 4).



Government debt dynamics are being rapidly brought under control (Figure 5). After the
initial expansion of the deficit to cushion the economy, the authorities have stuck to an
ambitious adjustment path calibrated on Nordic experience. Over 7 percent of GDP in
fiscal measures have been taken to date, and the deficit has been reined in from the
14 percent of GDP projected in mid 2009, to a projected 9 percent of GDP in 2010. CDS
spreads on government debt have now dropped to around 300 bps.

7.


Balance sheets are slowly being repaired:
Concerning overall external debt, the public position has improved through asset and
liability management transactions, including repurchase of outstanding Eurobonds at a
discount, and the repurchase of the Avens structure at a discount (this was a Netherlandsbased company which held Icelandic government and government guaranteed bonds).
The position of the non-financial private sector has gradually improved through debt
restructuring agreements with creditors (some of which are still underway).

Regarding overall consumer and corporate debt, progress has been very slow, largely
due to delays in setting up effective debt-restructuring mechanisms (in part due to delays
in making the new banks fully operational); problems with coordinating multiple
creditors and preventing hold outs (especially amongst second and third lien holders); and
problems with take up of existing mechanisms by debtors, as they reportedly hold out in
the expectation that the government will provide a better debt reduction deal for them.
Nonetheless, some 400–500 consumer cases have been completed or are in process out of
court, and some 100 cases have been processed through the courts (Figure 6).

8.
Recent developments show an economy
still facing headwinds. The economy stabilized
towards the end of 2009. However, indicators
point to a setback in the first half of 2010, due to
the March/April volcanic eruption (taking a
temporary but significant toll on tourism); the
slowdown in the global recovery (weakening
demand for exports and worsening the terms of
trade); and from the initial fiscal cutbacks
(dampening momentum in private consumption).
Inflation has continued to fall, with the
12 month rate now below 5 percent. The
underlying current account remains in surplus.

9.
The restoration of the financial system is also confronting a new challenge
(Table 2). In June the Supreme Court of Iceland ruled that foreign exchange indexation
clauses in loan contracts are illegal, but left open the question of what constituted a foreign
exchange indexed loan (banks utilized many different fx and fx-linked contracts), and
whether the foreign-currency related interest rate stipulated in the loan contracts would
remain valid. A broad ruling upholding the contractual interest rate could have a deep impact
on financial institutions’ capital (since this is well below their funding cost, and almost half
of all loans could be affected). Bank owners would bear the losses (almost two-thirds of the
system’s equity is in private hands, a feature of the compensation instrument that was
introduced to have creditors bearing both upside and downside risks). While a recent District

7
Court ruling appears to provide grounds to support that a krona interest rate should be
applied to recalculate the illegal foreign exchange indexed loans, it may take some time until
legal certainty emerges on this issue. Separately, the need to recapitalize the government
owned and guaranteed Housing Finance Fund (HFF) has become more acute, as operational
loses reduced its capital from 4.6 percent of risk weighted assets in end-2008 to 3 percent at
end-2009.
II. OUTLOOK
10.
A durable recovery is expected to take hold during the second half of 2010
(Table 3–4; Figure 7; LOI ¶5). The expected pattern of recovery has not changed, and is
broadly in line with experience in past crisis cases. The contribution of net exports to growth
is expected to diminish, and a revival of investment and ultimately consumption is projected
to generate a slow recovery going forward. The recovery is forecast to pick up steam in 2011,
with growth reaching 3 percent, boosted by planned investments in power-intensive sectors
(which will temporarily reduce the current account surplus). Disinflation is forecast to
continue, with the 12 month rate remaining below 5 percent at year-end, reflecting subdued
wages in the non-tradable sector and recent exchange rate appreciation. Medium-term current
account surpluses are projected to improve slightly, driven mainly by a better outlook for the
balance of services. Relative to post-crisis experience in other countries, Iceland’s adjustment
is likely to feature a longer period of elevated trade balances and suppressed consumption,
given the initial level of debt overhang.
11.


The forecast is subject to considerable uncertainty:

investment (though over time it may deliver modest transfers to those benefiting from
court decisions). Higher FDI could in contrast unlock higher growth.



Regarding inflation, supply-side influences could derail the projected disinflation path.
Wage bargaining in Iceland is fairly centralized, and past post-recession patterns in
Iceland point to the risk that wage increases in the tradable sector spread to non-tradables,
sparking cost-push pressures. The Stability Pact with labor and employer organizations
has to date been a vehicle to manage such pressures, but has broken down. The
authorities agreed that it would be important to revive it during the fall 2010 wage
negotiation rounds.

12.
Iceland’s external and public debt remain sustainable, but their high levels
amplify risks (Tables A1–A2; Figures A1–A2).

in more detail in the program modalities
section below). Iceland must also address a period of high debt rollover during 2011–12.



Gross external debt is expected to fall to about 280 percent of GDP in 2010 and
reach around 190 percent of GDP by 2015. Stress tests point to risks, mainly emanating
from exchange rate depreciation. Although the gross level is still very high, it is not out
of line with gross levels in other advanced globally integrated economies. Moreover,
debts are very concentrated in multinational corporations with small footprints in Iceland,
and these companies appear to have the foreign assets and foreign income necessary to
service their debts.2 (Figure 8)



Public and external assets are relatively high. Iceland’s funded pension system is a net
international creditor, and has been shifting assets into Iceland as opportunities arise (for
instance, pension funds purchased the assets the government acquired in the Avens
transaction). The public sector holds significant assets, including in the power sector, but
also equity and collateral acquired during the crisis. Overall Iceland’s net international
position is -30 percent of GDP at end-March 2010, while net public debt is projected to

2

9
be 76 percent of GDP at end-2010. On both measures, Iceland is well within the range
defined by its peers.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: PROGRAM ISSUES
13.
Discussions focused in large part on securing the program to the impact of the
June Supreme Court ruling on foreign exchange indexed loans. The authorities and staff
agreed that the ruling—which put financial stability under pressure and created significant
contingent liabilities—had implications across the policy spectrum. It was agreed that a
process to ensure adequate bank capitalization had to be put in place, that the pace of capital
control liberalization would need to be adjusted, and that measures would need to be taken to
encourage greater participation in the existing private sector debt restructuring framework.
The discussions also focused on securing the fiscal adjustment for 2011 and beyond, with the
new financial sector contingent liabilities informing the decisions taken.
A. Financial Sector Policies
14.
The June Supreme Court ruling on foreign exchange indexed loans delivered a
setback to the full restoration of financial stability (LOI ¶7). The authorities noted that
most financial institutions had expected the court to uphold these loans (particularly since
similar loan contracts had in the past been enforced through the judiciary system), and at
worst for the courts to order loan recalculation at krona interest rates. The impact on bank
capital could be significant, and will depend on where courts draw the line between foreign
currency denominated loans and foreign exchange indexed loans (it is reported that there are
some 300 different contract types); the interest rate to be applied on the loans (contractual
rate versus published best-available average krona rates); and possibly on the nature of the
borrower (consumers appear to have extra protection in Iceland’s legislation). However, even
under the most adverse scenario, all banks would retain positive net worth and a capital to
risk-weighted assets ratio of over 4 percent. A new consumer case where the interest rate
issue will be settled is expected before the Supreme Court as early as September, although
full legal certainty about this matter will take some time. In these circumstances, the
authorities indicated that they would actively keep under review whether new legislation
could help reduce the uncertainty.

15.
A bank recapitalization process had to be designed to ensure the soundness of
the system notwithstanding the legal uncertainty (LOI ¶7). The authorities indicated that
they did not wish to become the owners of the two large private banks, and accordingly
wanted to give existing owners and creditors every opportunity to put new capital in as losses
were realized. At the same time, it was recognized that strong assurance was needed that the
system would be solvent even under a worst-case scenario, and that the government would
thus need to be prepared to backstop the recapitalization, but in manner that would protect
the public sector from absorbing further losses. The agreed approach achieves these aims
through several pillars:


Timely monitoring and recognition of losses. The FME has asked banks to classify loans
into those probably affected, possibly affected and not likely affected by the Supreme
Court ruling. The FME will closely monitor banks’ assessment of affected loans
supported by periodic reviews by independent lawyers.



A requirement that banks meet two capital benchmarks. They should meet 16 percent of
risk weighted assets after accounting for losses from probably affected loans (the current
regulatory requirement) and 6 percent of tier I capital to risk weighted assets assuming
that losses from possibly affected loans materialize (in parallel to standards set in recent
European stress tests). Capital requirements will be kept under review.



Time for bank owners to recapitalize. The new banks’ owners are given until endOctober to provide a credible plan to bring banks into full compliance with the two
capital benchmarks within 60 days. This allows time to account for expected legal
rulings. An FME decision about banks’ plans is proposed as a new program structural
benchmark for mid-November.



A government backstop for capital provision. The authorities indicated that during
October they would seek parliamentary authorization to issue enough bonds to backstop
recapitalization, up to amounts that could be needed in the worst case scenario (up to
krona 160 billion or 10 percent of GDP). This was proposed as a new program structural
benchmark. The government would acquire preferred shares, or a similar internationallyaccepted tier I capital instrument which would allow it to augment tier I capital while
ensuring that common equity holders—the banks’ owners—bear any future losses first.



A separate approach for Byr and Keflavik (which are not yet resolved). Time will be
allowed to get creditors, via the Resolution Committees, to absorb losses and recapitalize
the banks. Barring this, the least-cost option for the government is to fully recapitalize
them itself (after ensuring that creditors bear losses). This would cost about 3½ percent of
GDP, versus 1½ percent foreseen in the program. End-December appears a feasible date
by which to complete the recapitalization, taking into account the need for a new asset
valuation and EU approval for state aid. Nonetheless, in view of the timing uncertainties,
it was agreed not to propose to reset the existing program structural benchmark on

11
recapitalization (which was not observed), but the issue would be a topic for discussion at
the time of the next review.
16.
The authorities and staff agreed that commercial banks need to accelerate their
restructuring efforts to address various risks inherited from the resolution process
(LOI ¶8). These risks include high levels of nonperforming loans, high deposit
concentrations, asset concentrations, large interest rate and exchange rate imbalances (albeit
uncertain, in light of the recent Supreme Court ruling), low deposit growth, very little new
lending, and high reliance on asset recovery to sustain profitability. A critical first step has
already been taken with the recent appointment of new bank managers and directors (in
May–June). Next steps include:


Revised business plans. Through these plans, due by end-year, the authorities and bank
managers will agree on quarterly operational targets covering the upcoming 24 months,
especially regarding asset concentration and debt restructuring (which are critical to
reduce financial imbalances and restore viability to the many non performing borrowers).



Revised prudential regulations. Building on the amendments recently introduced to the
banking law the FME will revise by end-October existing regulations on large exposures,
connected lending, and related party loans. The aim will be to bring Iceland’s regulatory
framework into line with current EU norms and practices.

17.
The work to stabilize the non-bank sector has also been partially disrupted by
the Supreme Court ruling (LOI ¶9):


The HFF. The HFF is not affected by the court ruling, since it lends exclusively in krona
(indexed to inflation). It submitted its business plan to the FME in late-June,
incorporating the findings of an independent and experienced panel of technicians. The
FME has also engaged an accounting firm to assess the HFF’s loan book. Preliminary
estimates show that the HFF could require a capital injection of 2–3 percent of GDP to
keep capital above the regulatory minimum for the period of its business plan (and this
amount has been incorporated into public debt projections). The FME is expected to
approve its plan by end-September (the program structural benchmark required plans for
all non-banks to be approved by end-August). The government would inject the
necessary capital by end-year.



Other non-banks. The Supreme Court ruling has a large potential impact on non deposit
taking private asset finance companies (which constitute about 5 percent of total financial
system assets). For these companies exchange rate indexation is a common practice. It
was agreed that no public funds will be made available to recapitalize them. In lieu of the
original timeline for them to submit business plans, they would be given a timeline
similar to banks to identify corrective actions and meet capital requirements with the
support of their shareholders or creditors. If they cannot, they will be induced to exit in an
orderly fashion. This would not be expected to have any market repercussions, and

12
indeed one small private asset financing company already exited in 2010 with no
noticeable impact.
B. Private Sector Debt Restructuring
18.
The private sector debt restructuring process could be slowed down by the
Supreme Court ruling (LOI ¶10). While the ruling defacto restructures some foreign
currency loans, it could take years for the legal process to determine which loans are subject
to the ruling, with individuals foregoing the available restructuring mechanisms in the
meantime. Moreover, the decision may encourage krona borrowers to delay their decision to
restructure, in the hope that either they too benefit through future legal challenges to
indexation clauses in their loans, or that the government succumbs to social and political
pressures and grants them equivalent treatment through the budget. Delays in debt
restructuring would be costly from a macroeconomic perspective, given the potential boost to
demand that balance sheet repair could deliver.
19.
The authorities remain committed to a targeted, voluntary approach to
restructuring (LOI ¶11). They acknowledged a need to speed up the process, but despite
political pressures they reiterated that they will not undertake across-the-board debt writedowns: this would do little to solve Iceland’s overall debt overhang, and would merely shift
problems from the private sector, including those able to pay, to the public sector. This would
risk a public debt crisis, which could significantly raise interest rates for all Icelandic
borrowers, and would ultimately have to be addressed by additional fiscal adjustment
measures affecting all Icelanders, including higher taxes and additional spending restraint. In
contrast, the cost of a voluntary approach targeted to truly distressed borrowers can largely
be borne by banks (which have adequate provisions), and can deliver deeper debt relief to
those viable debtors requiring it.
20.
Recent changes to the framework for household debt restructuring are expected
to speed the process and encourage participation (LOI ¶13). These changes are expected
to address the major problems with the framework that have been identified (Table 6), and
their implementation in legislation meets a program structural benchmark. The changes (i)
create a Debtors’ Ombudsman’s Office, which will help debtors deal with multiple creditors
and sift through the many available restructuring schemes; (ii) bring additional individuals
into the scheme (e.g., individuals having some debts arising from business activities and
debtors with two properties); and (iii) remove tax disincentives for households that receive
relief. The authorities and staff agreed that efforts should be made to promote short sales of
real estate properties as an alternative to foreclosure which can be costly and time
consuming. With these mechanisms in place, the moratorium on foreclosures has been
allowed to expire as envisioned, and this is expected to further mitigate the hold-out problem.
21.
A number of initiatives are expected to help expedite corporate debt
restructuring (LOI ¶14). Financial institutions have developed and put in place general
guidelines, which aim to harmonize initiatives among banks. Special guidelines are now

13
being developed for small and medium sized enterprises. Meanwhile, the authorities are
taking measures to give banks a stronger financial incentive to restructure debts (semi-annual
audits will allow enforcement of more timely provisioning); and are essentially setting
quarterly targets for restructuring of loans (the regulatory guidance about elimination of
imbalances). If these measures are followed through, the process of corporate restructuring
could be complete in 18–24 months (consistent with international experience).
22.
The corporate insolvency regime has been refined, but remains under review
(LOI¶15). Amendments to the Bankruptcy Act have been passed, and among other things
will help expedite restructuring agreements and liquidation proceedings. A Special
Committee under the Ministry of Justice conducted an assessment of whether additional
revisions to the Bankruptcy Act were warranted and concluded that there is no such need at
this stage. However, it recognized that additional analysis should be made in the future
concerning the possibility of introducing additional measures to further expedite
restructurings, for instance, accelerated determinations of viability (the latter modeled on a
recently passed Danish Law, Act no. 718 of June 25, 2010). In practice, some restructuring
cases already mimic a pre-packaged rehabilitation plan approach, and formalizing such an
approach as an additional tool available to all would be a useful alternative approach which
would grant predictability and certainty to the now-informal process. The authorities
acknowledged some capacity problems in the court system, and are determined to prevent
delays by increasing the number of judges and court assistants (paid for by higher court fees).
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
23.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to preserve exchange rate stability
(LOI ¶15). This policy has contributed to the sharp decline of inflation and the shallowerthan-expected recession (in the latter case by preventing deeply adverse balance sheet effects
on fx borrowers). The authorities and staff agreed that the exchange rate was undervalued
from a medium-term perspective (Box 1), but recognized a wide degree of uncertainty about
the extent of undervaluation. Moreover, the more depreciated offshore rate sends an
unmistakable signal that the currency would depreciate were it to be fully floated with no
controls. Going forward, the authorities indicated that they would take advantage of recent
krona strength. They have started to purchase foreign exchange from the market—realizing
$14 million by the first week of September—and regular auctions are planned going forward.
The accumulation of reserves would improve confidence and set the stage for the gradual
elimination of capital controls in a stable exchange rate environment, and thus help to resolve
short-term tensions. Reserve coverage indicators support this approach. While they have
recently improved, they remain low, unless the impact of capital controls is accounted for
(Table 7; Figure 9). Program NIR targets were adapted to reflect this emphasis.
24.
Banking sector uncertainty stemming from the Supreme Court ruling has
created an obstacle to the next capital control liberalization step (LOI ¶16). Capital
controls continue to be an essential policy to stem large-scale capital outflows which could
destabilize the currency. Nevertheless, as they hinder investment, and cannot be administered

14
effectively for long periods of time, the program goal remains to remove them as quickly as
feasible. The authorities have already taken a first step—liberalizing controls on new foreign
exchange inflows—and some important preconditions to undertake the next step are now in
place, including a better balance of payment outlook and an improving fiscal and public debt
position. However, it was recognized that time would be needed to more fully secure
financial system stability before proceeding. That is, banks should have enough liquidity to
handle possible deposit outflows, and sufficient capital to buffer against potential losses (due
to their currency position, and that of their borrowers). The recent Supreme Court decision on
foreign exchange indexed loans had created considerable uncertainty along these dimensions.
Once these uncertainties are sufficiently resolved, a next step can be taken, and consistent
with the August 2009 strategy, this will involve release of controls on the sale and conversion
of longer term assets.
25.
It was agreed that effective administration of the controls remained a key
priority (LOI ¶17). In early May, the authorities took further steps to close loopholes in the
system, and going forward they expect to regularly review and adjust as necessary. They
indicated that they would make enough resources available at each stage of the enforcement
process to ensure that circumvention cases would be prosecuted in a timely manner. For
example, they had already transferred enforcement responsibilities from the FME (which
must husband its resources to deal with banking sector challenges) to the CBI.
26.
As the capital control regime marginally affects the conversion and transfer of a
certain component of current payments, it gives rise to an exchange restriction subject
to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Section 2(a) (LOI ¶17). This restriction arises
from limitations imposed by the capital control regulations on the conversion and transfer of
interest on bonds. The authorities are requesting Board approval of further retention of the
measure. In view of the measure’s temporary nature (the goal of the program is to eliminate
the control regime as soon as circumstances permit and the authorities have articulated a plan
to this end), and on the basis that it has been imposed for balance of payments reasons and is
non-discriminatory, staff supports the authorities’ request for Board approval of the retention
of exchange restriction until the earlier of 12 months or the completion of the next Article IV
consultation.
27.
The authorities and staff both foresaw growing constraints on monetary policy
(LOI ¶18). Interest rates would need to be set in view of the program inflation objective and
with due consideration to possible effects on the exchange rate. Since the second review, the
sluggish economic recovery, easing inflationary pressures and favorable developments in
CDS spreads had contributed to allow further gradual monetary relaxation (200 bps in three
steps) without disorderly exchange rate movements. Going forward, decisions on interest
rates would depend on the message in new data. In this context it was recognized that over
time, capital control liberalization would increase the influence of monetary policy on the
exchange rate, and the central bank would need to place additional emphasis on ensuring that
the risk-adjusted interest rate differential remained sufficient to stabilize net capital flows and
thereby the currency (Figure 10).

15
Box 1. Iceland: External Competitiveness and Stability
Iceland’s price competitiveness has improved considerably since 2007. The nominal exchange rate
collapsed in the wake of Iceland’s 2008 financial crisis, falling from around krona 80 per euro, to a
present level of krona 160 per euro. The inflation surge that followed was eventually contained, and the
real effective exchange rate (REER) has thus depreciated by about 40 percent since 2007. The drops in
the CPI-based and ULC-based REER, which are similar in magnitude, are the sharpest in the last 30
years.

Sources: CBI and staff estimates.

Staff analysis shows a modest REER undervaluation. Three standard CGER methods suggest
undervaluation ranging from 2 to 23 percent. The macroeconomic balance (MB) method shows that the
medium-term equilibrium current account is close to balance, implying a slight undervaluation of about
2 percent. The external sustainability (ES) approach suggests a moderate undervaluation of 9 percent if
Iceland’s NFA (excluding the old banks) were to be stabilized at the end-2009 level of -38 percent of
GDP. Finally, the equilibrium exchange rate (ER) approach indicates that the current level of REER is
undervalued by about 23 percent, although this result is mainly driven by the use of historical average
REER—assumed to be the equilibrium level—as a basis for the calculation.

Large uncertainties surround the analysis, given the large structural shift after the crisis. The time
horizon is one important factor. CGER-type methods focus on medium-term factors, whereas in the
short run other factors may dominate. In Iceland’s case, without the capital controls, large potential
outflows from the sizable nonresident krona positions could put significant pressures on the exchange
rate. As a result, the current REER could be seen as being overvalued. Moreover, the level at which
NFA will stabilize is debatable. The post-crisis adjustment of corporate and households is continuing,
even after the already-large narrowing of the NFA position. In addition, there are still uncertainties
regarding Iceland’s NFA: further changes in the corporate landscape through restructuring, takeover or
changes in domicile could abruptly change NFA and the NFA-stabilizing REER.

16
D. Fiscal Policy
28.
The authorities and staff agreed on some minor modifications to fiscal
adjustment targets (LOI ¶19) (Tables 7–8). The 2011 general government primary surplus
target was reduced from 1¼ to ½ percent of GDP, while the medium-term target was reduced
from 6¾ to 6 percent of GDP. The

agreed that the uncertainty regarding

called for caution. Targets will be kept under review: Iceland’s strong projected debt
dynamics suggest more room to moderate the pace of adjustment if the government continues
to avoid absorbing the private sector’s crisis-related losses, and if contingent financial sector
liabilities prove to be contained.
29.
The authorities are broadly on track to achieve the 2010 fiscal target (LOI ¶20).
The apparent softening of activity during the 2nd quarter had a temporary impact on
consumption tax revenue collections, but the overall revenue target remains within reach due
to over performance of property and income taxes. Given under spending in some areas
(totaling about ½ percent of GDP) and over performance by local governments (about
¼ percent of GDP to date), the 2010 general government primary deficit target remains well
within reach. Should revenues over perform during the second half of the year, the authorities
are committed to saving the excess (to preserve the implicit targeted adjustment of the
structural deficit).

30.
Sufficient measures have been identified to deliver the 2011 fiscal target (LOI
¶21) (Table 9). The general government primary balance target of ½ percent of GDP will be
achieved by a central government primary balance of ½ percent of GDP, along with a
balanced local government position. The projected local government outcome will be
supported by the introduction of a stronger framework (see paragraph 37), while the central
government target will be met through 3½ percent of GDP in measures. The authorities
explained that they will emphasize spending cuts, to keep the broad balance envisioned in the
consolidation plan originally agreed with social partners:


Revenue measures will amount to about 0.6 percent of GDP. The authorities intend to
increase the capital and corporate income tax rates from 18 to 20 percent. These measures
will move Iceland closer to the tax rate prevailing in other Nordic countries, and enhance
administration (by eliminating tax arbitrage opportunities created by the lower capital and
corporate tax rates versus the lowest individual income tax rate).



Expenditure measures will amount to about 3 percent of GDP. The authorities have
approved lower spending ceilings by ministry, with underlying gains to be delivered
primarily by administrative reorganization (including employment rationalization); wage
restraint, and benefit restraint. The measures are expected to reduce general government
employment and employee compensation by 13 percent relative to 2008, keeping them in
line with historical values relative to the private sector.

31.
The near-term financing outlook is benign and discussions focused on how to
orchestrate Iceland’s return to international markets (LOI ¶23). The authorities have
now financed 79 percent of their 2010 need via domestic markets, and maintain some
14 percent of GDP in deposits in the CBI (enough to handle gross financing needs for the
next 27 months). However, still muted global risk appetite, the uncertainty about banking
sector contingent liabilities, and lingering uncertainty concerning the Icesave dispute create a

18
barrier to an immediate return to international markets. To continue to lay the groundwork
for a return to markets at a better conjuncture, the authorities are working to update their
medium-term debt management strategy to fully capture the impact of recent debt buyback
operations. The strategy will be published in the fall. Concerning domestic debt, it was
agreed that a key priority would be to reduce the level of non-market debt, including by
repurchase (using excess government deposit balances) and via exchange.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: MEDIUM-TERM CHALLENGES
32.
Iceland’s crisis has spawned three key medium-term challenges. The first is to
generate conditions to grow out of the large post crisis debt. The second is to define the
adjustment measures necessary to stabilize the public debt (with due consideration for their
growth impact). And the third is to overhaul the policy framework to ensure that pre-crisis
policy mistakes are not repeated, and policies are robust to shocks. The discussions focused
on these challenges.
A. The Growth Challenge
33.
To restore growth in Iceland, key supply-side constraints must be overcome
(Figure 11).3 Iceland’s debt overhang and the restraint this places on domestic demand
suggest that excess capacity in non-tradables sectors (e.g., construction) will not be used very
soon. Growth will almost certainly have to come from an expansion of tradables production.
The price signals to move resources to tradables are in place: the real depreciation of the
currency and sharp improvement in Iceland’s unit labor costs have made Icelandic companies
much more competitive. However, the export sector is now near capacity, implying a need
for new investment. Here, the narrow production structure of Iceland’s economy presents
constraints. Existing production, concentrated mainly in energy intensive industries and
fisheries is “distant” from other types of production, implying relatively high investment
costs to expand into new products (one source of growth in typical post-crisis recoveries).
Meanwhile, scaling up existing production would be relatively straightforward, but confronts
physical constraints (available stocks, in the case of fish), and potentially long lead times
(e.g., investment in the energy intensive sector, which must be preceded by an expansion of
energy production). Reducing the cost of investing in Iceland and the time lags for doing so
were thus crucial issues.
34.
The authorities acknowledged that Iceland needs to put in place conditions to
encourage investment in the tradables sector. The authorities and staff saw several
program elements that would lay the groundwork for higher investment. First, the full
removal of capital controls and completion of fiscal adjustment (or at least the definition of
adjustment measures) would remove uncertainty about key aspects of the regulatory and tax
3

See also “Iceland: Overcoming Constraints to Growth” in Iceland: Selected Issues

19
environment, and facilitate decisions. Second, restoring the financial sector, and accelerating
corporate debt restructuring would help remove some of the financing constraints that would
otherwise delay new investments. Third, the focus on preserving Iceland’s valued Nordic
social welfare model would help discourage emigration and preserve Iceland’s reservoir of
human capital, and the potential this brings to bridge gaps to new products, techniques and
markets at lower cost. However, the staff and authorities both saw obstacles to investment, in
part due to hesitancy about foreign investment in sensitive sectors (e.g., energy). Since the
potential downside from long delays of planned investments in the energy intensive sector is
large, how this debate plays out in Iceland may well have implications for other program
policies, and it was agreed that this needs to be kept under review.
B. Medium-Term Fiscal Consolidation
35.
Completion of Iceland’s medium term fiscal adjustment will require the
identification and implementation of additional fiscal measures. To achieve the fiscal
target in the plan—a general government primary balance of 6 percent of GDP by 2013—
3 percent of GDP in additional measures will need to be defined for 2012–13. There is a
broad consensus in Iceland that the measures should be balanced between revenue increases
and expenditure cutbacks. There is much less consensus about what underlying measures to
take, although technical assistance has helped to lay out revenue options (Table 12). The
authorities and staff agreed that different mixes would likely have different macroeconomic
implications, with some Iceland-specific nuances: excessive reliance on capital and corporate
income taxes may constrain investment, but sharp movements in consumption taxes would
temporarily elevate inflation (and affect the large stock of CPI indexed debt). Excessive
reliance on public investment cutbacks would affect the stock of public capital, putting
another unwelcome barrier in front of private sector investment and sustained long term
growth. A focus on wage and transfer restraint could have salutary effects on the labor
market, contributing to restrained unit labor costs and higher employment levels, although
this would depend on continued cooperation with representatives of labor unions.
36.
The discussions focused on better understanding the macroeconomic
implications of different mixes of adjustment measures (Figure 12).4 It was agreed that
the work should examine the existing plan for balanced revenue and expenditure measures
(and the implications of different compositions of specific measures within this), and that it
should also examine alternative strategies that placed more reliance on expenditure measures,
as well as those that placed more reliance on tax measures. The simulation results, using the
IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model calibrated to Iceland, suggest that an
expenditure-oriented adjustment mix (an 80/20 division of measures) would bring a modest
cumulative real GDP growth gain of about ¼ percentage points in 2011–15 compared to a
4

20
balanced revenue/expenditure adjustment and a cumulative gain of ¾ percentage points
compared to a revenue-oriented mix. A potential negative effect on the trade balance could
be offset if the expenditure-oriented adjustment plan places greater weight on better targeting
of transfers, which would provide an additional ½ percentage point GDP growth in 2011–15
while redirecting the economy towards export-led growth. The authorities anticipate that
decisions will be taken about the policy mix and the remaining measures in the fall of 2010.

C. Strengthening the Policy Framework
37.
Iceland must establish a stronger policy framework to support the achievement
of program objectives and stability in the post-program period (LOI ¶25). The
authorities and staff saw the key issue to be stronger financial sector regulation and
supervision—shortcomings in this area were at the heart of the recent crisis—but also
recognized needed reforms to the budget framework, and a need to define the post-program
monetary policy framework.


Financial sector regulation and supervision. The Jannari Report5 and the Report of
Parliament’s Special Investigation Commission6 have identified a number of
shortcomings in regulation and supervision preceding the crisis. Legislation has been
enacted to address a number of these, and is pending concerning deposit insurance
revisions (Table 11). The changes are expected to enhance the quality of bank
supervision and regulation, provide a better overview of risk concentration, enhance bank
resolution procedures and strengthen the safety net. It was agreed that key next steps

21
include: (i) ensuring that enough well trained staff are placed in key areas of the FME
such as risk identification and management and onsite examination; (ii) establishing the
now-authorized credit risk bureau at the FME (which will cover almost two thirds of total
loans of the three large commercial banks); (iii) incorporating regulatory changes now
being developed by international standard setters (i.e., liquidity, capital, and macro
prudential measures) and crisis management (i.e., enhanced framework on early measures
and resolution tools); and (iv) defining a timetable for lifting the blanket deposit
guarantee. These will be subjects for discussions under future program reviews.


The fiscal framework (Table 12). Iceland has comparatively weak frameworks for the
budget and for local governments, and this contributed to a spending bias that increased
the amplitude of the pre-crisis boom (Figure 13). Strengthening these frameworks is
desirable in itself, and a necessary condition for any post-program system of fiscal rules
to be viable. Past technical assistance has identified needed reforms of the budget
framework, which the authorities are in the process of implementing. The authorities
indicated in particular that the 2011 budget would see the introduction of two-year
nominal spending ceilings. An overhaul of the fiscal framework for local governments
has also begun and is expected to be completed by year-end (a program structural
benchmark). A working group charged with providing recommendations has made
proposals in line with good international practice, including debt limits, a rule on the
fiscal balance, and mechanisms for coordination.



The monetary framework. The CBI institutional framework and the level of transparency
concerning monetary policy have been strengthened since the crisis, in particular by the
introduction of a five member Monetary Policy Committee (including two outside
members). Still, the authorities and staff recognized serious challenges for implementing
the de jure inflation targeting framework in Iceland, including (Figure 14): (i) smallness
and openness make the economy subject to large shocks and make the output-inflation
variability trade-off less favorable; (ii) a strong pass-through from exchange rate
movements to inflation weakens the credibility of monetary policy; (iii) a shallow
financial market limits trade and makes price formation more difficult and erratic; and
(iv) a potential for large capital flows complicates policy conduct and makes the policy
rate less effective. These weaknesses would need to be addressed if a revised IT regime
were to be put in place (either as an end in itself, or as a lead in to possible euro
membership). However the authorities and staff both acknowledged that a decision on
Iceland’s post-program framework would be premature at this point, pending further
progress in extricating Iceland from its crisis and work on considering the costs and
benefits of the various framework options.

22
V. PROGRAM MODALITIES
38.

Program commitments are set through end-2010:



Program performance will continue to be monitored by quarterly reviews
(Table 13). All quantitative performance criteria have been specified through
December 31, 2010, and indicative targets set for March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2011
(LOI Table 1 and TMU). Some modifications of the PCs for end-September 2010 are
proposed: (i) an increase in the end-September floor on the change in net international
reserves (NIR) of the CBI (to reflect a stronger emphasis on reserve accumulation);
(ii) exclusion of government fx deposit liabilities from the calculation of NIR (given the
sharp build up of these liabilities due to ALM transactions, and a need to protect levels of
gross reserves); and (iii) the end-September ceiling on the change in net domestic assets
of the CBI will be modified to be consistent with the revision in the NIR target.



New structural conditionality has been added in support of program objectives
(LOI Table 2, and LOI ¶7). Both the submission of legislation to parliament to
authorize bond issuance to cover potential bank recapitalization needs (by October 15,
2010) and the FME’s decision about the banks’ recapitalization plans (by
November 15, 2010) are key steps towards bank recapitalization. Progress in these areas
will be critical towards securing financial stability, and supporting market and depositor
confidence in banks’ liquidity and solvency in the face of the legal uncertainties
surrounding the Supreme Court ruling on foreign exchange indexed loans.

39.
Iceland continues to require substantial external financing under the program
(Table 14). Iceland must build up adequate reserve levels ahead of: (i) a sharp rise in external
amortization in late 2011 and early 2012; (ii) the full opening of the capital account; and (iii)
the outflows consequent on settlement of the old banks’ estates (the resolution committees
have about $2 billion on deposit with the CBI). Fund and bilateral disbursements to date,
combined with the Avens transaction, have dramatically improved Iceland’s reserve position.
Achieving the full amount of financing in the program will further raise reserves to about
80 percent of short-term debt by residual maturity—a level similar to that in other Fund
programs—and would leave Iceland in a position to smoothly meet these obligations.
40.
Financing assurances are in place (LOI ¶26). In view of the projected current
account surplus and existing effective capital controls Iceland should have sufficient
financing over the next 12 months to support the policies in place. As noted above, reserves
do need to be built up to ensure medium-term viability, and remaining committed bilateral
financing would deliver this outcome. The authorities intend to meet the Nordic’s conditions
to unlock this external financing before the end of the program period. Key amongst these
conditions is that Iceland meet its “international obligations”, in particular in relation to the
Icesave deposit insurance dispute. Icesave settlement discussions are continuing and
solutions have been found to a variety of technical issues, but some important issues remain

23
outstanding, including the interest rate, and the distribution of legal and economic risk. The
authorities remain committed to finalizing a settlement, although it could prove difficult to
continuously preserve the delicate cross-party political consensus now supporting the
process, especially if legal proceedings on the status of the deposit insurance obligations
move forward. A settlement remains the expected outcome, but could take some time to
arrange and approve.
41.
Staff believes that the modified program continues to place Iceland in a position
to fulfill its obligations to the Fund in a timely manner (Table 15). External debt remains
on a downward trajectory. Fund credit outstanding would peak in 2012 at 54 percent of gross
reserves and then rapidly fall. Payments would peak in 2012–13 at a manageable 15 percent
of reserves. As before, the ability to vary the pace of capital account liberalization, and
Iceland’s past experience with import compression in the face of demand shocks, provide
comfort that balance of payments shocks can be absorbed despite high debt servicing
obligations.
42.
The balance of program risks has been shifting, but strict program
implementation should help Iceland continue to cope with such risks:
 Key program risks remain, including: (i) that high debt induces a low-growth, highemigration trap; and (ii) that wider political barriers prevent a solution to the Icesave dispute,
which cuts Iceland off from needed external financing. Continued calibration of the program
to evolving demand and external financing conditions is expected to help the program cope
with these risks should they materialize. In particular, the authorities have indicated that they
are prepared to adjust the program as needed to deal with any financing shortfalls (and given
the success to date in raising international reserves, the availability of marketable non-reserve
foreign assets, and the potential to maintain the effective capital control regime, this could be
accomplished without major policy changes).
 Policy mis-sequencing risk remains a concern, particularly in light of the recent Supreme
Court ruling on fx indexed loans. The ruling raised concerns about underlying financial
sector vulnerability, and dented public confidence in the banks. A misstep on capital control
liberalization, before the banks are strengthened, could expose them to a deposit run. The
risks to financial stability are, however, mitigated by the authorities’ commitments to a clear
plan for a bank recapitalization process, and to pre-condition capital control liberalization on
assurances of financial stability.
 Litigation risk has grown in importance. The recent Supreme Court ruling over foreign
exchange indexed loans has opened a potential channel for litigation from creditors over the
likely losses to be sustained by the new banks. Public debt stress tests show that within limits
contingent liabilities can be managed by the program without endangering debt
sustainability. Successful litigation over the recent Supreme Court ruling would fall within
the limits. However, as noted in previous staff reports, successful litigation over the

24
Emergency Law would have broader consequences (see IMF Country Report No. 10/95,
Paragraph 37, bullet 5).
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Impressive progress has been achieved under the Fund-supported program. The
fears and concerns when the program was launched in the immediate wake of the collapse
have diminished, reflecting the authorities’ strong determination and policy implementation.
Heterodox program elements like capital controls, the decision to allow automatic stabilizers
to work, and a narrow structural focus on measures that had a direct and early bearing on
program objectives have underpinned achievements. The authorities’ willingness to refocus
and change the program as circumstances have changed augurs well for continued success.
44.
Iceland is set to rebound from its post crisis recession. The economy stabilized
towards the end of 2009, and while it appears to have slowed again during the first half
of 2010, quarter-on-quarter growth should resume during the second half. Meanwhile, a
recovery of the exchange rate has helped engender a sharp downward shift in inflation. From
a medium-term perspective the exchange rate remains mildly undervalued, which should
support continuation of the underlying current account surplus.
45.
Still, a wide margin of uncertainty surrounds future prospects. The private debt
overhang, barriers to energy sector investment, and global factors could all slow growth,
while cost push pressures emanating from wage agreements could threaten inflation. It will
be important for the authorities to reach a consensus with their social partners on wage
settlements in the period ahead, and on a growth strategy to support investment.
46.
Program implementation has been a key reason for success to date. A significant
amount of fiscal adjustment measures have now been put into place, stabilizing public debt
dynamics, and the financial system is slowly being restored. Third review program targets
have been met, along with a structural benchmark on improving the household debt
restructuring framework.
47.
The program now must confront a significant new policy challenge. The Supreme
Court ruling on foreign exchange indexed loans could have significant implications for bank
capital, and it could take some time to fully sort out the issue (given many different types of
fx-linked loan contracts). This has implications for policies, and may have real economic
effects, by delaying efforts to restructure private sector debts.
48.
Staff welcomes the framework being put in place to secure the capitalization of
the banking system. Banks’ capital buffers ensure that they can maintain positive net worth
even in adverse legal scenarios. This gives the opportunity to allow owners to bring in capital
as losses are realized, but they must be held to the standard of a credible commitment. It will
be critical for the government to backstop capital raising efforts, in support of financial

25
stability, but the authorities must structure their participation to minimize the risk that the
government will have to absorb potential new losses.
49.
Until the stability of the financial system is secure, capital controls and the
government’s blanket deposit guarantee must be maintained. There is a risk otherwise of
a deposit run into foreign currency, which would be very difficult to manage. It will take
some time to achieve a normal functioning of the financial sector: implementation of the
recapitalization framework will need to be matched by work to restructure banks’ balance
sheets and their operations. It remains the aim of the program to work through this process as
quickly as possible.
50.
It is time to bring to closure the work on setting up household and corporate
debt restructuring frameworks. The new household debt restructuring measures are
welcome, and address the known problems with the framework, including creditor
coordination and advice to debtors. The tools to guide the corporate work are now also
essentially in place. Staff welcomes the end of the moratorium on foreclosures, but remains
concerned that the authorities have not contained expectations of additional debt relief
measures. A clear message to contain expectations is needed, particularly in the wake of the
Supreme Court ruling.
51.
Passage of the 2011 budget would mark a significant milestone. The projected
primary position of the general government would move back into surplus. Of course, as total
measures taken or proposed approach 10 percent of GDP, there are no painless options left.
Firm political commitment will be needed to bring the budget to a conclusion, but it remains
important to take efforts to build consensus behind the measures chosen.
52.
Looking forward there may be scope to reduce the total amount of fiscal
adjustment now targeted. Debt dynamics are very favorable under the existing program
design, and can tolerate moderate reductions in the medium-term fiscal target, provided
financial sector contingent liabilities prove to be contained, and the authorities continue to
resist absorbing private sector losses.
53.
Iceland needs to build up its stock of international reserves. Reserves appear high
in gross terms, but remain inadequate relative to short-term external debt and given the risk
of capital outflows from resident sources. Program financing will help to address this, but
from a longer-term perspective, Iceland will need to purchase reserves in the market to help
redeem program loans. Staff welcomes the CBI’s commitment to get a head start on this
in 2010.
54.
Iceland should continue its efforts to normalize relations with international
creditors. This is important to unlock program bilateral financing, but more generally is
needed to revive market confidence in Iceland’s re-integration into global markets. The staff
welcomes Iceland’s continued commitment to reaching an agreement with the U.K. and The
Netherlands concerning Icesave deposits.

26
55.
Increased attention must be given to strengthening the policy framework. Staff
welcomes the work to date to amend the banking law towards stronger banking regulation
and supervision, and the measures taken to improve the budget planning and implementation
framework. Key steps ahead include reform of the fiscal framework for local governments,
full implementation of legislated financial sector supervisory reforms, and further
strengthening of the supervisory framework in line with the evolution of international norms,
and reflecting the findings of a planned BCP assessment.
56.
On the basis of the considerable progress to date and accomplishments of the
program, staff supports the authorities’ request to complete the third review. Staff also
recommends the modification of NIR and NDA targets for end-September 2010, and
establishment of quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2010. Iceland’s capital
control regime continues to marginally affect the conversion and transfer of a certain
component of current payments, giving rise to an exchange restriction. Since it has been
imposed for balance of payments reasons, is non-discriminatory and temporary, staff
support’s the authorities’ request for Board approval of the further retention of the measure
until the earlier of 12 months or the completion of the next Article IV consultation.
57.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the twenty-four
month consultation cycle in accordance with the Board decision on the consultation
cycle for program countries.

Table 5. Iceland: Framework for Household Debt Restructuring
Household Debt Restructuring—Status of Proposed Reforms
Problems

Actions Taken

Better access
to
Information
Advice and
Mediation
Mechanisms

Debtors Ombudsman’s Office
(DO). This entity will oversee
debt mitigation procedures for
individuals and provide them
with advisory and mediation
services.

Extending
current
framework to
individuals
not currently
covered

The framework was expanded to
include self-employed and
individuals whose debt overhang
includes debt arising from
his/her economic/business
activities.

Key Next Steps
Scale up DO, including via outsourcing
Ensure adequate coordination between MoSA and
MoJ on supervision and oversight of the DO.

The framework was expanded to
include debtors with two
properties
Debt mitigation extended to
cover individuals that have
emigrated to study or seek
employment. Legal domicile in
Iceland is no longer a
precondition for debt mitigation

Creating
incentives for
debtors and
creditors to
engage in
voluntary
debt
restructurings

New legal framework on
voluntary debt mitigation creates
a connection with judicial
remedies, introducing formal
lodging of claims and time limits
for processing applications.
The moratorium on foreclosures
is being phased out (with limited
rights for continued residence
linked to social considerations)
Modification of the tax regime to
remove tax disincentives for
households that receive relief.

Promote short sales of properties, as an alternative to
foreclosures.
Contain public expectations about the possibility of
new and more beneficial government-sponsored
measures.

Sources: Central Bank of Iceland; and Fund staff estimates
1/ Although the balance sheets of the new banks have been finalized, the CBI has not received full monetary data reports.
Therefore the items under the banking system and consolidated financial system remain estimates for all periods after October 2008.
2/ Foreign liabilities include fx deposits of domestic banks and the government.
3/ Net claims on banks is the difference between CBI's lending to banks and banks' holding of certificates of deposits.
4/ Base money includes currency in circulation and DMBs deposits at the central bank in krona.
5/ Net claims on the public sector of the consolidated system include only net claims of the central bank up to January 2009.
Starting Feb 2009, the data also include oustanding government bonds held by the banks.

1/ Historical data are semi-accrual; projections are modified cash.
Projections for 2010 reflect the consolidation of the central government (cash) budget, and projections for local governments and social security funds.
2/ Measures have been divided about equally between tax and expenditure measures in 2012. In the current projections, measures are reflected only in these lines.
Measures are counted cumulatively from 2011 onward.
3/ Excluding write-off claims on banks. Write-offs in 2008 are the result of central bank recapitalization and securities lending contracts that failed after the bank collapse.
Write-offs in 2009 relate to an estimate of the NPV of depositor guarantees (liabilities not recovered by assets) and retroactive interest paid to new banks to compensate for late capitalization.
4/ Includes bilateral loans to support foreign currency reserves at the Central Bank of Iceland (CBI).
Loan from the Norwegian government directly to the CBI is excluded from general government debt. Includes the estimated net present value of the oustanding guarantee, net of asset recovery,
on the UK/Dutch IceSave loans to the Icelandic Depositors' and Investors' Guarantee Fund. Does not include Fund liabilities.
5/ Cash flow impact of the outstanding IceSave guarantee after asset recovery. It estimates, under given assumptions for asset recovery, the residual obligation for the government and growth there
due to accruing interest.
6/ Gross debt minus liquid assets at the CBI (including assets from bilateral loans to support CBI reserves, which are assumed to be liquid).
7/ In percent of potential GDP. Structural estimates for 2009 were normalized to account for the impact of the asset bust price cycle. The deterioration in 2009 does not reflect the fiscal stance.
8/ State guarantees only. Excludes guarantee on IceSave loans.

Table 11. Iceland: Status of Financial Sector Supervision and Regulation Reform
Problem
Inadequate cooperation between domestic
supervisory institutions

Recommendation 1/

Decrease the number of Ministries
that have a hand in Financial Supervision

Bring FME and CBI under the same
administrative umbrella

Status
Supervision centralized under Ministry of
Economic Affairs (FME, CBI). Exception:
HFF, which remains under Ministry of
Social Affairs

Inadequate communications with other
regulators before and during the crisis


Participate more actively in
international cooperation within the EEA
and EU.

A focus on the letter of the law allowed
banks to use high powered legal help to
effectively skirt regulation.


Give more discretionary powers to
the FME, and encourage it to use them
more forcefully

The FME now has discretionary powers to:
(i) compute capital; (ii) rule on stock
options and incentive schemes; (iii)
prohibit the establishment of foreign
branches; (iv) supervise closely the role of
board members; and (v) define whether
there is an economic connection between
borrowers.

Build up of large exposures.


Create a national credit registry at the
FME, to provide a better overview of large
exposures.

Work is underway by the FME and CBI
staff to establish a credit risk registry
(CRR) by end-June 2011. Borrowers
above ISK 300 million will be reported by
banks to the CRR (about 70 percent of
existing system loans).


Lay down tougher rules on large
exposures, and strictly enforce them
Level of capital


On the basis of pillar II, Iceland’s
banks should be subjected to higher
minimum tier I capital (12 percent)

The authorities continue requiring banks to
hold a minimum of 12 percent of tier I
capital given the still sizable level of
nonperforming loans and number of
borrowers that need restructuring.

Significant connected lending


Lay down tougher rules on connected
lending and strictly enforce them

The FME’s opinion on economic links
between specific borrowers and bank
owners will prevail at all times, unless it is
shown to be wrong.

Fit and proper requirements were only
applied from 2005 on, and narrowly
(covering only MDs)


Strengthen fit and proper
requirements and more strictly enforce
them

Changes in accordance with
directive 2007/44/EC. The FME will decide
on eligibility of applicants to qualify for
holding.

Offsite reports on credit risk exchange rate
risk and liquidity risk were never verified



The FME has increased the number of
staff. A high level committee has been set
up to revise and update supervisory
powers at the FME law; draft proposals
are expected in early 2011.

Failure of deposit insurance fund


Review and improve the deposit
insurance system, following developments
in the EU

Conduct more on site inspections

The draft bill was submitted to parliament
for approval. The deposit insurance limit
would be raised to euro 50,000 and will
aim to protect a large number of
depositors. Banks will be given sufficient
time to absorb the increase in
contributions, and the DIS will be able to
borrow to ensure sufficient resources.

A committee has been set up to propose

Create a separate regime for
new legislation on bank resolution.

Reform

Steps

Progress

Strengthening the Budget Framework
The legislative framework is not complete,
particularly in defining roles and
responsibilities of key actors, in budget
preparation, and in specifying the
circumstances and procedure for approval
of supplementary budgets.

 Introduce a Parliamentary standing
order to enshrine a greater medium-term
orientation and top-down sequence to
budget preparation.
 Restrict use of supplementary budgets
to genuinely unforeseen and unavoidable
expenditures.
 Set up a more comprehensive,
transparent and binding fiscal framework
for general government and rationalize the
process of budget formulation and
approval.
 Establish a top-down approach to
budget preparation, discussion, and
approval in Cabinet and Parliament.

Operational spending overruns routinely
legitimized by supplementary budgets.
Positive and negative carryovers vis-à-vis
a fully fledged system of contingency
funds makes frequent recourse to
parliament necessary and complicates
budget management.

 Introduce tighter controls over budget
execution including through curtailing
carryover of unused budget
appropriations, carry forward of future
appropriations, earmarking of revenues,
and unfunded expenditure commitments
by line ministries, and excessive recourse
to supplementary budgets.

Performance management is only partially
developed and is not integrated with the
budget cycle.

 Require an independent audit of the
achievement of the annual fiscal policy
targets

Source: FAD TA Report: “Iceland – Strengthening the Budget Framework.”
1/ Based on FAD TA recommendations.

 More disciplined procedure to prepare 2011
Budget: presentation to Parliament of mediumterm fiscal objectives and nominal spending
ceiling for 2011–12 in early Summer.
 Include in the budget an account of changes
to individual and overall expenditure ceilings and
ministerial ceilings in a four-year perspective.
 Parliamentary approval of the budget to
follow the top-down procedures voting the
medium-term fiscal objectives and expenditure
ceiling before individual allocations.
 Expand contingency funds at the line ministry
level.
 Ensure that new legislation introducing new
spending is part of the budget preparation
process or absorbed within ministerial budget
ceilings during the year.
 Ensure that supplementary budgets do not
imply an increase in total appropriations.
 Widen the scope of INAO’s audit to verify the
consistency of both fiscal plans and outturns with
the government’s overall fiscal framework.
 Rate ministries and agencies on the basis of
their financial management.

Commitment to introduce changes to
budget preparation, approval and execution
procedures according to July 2009 report
by MoF to Parliament.

July 2009 report by MoF to Parliament
announced a range of reforms to introduce
a two-year fixed expenditure ceiling and
top-down sequence to budget preparation
and approval.
2011 Budget and medium-term fiscal
objectives under preparation with the
objective of presenting them to Parliament
in early fall.
July 2009 report by MoF to Parliament
announced tighter controls on carryovers,
reduction in the earmarking of revenue, and
limitations on the use of supplementary
budgets.

July 2009 report by MoF to Parliament
invited INAO to report on achievement of
fiscal policy targets at the end of each
budget year.

38

The medium-term framework does not
inform the cabinet’s and parliament’s
policy prioritization discussions; it does not
enable spending agencies to prepare longterm budget plans; nor does it ensure
multi-year expenditure discipline and fiscal
sustainability.

 Update Parliamentary standing order
governing preparation of the budget in
Parliament to introduce two-stage sequence to
approval of the budget
 Amend the 1997 Budget Act to restrict use of
supplementary budgets

1/ Simulation scenarios for fiscal consolidation compares the baseline (second review) with the latest revised plan and a much less ambitious
plan (primary surpluses of 0.6 percent of GDP for the medium term). Icesave scenarios include better loan terms compared to the August 2009
agreement and better (100 percent) and worse (50 percent) asset recovery rate compared to the baseline (88 percent). Landsvirkjun scenario
considers a 10 percentage points increase in Aluminum price volatility and a 30 percent fall in Landsvirkjun's asset value.

1/ Model-based esimates are based on Jeanne and Ranciere (2006). The model calibrates optimal reserves level for a
small open economy that may be hit by a sudden stop in capital inflows, and maintains a stock of reserves to smooth the
impact of the sudden stop on domestic absorption. Baseline optimal reserves level assumes: 74 percent of GDP in the size of
sudden stop (short-term external debt), 10 percent probability of a sudden stop, 6.5 percent output loss, 3 percent potential
output growth, 6 percent opportunity cost of reserves and a relative risk aversion parameter of 2 (higher number means
higher risk aversion). Emerging markets usually observe higher risk aversion level than advanced countries (see Salman
(2005) for example).

ATTACHMENT I. LETTER OF INTENT
Reykjavik, September 13, 2010
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington D.C., 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
Iceland’s economic program is laying the foundation for a sustainable recovery.
Progress towards fiscal consolidation has been reflected in improving confidence, falling
debt spreads and an appreciating krona. The post-crisis recession eased in the fourth quarter
of 2009, unemployment appears to have peaked, and while the economy faces headwinds, we
expect a durable but gradual recovery to take hold in the second half of 2010.
2.
Our policy implementation remains broadly on track. All end-May performance
criteria have been met. The end-June structural benchmark concerning the passage of
legislation to strengthen the framework for household debt restructuring has also been met.
Although we have taken steps to intervene in weak savings banks, as discussed below their
recapitalization, a structural benchmark for end-May, has been delayed to account for the
impact of a recent court decision. The status of all program measures is summarized in
Tables 1 and 2.
3.
On this basis, we request completion of the third review under the Stand-By
Arrangement. As set out in Table 1, we request that ceilings and floors for the quantitative
performance criteria under the arrangement be modified for end-September 2010, and
established for December 31, 2010, and that indicative targets be set for March 31, 2011 and
June 30, 2011. As detailed below, we also propose two new structural benchmarks covering
bank recapitalization and authorization for bond issuance in support of bank recapitalization
(Table 2).
4.
We believe that the policies set forth in this and previous letters will deliver the
objectives of our program. We stand ready to take any further measures that may become
appropriate for this purpose. We will consult with the Fund on the adoption of any such
measures and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in this letter, in accordance
with the Fund’s policies on such consultation.

57
The outlook
5.
Iceland’s economy is beginning to emerge from recession, and a gradual
recovery remains our expectation:


The outlook for real GDP growth remains broadly unchanged, with a durable but
gradual recovery expected to take hold in the second half of 2010. Economic activity
broadly stabilized at the end of 2009, driven by strong exports and a recovery in
consumption. However, continued delays in large investments projects and the impact
of the spring volcanic eruption on tourism have led to a temporary setback during the
first half of 2010. Deleveraging and external demand remain the key downside risks.
Upside could conversely be realized through higher investment, particularly in the
now competitive tradables sector, and we are committed to removing obstacles to
investment.



We expect the headline 12-month end-period inflation rate to continue to decline. It
should reach 4 percent by end-2010 and 2–3 percent in 2011. Significant slack in the
economy helps, but our cautious monetary policy, which has contributed to a gradual
appreciation of the krona, has been crucial towards disinflation. Risks to the outlook
emanate from possible wage increases in export sectors spreading to non-tradables
sectors, and from still volatile inflation expectations. To attenuate these risks, the
government is committed to discuss a new stability pact with our social partners, with
a view to reach an agreement by end-September.



The outlook for the balance of payments is strong. Over the next 12 months, we
expect continued reserve accumulation due to a continuing trade surplus and the
realization of program financing. Looking further ahead, our asset and liability
management transactions (paragraph 6) have markedly reduced debt service
through 2012. Overall, our reserve coverage stands at a healthy 125 percent of short
term debt (by residual maturity, adjusted for continuing capital controls).

6.
While Iceland’s gross debt levels remain high, they are being addressed. We have
significantly reduced both gross and net external and public debt through the purchase of a
Luxemburg-based holding company and its assets, comprised of krona deposits and Icelandic
government and government guaranteed bonds (“Avens”); and through direct Eurobond
repurchases from the market. We expect continued declines in gross public and external debt
over the medium term, but levels will remain high for the time being, with gross general
government debt expected to peak at about 120 percent of GDP in 2010, and gross external
debt projected to amount to 280 percent of GDP in 2010. The high debt ratios pose risks,
which are attenuated somewhat by significant public and external assets (the net international
position amounts to only -30 percent of GDP at end-March 2010). Remaining risks can be
managed through firm implementation of the program, including the policies laid out below.

58
Restoring the financial system
7.
A ruling by Iceland’s Supreme Court has required us to revisit the issue of
recapitalization of banks. The three new commercial banks were set up with significant
capital buffers, and all exceeded the regulatory minimum prior to the ruling. However,
capital levels will be affected by the decision (which stated, among other things, that foreign
exchange indexation clauses in domestic currency loans are illegal). The ongoing strategy
and timetable to restore the solvency of Byr and SpKef (successors to savings banks
intervened in April) has also been affected by the court ruling. To preserve market
confidence in the financial system and protect depositors, while encouraging bank owners to
bring new capital in (thus minimizing fiscal costs), the following steps will be taken:


Assessment. The FME has asked banks and savings banks to assess potential losses on
their pool of fx loans. The loans have been provisionally classified as probably
affected by the ruling, possibly affected by the ruling, and not likely to be affected. A
legal audit of banks’ loan contracts, to be completed by end-September, will help
refine the classification, and the classification will be updated as necessary, as court
rulings bring further clarity.



Accounting for losses. The FME will require banks to fully provision likely losses on
probably affected loans by end-October. To the extent court rulings establish
additional probably-affected loans (as losses on possibly affected loans crystallize),
we will require these loans to be provisioned fully and immediately.



Recapitalization of the three new commercial banks. Banks will be required by
end-October to commit to a credible plan to meet within 60 days: (i) minimum
regulatory capital requirements; and (ii) at least 6 percent total tier I capital to risk
weighted assets (after deducting from capital potential losses on possibly affected
loans). The FME will adopt a decision on all three banks’ plans by November 15 (a
structural benchmark). In the event that subsequent court decisions crystallize
possible losses, banks would have 2 weeks to present revised credible plans to meet
these targets, and a new 60 day period would be provided to meet the targets.



Government participation in recapitalization. If any of the three new commercial
banks cannot demonstrate that they will be able to meet their capital requirement
within the designated time frame, or proves unable to do so, we will support their
recapitalization by injecting tier I capital using an instrument that will be structured to
isolate the government from initial impact of potential future losses (for instance,
preferred shares). Recapitalization could have a substantial cost to the government
and taxpayers, but it is a cost that will have to be borne to preserve financial stability.

59
To facilitate potential recapitalization, the 2010 supplementary budget, which we will
submit to Parliament by October 15, will: (i) authorize sufficient bond issuance to
cover the recapitalization need if losses on all probably affected and possibly affected
loans are realized; and (ii) enable the Ministry of Finance to recapitalize the banks in
amounts needed (on the request of the Icelandic State Bank Agency which will
manage, on behalf of the government, any shares acquired (a structural
benchmark). We anticipate that this supplementary budget will be considered by
Parliament by mid-November. Enactment would ensure that funds are available if
government participation in recapitalization becomes necessary at this early juncture.
The authority to issue sufficient bonds will be renewed in the 2011 budget.


Recapitalization schedule for Byr and Keflavik. By end-September we aim to
complete negotiations with the Resolution Committees on recapitalization plans. The
plans would account for losses on loans that are affected by the Supreme Court
ruling, and would require enough capital to address losses from loans that may
possibly be affected by future rulings. If agreements cannot be reached, new asset
valuations would be undertaken to prepare the ground for recapitalization by the
government. In either case we expect that by end-December these institutions will
meet FME capital requirements.



Reducing uncertainty. It is in the interest of both lenders and borrowers to reduce the
uncertainty surrounding the status of foreign currency linked loans, and this would
also contribute to better macroeconomic performance. To this end we will identify
any remaining legal uncertainties regarding foreign currency linked loans, and
address them in a manner that protects the government from absorbing private sector
losses.

8.
We are working to address bank balance sheet vulnerabilities. This will set the
stage for a durable renewal of lending:


Updated prudential rules. On the basis of the recently passed amendments to the
banking legal framework, by end-October the FME will strengthen prudential rules,
including on connected parties, large exposures, foreign exchange lending, and
liquidity.



Revised business plans. By end-December 2010, the FME, with technical support of
an internationally recognized consulting firm, will assess progress made by banks in
reducing operational, risk management and governance gaps, and in addressing the
capital implications of the Supreme Court ruling on foreign exchange loan indexation
clauses, and sign off on the revised business plans submitted by the institutions.



Implementation. On the basis of revised business plans, the FME will negotiate a
timetable on quarterly targets with banks covering the gradual reduction of remaining

60
financial imbalances, restructuring of their operations, and adjustment of their credit
exposures and liquidity positions to the new prudential regulations (if they are not
already in compliance).
9.

We are also working to address weaknesses in the non-bank sector:



The Housing Finance Fund (HFF). By end-September, we expect to formulate a
rehabilitation and recapitalization plan based on the HFF’s business plan. This will
cover, inter alia: (i) recapitalizing the HFF by end-December 2010, by injecting
enough marketable government securities to keep its capital above the regulatory
minimum for the period defined by its business plan; and (ii) the establishment of a
timetable for harmonizing capital and other requirements with those of other financial
institutions.



Other non-bank financial institutions. Since these institutions were affected by the
Supreme Court ruling on foreign exchange indexed loans, the FME has requested an
acceleration of the work on rehabilitation and recapitalization plans, following the
requirements laid out above for commercial banks. For these other non-banks, public
funds will not be available for recapitalization, and if they cannot identify corrective
actions, they will be resolved in an orderly fashion.

Restoring private sector balance sheets
10.
We remain committed to a targeted, voluntary approach to debt restructuring.
Moreover, we are determined to see the work through to a conclusion as soon as possible and
in particular to ensure that the frameworks we have designed for household and corporate
debt restructuring function efficiently and productively. While we remain committed to
simplifying the process, we have ruled out an across-the board debt write down (e.g., for
borrowers not affected by the Supreme Court ruling on foreign exchange indexed loans).
This reflects the enormous and unaffordable fiscal cost, the need to preserve an operating and
stable banking system, and the detrimental impact this would have on Iceland’s payment
culture. We will continue to focus attention on the distressed borrowers who fortunately
remain a minority of total borrowers.
11.
We have amended Iceland’s voluntary framework for household debt
restructuring (meeting the end-June structural benchmark). Key aspects of the changes
include the establishment of a Debtor’s Ombudsman (to provide advisory and mediation
services to debtors, and help address creditor hold-out problems); and the extension of the
framework to several classes of solvent borrowers who have not previously been eligible
(e.g., individuals having some debts arising from business activities). We have implemented
changes to forced auctions to address market failures and have also clarified the conditions
under which debtors can temporarily remain in a foreclosed home (they must pay market rent
and can be asked to provide a guarantee against damages). Guidelines provide for a

61
minimum stay of 6 months (and longer if specific social criteria are met). Finally, we will
encourage banks to offer debtors the option of short-selling their properties, and we have
removed tax disincentives for households that receive relief.
12.
With the framework now finalized, our focus will be on encouraging greater
participation by households. We set up in August the new Debtors’ Ombudsman’s Office,
and are scaling its operations up (including via outsourcing), and engaging in enhanced
public outreach to explain the framework. This should help quickly guide debtors through the
many options available to them. Finally, with the framework in place, we are proceeding as
planned to remove temporary post-crisis measures—like the moratorium on home
foreclosures—the continuance of which represent a barrier to debtor participation.
13.
We have made further progress in operationalizing a framework for voluntary
corporate restructuring. Banks have now developed and put in place general guidelines.
The FME will also instruct banks to produce specific guidelines covering the treatment of
small and medium sized enterprises (where a case-by-case approach would prove difficult to
implement). A special committee will monitor and continuously report on the application of
these guidelines, putting special emphasis on ensuring transparency and fairness. One
by-product of the recent strengthening of supervisory oversight powers, and actions to
strengthen banks’ balance sheets, will likely be faster progress with restructuring. This would
come both via the quarterly targets for eliminating remaining fx imbalances, and via a
requirement for banks to adopt semi-annual audits (which will speed the FME’s ability to
detect loan losses associated with delays in debt restructuring, and thus speed up
provisioning, giving banks a financial incentive to restructure).
14.
The insolvency regime has been refined. Recent amendments to the Bankruptcy Act
simplified and expedited in-court proceedings for restructuring agreements and liquidations;
addressed operational issues arising in the context of cross border insolvency of companies;
and ensured preservation of secured creditors’ rights. A Committee on Procedural Law under
the Ministry of Justice assessed whether there is a need to introduce additional changes to
Iceland’s insolvency regime to better expedite out-of-court restructurings. The Committee
has concluded that such changes are not needed at this stage while recognizing that further
assessments of specific measures could possibly be undertaken at a later stage based on the
experience of a recently passed Danish Law (Act no. 718 of June 25, 2010).
Monetary Policy and Capital Controls: Preserving Currency Stability
15.
Given the recent krona strength and continuing balance of payments inflows, we
will place increased emphasis on reserve accumulation. A higher level of non-borrowed
reserves will improve confidence in the economy (lowering debt spreads), and strengthen the
CBI position ahead of the phase out of capital controls. The aim of the purchases will be to
accumulate non-borrowed reserves, not to set a level or direction for the krona. The CBI
began to undertake auctions beginning at end-August 2010, and these will continue on a

62
regular schedule. Initial purchases will be small, and will gradually mount over time in a
manner tied to projected market conditions. The CBI may undertake additional purchase, via
auctions if possible, in the event of large and irregular inflows into the market.
16.
Once the preconditions are in place, we will take the next step towards capital
account liberalization. Capital controls continue to be an essential tool to stem large-scale
capital outflows which could destabilize the currency. However, they do represent an
obstacle to higher investment in Iceland, and we are committed to careful removal of the
controls, in a manner that preserves currency and financial system stability. Consistent with
our liberalization strategy, the next step will involve lifting controls on long term assets.
Assuming the balance of payments outlook remains unchanged, the next step can be taken
once the banking system is deemed sufficiently strong (with enough liquidity to handle
possible outflows, and sufficient capital to buffer against any losses). Any subsequent steps
will be taken on the basis of the outcome of previous steps.
17.
We remain committed to effective enforcement of the capital control regime. To
help deliver continuing compliance as liberalization proceeds, we will ensure that enough
resources are available to take cases from their initial stages of investigation right through
court proceedings. As the capital control regime marginally affects the conversion and
transfer of a certain component of current payments, namely interest on bonds (whose
transfer the foreign exchange rules apportion depending on the period of the holding). We
request temporary Fund approval of further retention of the measure that gives rise to the
existing exchange restriction in line with Fund policies.
18.
The CBI’s policy stance will be set to preserve currency stability and continued
disinflation. Currency depreciation brings with it significant inflation pass-through and
additional balance-sheet stress, both of which must be minimized to secure Iceland’s
economic recovery. Looking ahead, each step towards capital control liberalization will
increase the influence of monetary policy on the exchange rate, and we will thus need to
ensure that Iceland’s risk-adjusted interest rate differential is sufficient to preserve currency
stability. We expect currency stability and Iceland’s significant output gap to promote
continued disinflation, but in the event of inflation persistence, will adjust our policy to attain
end-year inflation objectives.
Fiscal Policy: Securing Public Debt Sustainability
19.
We are on track to hit our 2010 primary fiscal deficit target. Government revenue
collections are broadly on track, and central government spending remains below budget
limits. The general government primary deficit should reach the targeted level of 2¾ percent
of GDP in 2010 (an improvement of about 4¼ percent of GDP over 2009). Should revenues
exceed targets during the second half of 2010, we will preserve the structural adjustment
implicit in the 2010 budget targets.

63
20.
We aim to achieve a general government primary surplus in 2011. Based on the
updated forecasts for 2010, we are preparing the 2011 budget for the central government
aiming at a general government primary surplus of ½ percent of GDP (implying an
adjustment of 3¼ percent of GDP). This is broadly in line with the planned adjustment in our
medium-term consolidation plan (3¾ percent of GDP); the slight reduction is to provide
insurance against downside risks to domestic demand. We expect that local governments will
deliver a balanced primary position, backed by a strengthened fiscal framework. The central
government will therefore target a primary surplus of ½ percent of GDP (implying a central
government primary adjustment of 3¼ percent of GDP).
21.
A package of measures has been identified to help deliver the central
government fiscal adjustment in 2011.


Revenue measures. These will yield about 0.6 percent of GDP, and include increasing
the corporate income tax and capital income tax rates from 18 to 20 percent. The tax
measures will mainly offset the impact of expiring one-off measures from the 2010
budget, but will also generate a small increase in the ratio of primary revenue to GDP.



Expenditure measures. These will amount to 2 percent of GDP relative to the budget
baseline for 2011 (and 3 percent of GDP measured against the projected 2010
outturn). The measures include no nominal wage or benefit increases; a 5 percent
reduction of health, primary education, and police service costs; a 7½ percent
reduction in higher education costs; and a 9 percent reduction in general
administrative costs (including through reduction in overtime, reorganizations, and
contract renegotiations).

22.
We have updated our medium term fiscal consolidation plan. We remain firmly
committed to stabilizing the fiscal position by achieving a positive primary balance in 2011,
a positive overall balance in 2012, and a significant general government primary surplus
by 2013 (6 percent of GDP). To the extent that debt falls faster than expected and if
contingent bank recapitalization liabilities prove to be contained, then we may revisit the
medium-term targets. We have identified a number of options to help us achieve our targets.
On the revenue side, the entire structure is under review, and technical assistance has
identified several options including, among others, restoring aspects of the VAT system to
their pre-crisis status; and improving the progressivity of the personal income tax. On the
expenditure side, we remain committed to improving the progressivity of benefits.
23.
We will steadily improve our financial balance sheet. We have increased issuance
of long-term bonds, responding to investor appetite for longer maturities and in line with our
objective of extending average time to maturity. To ensure that investors are aware of
changes in our annual borrowing plan, we have published an update and have committed to
announcing any further changes at the end of each quarter. Our recent repurchase of
Eurobonds has helped smooth the profile of our external debt coming due. To prepare the

64
ground for a return to the international market, we will publish our medium-term debt
management strategy. Consistent with our medium term debt strategy, we will maintain an
adequate deposit buffer in our treasury single account. To the extent a surplus of funds
emerges, we will use it to repurchase outstanding government debt, beginning with non
marketable issues (e.g., the CBI recapitalization bonds).
Strengthening the policy framework
24.
A stronger institutional framework will support the achievement of our program
objectives. To date we have focused on rectifying the key financial sector regulation and
supervision shortcomings that contributed to the crisis. We have also addressed issues with
our fiscal-framework, to support our fiscal consolidation objective. Over the course of the
coming year we plan to identify ways to strengthen our monetary policy framework to better
secure our objective to deliver low and stable inflation, and a stable financial system.
25.

Reforms to banking regulation and supervision are on track:



FME. Following the recent amendments to the banking law, the FME has introduced
organizational reforms to enhance on-site inspection and off-site supervision.
Looking forward, the FME will articulate an action plan to operationalize its registry
of large exposures by end-June 2011; and by December 2011, the number of staff in
the areas of risk assessment, forensic accounting, and information technology will be
brought into line with numbers in peer advanced countries. The FME will also take a
more proactive role in the oversight of financial products, and will require banks to
strengthen their approval policy for new products



Bank resolution procedures and prudential requirements. The recent amendments to
the banking law did not address all framework issues, and in any event the upcoming
Basel capital and liquidity requirements may require further revisions. We intend a
two-part approach to deal with remaining issues. By end-February 2011, we plan to
submit legislation to parliament to tackle the resolution framework for banks, and to
address the respective powers of the FME and CBI to supervise and regulate the
financial system. We remain committed to a new Basel Core Principles assessment in
March 2011. This and any revised EU directives on capital and liquidity requirements
will form the basis for further revisions during the second quarter of 2011.



Deposit insurance and phase out of blanket deposit guarantee. We now expect that
the draft bill of law harmonizing the deposit guarantee regime with the relevant EU
directives will be passed by end-September 2010. The blanket guarantee will remain
in place when the law becomes effective. As the financial system strengthens, we will
gradually phase out this blanket deposit guarantee. To help define a timetable, the
CBI and the FME will jointly prepare a report for the Minister of Economic Affairs
on the resilience of the banking system, and undertake a survey of public confidence

65
and market belief in the strength of financial institutions and prudential regulation and
supervision.
26.

Public financial management reforms are also on track:



Budget framework. We have been implementing the various reforms adopted in mid2009, in particular, the two-stage budget approval process, the creation of an adequate
budget contingency, and limits on and closer scrutiny of carryovers. Looking forward,
the 2011 budget will continue these practices, and establish binding two-year nominal
ceilings, a crucial reform to help guide consolidation efforts. We are also committed
to reduce the earmarking of revenues.



Framework for local governments (a structural benchmark for end-December). We
are on track to propose amendments to the Local Government Act and complete the
reform in time for fiscal year 2011. Two key fiscal rules embedded in the framework
will be: (i) a zero-balance fiscal rule requiring corrective measures if a local
government is in breach; and (ii) a ceiling on the ratio of local government debt and
commitments to tax revenues.

External Financing
27.
Our ability to fully implement the program described above remains dependent
on access to adequate external financing. This financing will help us smoothly manage our
external debt rollover during 2011–12, and contribute to confidence during the gradual
capital account liberalization process. We have already fully drawn on available tranches
from our bilateral partners, and have obtained significant additional resources through the
Avens transaction. We intend to draw remaining amounts of committed financing, as
financing gaps require. Progress in covering our financing need will continue to be assessed
during quarterly program reviews. In the event of any shortfalls, we stand ready to consult
with the Fund on any additional measures that would prove necessary to meet program
objectives (consistent with our undertaking in paragraph 4 above).
28.
We expect to meet the preconditions of some of our bilateral partners to access
bilateral program financing. In particular, we remain committed to finalizing arrangements
for the reimbursement of the governments of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands for
amounts expended to settle retail deposits in the fallen banks. In this regard, we here reiterate
the undertaking contained in our Letter of Intent dated 15 November 2008 and our Letter of
Intent of 7 April 2010, to ensure that the United Kingdom and the Netherlands will be
reimbursed in respect of deposits of Landsbanki branches in those two countries (up to the
Euro 20,887 minimum provided for under Icelandic Law and the EU Deposit Guarantee
Directive 90/19/EC); and will receive the reasonable time value of money, provided that
comprehensive agreements are reached. Discussions on this topic have taken place since the
Second Review (and drafts of the legal documents have been exchanged and discussed).

66
While a number of issues remain outstanding we remain committed to bringing those
arrangements to a close.

ATTACHMENT II. TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Icelandic authorities and
the IMF staff regarding the definitions of quantitative and structural performance criteria, as
well as respective reporting requirements for the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). These
performance criteria and indicative targets are reported in Tables 1 and 2.
2.
The exchange rate for the purposes of the program is set at 113.9 Icelandic króna per
U.S. dollar. The corresponding cross exchange rates are provided in Table 3.
Central Government

Definition: For the purposes of the program, the government includes the central
government, which includes government entities of group “A” as defined in the Government
Financial Reporting Act No.88/1997.
4.
Supporting material: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) will provide to the IMF
detailed information on monthly revenues and expenditures both on a cash and accrual basis,
domestic and foreign debt redemptions, new domestic and foreign debt issuance, change in
the domestic and foreign cash balances of the central government at the central bank of
Iceland, all other sources of financing including capital transactions, and arrears of the
central government. Data will be provided within 30 days.

Criteria: Definitions and Reporting Standards
A. Floor on the Cumulative Net Financial Balance of the Central Government
5.
Definition: The net financial balance of the central government will be measured
from the financing side at current exchange rates, and will be defined after contributions to
the government employee’s pension fund. The net financial balance will be defined as the
negative of the sum of (i) net domestic financing and (ii) net external financing.


Net domestic financing (NDF) is defined as the change in the stock of the net
domestic debt of the central government. Domestic central government debt consists
of ISK-denominated debt financed by the banking system (the Central Bank of
Iceland (CBI) and commercial banks) and non-bank financial institutions to the
central government. It consists of treasury bills, government bonds, promissory notes
and other domestic debt instruments issued by the government, including any interest
arrears, and loans and advances to the central government by the commercial banks,
including any interest arrears. Net domestic central government debt is calculated as
the gross debt plus proceeds from the sale of financial assets (including, but not
limited to, government, government-backed, or other bonds obtained during the
central bank recapitalization process, and as a result of failed securities lending) or

70
proceeds from privatization, minus ISK-denominated government deposits with the
central bank of Iceland and commercial banks. ISK-denominated government
deposits at the central bank of Iceland include the deposits in the treasury current
account, government institution current accounts and other time deposits. Domestic
debt will be valued at the nominal price for T-notes. For T-bonds and other loans,
both of which are indexed, the nominal value of the debt will be adjusted by the
consumer price inflation.


Net external financing is defined as the total of foreign currency denominated
financing disbursed to the central government minus the net accumulation of foreign
currency deposits at the CBI and at commercial banks, plus accrued interest from the
Icesave-related debt, net change in external arrears, minus amortization paid.
Amortization includes all external debt-related payments of principal by the central
government. Disbursements and amortization will be valued at the exchange rate at
the time of the transaction. Net accumulation of foreign currency deposits is defined
as the sum of daily change in the stock of foreign currency deposits at the CBI and at
commercial banks in foreign currency, valued at the current daily exchange rate.
Accrued interest on Icesave-related debt will be calculated based on the average
monthly value of the outstanding stock of Icesave-related debt. The stock of
outstanding Icesave-related debt will be calculated as sum of the outstanding loans
and the accrued interest from the previous period minus the amount paid out from
recovered assets. The stock of Icesave-related debt will be calculated in the currency
of the loan agreements (sterling and euro). Accrued interest will be converted to
krona at the current (monthly average) exchange rate.



Adjustments: For the purposes of the program, the net financial balance will exclude
any debt issuance for the purposes of bank restructuring and central bank
recapitalization. It will; however, include the accrued interest on inflation indexed
debts related to central bank and bank recapitalization. Net domestic financing will
exclude the retro-active accrued interest on the bank capitalization bonds from
October 8, 2008 to October 8, 2009.

Supporting Material:



Data on domestic bank and nonbank financing will be provided to the IMF by the
Central Bank of Iceland and the Financial Management Department of the MoF
within three weeks after the end of the month. This will include data on redemptions
of domestic central government liabilities and data on the cash balances in domestic
currency of the MoF at the Central Bank of Iceland and in commercial banks.



Data on net external financing (disbursement, net change in external arrears and
amortization) as well as other external borrowing will be provided to the IMF
monthly by the Financial Management Unit at the MoF within three weeks of the end

71
of each month. Data on the fx cash balances of the MoF at the Central Bank of
Iceland and in commercial banks will be reported daily.
B. Floor on the Net International Reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland
7.
Definition: Net international reserves (NIR) of the Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) are
defined as the U.S. dollar value of gross foreign assets minus foreign liabilities of the CBI.


Gross foreign assets are defined consistently with SDDS as readily available claims
on nonresidents denominated in foreign convertible currencies. They include the
CBI’s holdings of monetary gold, SDRs, foreign currency cash, foreign currency
securities, deposits abroad, and the country's reserve position at the Fund. Excluded
from reserve assets are any assets that are pledged, collateralized, or otherwise
encumbered, claims on residents, precious metals other than gold, assets in
nonconvertible currencies, and illiquid assets.



Gross foreign liabilities are defined consistently with SDDS as all fx liabilities to
residents and nonresidents, including commitments to sell foreign exchange arising
from derivatives, and all credit outstanding and SDR allocation from the Fund.
Foreign currency deposits and other liabilities of financial institutions (both active
and in the process of winding up) will be included in gross foreign liabilities. General
government fx liabilities at the CBI will not be included in gross foreign liabilities.



For program monitoring purposes, the stock of foreign assets and foreign liabilities
of the CBI shall be valued at program exchange rates as described on paragraph 2
above. The stock of NIR amounted to $634 million as of December 31, 2009 (at the
program exchange rate).

8.

Adjustment mechanism:



The NIR floor will be adjusted downward at the program exchange rate by the
amount of Nordic disbursements relative to the technical assumption below. For
every one dollar of disbursements, the NIR floor for each period will be adjusted
downwards by 0.5 dollars. Nordic disbursements are defined as external
disbursements from Denmark, Finland and Sweden to the Government of Iceland,
and from Norway to the CBI



For each period, the NIR floor will be adjusted up to an amount specified in the table
below. The Figures indicate a cap on the cumulative use of NIR.

Supporting material: Data on net international reserves (both at actual and program
exchange rates) and on net foreign financing (balance of payments support loans; cash grants
to the consolidated government; amortization (excluding repayments to the IMF); interest
payments on external debt by the MoF and the CBI) will be provided to the IMF in a table on
the CBI’s fx flows (which include details of inflows, outflows, and net international reserves)
on a monthly basis within two weeks following the end of the month. Flows of net
international reserves will be provided on a daily basis.
C. Ceiling on Net Domestic Assets
10.
Definition: Net domestic assets of the CBI are defined as the sum of net credit to the
government, net credit to the private sector and other items net.


Net credit to the central government is defined in criteria D.



Net credit to the private sector is defined as the difference between credit to the
private sector and liabilities of the private sector to the CBI. Credit to the private
sector is defined as the sum of CBI lending to banks and other financial institutions
(through its overnight and weekly collateral facilities and any other instruments to
which the CBI would extend credit to the private sector) and other assets. Liabilities
of the private sector to the CBI is defined as the sum of current account balances of
the banks and other financial institutions at the CBI, central bank CDs in issuance and
other liabilities.



Other items net are defined as the sum of capital contributions, revaluation accounts
and retained earnings. Performance against the NDA target will be measured at
program exchange rates.

73
11.
Supporting material: The CBI will provide to the IMF with data on net credit to the
government and net credit to the private sector. Data on central bank lending to banks and
other financial institutions through its overnight and weekly collateral facilities, any other
instruments to which the CBI would extend credit to the private sector, current account
balances of the banks at the CBI, and central bank CDs in issuance, on a daily basis. The CBI
will provide the net domestic assets data based on the monthly balance sheets on the monthly
basis within two weeks following the end of the month.
D. Ceiling on Net Credit of the Central Bank of Iceland to the Central Government
(Indicative Target)
12.
Definition. Net credit of the CBI to the central government is defined as the
difference between CBI lending to the central government and central government deposits at
the CBI in domestic currency.


Deposits of the central government at the CBI in domestic currency include the sum
of deposits in the treasury current account, government institution current accounts
and other time deposits.



Adjustment. For the purpose of the program, the net credit of the CBI to the central
government will exclude any debt issuance for the purposes of recapitalizing the CBI.



Supporting material: The CBI will provide the IMF with data on central bank
lending to the central government and central government deposits at the central
bank, on a daily basis with a lag of no more than 10 days.
E. Ceiling on Contracting or Guaranteeing of New Medium and Long Term External
Debt by Central Government

13.
Definition: The performance criterion covers public and publicly guaranteed external
debt in foreign currency with an original maturity of more than one year. Debt falling within
the limit shall be valued in U.S. dollars at the time the contract or guarantee becomes
effective.
The term “debt” will be understood to mean a liability created under a contractual
arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or
services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will
discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a
number of forms, the primary ones being as follows.


Loans. That is, advances of money to an obligor by the lender made on the basis of
an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits,
bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges

74
of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is
required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral
from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements).


Suppliers’ credits. That is, contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services
are provided.



Leases. That is, arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has
the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter
than the total expected service life of the property, while the leaser retains the title to
the property. For the purpose of the program, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of
the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or
maintenance of the property.



Arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to
make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to
make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g.,
payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.”



Adjustments. (i) Previously contracted debt that has been rescheduled will be
excluded from the definition of “new debt” for the purposes of this performance
criterion; (ii) excluded from the limits are purchases from the IMF Stand-By
Arrangement and bilateral official loans extended and earmarked for payments on
foreign deposit guarantees; (iii) changes in the stock of nonresident holding of
medium and long-term debt in krona will also be excluded from definition of new
debt; and (iv) arrears arising from intervened banks will be excluded.

14.
Supporting material: Details of all new commitments and government guarantees
for external borrowing, with detailed explanations, will be provided by the MoF to the IMF
on a monthly basis within two weeks of the end of each month. Data will be provided using
the actual exchange rates in effect at the time of contract or guarantee.
F. Ceiling on the Stock of Central Government Short-Term External Debt
15.
Definition: The limit on short-term external debt applies on a continuous basis to the
stock of short-term external debt in foreign currency owed or guaranteed by the central
government of Iceland, with an original maturity of up to and including one year. It applies to
debt as defined in paragraph 10 above. Excluded from the limit are any rescheduling
operations (including the deferral of interest on commercial debt) and nonresident holding of
short-term debt in krona. Debt falling within the limit shall be valued in U.S. dollars at the
time the contract or guarantee becomes effective.

75
16.
Ceiling on the accumulation of new external payments arrears on external debt
contracted or guaranteed by central government from multilateral or bilateral official
creditors. This performance criterion applies on a continuous basis. External payment
arrears consist of external debt service obligations (principal and interest) falling due after
October 20, 2008, and that have not been paid at the time due, taking into account the grace
periods specified in contractual agreements. Data will be provided on a monthly basis with a
lag of no more than 20 days.
G.

Reporting Requirement for Financial Institutions in the Winding-up Process

17.
The CBI will provide to the IMF data reports from all financial institutions in the
winding-up process on a quarterly basis. The reports will be in the format according to the
CBI reporting template agreed with the IMF. The required data will allow the CBI and the
IMF to track asset recovery and payout to creditors against their claims for both domestic and
external assets and the cross-border movement of the proceeds.

APPENDIX I. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
External and public debt remains sustainable, with lower levels compared to the
second review, but risks remain (Tables A1–A2; Figures A1–A2).
A. External DSA
2.
A number of assumptions underlying the analysis have been modified, reflecting
new information since the time of the second review (Table A1):


The authorities’ recent eurobond buy-back and the Avens transactions have reduced
public external debt by about 6 percent of GDP in 2010.



The payment of assets by Resolution Committees (RCs) of old banks is now expected to
be in 2012 instead of 2011 due to the anticipated delay in clearing legal challenges.



A new asset recovery path for Landsbanki has been taken into account. The main change
is a more front-loaded nature of the recovery.

3.
Under the program macroeconomic baseline, external debt is projected to have
peaked at about 300 percent of GDP in 2009 and to fall slowly to around 190 percent of
GDP by 2015 (Table A1; Figure A1). Key factors driving the decline include payout from
asset recovery, deleveraging by Icelandic companies, and growth and current account
dynamics. Indeed, by the end of the period, Iceland’s non-interest current account balance
(12 percent of GDP) is well above the debt-stabilizing level (-1 percent of GDP), suggesting
that external debt reductions will continue further in the medium-term.
4.
Stress tests suggest that the downward trajectory is a robust result, provided the
program is implemented. Standard shocks would slow, but do not stop the downward
trajectory. External debt would sharply increase with exchange rate depreciation: a
permanent depreciation of 30 percent would drive up external debt as a percent of GDP to a
much higher level, although the downward trajectory would still be expected to resume. Only
the historical scenario leads to negative debt dynamics, but is not thought likely. The collapse
of the banking sector was a permanent shock, and the events of the 2003–07 boom are
unlikely to be repeated any time soon.
B. Public Debt Sustainability
5.
New information since the time of the second review led to changes in several
assumptions:


The adjustment path for the general government primary balance (excluding interest
revenues) reflects a 4½ percent of GDP improvement in 2010, and a 3½ percent of GDP

77
improvement in 2011. The primary balance stabilizes at 6 percent of GDP in 2014 instead
of reaching 6¾ percent of GDP as in the second review.


The Icesave assessment has been updated. Recovery is now expected to be more
frontloaded, with nearly 60 percent of assets recovered by end-2011. With payouts
commencing in 2011, despite higher accrued interest, the total residual public obligation
is estimated to be about 16 percent of 2015 GDP.



Eurobond repurchases of about 5 ¾ percent of GDP in 2010.



HFF recapitalization of 3 percent of GDP in 2010.

6.
Under these assumptions, the 2010 gross public debt to GDP ratio is about
5 percent lower compared to the second review. Public debt will peak due to the
disbursement of bilateral loans and stand at 115 percent at end-2010.
7.
Under the program baseline scenario, Iceland’s public debt declines steadily
over the medium term (Table A2, Figure A2). The downward path continues to be driven
by the consolidation plan and the gradual improvement of the real interest rate/GDP growth
differential. By end-period, the actual primary balance would exceed the debt-stabilizing
level, with debt reduction continuing beyond the projection period.
8.
The downward debt trajectory is robust to shocks, provided the program is
implemented (Figure A2). Debt remains on the downward trajectory under all standard
shocks. The unchanged primary balance scenario is the exception: it would imply a reversal
of the adjustment path and a quick deterioration in the debt position.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (GDP deflator).
3/ Projections also reflect the impact of price and exchange rate changes, inflows of extraordinary financing (and Fund repurchases).
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year. This estimate excludes old bank-related asset recovery in 2014, and large one-off projected liquidation of assets abroad, to service lumpy debt payment.
7/ Historical debt and interest data exclude old bank data (based on staff and Central Bank estimates).

1/ General government gross debt (including bilateral loans to the central government to support central bank reserves; excludes IMF loans).
Also includes the estimated impact of the guarantee on UK/Dutch IceSave loans, net of asset recovery. It estimates, under given assumptions for asset recovery and on a cash flow basis,
the residual obligation for the government and growth thereof due to accruing interest.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ Reflects the estimated "net present value" of the guarantee on UK/Dutch IceSave loans, after asset recovery.
6/ Includes capitalization of new banks, savings banks, and bilateral loans to support CBI reserves.
7/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes. In 2009-11, the residual also reflects use of deposits at the central bank and sale of financial assets obtained during the financial crisis.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Safeguards Assessment: The 2009 assessment concluded that the CBI's overall
control environment was broadly appropriate for a small central bank, with good
controls in the accounting and financial reporting area. The CBI's external and
internal audit procedures practices were not found to be in line with international
practices, however, and the foreign reserves management area would benefit from
development. The authorities have already taken steps to implement safeguard
recommendations, notably by appointing an international audit firm under the
auspices of the Auditor General to conduct annual external audits of the CBI in

83
line with international standards, starting with financial year 2009. Internal audit
was also outsourced. Work on other recommendations, such as the reserves
management guidelines, is in progress.

Discussions for the 2010 Article IV Consultation were held in Reykjavik during
June 14–28, 2010 and July 19–22, 2010. The mission met with Prime Minister
Sigurðardóttir, Finance Minister Sigfússon, Economic Affairs Minister
Magnússon, Central Bank Governor Guðmundsson, and other senior officials, as
well as parliamentarians, CEOs of the new banks and Icelandic corporations, the
employers federation and labor unions, representatives of creditors, and
academics. The staff team comprised M. Flanagan (head), C. Fernández and W.
Maliszewski (EUR); I. Petrova (FAD); L. Cortavarria (MCM); M. Chivakul

APPENDIX III. ICELAND: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes. Iceland subscribed to the
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in 1996, and is in observance of the SDDS
specifications for coverage, periodicity, and timeliness, but uses a flexibility option on the
timeliness and periodicity for the production index and the producer price index (PPI). The
Statistics Department (STA) prepared a data module of the Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (data ROSC) that was published on November 22, 2005.
Data on a wide range of economic and financial variables are provided to the Fund in a
timely manner during and between consultations. In addition to periodic press releases,
statistical information is disseminated to the public through a range of monthly, quarterly,
and annual publications by three main institutions (The Central Bank of Iceland (CBI), the
Ministry of Finance, and Statistics Iceland), and is increasingly available on their internet
sites. Provision of electronic data in English has improved substantially in recent years,
especially, from Statistics Iceland.
As regards the national accounts data, the authorities shifted to ESA95 in August 2000 and
revised the corresponding time series back to 1990. Another revision was carried out in 2002.
A breakdown is disseminated by industry back to the beginning of the production approach
in 1973. Data on GNP and national income, in current and constant prices, as well as data on
net savings for the economy as a whole, are also disseminated. The quarterly data are
seasonally adjusted.
The authorities publish Treasury returns on a monthly basis, and quarterly and annual data on
the general government balance. Iceland reports government finance statistics in accordance
with the GFSM 2001 framework in the GFS Yearbook, and is an up-to-date contributor to the
International Financial Statistics (IFS). Balance of payments data deviate from the IMF’s
Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5) in certain respects. In particular, the CBI
follows the methodology applied by the European Central Bank (ECB) for the calculation of
income payable by collective investment institutions (e.g., mutual funds). Unlike the BPM5,
the ECB’s methodology includes portfolio investors’ shares of retained earnings in the
balance of payments statement. Some other departures are: a) income on external debt is
compiled on a due-for-payment basis, including between affiliated enterprises; b) debt
between affiliated banks is not identified; c) banking sector loans are not classified separately
from currency and deposits; d) in the international investment position, foreign direct
investments are valued at book value; e) external debt is valued at face value; f) financial
derivatives held by banks are not available as on-balance sheet items; and, g) domestic
currency deposits held with banks by nonbank nonresidents are not recorded as part of
external debt.

85
On monetary and financial statistics, the concepts and definitions broadly conform to the
guidelines of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Departing from the
MFSM, monetary aggregates include deposits of the foreign sector and the central
government; and the currency-linked and indexed bonds held by nonresidents are classified
as domestic instead of foreign liabilities. Classification and sectorization are mostly in line
with the MFSM, except that, in the accounts of other depository corporations (that is,
commercial and savings banks), financial derivatives are off balance sheet and positions of
nonfinancial public corporations are included in the government accounts but cannot be
identified; and, in the accounts of the CBI, fixed assets are off balance sheet. Several banks
do not report at market value loans net of provisions and securities for investment.

Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation and Third Review Under the
Stand-By Arrangement and Request for Modification of Performance Criteria
Supplementary Information
Prepared by European Department
Approved by Poul M. Thomsen and James Roaf
September 24, 2010
This supplement provides an update on developments and their implications for the
program since the issuance of the Staff report. These developments have helped to reduce
policy related risks in several areas, although they do not alter the thrust of the Staff
Appraisal.
Financial sector developments
The legal risks overhanging Iceland’s financial sector have materially receded. On
September 16, the Supreme Court delivered a new ruling relevant for foreign exchange
indexed loan contracts, clarifying that loans ruled to be illegal should be recalculated
using krona interest rates (rather than by using the interest rate in the original contract).
Under this outcome, the recapitalization needed to return banks to the prescribed
16 percent CAR would amount to at most 3 percent of GDP. Private shareholders would
be expected to cover about half of this. The actual recapitalization need will likely be
lower, depending on how the line is drawn between legal and illegal foreign exchange
linked loans. To put an end to the uncertainty, the authorities are presently pursuing a
voluntary framework with banks (which would see conversion of certain foreign currency
loans into krona denominated loans).
External financing developments
The external financing outlook has improved notably:


September 17 saw the first bond issuance in international markets by an Icelandic
public or public-guaranteed entity since the financial crisis in 2008. Iceland’s
National Power Company (Landsvirkjun) secured the sale of USD 100 million of a
USD-denominated 5-year note to foreign investors at a 6½ percent coupon (slightly

2
below the program’s interest rate baseline). This transaction that signals significantly
lower Landsvirkjun’s refinancing risk going forward.


The CBI is set to realize substantial proceeds from the just-concluded sale of FIH
Erhvervesbank (the CBI acquired the shares of this Danish former subsidiary of
Kaupthing by dint of collateralized lending in the pre-crisis period). The payment
consists of an upfront cash payment of $300 million and an earn-out agreement of up
to $530 million to be paid in early 2015. While the upfront cash payment is lower
than the staff’s baseline assumption, the expected 2015 payment is considerably
higher, and the total medium-term benefit to reserves would be in the order of
$300 million.

In addition, there has been progress towards resolving the Icesave dispute. The
Icelandic authorities have informed staff that they, the United Kingdom and the
Netherlands have made significant progress in recent weeks towards reaching agreement
on terms for reimbursing the United Kingdom and Netherlands for amounts used to cover
retail deposits, up to the EU limit at the time, in the “Icesave” branches of an Icelandic
bank. The likelihood of continued legal proceedings in this case has now diminished,
while the likelihood has risen for a negotiated settlement at an earlier-than-anticipated
juncture. This would pave the way for early access to remaining bilateral financing.
Monetary policy developments
The central bank of Iceland has further cut interest rates, bringing the rate corridor
down by 75 basis points. Continuing positive developments on the inflation front and
stability of the krona underlie the decision. The CBI also noted that with financial
stability risks diminishing, gradual capital control liberalization could be put back on the
near-term agenda, and this would have implications for monetary policy going forward.
This placed some upward pressure on medium and long term bond yields, underscoring
the need for the gradualism embedded in the agreed liberalization approach.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 4, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Iceland
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today concluded the 2010
Article IV consultation with Iceland. 1
Background
The seeds of Iceland’s 2008 financial crisis were sown during a prior boom of exceptional
magnitude. Easy access to foreign credit fueled rapid growth of domestic demand that swelled
the current account deficit and drove up asset prices. Over time, Iceland’s gross external debt
rose above 600 percent of GDP, while households and corporations accumulated heavy debt
burdens with large exposures to foreign exchange and inflation risk. Moreover, short term
obligations soared, while the growth of the central bank’s international reserves lagged.
The global banking crisis exposed Iceland’s vulnerabilities, triggering a balance of payments
crisis, a collapse of the exchange rate and output, and the failure of financial and many nonfinancial firms. The cost partly fell on the public sector, which had to finance bank
recapitalization, crisis-related central bank losses and recession-induced fiscal deficits. The
pressure on the public sector balance sheet drove Iceland’s interest rate spreads sharply
higher, underscoring the risk of a debt crisis.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

The Icelandic authorities put together an economic recovery plan supported by financing from
the Fund, Nordics and Poland. The program included: (i) measures to stabilize the exchange
rate to contain balance sheet pressures; (ii) the initial operation of automatic fiscal stabilizers
to cushion the economic collapse; (iii) a significant medium-term fiscal adjustment to bring debt
dynamics under control; (iv) a blanket deposit guarantee, still in place, to preserve financial
stability while new banks were being set up from the shells of the collapsed old banks; (v) the
establishment of frameworks to facilitate household and corporate debt restructuring; and (vi)
structural reforms to strengthen bank supervision and regulation and improve budget planning
and debt management.
Under the recovery program, Iceland’s recession has been shallower than expected, and no
worse than in less hard-hit countries. At the same time, the krona has stabilized at a
competitive level, inflation has come down from 18 to under 5 percent, and CDS spreads have
dropped from around 1000 to about 300 basis points. Current account deficits have unwound,
and international reserves have been built up, while private sector bankruptcies have led to a
marked decline in external debt, to around 300 percent of GDP. The outlook is for an
investment-led recovery to begin during the second half of 2010, and for growth of about 3
percent in 2011.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for their strong and determined program implementation
and readiness to adapt policies as warranted. This helped Iceland overcome a deep financial
and economic crisis. Growth is expected to begin to rebound, although uncertainties remain,
including from the global outlook and the private debt overhang. To better secure the ongoing
recovery, Directors encouraged the authorities to develop a strategy to unlock investment and
to reach consensus with social partners on wage settlements. Continued steadfast
implementation of the program will be crucial.
Directors emphasized that it is important to maintain the momentum towards restoration of the
financial system. They welcomed the authorities’ framework to secure bank capital in the face
of legal uncertainty about banks’ foreign exchange linked loans. Directors observed that the
Supreme Court’s most recent ruling has substantially lessened risks to the system and
recommended that the authorities take the necessary steps to ensure that banks meet capital
requirements within the expected timeframe.
Directors stressed the importance of accelerating the restructuring of banks’ operations and
balance sheets. They recognized recent steps to improve the frameworks for household and
corporate debt restructuring, which would help support the economy. Directors underscored
the need to expedite implementation of the framework and improve incentives for debtors to
use it by limiting expectations of further debt relief.

Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to further fiscal adjustment in 2011. They
emphasized the need to reach the targeted primary surplus, and to build consensus for
measures taken. Directors observed that, subject to careful evaluation, there might be scope
to moderately scale back the targeted adjustment if financial sector contingent liabilities prove
contained and the government continues to resist absorbing private sector losses.
Directors welcomed the downward trend in inflation, supported by a stronger exchange rate
and the central bank’s careful execution of monetary policy. They noted that the mild
undervaluation of the real exchange rate would support continuation of the underlying current
account surplus.
Directors considered that it is critical for Iceland to build up its international reserves. They
welcomed the central bank’s purchases of foreign exchange and highlighted the need to build
reserves as market conditions and balance of payment developments permit. Welcoming
recent progress, Directors supported continued efforts towards an early normalization with
international creditors, including towards finalization of negotiations regarding Icesave
deposits, which would unlock bilateral program financing and ease Iceland’s reintegration into
global markets.
Directors noted that preconditions for capital account liberalization are falling into place,
including stronger reserves and more secure public finances. They agreed that capital controls
should be maintained until the stability of the financial system has been secured.
Directors noted the importance of strengthening policy frameworks. They welcomed the
measures taken to improve budget planning and implementation as well as the new legislation
to strengthen bank regulation and supervision. Directors encouraged the authorities to press
ahead with reform of the local government fiscal framework, and with implementation of
supervisory reforms.

IMF Completes Third Review Under Stand-By Arrangement for Iceland,
Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the third
review of Iceland’s economic performance under a program supported by a Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA).
The completion of this review enables the immediate disbursement of an amount equivalent
to SDR 105 million, which would bring total disbursements under the program to an amount
equivalent to SDR 875 million (about € 997.9 million or US$ 1.36 billion).
The 33-month SBA was approved on November 19, 2008 (see Press Release No. 08/296) for
an amount equivalent to SDR 1.4 billion (about US$2.17 billion) and was subsequently
extended to August 31, 2011 (see Press release No 10/156). The arrangement entails
exceptional access to IMF resources, amounting to 1,190 percent of Iceland’s quota.
A Public Information Notice on the Executive Director’s assessment of the 2010 Article IV
consultation with Iceland will be released separately.
Following the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director
and Chair, stated:
“Iceland has made impressive progress under its Fund-supported program, reflecting the
authorities’ strong policy implementation and readiness to adapt policies when warranted.
While the economy still faces headwinds, a rebound in growth is on the horizon, with the
mildly undervalued krona and planned investment projects lending support to economic
activity. The downward trend in inflation should continue, supported by the stable krona.
“The authorities have made progress towards restoring the financial system. Recent legal
uncertainty about banks’ foreign exchange linked loans and their capital has diminished, and
a framework is in place to ensure that capital requirements will be met. The revised

2
framework for household and corporate debt restructuring will be helpful and the relief this
provides to borrowers should support the economy.
“There has been considerable progress towards consolidating the fiscal position. The 2011
budget marks a milestone, with the general government projected to return to a primary
surplus. Given the robust projected public debt dynamics, there may be scope in future to
moderately scale back the targeted adjustment if financial sector contingent liabilities prove
contained.
“Rebuilding Iceland’s international reserves is a priority. This will pave the way for capital
account liberalization and the country’s reintegration into global financial markets. The
careful monetary policy strategy adopted by the central bank, including the newly introduced
foreign exchange purchase auctions, is delivering results and should be continued.
“In the medium term, strengthening Iceland’s policy framework will be critical. The
authorities have improved budget planning and execution significantly and have legislated a
stronger framework for bank regulation and supervision. Important steps ahead include
reform of the local government fiscal framework and implementation of the financial sector
supervisory reforms.”

Statement by Per Callesen, Executive Director for Iceland
and Lilja Alfredsdottir, Advisor to Executive Director
September 29, 2010
Significant progress has been made in Iceland to combat the effects of the collapse of the
Icelandic financial sector that took place exactly two years ago this week. Economic activity
has stabilized and growth is expected to resume in the second half of 2010. Inflation continues
on a downward path and the outlook for a positive balance of payments is favorable.
However, numerous challenges remain after a financial crisis that has affected almost every
sector of the economy. My authorities broadly agree with staff assessment and wish to thank
the Fund and its staff, in particular Mr. Mark Flanagan, for their excellent work in Iceland.
The Fund program has helped to restore confidence and focus our responses to the crisis.
Policy implementation is broadly on track, and has met all end-May criteria and the end-June
structural benchmark concerning legislation to strengthen the framework for household debt
restructuring. The recapitalization of some weak banks, a structural benchmark for end-May
that was delayed, can now go ahead after the September Supreme Court ruling.
My authorities are fully committed to going forward with the program with a continued
emphasis on i) further restoration of the financial system where a significant element of
uncertainty has now been removed after the September Supreme Court ruling on foreign
exchange-indexed loans, ii) maintaining exchange rate stability, and containing inflation, iii)
corporate and household debt restructuring, iv) taking steps towards capital account
liberalization, v) securing public debt sustainability and vi) normalizing relations with
international creditors and reviving market confidence in Iceland.
Since the second review, some progress has been made in negotiations with the authorities of
the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The Icelandic authorities will continue to negotiate
in good faith to conclude an agreement on the Icesave issue. My authorities have also sought
to maintain a constructive dialogue with the creditors of the intervened private banks in
accordance with best international practice.
The Supreme Court Ruling
The Supreme Court ruled on September 16th that the lowest interest rates on new nonindexed loans at credit institutions as published by the Central Bank should prevail in the case
of illegal foreign exchange indexation clauses in loan contracts. The ruling alleviates
substantially the uncertainty resulting from the Supreme Court’s June ruling on the illegality
of foreign exchange indexation. If the Supreme Court rulings are confined to consumer loans,
the cost to the banking sector is expected to be contained with no need for additional capital
injection from the Treasury or other shareholders. Even if corporate loans are found to be
illegally indexed to foreign currencies, the possible additional capital injection required into
the banks remains limited, and far below levels that had been feared if the foreign contractual
interest rates had been imposed. The government is now committed to clarifying the legal
sphere in light of the verdicts, easing the settlement of claims and thus speeding up debt
restructuring, which might otherwise fall victim to longwinded court proceedings. This will
be done in cooperation with the financial institutions. Increased clarity will also support the
financial restructuring of the savings banks system. The Icelandic State Financial Investments
fund will be responsible for the government’s stake in these relatively small, but not
insignificant, institutions.

2

The outlook
Growth in 2009 contracted less than expected. While the first half of 2010 was sluggish,
partly due to a volcanic eruption that affected tourism, growth in the second half should be
more supportive and a positive growth is expected in the first half of 2011. Unemployment,
which before the crisis was almost non-existent, stood at 8.7 percent in mid-2010. This level
of unemployment is uncharacteristic for the Icelandic society where participation rates have
traditionally been very high. The government has introduced several measures to stimulate
small enterprise start up and retraining of labor. Lower unemployment levels should be
registered when growth resumes next year.
Risks to the outlook are further deleveraging and contraction of demand, if growth in the main
export markets weakens. The depreciation of the exchange rate has made the export sector
more competitive and exports have been robust as reflected in the trade figures. However,
supply constraints that are present in the main export industries, fisheries and primary
aluminum production, hinder volume expansion. Despite the firm management of fishing
stocks, potential in the fisheries sector is far from being exhausted. Higher profits and prices
have been obtained e.g. by increasing processing for human consumption and direct exports to
end users. In general, private sector investment will be a key element in promoting growth
and for that purpose my authorities will implement policies to provide an environment that
encourages investment, in particular foreign direct investment, with due regard for the
environmental impact.
Fiscal policy
Execution of the 2010 budget is advancing well, with both expenditures and revenues on
target during the first half of the year. The authorities are confident that this will bode well for
the 2011 budget, which will be presented to parliament on 1 October. The budget is expected
to be passed in December. The passing of the budget will mark an important step in Iceland’s
path towards recovery as general government finances will be returned to a primary surplus of
around half a percent of GDP as a result of the 3.25 percent primary adjustment subscribed in
the bill. The improvement is more than four percent of GDP over the 2009 figures. All
revenues exceeding targets in 2010 will be saved. The medium-term fiscal path will be set on
a firmer footing at the same time as the budget will include 2-year nominal ceilings that will
guide policy through 2012 in line with the planned medium-term consolidation plan which
aims at a primary balance of six percent after 2012. My authorities are fully committed to a
consolidation path that remains in line with the ambitious consolidation programs in the Nordic
countries in the early nineties.

Gross general public debt is expected to peak at around 120 percent of GDP this year with
gross-external debt reaching 280 percent of GDP. The net international position, however,
amounted to -30 percent of GDP in March 2010. The debt situation is actively being
addressed, including measures such as the purchase of a Netherlands-based holding company
and its assets and through buyback operations of Eurobonds, at discount, from the market.
Staff points out that debt dynamics are favorable under the program design and could tolerate
moderate reductions in the medium-term fiscal target. Also staff’s debt sustainability analysis
indicates that external and public debt levels remain sustainable with lower levels registered
compared to the second review. Under a plausible scenario, external debt peaked at 300
percent of GDP in 2009, falling to 190 percent of GDP in 2015. To achieve debt targets, my
authorities are committed to continue to contain financial sector contingent liabilities and
limit the absorption of further private sector losses. A large part of Iceland’s external
liabilities are a legacy of the activities of multinational corporations with operations mainly in

3

other countries. Recently one such company was acquired by a German bank, resulting in a
significant lowering of external debt.
Monetary policy
The Central Bank has continued to lower interest rates, keeping a close eye on inflation
expectations and the exchange rate of the króna. In August the policy rate was lowered by 100
bp and again on 22 September when the Monetary Policy Committee decided to lower the
Central Bank’s interest rates by 75 bp. The policy rate (the seven-day collateralized lending
rate) is now 6.25 percent while the deposit rate (current account rate) is 4.75%. This rate has
in effect become the reference rate for bank lending. In a statement following its interest rate
decision, the Monetary Policy Committee noted that the capital controls, developments in
terms of trade and other factors affecting the current account balance, and the monetary policy
stance relative to trading partner countries all continue to support the exchange rate. The
Committee underlined that it stands ready to adjust the monetary stance as required to achieve
its interim objective of exchange rate stability and ensure that inflation is close to target over
the medium term.
The exchange rate has continued to strengthen, amounting to close to 17 percent against the
euro from the beginning of the year. At the same time the five year CDS spread for Iceland
has dropped from 412 basis points to around 300 basis points. The Central Bank has started to
purchase foreign exchange on a regular basis for the purpose of reserve accumulation. This
operation does not signal any preferred level for the króna. Initial purchases have been small
but additional purchases, preferably via auctions, will be undertaken in the case of large
irregular inflows into the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange reserves will be further
strengthened following the completion of the sale of the Danish FIH Erhvervsbank A/S to a
consortium of four foreign companies on 18 September. When the transaction is complete, the
Central Bank will receive a substantial amount of foreign currency, and will also have the
possibility over the medium-term to recover the rest of a 500 million euro loan granted against
share collateral in October 2008 to one of the failed Icelandic banks.
Capital account restrictions were imposed in late 2008 to stabilize the currency and contain
damaging capital outflows. Enforcement of the controls has become gradually stricter
reflected inter alia in the current account and stronger króna. However, ways to circumvent
the controls will be found as time goes on and my authorities will continue to lift the controls
gradually as soon as conditions permit. The next step would follow conclusion of the third
review with lifting of some restrictions related to long term assets.
Inflation has been faling this year and should be well below five percent at year-end, closing
on the inflation target soon thereafter. A reasonable outcome of labour market negotiations
that are shcedule to take place later this year, will be crucial to anchor inflation expectations
and secure more permanent stability of prices and income.
The policy framework
Reforms on banking regulation and financial supervision are on schedule. Among these are
organizational reforms of the FME inter alia to enhance on-site inspection and off-site
supervision; bank resolution procedures and prudential requirements inter alia to adjust in
2011 to new Basel capital and liquidity requirements and relevant EU directives; and passing
this autumn of a draft bill harmonizing the deposit guarantee regime with EU Directives.

4

Public financial management reforms include a two-stage budget approval process and the
2011 budget will establish a binding two-year nominal ceiling. Amendments to the Local
Government Act include two fiscal rules, namely a zero-balance rule requiring corrective
measures if a local government is in breach, and a ceiling on the ratio of local government
debt and commitments to tax revenues.
External Financing
While access to external financing will not be essential for meeting the debt roll over coming
due in 2011 and 2012, it will be fundamental for building up the necessary confidence and
will support the preparation of the release of the capital controls. In the event of any
shortfalls, we stand ready to consult with the Fund to implement necessary measures to meet
program objectives. My authorities will meet the preconditions of some of our bilateral
partners to access bilateral program financing. In this regard my authorities reiterate the
undertaking contained in their previous and current Letters of Intent to ensure that the United
Kingdom and the Netherlands will be reimbursed in respect of deposits of Landsbanki
branches in those two countries provided that comprehensive agreements are reached. The
Icesave issue has been complicating the recovery for too long and a successful resolution is an
important step to regain confidence in the Icelandic economy.
