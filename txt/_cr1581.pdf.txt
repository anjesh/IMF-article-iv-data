STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
Elections: The candidate of the ruling coalition Frente Amplio, former president Tabaré Vazquez,
won the presidency and will take office in March 2015. With Frente Amplio retaining majority in
both houses of Parliament, broad continuity in macroeconomic policy making is expected.
Focus: Amid moderating but still solid growth, the 2014 consultation focused on four broad
themes: confronting inflation, reinforcing fiscal sustainability, safeguarding financial stability, and
bolstering strong and inclusive growth for the medium run.
Main Policy Advice:



A comprehensive disinflation strategy is needed to bring inflation to the mid-point of the
target range. This would include maintaining a tight monetary policy stance, moving towards
tighter fiscal policy, reducing the extent of backward-looking indexation of wages, wellcrafted central bank communication on the direction of monetary policy, and enhanced
central bank autonomy. The present conjuncture provides an unusually good opportunity to
achieve a paradigm shift in expectations.



Fiscal sustainability would be reinforced by raising the primary balance by 2 percent of GDP
over the medium term to ensure a downward trend in net public debt.



Banks’ exposures to exchange rate depreciation risks bear continued close monitoring. It
would be useful to strengthen risk weights for foreign currency loans to unhedged borrowers
and incorporate greater exchange rate stress into the supervisory stress tests.



Uruguay’s medium-term growth would benefit additionally from heightened efforts to boost
infrastructure, strengthen education outcomes, and foster an innovation-friendly business
environment.

Past advice: In recent Article IV consultations, there has been broad agreement between the
authorities and Fund staff on the macroeconomic policy objectives. Views have differed on the
appropriate stance of fiscal policy, with staff favoring a tighter stance. The tightening in the
monetary policy stance since mid-2013 has been in line with staff advice. The authorities have
taken several steps to reduce the fiscal risks stemming from the impact of recurrent droughts on
the balances of the state-owned electricity company, including by boosting investment in wind
power, creating an energy stabilization fund, and purchasing weather related insurance. The
authorities continue to make steady progress in implementing the 2012 FSAP recommendations
to further strengthen financial regulation and supervision, and improve access to finance.

CONTEXT
1.
Uruguay’s economy performed strongly over the last decade and has so far weathered
the regional slowdown quite well. Buoyant FDI inflows since 2005 have contributed to strong
growth in productivity and real incomes. Per capita income has risen by 75 percent following the
2002 crisis, while poverty and inequality have declined to historic lows (Box 1). The public sector
balance sheet has been fortified substantially, with net public debt at less than half its post-crisis
peak and the average maturity of central government debt among the longest in the world.
Investments in renewable energy have started reducing the country’s dependence on oil imports
and the volatility of the public sector balance. Uruguay’s economy is now cooling off in the context
of a regional slowdown, but has achieved a robust pace of growth through 2014.

2.
Entrenching strong growth in the medium term will require taking policy actions to
reinforce macroeconomic stability as well as accelerating supply-enhancing reforms. Robust
growth in recent years has been accompanied by above target inflation and a marked decline in the
primary fiscal balance. Although near term risks seem manageable given Uruguay’s strong liquidity
cushions, the uncertain external environment calls for continued prudence in macroeconomic
management. The aftermath of the elections is an auspicious time to take forward a policy agenda
to consolidate macroeconomic stability, strengthen institutions, and accelerate supply-side reforms.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
The economy is decelerating gradually (Figure 1). Real GDP growth is estimated to have
declined to around 3¼ percent in 2014 from 4½ percent in 2013. Private consumption growth has
geared down from its torrid pace in 2010–11 but has remained robust. Private investment is
moderating from record high levels. Although commodity exports were solid in 2014, the growth of
overall export receipts has slowed down markedly from a few years ago. Weak economic conditions
in Argentina, in particular, have continued to weigh on Uruguay’s external services balance and
current account (Figure 2).

The surge in nonresident purchases of local
securities has abated and the Uruguayan peso has
depreciated towards levels consistent with fundamentals.
The peso has weakened by about 30 percent against the U.S.
dollar and 7 percent in real effective terms since the Fed’s
May 2013 tapering announcement, broadly in line with the
trends in the region. Noting the reversal of appreciation
pressures, the authorities eased the reserve requirements on
nonresident purchases of public debt securities in September
2014. They also intervened in the foreign exchange market,
selling about US$500 million in forward contracts in the
second half of 2014. International reserves remain
comfortably above norms and the exchange rate slightly on
the strong side of fundamentals (0–5 percent, Annex I).

Inflation remains above the central bank’s 3–7 percent target range (Figure 1). After
being pushed to near 10 percent in early 2014 by food price shocks and the pass-through of peso
depreciation, consumer price (CPI) inflation eased to 8¼ percent at the end of the year. The easing
in inflation was due to one-off measures and subdued

The one-off measures in force since March 2014, estimated to subtract about ½ percentage point from the CPI for
a temporary period, include reduced VAT on fruits, vegetables, and energy and telephone tariffs, a subsidy on health
care contributions, and lower lottery prices. Core CPI excludes these effects.

Monetary policy has been tight while fiscal policy has been slightly expansionary in
2014 (Figure 3).


Since the introduction of money growth targets in July
2013, the growth rate of M1 plus savings deposits
(M1+) has declined from around 14 percent in the
previous year to about 7 percent in 2014Q3 and the
peso yield curve has hovered 400–500 basis points
above its level prior to July 2013. Reflecting the
monetary policy tightening as well as cooling demand,
a slowdown now appears to be taking hold for both
peso and FX loans.

Current fiscal spending has continued to grow faster
than real GDP in 2014, implying an expansionary fiscal
policy stance. The budget approved for 2015 will keep
central government discretionary spending constant in
nominal terms—in line with a convention for postelection years. This, together with a moderation of
investment by public enterprises and a strengthening
of their operating balances, will improve the public
sector primary balance by ¾ percentage point of GDP.

Banks continue to account for the bulk of financial intermediation, and report
adequate capital levels and ample liquidity (Table 1).2 Bank resilience indicators are generally
strong, with non-performing loans (NPLs) at less than 2 percent of total loans, total loan-loss
provisions on average three times larger than NPLs, and net foreign exchange positions below
1 percent of capital. Nonetheless, a few indicators of soundness are less strong than they were a few
years ago (Figure 4). In particular, foreign currency credit to borrowers in the nontradables sector
has increased as a share of total credit, banks’ capital buffers have declined somewhat, and the
share of NPLs has inched up in 2014. Bank profitability remains subdued given high deposit
dollarization and high U.S. dollar liquidity, low interest rates on U.S. dollar assets, and high operating
costs.3

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
The sharp decline in oil prices will start having a significant effect on Uruguay’s
economy in 2015. The drop in global crude oil prices is expected to lower Uruguay’s oil import bill
by almost 1½ percentage points of GDP in 2015, and to reduce the current account deficit despite
the projected slowdown in export earnings. However, the pass through of lower crude oil prices to
end-user prices is expected to be gradual, as part of the windfall will initially be absorbed by the
state-owned petroleum company to shore up its operating balance.
9.
The deceleration in activity is expected to continue in the near term. GDP growth is
projected to soften to around 2¾ percent in 2015. The programmed slowdown in fiscal spending
and continued weak external conditions—including lower export prices for soy and grains—are
projected to outweigh the positive impact of lower gasoline prices on private consumption and the
ramping up of exports by the recently completed Montes del Plata pulp mill.4
10.
In the medium term, growth is projected to return to the potential rate of 3–
3½ percent as external demand growth recovers and private investment growth picks up. The
downward revision to medium-term growth—from the 4 percent projected one year ago—reflects
significant downward revisions to growth prospects in key trading partners. CPI inflation is projected
to decline gradually to within the target range as monetary policy remains tight, the output gap
closes, and lower oil prices are gradually passed through to retail prices. Net public debt is projected
to crawl up to 43 percent of GDP by 2019 from 36½ percent in 2013 with the primary balance
remaining below the debt-stabilizing level.
11.

There are risks stemming from external and domestic factors (detailed in the RAM).



The immediate region. Uruguay’s economic linkages with the immediate region have lessened
in some respects but remain relevant (Annex II). Subpar performance in Argentina and Brazil has
already lowered Uruguay’s growth, and poses further near- and medium-term risks.5



The global economy. Being a small and open economy that mostly exports agricultural
commodities, imports all its oil, and has nonresidents holding a high share of its public debt,
Uruguay would not be immune to further changes in global commodity prices or global financial
conditions.6

4

The Montes del Plata pulp mill started production in June 2014. Its exports are estimated at US$300 million in 2014
and are expected to increase to US$700 million in 2015 (close to 1½ percent of GDP).
5

A one percentage point drop in Argentina’s GDP growth is estimated to reduce Uruguay’s GDP growth by slightly
more than ½ percentage point; the impact could be lower now given diminished economic linkages. Growth shocks
in Brazil have typically had a muted effect on Uruguay. See Annex I in the 2013 Article IV Staff Report, “Is the
Uruguayan Economy Decoupling from its Neighbors? An Analysis of Inwards Spillovers to Uruguay”.

The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s
outlook but saw more limited downside risks. They
felt that the decoupling of Uruguay’s economic
performance from economic developments in Argentina
and Brazil has been self evident in recent years, and that
the reduced trade and tourism linkages especially with
Argentina would imply lower negative spillovers than in
the past. They stressed that a slowdown in China would
hurt Uruguay less than other regional commodity
exporters as agricultural commodity prices would be
unlikely to fall as much as those for oil or metals. Finally,
they emphasized that the public sector’s strong liquidity
buffers and the flexible exchange rate would help buffer
Uruguay’s economy against adverse shocks.

POLICY ISSUES
A. Confronting Inflation
13.
Confronting inflation remains a priority. Inflation taxes low income households and
presents an obstacle for financial de-dollarization. Inflation persisting above the target range also
creates the risk of unhinging inflation expectations and prevents the use of monetary policy as a
countercyclical tool.
14.
Bringing CPI inflation to the mid-point of the target range requires a comprehensive
disinflation effort. The recent decline in oil prices will create an excellent window of opportunity to
bring inflation closer to the target range. A strategy to reduce inflation further to 5 percent, the midpoint of the target range, should include maintaining tight macroeconomic policies, a strategy for
reducing the backward-looking indexation of wages, steps towards strengthening the central bank’s
influence on inflation expectations through forward-looking communication, and enhanced
autonomy for the Banco Central del Uruguay (BCU). If implemented together, the measures would
be mutually reinforcing and hence bring down the cost of the disinflation. A comprehensive
disinflation strategy along these lines would also eliminate the need to resort to ad hoc measures—
such as fiscally costly VAT cuts—to hold inflation down in the case of further commodity price
shocks.


Policy stance. The slowdown in M1+ growth and the substantial increase in real interest rates
since mid-2013 represent a welcome tightening in financial conditions. The current monetary
policy stance—with short term interest rates about 600 basis points above inflation—is
consistent with the goal of lowering inflation. In order to durably reduce inflation to the middle
of the target range, monetary policy needs to stay tight for some time, with appropriate re-

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

URUGUAY

calibration if economic circumstances change. Tighter fiscal policy would also help lower
inflation by tempering the growth of domestic demand.


Reducing inflation persistence. Reducing the indexation of wages to past inflation is
critical for lessening inflation persistence and lowering the cost of disinflation. The
government’s wage-setting guidelines for the bargaining rounds of 2015 and 2016 should
solely recommend nominal contracts. To ensure the success of the effort, it will be critical to
lower inflation further and get a tighter grip on inflation expectations through well-crafted
central bank communication on the direction of monetary policy.



Improving the policy framework. A major currency depreciation spurred in part by the
Fed’s tapering announcement in mid-2013 fueled inflationary pressures and created serious
challenges for the disinflationary effort within the monetary framework introduced in mid2013. Therefore, it seems too early to assess the efficacy of this framework in anchoring
expectations. However, given the challenges involved in predicting money demand, it is
important that the authorities monitor the performance of the new framework closely and
remain open to considering other frameworks as needed over time. To enhance the
framework, there would be merit in allowing more variable M1+ growth targets to ensure
that the monetary policy stance is appropriately responsive to shocks and to avoid carrying
over past errors in predicting money demand (Box 2).



Further enhancing central bank communication and autonomy.
o

Communication. There is scope to strengthen the expectations channel of monetary
policy through well-crafted communication efforts. Providing a more detailed
assessment of the impact of money growth on inflation, publishing inflation forecasts,
and explaining how monetary policy would respond to shocks could strengthen the
BCU’s influence on inflation expectations.

o

Autonomy. Though no institutional framework guarantees success, there is evidence
that central banks that pursue their established objectives independent of political
considerations are more effective in reaching their goals. In this regard, there is scope
to increase the BCU’s autonomy through legislation that delinks the terms for the
President and Board members from the electoral cycle, as was envisaged in the draft
central bank law submitted to Uruguay’s Parliament in December 2005.

15.
Authorities’ views on inflation dynamics. The authorities indicated that they expected
inflation to trend down in the near term given the tight monetary policy stance and the eventual
pass-through of the drop in global crude oil prices to retail prices. They noted that some of the
recent decline in administrative prices reflected structural changes, for instance cheaper electricity
production given the coming-on-stream of wind power. The authorities considered the current
policy mix to be consistent with lowering inflation and did not consider fiscal policy to have a
significant effect on inflation at this time. They felt that inflationary risks from exchange rate
depreciation had lessened with the real exchange rate being near equilibrium.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

URUGUAY

16.
Authorities’ views on the monetary policy framework and central bank autonomy. The
authorities took note of the staff’s view that allowing for more variable monetary growth targets
may be necessary to enhance the responsiveness of the monetary policy stance to shocks and to
avoid carrying over past errors in predicting money demand. Nevertheless, they felt that
communicating more variable targets might be a challenge. The authorities considered that the BCU
has an appropriate level of autonomy, giving it significant flexibility in choosing the monetary policy
settings.

B. Reinforcing Fiscal Sustainability
17.
The upcoming budget is an opportunity to restore a downward trend in the public
debt-to-GDP ratio. Under unchanged fiscal policies beyond 2015 and staff’s macroeconomic
projections, the net debt ratio would creep upwards over the medium term, approaching less
comfortable levels. Moreover, adverse shocks to growth, interest rates, and the exchange rate could
worsen the debt dynamics (Annex III). Staff welcomed the planned fiscal withdrawal for 2015, and
recommended increasing the structural fiscal balance by an additional 2 percentage points of GDP
in the following four years, which would help keep net public debt close to current levels in 2019
and on a firm downward trend in the medium run.
18.
The improvement in the primary fiscal balance
could come from a mix of expenditure and revenue
measures. The relatively high share of rigid spending
(pensions, social assistance and wages) poses a challenge
to improving the primary balance through expenditure
restraint alone. Therefore, revenue-enhancing measures
would also be needed. While sustained expenditure
restraint could gradually deliver part of the targeted
improvement in the primary balance, revenue measures
could be adopted upfront, in 2016, to reduce the eventual
adjustment need and achieve a visible change in the
direction of debt right away. Table 2 presents an
adjustment path along these lines.

On the expenditure side, real spending growth could be kept below real GDP growth. For
instance, capping the growth of real primary expenditures at 2 percent from 2016 onwards
would contribute two-thirds of the recommended adjustment over four years. To help ensure
compliance with expenditure targets, there would be merit in incorporating a numerical
expenditure rule in the next five-year budget. The real expenditure growth targets could be
converted into a nominal expenditure ceiling for each individual year of the five-year budget
period and be reduced over time if disinflation proceeds faster than expected. Also, targeting
higher spending efficiency would help accommodate any new spending priorities without
stretching the expenditure envelope.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

URUGUAY

On the revenue side, a mix of measures could be considered. In particular, lowering the
minimum income threshold for the PIT (currently, only about 35 percent of employees are
estimated to contribute to the PIT), limiting VAT exemptions (estimated at 3 percent of GDP),
and reviewing the business tax exemptions (about 2 percent of GDP) and eliminating those that
are not clearly conducive to long-term growth could deliver the remaining adjustment.

1/ Both the baseline and the fiscal adjustment scenarios assume that the ratio of primary expenditures to GDP declines by 0.8 percentage points in
2015, as the discretionary expenditures of the central government are kept constant in nominal terms and spending by nonfinancial public
enterprises (NFPE) slows down.
2/ The fiscal consolidation scenario assumes a 2.0 percent cap on the growth rate of real primary expenditures and a persistent increase in
revenues of about ½ percentage point of GDP from 2016 onwards.
3/ The assumed GDP multipliers are 0.3 for expenditures and 0.2 for revenues, consistent with empirical research for emerging markets. See, for
example, N. Batini, L. Eyraud, and A. Weber, 2014, “A Simple Method to Compute Fiscal Multipliers,” IMF Working Paper 14/93 (Washington:
International Monetary Fund); and E. Ilzetzki, 2011, “Fiscal Policy and Debt Dynamics in Developing Countries,” Policy Research Working Paper 5666
(Washington: The World Bank), which show that in emerging markets spending multipliers generally range from 0.1 to 0.3, while revenue
multipliers lie between 0.2 and 0.4.

Authorities’ views on fiscal policy:
Objectives and composition. The authorities agreed that keeping the net debt to GDP ratio
stable over the next five-year budget period would be desirable. They noted that a precise policy
strategy would be outlined in the next five-year budget to be submitted to Parliament by June
2015. They stressed that a number of investment projects implemented by the state-owned

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

URUGUAY

enterprises would be completed in the near term, improving the public sector balance. The
authorities saw limited scope for reducing tax exemptions, which they consider to be well
targeted. They underscored the success of investment incentives in attracting FDI and noted that
revising the business tax exemptions would create uncertainty and potentially undermine
investment prospects.


Framework. The authorities stressed that their fiscal policy framework already incorporates a
net debt rule imposing a limit on the annual increase in the net liabilities of the consolidated
public sector.7 They took note of staff’s argument that an expenditure rule would entail less
procyclicality than a net debt rule.

monetary policy stance, an effective real exchange rate very

21.
There is limited scope to respond to adverse spillovers with countercyclical
macroeconomic policies. With inflation above the target range and a structural primary fiscal
balance that is lower than the level that would stabilize the public debt-to-GDP ratio, there is limited
room for active monetary or fiscal policy easing to combat adverse spillovers. Automatic fiscal
stabilizers built into Uruguay’s solid social safety net and tax system would help shelter the economy
from adverse developments.
22.
Nevertheless, the strong liquidity buffers of the public sector and the banking system
would enable an orderly adjustment to shocks.


Public sector financing risks are limited in the near term as the central government has access to
3½ percent of GDP in contingent credit lines and has a stock of liquid financial assets sufficient
to cover public debt service through end-2015 (4½ percent of GDP). Central bank reserves

stood around 32 percent of GDP in October 2014, whereas ‘liquid’ reserves (excluding required
reserves against FX deposits) amounted to 18½ percent of GDP, comfortably exceeding
prudential benchmarks (Annex I). The high share of private nonresident holdings of Uruguay’s
public debt, however, could make domestic financial conditions susceptible to changes in global
financial sentiment.


The modestly sized and highly liquid banking system is
unlikely to act as a major amplifier of shocks.
Nevertheless, there is a need to continue monitoring
closely the resilience of banks and their customers. FXdenominated bank credit to borrowers in the
nontradables sector, around one third of total loans to
the private sector or 7 percent of GDP, could be a point
of vulnerability (Table 1, paragraph 24–27).



Macroprudential policy settings could be eased in case of
liquidity strains. The reserve requirement on nonresident holdings of central bank paper could
be unwound if there were disruptive portfolio outflows, and in case of liquidity stress in the local
banking system, reserve requirements on bank deposits could be lowered.

23.
Authorities’ views. The authorities argued that with international reserves significantly
above traditional prudential benchmarks and money growth in line with the BCU’s reference range,
occasional FX intervention is appropriate for smoothing potential excessive volatility in the exchange
rate. They also argued that foreign currency sales entailed lower fiscal costs than issuing central
bank securities to withdraw peso liquidity.

D. Safeguarding Financial Stability
24.
Heightened external risks call for continued vigilant regulation and supervision of the
highly dollarized banking system. A comprehensive set of regulations for mitigating FX-related
credit, market, and liquidity risks is in place (Table 3). The authorities’ plan to impose the Basel III
Liquidity Coverage Ratio requirements by currency is welcome; staff recommended that the new
requirements also take into account the higher potential run-off rates of nonresident deposits. Staff
also encouraged continued proactive efforts to monitor the risks associated with FX-denominated
lending, and recommended applying higher capital risk-weights to FX loans to unhedged borrowers.
25.
Authorities’ views on FX exposures. The authorities did not see a need to further tighten
regulations related to FX lending to unhedged borrowers, noting that verifying the currency of
borrowers’ earnings would present a challenge for applying different risk weights to FX loans to
unhedged versus hedged borrowers. They argued that the provisioning rules, with banks
periodically assessing the payment ability of borrowers under real currency depreciations of 20 and
35 percent, ensured that banks hold greater cushions against FX loans to unhedged borrowers.

26.
Staff recommended making the supervisory stress tests more stringent and requiring
banks to incorporate the test results into their capital planning. Staff welcomed the authorities’
plan to differentiate the impact of shocks across corporate versus household borrowers, and by the
currency denomination of the loans, starting with the 2015 stress tests. Staff pointed out that the
real depreciations assumed in the “adverse” scenario of the latest supervisory stress tests (carried
out in 2014Q2) were less than five percent, calling to make them more stringent.8 Staff also urged to
make the stress test results more binding, by requiring any banks that faced capital shortfalls in the
tests to submit capital plans for the authorities’ approval, describing how they would deal with
contingencies.
27.
Authorities’ views on the stress tests. With banks adequately meeting the current
regulatory and supervisory requirements, the authorities saw no significant risks to financial stability.
In responding to staff’s query on the stringency of supervisory stress tests, they discussed the results
of internal stress tests (prepared for the Financial Stability Committee) which featured deeper
exchange rate stress. The authorities argued that any capital deficiencies resulting from the
considered shocks could be resolved through recapitalization without creating systemic risks. They
explained that with the planned introduction in 2015 of banks’ self-assessment of capital adequacy,
they would start a dialogue with banks on the implications of the stress test results.
28.
Progress continues towards implementing the recommendations of the 2012 FSAP. The
authorities explained that an organizational change of the Superintendency of Financial Services
(SSF) to enhance the supervisory capacity will be incorporated in the 2015 budget. Staff welcomed
the efforts to strengthen the safety net and crisis management through an information exchange
agreement between the SSF and COPAB—the deposit insurance fund. Moreover, the authorities are
considering amendments to the bank resolution legal framework, consistent with the 2012 FSAP and
recent Fund technical assistance. The authorities also mentioned that they are planning to
implement a simulation exercise for bank resolution to enhance coordination among involved
agencies.

The authorities’ May 2014 stress test entails shocks of -3.2 percent for real GDP, 11.3 percent for the exchange rate,
9.1 percent for inflation, and increments of 335 and 70 basis points in country risk and international interest rates,
respectively.

E. Bolstering Inclusive Growth in the Medium Term
29.
Supply-enhancing reforms are needed to secure the strong economic growth that
Uruguay needs in order to continue deepening its social gains. Given limited scope for higher
contribution from the growth of the labor force going forward, strong medium-run growth will
require continued high investment rates and TFP growth (Figure 5).
30.
The structural reform agenda of the incoming administration is well targeted to the
identified potential impediments to future growth.


Infrastructure. Unlike investments in energy and telecommunication infrastructure, investment
in transport infrastructure has fallen below the needs of Uruguay’s growing economy, which
could hinder FDI prospects in the medium run. The authorities indicated that the modernization
and maintenance of highways and railroads are a priority in their reform agenda, with several
rehabilitation projects to be launched as Private Public Partnerships (PPP) in the near term. The
authorities argued that the PPP investments should pick up as the private sector becomes more
familiar with the framework, while acknowledging that there is room to improve the project
design and approval procedures. Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to review the overall
PPP process and introduce changes as needed.



Education. There is broad consensus that reversing the quality decline in secondary education
will be essential to sustain strong and inclusive growth in the long run (Box 1). The incoming
administration is committed to undertake reforms to boost student enrollment and completion
rates, and learning outcomes in secondary education. The reform will establish a set of analytical
skills in order to help students better succeed in college and the labor market, create a common
core curriculum to support the acquisition of those skills, and implement a national system of
standardized evaluation. The authorities expect education spending to increase by 1 percent of
GDP over the next five to ten years.



Labor skills. The labor market has been tight in recent years, with anecdotal evidence of skill
shortages in some sectors. There is a need to review the government funded training programs
and ensure that their design is well aligned with the demands of Uruguay’s current production
structure. The authorities stressed the need to improve job training opportunities especially for
the youth, and address the skill gaps in fast-growing sectors such as services and IT.

31.
Fostering an enabling business environment will also be important in maintaining high
productivity and investment rates in the years ahead. With business surveys ranking labor
market efficiency as the most difficult aspect of doing business in Uruguay, it would be useful to
evaluate the labor market regulations introduced in recent years and ensure that they strike a good
balance between efficiency and appropriate protection for workers. The authorities emphasized their
plans to launch a national system of competitiveness, an umbrella reform agenda that aims to
facilitate an innovation-friendly business environment; not only by improving infrastructure and
human capital, but also by promoting research, development and entrepreneurial capacities.

A far-reaching financial inclusion law adopted in April 2014 will broaden
households’access to financial services and promote their use of electronic payments. The law
requires all salaries and pension benefits to be paid into bank accounts or debit cards by May 2017,
mandates that workers be able to access affordable credit that is serviced directly from these
accounts, and incentivizes electronic transactions through temporary VAT cuts on purchases with
credit and debit cards. The authorities indicated that the number of debit card transactions tripled
from less than 1 percent to around 3 percent of total transactions in the two months following the
introduction of VAT cuts in August 2014, and noted that they expect cash transactions to halve by
August 2015.
33.
The authorities have also taken steps to facilitate household access to a greater range
of saving instruments. Shares in money market funds backed by central bank securities can now be
purchased at payment service providers. Once take up increases, the availability of alternative saving
instruments should enhance competition for peso-denominated bank deposits and strengthen the
impact of monetary policy on household saving decisions.

STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The Uruguayan economy is decelerating gradually after a decade of strong and
inclusive growth. Export receipts are growing at a markedly lower clip than a few years ago and
domestic demand growth is slowing towards a more sustainable pace. At the same time, inflation
remains above the target range and the primary fiscal balance has weakened further in 2014.
35.
The external environment presents risks as well as opportunities. As a small open
economy that exports mostly agricultural products and has nonresidents holding a relatively high
share of its public debt, Uruguay is exposed to the risk of lower global growth and tighter global
financial conditions. At the same time, the recent drop in global crude oil prices will provide a
welcome opportunity to improve the overall fiscal and balance of payments positions and reduce
inflation.
36.
Uruguay’s strong liquidity buffers would allow an orderly adjustment in the event of
adverse external shocks. Public debt maturity is high, reserves comfortably exceed prudential
benchmarks, and banks and the public sector have ample U.S. dollar liquidity. However, abovetarget inflation would leave little room for a countercyclical monetary policy response, and a primary
balance that is insufficient to stabilize net public debt would limit the policy space to deploy
discretionary stimulus.
37.
A multi-dimensional disinflation strategy is needed to bring inflation to the mid-point
of the target range. Such a strategy would involve maintaining a monetary policy stance tight
enough to keep inflation on a downward trend, moving towards tighter fiscal policy, a reduction in
the backward-looking component of wage setting to temper inflation persistence, and bolstering
the central bank’s influence on inflation expectations through well-crafted communication efforts.
Enhanced central bank autonomy would also be beneficial.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

URUGUAY

38.
The upcoming five-year budget is an opportunity to reinforce fiscal sustainability.
Improving the primary fiscal balance by about 2 percent of GDP over the medium term would help
ensure that net public debt is put on a firmly declining path. The improvement in the fiscal balance
could be achieved by keeping spending growth moderately below potential GDP growth over the
next five years and modestly increasing revenues.
39.
Financial regulation and supervision are solid, but could benefit from fine-tuning in
some areas. The exposures to exchange rate depreciation risks bear continued close monitoring.
There is scope to strengthen risk weights for foreign currency loans to unhedged borrowers,
incorporate greater exchange rate stress into the supervisory stress tests, and require banks facing
capital shortfalls in the stress tests to submit contingent capital plans for the SSF’s approval. In
addition, measures to assist financial deepening could enhance growth and social inclusion.
40.
A key challenge is to bolster strong growth in the medium run in order to continue
deepening Uruguay’s social gains. The commitment of the incoming government to boost
infrastructure investments, revamp secondary education and skill formation for the youth, and foster
an innovation-friendly business environment is welcome.

Box 1. Uruguay‘s Experience with Inclusive Growth 1/
Uruguay has a long history of high living standards comparable to many developed
countries and has made further progress in improving social conditions in the last decade.
The recession leading to the 2002 crisis took a severe toll on social indicators. However, rising
employment and labor incomes, as well as the introduction of targeted public transfers, kept
poverty on a declining trend after 2005 and reduced it to multi-decade lows. Income inequality
has also declined after 2007.

targeted cash transfers. The more comprehensive and permanent Equity Plan launched in 2007
included an expansion in the coverage and amount of social assistance transfers, as well as farreaching tax and health care reforms. The tax reform introduced personal income taxes and
improved the progressivity of the tax system, while the health care reform doubled by 2010 the

Strong skill formation, especially for women and youth, would help ensure that the
reduction in poverty is durable. Although Uruguay’s cash transfer policies were successful in
reducing the poverty rate over the last decade, a sizable share of the population remains at risk of
falling back into poverty. Strengthening job training opportunities and job search assistance,
especially for women and youth, would help insert the poor and vulnerable population into the
labor market, thereby providing a durable strategy for eliminating poverty and vulnerability.

Enhancing the quality of education is crucial for improving equity and raising growth
potential in the longer-term. Declining PISA scores and the high dependence of student
performance on socioeconomic conditions are a concern (Figure 5). Uruguay currently spends
about 4. 6 percent of GDP on education, below the 5.4 percent average among OECD countries.
While additional resources could be allocated to improve the quality of education, there is room
to improve the efficiency of education spending as well.

partly offset the decline on the services side, with the
trade deficit improving in 2013 relative to 2012 due to lower oil imports, and shrinking further in
2014 due to strong commodity exports and a lower oil import bill. The current account deficit,
estimated at 4¾ percent of GDP in 2014, is projected to decrease to 3¾ percent of GDP in 2015,
thanks to a lower oil import bill that is projected to more than offset the impact of lower prices for
many of Uruguay’s agricultural commodity exports. Over the medium term, the CAD is projected to
return to about 3½ percent of GDP as goods and services exports recover gradually in line with
stronger performance in trading partners.
2.
FDI has continued to exceed the current account deficit. Averaging 5¼ percent of GDP,
FDI more than financed Uruguay’s CAD most years between 2003 and 2013, and is estimated to
have done so in 2014 as well. Net portfolio investment inflows to Uruguay averaged a strong
4 percent of GDP in 2011–13 as the country regained its investment-grade sovereign rating, but
have slowed down since end-2013 (to 2 percent of GDP in the 4 quarters through 2014Q3). Other
investment flows have proved volatile and have not shown a clear trend.

The EBA current account model, based on data available as of October 2014, suggests a
cyclically-adjusted current account “norm” of -3.2 percent of GDP for Uruguay. The actual
cyclically adjusted CA balance in 2014 is projected to be -3.3 percent of GDP, in line with
the norm.



Calculations based on the EBA external stability approach indicate that a current account
of -1.3 percent of GDP would be required to stabilize Uruguay’s net foreign assets to GDP
ratio in the medium-term.



Based on staff estimates of the relationship between the current account and the REER for
Uruguay, the EBA current account and external stability results suggest Uruguay’s REER is
between 0 and 5 percent above its norm.



Finally, an estimate using an EBA-like
equilibrium real exchange rate
regression suggests that Uruguay’s
REER is 3 percent above its equilibrium
value. Uruguay is not included in the
official EBA REER regression due to
data gaps; therefore, an auxiliary
regression was estimated based on a
cross-country sample, using an
imputed series for Uruguay’s financial
home bias.

Annex II. Uruguay’s Economic Ties with Argentina and Brazil
Argentina. The shares of Uruguay’s merchandise and service exports to Argentina have diminished
in recent years, but remain relevant. There has been a sharp drop in banking linkages between the
two countries since the early 2000s.






The share of nonresident deposits (traditionally dominated by Argentine holders) in Uruguay’s
bank deposits has fallen from a peak of 40 percent in 2001 to about 15 percent in 2014.
Argentina accounts for 60 percent of tourism spending in Uruguay. Even so, spending by
Argentine tourists in Uruguay has dropped from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2011 to 2 percent in
2013 following the introduction of foreign exchange controls in Argentina. Conversely,
spending by Uruguayans in Argentina increased from 0.8 percent of GDP to 1.3 percent of GDP
against the backdrop of a sharp depreciation of the Argentine peso.
In 2013, Argentina accounted for only 5 percent of Uruguay’s goods exports (1 percent of GDP),
a historical low compared to an average of 10 percent of exports during the last two decades.
In 2009–12, FDI from Argentina accounted for about one-third of total FDI inflows into Uruguay
(mainly into agriculture and real estate). Through data for 2013 is not yet available, anecdotal
evidence suggests that there was a decline in real estate purchases by Argentines in 2013,
following a bilateral tax information exchange treaty signed by the two countries.

Brazil. Brazil remains an important trade destination for Uruguay, and its share in tourism and FDI
inflows has increased over the past decade.




40

Brazil’s share in Uruguay’s goods exports has increased from 13 percent in 2005 to 19 percent
in 2013. In contrast to Uruguay’s exports to Argentina, more than two-thirds of which are
specialized manufactured products without an alternative market, the majority of Uruguay’s
exports to Brazil are commodity-based, and thus easier to export to alternative markets when
growth slows in Brazil. On the services side, Brazil, combined with Chile and Paraguay, has
accounted for around one-fifth of tourism receipts (0.8 percent of GDP) in recent years.
FDI inflows from Brazil to Uruguay are also significant. Their share in total FDI has increased
from less than 1 percent in 2001 to almost 9 percent in 2012.

Annex III. Uruguay: Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA)
Under current policies and macroeconomic projections, the gross debt of Uruguay’s public sector is
projected to increase to 67 percent of GDP in 2019 from 62 percent of GDP in 2013. However, the high
level of liquid financial assets of the public sector—26 percent of GDP at end-2013—as well as the
high average maturity of the public debt, mitigate near-term financing risks. Uruguay’s gross financing
needs exceed the DSA benchmarks because short-term central bank securities are included in the total
public sector debt stock. The central bank’s debt is more than covered by its “free” reserve assets.
Composition of the Public Sector Financial Balance Sheet
The gross debt of the public sector has a broad institutional coverage. It includes:


Central government debt, which stood at 40 percent of GDP at end-2013. Currently the average
maturity of central government debt is close to 15 years and about half of the debt is in localcurrency.



Central bank debt, which stood at 17 percent of GDP at end-2013. The debt of the central bank
mostly consists of shorter-term securities (with maturity below 2 years) issued to sterilize the
liquidity created by reserve accumulation. About 85 percent of the central bank debt is in local
currency.



Public enterprises’ debt, which stood at 4 percent of GDP at end-2013.

In total, at end-2013 about 40 percent of Uruguay’s public sector gross debt was in foreign currency.
About 70 percent of the local-currency debt of the public sector was in CPI-indexed units.
The public sector has access to contingent credit lines of 3½ percent of GDP and at end-2013 had
total gross financial assets of 38 percent of GDP. Net public debt—gross debt minus liquid assets—
stood at 36½ percent of GDP at the end of 2013.


The gross foreign reserve assets of the central bank reached about 29 percent of GDP at end-2013.



The financial assets of the non-financial public sector amounted to 5½ percent of GDP at end2013, in line with the authorities’ prefunding policy aimed at holding enough liquid assets to
cover at least 12 months of total interest and amortization payments.



The stock of liquid foreign assets of the public sector stood at 26 percent of GDP, given by total
gross public sector assets minus (i) the required reserves held at by BCU against foreign currency

URUGUAY

deposits and (ii) the domestic currency claims of the nonfinancial public sector on resident
banks.1
Baseline and Alternative Scenarios
Under the DSA baseline scenario, the gross and net public debt ratios would creep upwards over the
projection horizon. In particular, net public debt would increase from 36½ percent of GDP in 2013 to
43 percent of GDP in 2019. The increase in gross public debt would be slightly less, from 62 percent
of GDP in 2013 to about 67 percent of GDP in 2019, assuming that the pace of asset accumulation
moderates over the next few years with an attendant slowdown in the issuance of central bank
securities. The gross financing need would rise over the medium term, consistent with higher global
interest rates and a rising debt stock. The baseline scenario assumes the maturity profile of the
public debt stock to remain tilted to the medium and long term, and the share of local currency
debt to remain slightly above 50 percent of the total.
Assuming that the real GDP growth rate, real interest rates, the rate of exchange rate depreciation,
and the pace of asset purchases remain at their levels projected for 2019, the medium term debtstabilizing primary balance is estimated at about 1¼ percent of GDP, about 1½ percentage points
of GDP above the projected medium term level of the primary balance.2
The analysis of past forecast errors for key macroeconomic variables suggests that the baseline
assumptions are generally realistic. The level of the projected primary balance for Uruguay is
comparable to those seen in the past.
A “historical” scenario (that assumes that the key macroeconomic variables behave as in the last
decade) yields a downward-sloping debt path, since Uruguay experienced high growth rates and
exchange rate appreciation in the last decade as it recovered from its 2002 financial crisis.
Vulnerability of the Financing Profile
Uruguay’s gross public and external financing needs do not imply near-term vulnerabilities,
although they are slightly above the benchmark levels of 15 percent of GDP. The elevated gross
public financing needs reflect primarily the short-term maturity of the central bank securities.
Refinancing risks for these securities are contained since their amount is smaller than the central
bank’s liquid foreign reserves. External financing risks are also mitigated by the high liquidity
buffers—including the liquid financial assets of the public sector and its contingent credit lines.
Uruguay’s current account deficits in the last several years have been more than or mostly covered
1

The latter adjustment removes the domestic currency assets from total assets and thus implies that all the liquid assets are in
foreign currency.
2

The expected rate of domestic currency depreciation against the U.S. dollar is given by the inflation differential between Uruguay
and the United States, on the basis of assuming a constant real exchange rate between the domestic currency and the U.S. dollar.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

by FDI inflows. A softening in FDI flows, should it occur, would come hand in hand with a decline in
capital goods imports, which would contribute to lower current account deficits and external
financing needs.
At 53 percent of total public sector debt, the share of public sector debt held by nonresidents is
found to be slightly above the benchmark. This exposure could make domestic financial conditions
susceptible to potential external shocks and needs to be monitored.
Stress Tests
Debt dynamics in Uruguay remain sensitive to shocks. In a stylized downside scenario that combines
a permanent exchange rate depreciation (relative to the baseline) of about 18 percent with a
temporary drop in growth and primary balances and a permanent increase in real interest rates, the
gross debt ratio rises by about 16 percentage points over the five-year forecast horizon. The net
debt ratio rises by 12 percentage points in the

baseline, red if benchmark is exceeded under baseline, white if stress test is not relevant.
2/ The cell is highlighted in green if gross financing needs benchmark of 15% is not exceeded under the specific shock or baseline, yellow if exceeded under specific shock
but not baseline, red if benchmark is exceeded under baseline, white if stress test is not relevant.
3/ The cell is highlighted in green if country value is less than the lower risk-assessment benchmark, red if country value exceeds the upper risk-assessment benchmark,
yellow if country value is between the lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks. If data are unavailable or indicator is not relevant, cell is white.
Lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks are:
200 and 600 basis points for bond spreads; 5 and 15 percent of GDP for external financing requirement; 0.5 and 1 percent for change in the share of short-term debt; 15
and 45 percent for the public debt held by non-residents; and 20 and 60 percent for the share of foreign-currency denominated debt.
4/ EMBIG, an average over the last 3 months, 11-Oct-14 through 09-Jan-15.
5/ External financing requirement is defined as the sum of current account deficit, amortization of medium and long-term total external debt, and short-term total external
debt at the end of previous period.

1/ Public sector is defined as consolidated public sector.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ EMBIG.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived as r - π (1+g)+π[Debt in indexed units] to take into account a high share of debt indexed to inflation in total debt. The real growth
contribution is derived as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of September 30, 2014)
The Inter-American Development Bank’s (IDB) Board of Executive Directors approved in
August 2011 a Country Strategy with Uruguay (2010–15). Sovereign-guaranteed lending under
the program is expected to reach approximately US$1.8 billion. The program includes additional non
reimbursable financing for technical assistance and analytical work.
Under the Strategy, the national authorities and the IDB identified the following priority
sectors in which the IDB Group would focus both its financial and nonfinancial products and
services: (i) transport; (ii) energy; (iii) water, sanitation, and solid waste; (iv) science and technology;
(v) social protection; (vi) education and job training; (vii) agribusiness; (viii) services exports; (ix)
public management and finances; and (x) urban development and citizen security. It is also expected
that all four of the Bank’s private sector windows will approve loans and technical assistance in the
energy, transport, agribusiness and global services sectors. The strategic areas were selected taking
into account: (i) a context of strong economic growth, which imposes heavy investment
requirements on a number of sectors; (ii) business opportunities, which in turn contribute to the
Bank’s institutional goals within the framework of the 9th General Capital Increase; (iii) greater
complementarity between the multilateral financial institutions working in Uruguay; (iv) the Bank’s
accumulated operational experience and technical knowledge from having worked for several
decades in the country; and (v) the government’s interest for continued IDB engagement.
As of September 30th 2014, the IDB’s portfolio in Uruguay includes loans for the financing of
45 projects; five of which are without sovereign guarantee. The 5 loans earmarked towards the
private sector account for US$494 million (22 percent of the approved amounts). The lending
portfolio amounts to US$2,249 million, of which US$1,379.8 million are pending disbursement. One
operation amounting to US$550 million is a contingent line of credit that would only be disbursed in
case the government needs it. Disbursements in 2014 for sovereign loans are expected to total
US$176 million. US$58.8 million has already been disbursed this year for private loans. The current
portfolio includes lending to support the Government in the following sectors: promotion of exports
and investments (32.5 percent of the approved amounts); water and sanitation (19.2 percent of the
approved amounts); urban development and citizenship security (12.2 percent of the approved
amounts); energy (11.4 percent of the approved amounts); institutional capacity and finance
(8.3 percent of the approved amounts); transport (5.7 percent of the approved amounts); and other
sectors such as labor training, science and technology, agro-industry and social protection
(10.7 percent of the approved amounts).

In 2014, the Bank approved loans to the public sector for approximately US$392.5 million in
the areas of integration, financial and budget public management, education, water and sanitation,
productive infrastructure (mainly in the renewable energy sector), and innovation and productive
development.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of January 27, 2014)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected area is national accounts.
National Accounts: In 2009, the Uruguayan authorities completed a revision of national
accounts statistics, in which they updated the benchmark year (from 1983 to 1997 and 2005) and
adopted the System of National Accounts (SNA) 1993. However, national accounts statistics still
have some shortcomings: limited coverage of the enterprise survey, partial update of business
register, poor quality source data for some components of GDP, inadequate information on the
informal economy, and incomplete quarterly accounts. About 60 percent of the GDP calculation
is based on fixed input-output ratios from 1997. Household consumption is not independently
derived and changes in inventories are obtained as residuals. Household income and expenditure
survey are conducted every ten years. The central bank (BCU) compiles and disseminates annual
but not quarterly GDP by the expenditure approach at current prices, and does not compile
annual integrated economic accounts by institutional sector, in particular, the income account.
Gross national income, gross disposable income and gross savings are also available annually.
Detailed national accounts data are only available up to 2008. Long-time series are not available
on the BCU website. There is no regular schedule for updating the base year of the national
accounts. The causes of the current revisions to the quarterly national accounts are not explained
to users. A monthly index of economic activity is not disseminated. For the national accounts
there is a need to plan for the adoption of the 2008 SNA and updating of the base year.
Prices: Both the consumer and wholesale price indices are reported on a regular and timely basis
for publication in the IFS. The new base period for the consumer price index is December
2010 = 100. The CPI has national coverage and includes more than forty thousand price
quotations. It does not cover either the implicit rent or the net acquisitions of owner-occupied
dwellings. For the CPI, reselection of the sample of detailed products has not been done for an
extended period. The base of the wholesale price index has been updated to 2001. Producer
price indices (March 2010 = 100) for national products have been recently disseminated. The PPI
does not cover utilities, construction, business and other services and exported output. The
authorities do not provide trade price and volume indices for publication in the International
Financial Statistics (IFS). For both the CPI and PPI, statistical outputs/intermediate results are not
validated with available information from alternative sources. The CPI and PPI would benefit from
a more regular and frequent schedule of weight updates.
Government Finance Statistics: Official data on the central administration, the state enterprises
and the social security system are complete and current, but there are problems with the
timeliness of the data on local governments. There are also problems with the timeliness of
financing and debt data reported for inclusion in the Fund’s statistical publications. Information
on a monthly and quarterly basis for financing and debt data respectively, are disseminated on

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

URUGUAY

the BCU website from 1999 onwards for the central government and total public sector, but no
information is reported for publication in the International Financial Statistics. The information
reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook covers transactions on
revenue and expense for the consolidated central government (data on revenue and expense for
local governments have not been reported since 1994), and the general government’s operations
on financial assets and liabilities, both in terms of flows (financing) and stocks (debt).
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary and financial statistics are prepared in accordance
with the IMF's Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (2000). Authorities report monetary data
for the central bank, other depository corporations, and other financial corporation’s (OFCs)
using the standardized reporting forms (SRFs). However, data for the OFCs are limited to offshore financial institutions. A mission could be fielded to expand the institutional coverage of the
OFCs and compile the SRF for OFCs with full institutional coverage.
Financial Sector Surveillance: Authorities participate in the IMF’s Coordinated Direct
Investment Survey (CDIS), Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and financial
soundness indicators (FSIs) databases. FSIs on non-financial corporations, households, market
liquidity and real estate markets are not available. BCU disseminates FSIs for individual banks
on a monthly basis and staff estimates FSIs for the banking system by weighting individual
bank FSIs by their asset share.
External Sector Statistics: Balance of payments statements are compiled and published on a
quarterly basis. Data are compiled following the recommendations of the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. Uruguay compiles and reports to STA quarterly data on balance of
payments and annual data on the international investment position (IIP) for publication in the IFS
and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. New surveys are allowing for improved
coverage of the private sector in the IIP.
Uruguay started disseminating the international reserves and foreign currency liquidity data
template on the Fund’s external website in 2005. The BCU also disseminates quarterly external
debt statistics in the format prescribed by the SDDS on the National Summary Data Page (NSDP).
II. Data Standards and Quality
Uruguay subscribed to the SDDS in February
2004 and is in observance.

Data ROSC published on October 1, 2001.
A data reassessment ROSC on CPI, PPI and NA
was published in February 2014.

III. Reporting to STA
Annual GFS are regularly reported to STA for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook. No high frequency GFS are reported for publication in the International Financial
Statistics.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 26, 2015

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Uruguay
On February 20, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Uruguay, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal
without a meeting.2
Recent Developments and Outlook
The Uruguayan economy continues to decelerate gradually. Real GDP growth is estimated to
have softened to a still robust 3¼ percent in 2014 from 4½ percent in 2013, mostly reflecting the
moderation in domestic demand growth amid a less favorable external environment. Weak
economic conditions abroad have continued to weigh on Uruguay’s current account, particularly
on the services side. At the same time, the surge in inflows to the local securities market abated
and the Uruguayan peso has depreciated towards levels broadly consistent with fundamentals.
Inflation remains above the central bank’s 3–7 percent target range. After being pushed to near
10 percent in early 2014 by food price shocks and the pass-through of peso depreciation,
consumer price inflation receded to 8¼ percent at the end of the year, in part due to subdued
increases in administrative prices and one-off measures to ease inflation. Above target inflation
reflects a shrinking but still positive output gap, upward shocks to food and fuel prices in 2010–
13, and pervasive backward-looking wage indexation that embedded these shocks.
Monetary policy has been tight while fiscal policy has been slightly expansionary in 2014. The
peso yield curve remained 400–600 basis points above inflation and credit growth has slowed
markedly. Public sector spending continued to grow faster than real GDP in 2014, but the budget
approved for 2015 will generate a fiscal withdrawal of about ¾ percentage point of GDP, mostly
by slowing spending.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that a proposal can
be considered without convening formal discussions.

2
Bank resilience indicators are generally strong, but less so than a few years ago. In particular,
foreign currency credit to borrowers in the nontradables sector has increased as a share of total
credit, banks’ capital buffers have declined somewhat, and the share of nonperforming loans has
inched up in 2014, albeit from a low level. Deposit dollarization remains elevated.
Economic activity is projected to decelerate further but remain solid. The pass-through of lower
global oil prices to end-user prices will be gradual, as part of the windfall from lower oil prices
will initially be used to shore up the operating balance of the state-owned petroleum enterprise.
The programmed fiscal tightening and continued weak external conditions will outweigh the
positive impact of reduced gasoline prices on domestic demand, with growth shifting down to
about 2¾ percent in 2015. Inflation is projected to decline gradually to within the target range
over the medium term as monetary policy remains tight, the output gap closes, and retail prices
for gasoline decline. Net public debt is projected to crawl up to 43 percent of GDP in 2019 from
36½ percent in 2013, with the primary balance remaining below the level required to keep debt
constant.
Key risks to the outlook relate to uncertainties regarding global and regional economic growth
and U.S. monetary policy normalization. The strong liquidity buffers of the private and public
sectors would facilitate an orderly adjustment to external shocks. Nevertheless, the high shares of
nonresident-holdings of public debt and foreign currency denominated bank credit to borrowers
in the nontradables sector could present vulnerabilities.
Executive Board Assessment
The Uruguayan economy is decelerating gradually after a decade of strong and inclusive growth.
Export receipts are growing at a markedly lower clip than a few years ago and domestic demand
growth is slowing towards a more sustainable pace. At the same time, inflation remains above
the target range and the primary fiscal balance has weakened further in 2014.
The external environment presents risks as well as opportunities. As a small open economy that
exports mostly agricultural products and has nonresidents holding a relatively high share of its
public debt, Uruguay is exposed to the risk of lower global growth and tighter global financial
conditions. At the same time, the recent drop in global crude oil prices will provide a welcome
opportunity to improve the overall fiscal and balance of payments positions and reduce inflation.
Uruguay’s strong liquidity buffers would allow an orderly adjustment in the event of adverse
external shocks. Public debt maturity is high, reserves comfortably exceed prudential
benchmarks, and banks and the public sector have ample U.S. dollar liquidity. However, abovetarget inflation would leave little room for a countercyclical monetary policy response, and a
primary balance that is insufficient to keep net public debt around its current level would limit
the policy space to deploy discretionary stimulus.
A multi-dimensional disinflation strategy is needed to bring inflation to the mid-point of the
target range. Such a strategy would involve maintaining a monetary policy stance tight enough to
keep inflation on a downward trend, moving towards tighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the
backward-looking component of wage setting to temper inflation persistence, and bolstering the

3
central bank’s influence on inflation expectations through well-crafted communication efforts.
Enhanced central bank autonomy would also be beneficial.
The upcoming five-year budget is an opportunity to reinforce fiscal sustainability. Improving the
primary fiscal balance by about 2 percent of GDP over the medium term would help ensure that
net public debt is put on a firmly declining path. The improvement in the fiscal balance could be
achieved by keeping spending growth moderately below potential GDP growth over the next five
years and modestly increasing revenues.
Financial regulation and supervision are solid, but could benefit from fine-tuning in some areas.
The exposures to exchange rate depreciation risks bear continued close monitoring. There is
scope to strengthen risk weights for foreign currency loans to unhedged borrowers, incorporate
greater exchange rate stress into the supervisory stress tests, and require banks facing capital
shortfalls in the stress tests to submit contingent capital plans for the approval of the
Superintendency of Financial Services. In addition, measures to assist financial deepening could
enhance growth and social inclusion.
A key challenge is to bolster strong growth in the medium run in order to continue deepening
Uruguay’s social gains. The commitment of the incoming government to boost infrastructure
investments, revamp secondary education and skill formation for the youth, and foster an
innovation-friendly business environment is welcome.
