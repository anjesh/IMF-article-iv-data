EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•
El Salvador has implemented a wide range of structural reforms over the last
decade. The reform effort encompassed important fiscal reforms, trade opening, and pension
reform, and was capped with the adoption of official dollarization in 2001. This strategy
brought rapid growth initially, an investment-grade rating, and substantial improvements in
social conditions. Nevertheless, growth has been sluggish in recent years, the fiscal and
external current account deficits have widened, and public debt has increased to over
45 percent of GDP, and the debt of the nonfinancial public sector to nearly 41 percent of GDP.
•
Although growth is expected to pick up slightly in 2005, important challenges
remain. Growth is expected at 2½ percent in 2005 mainly due to higher private consumption.
The medium-term growth outlook hinges critically on reforms to entrench prudent fiscal
policies, strengthen the banking system, and boost investment and productivity—reforms
needed to make sure that El Salvador can compete successfully under its dollarization regime.
•
The new government that took office in June 2004 is strengthening economic
policies to address these challenges. A tax package has been adopted, CAFTA was ratified
by congress, and banking reforms are continuing. Further measures are needed, however, to
fully address El Salvador’s vulnerabilities, and ensure sustained rapid growth and social
progress.
Key staff recommendations
•
The staff supports the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the policy framework,
and recommends that it be broadened into a comprehensive reform agenda to improve
growth prospects and enhance the economy’s resilience to shocks.
•
Fiscal consolidation. The primary fiscal surplus should be raised to about 1 percent of
GDP by 2006 (from a deficit of 0.7 percent in 2004) to place the public debt on a downward
path. Further reforms are needed on tax policy, expenditure control, and the pension system.
•
Central bank operations. Staff supported the authorities’ plans to fully implement the
dollarization law. In particular, the government should assume the central bank’s nonmonetary liabilities, while the central bank would develop its lender of last resort function.
•
Banking reforms. The authorities intend to deepen banking reforms along the lines of
staff recommendations, with focus on strengthening prudential norms, supervision, and bank
resolution practices.
•
Structural reforms. Strengthening competitiveness is key to boosting medium-term
growth prospects. Staff endorsed the authorities’ plans to deepen trade reform and alleviate
infrastructure constraints, and recommended further enhancing labor market flexibility.

I. BACKGROUND
A. A Brief Medium-Term Perspective
1.
Since the peace agreements of 1992, El Salvador has made major progress on
several fronts. Peace, democracy, and political stability have been firmly rooted. Social
conditions have improved, with a substantial decline in poverty. Wide-ranging economic
reforms—including trade opening, privatization, tax policy, civil service, and pension
system—have been supported by a broad national consensus. As a result, El Salvador has the
second-highest income level in Central America (after Costa Rica), maintains an investment
grade rating (the only country in the region), and is often considered to be the second-best
performer on reforms in Latin America (after Chile).1
2.
The reform efforts of the 1990s were capped by official dollarization in 2001. The
authorities view the official dollarization as a milestone in El Salvador’s reform efforts,
anchoring its stability-oriented policy framework. The new regime eliminated the scope for
monetary policy, and has helped reduce interest rates and consolidate low inflation (see ¶9).
3.
While the reforms have brought important benefits, growth has slowed over the
course of the past decade and the policy framework remains vulnerable. After a strong
expansion during the post-war reconstruction period, growth has been on a declining trend
reflecting falling productivity and low investment. Several studies have looked at
El Salvador’s growth performance in recent years, which can be attributed to declining
national savings; weakening external competitiveness, particularly through the 1990s; and
constraints on infrastructure, human capital, and weaknesses in governance.2 More recently,
adverse external cyclical factors, major earthquakes, and election-related uncertainties have
also inhibited growth.3
4.
Dollarization is now firmly entrenched, but it is a demanding policy framework
and further efforts are needed to ensure its sustainability in an environment of rapid
growth and financial stability. Vulnerabilities remain, particularly in the areas of the public
finances, the financial sector, and the labor market. These vulnerabilities could impair the
economy’s capacity to respond to shocks and inhibit its growth potential.

B. Recent Developments
Political and social environment
5.
Policymaking has recently been constrained by a divided congress. After fourteen
years of political dominance, the right-wing governing party (ARENA) lost its majority in
congress to the left-wing opposition (FMLN) in 2003. Although ARENA won the presidential
election in April 2004, the change in the balance of power created substantial uncertainty and
has limited the government’s ability to implement its reform agenda, as the FMLN has
opposed key reforms.4
6.
President Saca began his five-year term in June 2004 with a market-oriented
reform agenda. He has sought to broaden consensus with small parties, the FMLN, and
business sector, and recently secured approval of key tax measures and ratification of CAFTA.
While the next few months may offer an opportunity to pass additional reforms (mainly
banking) through congress, this window may close again with the approach of legislative
elections in March 2006.

While social indicators have improved significantly, important challenges remain.

Recent economic developments
8.
After growth decelerated in the second half of the 1990s, it slowed further in
2000–03. Buffeted by earthquakes, falling terms of trade (coffee and oil), and the slowdown in
the United States, real GDP growth declined to 2 percent per year in 2000–03 (implying
stagnant per capita income), the external current account deficit widened, and national savings
declined.5 Public debt rose rapidly to 46 percent of GDP by end-2003 and the debt of the
nonfinancial public sector to nearly 41 percent of GDP, reflecting earthquake reconstruction
and pension reform costs.6 Despite the higher fiscal and external current account deficits, net
international reserves (NIR) increased (to over 30 percent of M2 by end-2003), owing mainly
to higher prudential liquidity requirements in 2003.
9.
Despite the global and regional recovery in 2004, growth in El Salvador continued
to be sluggish and economic vulnerabilities remained.
¾
Growth was dampened in 2004 by shocks and election-related uncertainty. Through
September 2004, output grew by about 1.5 percent (y/y), owing to weak investment and export
growth. Investment was affected by uncertainties related to the April 2004 elections, as well as
delays in public investment due to late approval of the 2004 budget.7 National savings
continued to decline while unemployment stayed high at 7 percent. Inflation rose to
5.4 percent (y/y) in November 2004 (2½ percent in 2003), reflecting mainly higher world oil
prices and, to a lesser extent, a minimum wage increase in 2003 (frozen since 1998).
¾
Although fiscal deficits have come down, the primary balance is still negative. The
overall public sector deficit is estimated to have declined to 3 percent of GDP in 2004
(4½ percent in 2002), owing to lower reconstruction outlays. To finance the overall deficit in
2004, the government has placed international bonds and sold the remaining shares in a
telephone company (almost 2 percent of GDP).8
¾
After rising rapidly during 1999–2003, public debt declined slightly to 45 percent of
GDP at end-2004. The decline reflected the sale of government shares noted above.
Meanwhile, the structure of the public debt has improved with the issue of long-term

5

While real per capita GDP did not grow in 2000–03 (reflecting in part the impact of external
shocks), income (GNP) per capita rose by 3 percent a year during this period reflecting the
strong increase in family remittances (see Chapter III of BN).
6

Since 1998 the pay-as-you-go system is being replaced by a fully-funded system of
individual pension accounts. Pension costs are projected to reach about 2¼ percent of GDP
per year during 2005–09, mainly reflecting the shift of participants to the new system.
7

The budget was only approved in July 2004; until then, the spending ceilings of the previous
budget applied, with no new projects being started.
8

The bonds (US$286 million or 1.8 percent of GDP) were issued for 30 years at a fixed
interest rate of 7.6 percent (270 basis points over comparable U.S. treasury bills, one of the
lowest sovereign spreads in Latin America).

¾
The restructuring of the central bank remains to be completed, as envisaged in the
dollarization law (Box 1). The central bank has replaced most domestic currency with U.S.
dollar notes and holds prudential liquidity requirements of individual banks. However, some
important aspects of the dollarization law still need to be implemented, such as developing a
lender-of-last-resort (LOLR) function (see ¶30) and the transfer of central bank nonmonetary
liabilities to the government. These liabilities (mainly short-term paper) are not sufficiently
backed by NIR and constitute a source of liquidity risk for the central bank.
¾
In this context, the central bank continued to roll over its own paper and maintained
its NIR cushion in 2004. The margin of NIR over base money remained at around
US$150 million. Pending the transfer of nonmonetary liabilities to the government, the central
bank began to issue three-year paper in 2003 to replace maturing paper and reduce liquidity
risk. The central bank also implemented a scheduled reduction in a special liquidity
requirement (from 9 to 6 percent of deposits) during 2004.9
¾
Banks stepped up their medium-term external borrowing during 2003–04. With
deposits declining in real terms (2 percent per year), increased borrowing helped banks sustain
a moderate expansion of real credit (2 percent per year). The decline in deposits partly
reflected the increasing share of savings being invested in private pension funds (their
resources had risen to 11 percent of GDP at end-2003, since their creation in 1998). Crossborder lending by Salvadoran banks to the region picked up in 2004, but stricter country-risk

9

This requirement was introduced in mid-2003 against potential systemic liquidity pressures
before the presidential election. Including the special requirement, prudential liquidity
requirements cover 29 percent of banks’ deposits.

-9-

Box 1. Implementation of the Monetary Integration Law
Key Features of the Law (November 2000)
•
Legal tender. On January 1, 2001, the U.S. dollar became legal tender and all financial
system accounts were converted from colones to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate of C 8.75 per
U.S. dollar. Prices, wages, and salaries were denominated in colones or in U.S. dollars.
•
Conversion. The central bank no longer prints new currency notes nor issues coins, but
it may issue currency from its inventory of colón notes. The law did not set a deadline for the
conversion of existing currency notes in colones into U.S. dollar notes.
•
Credit operations. The central bank cannot extend direct credit to financial institutions,
but it retained the power to issue bonds and conduct transactions in securities and portfolio
investments.
•
Lender of last resort (LOLR). This function was restructured: (i) the reserve
requirement (20 percent of deposits) was converted into a remunerated prudential liquidity
requirement (effectively 23 percent of deposits) that banks can access to cover short-term
needs; (ii) use of the first 25 percent of this requirement is free of interest, the second
25 percent can be drawn at a market interest rate (LIBOR + 250 basis points), while the
remainder is only available in consultation with the superintendency of banks and under
intervention; (iii) banks that exhaust the requirement are to be liquidated, and the deposit
insurance fund (IGD) would pay out up to US$7,060 per depositor starting in January 2004
(US$6,250 earlier); and (iv) the central bank may conduct repurchase operations of U.S.
treasury bills or central bank securities, in the event of systemic liquidity problems.
•

Transfer of liabilities. The government will assume all other central bank liabilities.

Implementation of the Law (as of end-2004)
•
Conversion. Over 94 percent of currency in circulation at end-2000 has been converted
into U.S. dollar notes.
•
Credit operations. The central bank has refrained from intervening in the interbank
market and has unwound 15 percent of the outstanding stock of liquidity paper at end-2000.
•
LOLR. In mid-2003, the central bank introduced a special requirement of 9 percent of
deposits (which was lowered to 6 percent by September 2004) that banks can access in the
event of liquidity problems. The special and liquidity requirements now account for a
combined 29 percent of deposits. These resources, however, can not be used to manage
systemic liquidity. The authorities need to develop this capacity, including by building NIR.
Transfer of liabilities. The government has not yet assumed the central bank’s liabilities.
Excess of NIR over base money does not adequately back short-term non-monetary domestic
liabilities of the central bank (mainly, government deposits and open market bills). This
situation constrains LOLR capacity and constitutes a liquidity risk for the central bank.

- 10 -

provisions are tempering the growth.10 During 2004, bank lending rates (one year or more)
declined by 90 basis points, to 7½ percent, while deposit rate were stable at about
3¼ percent.11
¾
The external current account deficit
is estimated to have narrowed slightly to
4½ percent of GDP in 2004 (5 percent in
2003). A sharp pick up in family remittances
would more than offset an increase in oil
imports (which rose by 1 percent of GDP)
and a decline in net maquila exports (mainly
textiles), attributable to intensified
competition from East Asia. NIR declined by
US$170 million in 2004 to US$1.7 billion
(about 4½ months of imports), mainly
reflecting the scheduled decline in banks’
reserve requirements at the central bank.

While the real exchange rate has depreciated recently, other indicators suggest that
external competitiveness needs to be strengthened (Box 2). The CPI-based real exchange rate
has depreciated by almost 6½ percent since end-2001, mainly reflecting the fall of the U.S.
dollar. However, the recent sluggish export growth, relatively low FDI, heightened
competition from East Asia, and relatively high dollar wages, suggest that external
competitiveness needs to be strengthened. This will be particularly important in preparation
for CAFTA and expiration of textile quotas under the agreement on textiles and clothing in
2005.
C. Fund Policy Advice and Implementation
10.
Policy implementation in El Salvador has been broadly consistent with Fund
advice, although the pace of implementation has slowed recently. In recent Article IV
consultations, Directors praised El Salvador’s record of fiscal prudence and impressive
reforms since the early 1990s. More recently, Directors called for a stronger fiscal stance, a
larger international reserve cushion, further banking reforms, and improved central bank
operations to underpin the dollarized regime and help deal with adverse shocks. While
progress has been made on many of these areas, the pace of policy implementation slowed
during the election period, especially in the fiscal area. Implementation of technical assistance
has picked up recently, especially in the areas of tax policy, the banking system, and statistics.

10

Provisions range from 1 to 40 percent on investments with moderate risk (as assessed by
international rating agencies) and up to 100 percent for noninvestment-grade risk.

11

The compression of intermediation spreads reflects mainly greater competition among
banks for creditworthy borrowers in an effort to maintain market share.

- 11 -

Box 2. External Competitiveness
While the real exchange rate has depreciated recently, external competitiveness appears to require
further strengthening as export growth has been sluggish, foreign direct investment has remained
low, and competition from Asia has intensified.

•
The CPI-based real effective exchange
rate (REER) has depreciated by about 6½ percent
since 2002, after a large appreciation in 1992–
140
2001 (48 percent). The recent depreciation
reflects the decline of the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis other
major currencies and lower domestic inflation

than in trading partners.

policy in the 1990s supported the initial expansion
of exports and employment in the maquila and nontraditional sectors. Nevertheless, the recent trend
reflects an increase in the minimum wage (5 percent) in 2003 in excess of inflation and productivity
growth.
Other indicators suggest a weakening in external competitiveness:
•
Maquila and other goods exports have
stagnated since 199 at about 3 percent of GDP.
Moreover, after rapid growth in the 1990s, the
share of maquila exports (mostly textile) in the
United States remained relatively low (2 percent).

•
Foreign direct investment has only
averaged 1½ percent of GDP since 1999, despite
a liberal investment regime. This ratio is the
lowest in the region.

•
The nontradable sector remains
attractive relative to the tradable sector, as sizable
workers remittances have raised demand for
nontradables. This situation has maintained
employment and real wages relatively higher in
the nontradable sector relative to the tradable
sector (see Figure 2).

The authorities have generally agreed with the thrust of Fund policy advice, while
noting the challenge of approving often difficult reforms in a fragmented congress.
Nevertheless, the authorities indicated their strong commitment to addressing existing
vulnerabilities and regaining the reform momentum in the fiscal, trade, banking, and central
bank areas. They also expressed their appreciation for the Fund’s technical assistance and their
intention to request further assistance in the future, mainly on macroeconomic statistics.
II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. Near-Term Outlook
12.
Growth is expected to recover to 2½ percent in 2005. The pick-up would be
supported by strong private consumption,
and moderate increases in investment and

13.
The overall public sector deficit is projected to rise slightly to over 3 percent of
GDP. A tax package recently approved by congress (see ¶20) will be more than offset by a
budgeted increase in public investment and social spending, and further increases in interest
and pension payments. As a result, the public debt is projected to rise to 46 percent of GDP by
end-2005.
B. Medium-Term Outlook
14.
The authorities’ strategy for the next five years aims to improve growth prospects
and social conditions. The new government has begun to strengthen the policy stance to
deepen the process of integration with the global and regional economy. The main elements of
this strategy are:
•
Strengthen the fiscal stance. Key goals are to raise tax revenue by 3 percentage points
of GDP by 2009, to 14½ percent, and to achieve the social objectives of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDG) by 2012 (Table 14). Increased social spending would focus on
health, education, water, rural electrification, and rural roads.
•
Move forward with structural reforms. The priorities are to broaden trade opening,
consolidate the stability of the financial system, and alleviate infrastructure constrains. These
actions are expected to tap new sources of growth, mainly from agriculture, agro-business,
textiles, and services sectors (see Chapter II of BN).

- 13 -

15.
The medium-term outlook would improve under this strategy. A baseline scenario
prepared by staff, assuming implementation of the authorities’ strategy and including the
impact of CAFTA, projects an increase in real GDP growth to 3 percent over the medium
term—while this is still slower than in the mid-1990s (4 percent), it is higher than the average
growth rates in 2000–04 (2 percent).

16.
Despite the improved outlook resulting from these policies, important
vulnerabilities would remain:
•
The public finances would remain vulnerable to shocks, as the public debt would
remain relatively high. Staff simulations show that a temporary shock combining slower
growth, a lower primary balance, and higher interest rates would push the public debt up to
52 percent of GDP by 2009 (47 percent in the baseline—Annex).
•
The external position would remain fragile to external shocks. An important
downside risk is associated with competition from East Asia, which could raise the external
current account deficit by some 1 percent of GDP per year over the medium term. This would
raise external debt to 52 percent of GDP by 2009 (46½ percent in the baseline). (Table 10
sumarizes the impact of other shocks.)
•
The economy is also vulnerable to policy slippages. Given the lack of majority in
congress, marshalling the necessary consensus for the government’s reform agenda will be a
challenge. Under an alternative scenario that keeps the tax/GDP ratio and the primary deficit
at the levels projected for 2005—the public debt ratio could approach 55 percent by 2009.
Rising fiscal and external deficits and slower structural reforms would undermine investment
and productivity, and leave growth at the moderate pace of 2000–04 (see Annex).
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.
Against this background, the policy discussions centered on the challenge of
boosting El Salvador’s growth prospects and its resilience to shocks, thereby maximizing
the benefits of the dollarization regime. The main challenge for El Salvador is to boost
investment and productivity, while reducing public debt and building up liquidity cushions.
There was broad agreement between staff and the authorities that the strategy to achieve these
goals should be centered on policies to reverse the recent deterioration in national savings

- 14 -

(through additional fiscal measures), improve competitiveness, further strengthen the banking
system, and upgrade the investment environment. The staff emphasized the importance of
policies to raise growth and reduce vulnerabilities in the context of the dollarization regime—
the measures recommended by staff and the proposed sequence are summarized in Table 15.
18.
To anchor the policy discussions, the staff prepared an “active-policy scenario,”
based on a comprehensive reform

implemented, the staff considered that
growth could accelerate to, and be
maintained at, 4 percent a year over the medium term in the context of macro-stability and the
dollarization regime.
A. Fiscal Policy
19.
The staff recommended further fiscal consolidation to place the public debt on a
downward path. As noted, raising the primary surplus to about 1 percent of GDP from 2006
would lower the public debt to 43 percent of GDP by 2009.12 Recent tax measures (see below)
should be followed by further reforms in the areas of tax policy, tax administration, and
expenditure to yield an additional 0.7–1 percent of GDP. The authorities shared the staff’s
view from a medium-term perspective, but also stressed the more immediate need to address
social and investment priorities, which would lead to a primary deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP
in 2005–06 (the same as in 2004). They expected that political conditions should become more
conducive to further strengthen the fiscal stance after the congressional elections in March
2006. They also saw a chance that, on the basis of the reforms implemented and planned,
growth could pick up faster than projected in the staff’s baseline scenario, which would help
support revenue and fiscal consolidation.

12

In outer years, these evolution would bring the debt ratio within the “safe” range (25–
40 percent of GDP) observed in emerging countries with relatively strong growth and low
incidence of financial crises (WEO, October 2003).

- 15 -

20.
The authorities are taking important tax measures for 2005. Congress recently

potential—evasion on income tax and VAT
is estimated at 2½–3 percent of GDP.
21.
A series of steps are underway to improve tax administration. Reforms to the tax
code (October 2004) have enabled the authorities to tighten penalties for tax delinquency,
phase out bank secrecy for tax purposes, and fight import smuggling. Following FAD
recommendations, the authorities are adopting an action plan to tighten control over large
taxpayers and VAT rebates to exporters, improve cross-checking of tax payments, and
strengthen the tax agency, including by hiring additional tax auditors.
22.
Staff welcomed these initiatives, and encouraged additional revenue reforms. To
attain the fiscal consolidation proposed by staff, the authorities could implement additional
measures as recommended by FAD, including an increase in the VAT rate, adoption of a
property tax, and a gradual increase in excise taxes on petroleum products to levels elsewhere
in the region (as oil market conditions permit).13 The authorities indicated that they prefer to
intensify their strategy to reduce tax evasion before considering further tax measures.
23.
On the expenditure side, the authorities intend to increase priority social and
infrastructure spending. This increase, combined with rising interest and pension outlays,
will result in a substantial increase in total expenditure to about 19½ percent of GDP in 2005–
06 (18 percent in 2004). The authorities emphasized that the higher spending would be
focused on key priority programs, while other spending (such as public sector wages—¶12)
would be strictly contained. They also noted their plans for a substantial increase in private
sector participation in infrastructure projects (power generation, roads, ports, and an airport
cargo terminal).
24.
While progress has been made on expenditure reform, there is room to further
reorient spending toward social and investment priorities. Staff recommended a gradual
13

Staff estimates that raising the VAT rate from 13 to 15 percent would yield about
0.7 percent of GDP, while raising excise taxes on petroleum products to the average in the
region would yield 0.4 percent of GDP. The excise tax now amounts to 31 percent for gasoline
(37 percent in the region) and 24 percent for diesel (45 percent in the region).

- 16 -

increase in the retirement age by five years (to 60 years for women and 65 years for men), and
the transfer of expenditure responsibilities to local governments (following last year’s increase
in the tax-revenue sharing ratio from 6 to 7 percent). Subsidies for water services and liquefied
gas should be better targeted, while the subsidy for nontraditional exports (6 percent of value)
should be eliminated. The authorities agreed with most of these suggestions (which could
yield savings of about ½ of 1 percent of GDP), although they indicated that further pension
reform and decentralization measures would need legislation and a political consensus that
may be difficult to obtain in the near future.
25.
Staff encouraged the authorities to improve public expenditure management, as
recommended by the 2004 ROSC. While many best practices for transparency are being
met, the ROSC recommended the introduction of a multiyear budget and better control of
local governments which are assuming a growing role in implementing social and investment
projects. The authorities are developing a poverty map to improve the targeting of the poorest
areas and the allocation of resources among priorities envisaged in the MDGs.14
26.
The authorities intend to further improve public debt management. They plan
further issuance of 30-year sovereign bonds (3 percent of GDP for 2005), and have requested
new policy loans from the World Bank and the Inter-American Bank (IDB).15 Staff supported
these plans as they will further lengthen debt maturity and diversify financing sources.
B. Central Bank Operations
27.
The authorities intend to implement the pending elements of the dollarization
law, to firmly consolidate the monetary regime.
•
The authorities plan to restructure the balance sheet of the central bank, to make it
fully consistent with dollarization. They intend to submit a restructuring plan to congress in
2005, in order to: (i) replace central bank paper and illiquid claims on the government with
treasury bills; and (ii) transfer other assets and liabilities to the government, as recommended
by the 2004 FSSA. This would remove the liquidity mismatch, leaving the central bank only
with the task of managing prudential liquidity reserves (and the LOLR function, as explained
below). The authorities noted that the restructuring plan may need to be carried out gradually,

14

The World Bank’s public expenditure review of June 2004 found that El Salvador has the
basic foundations of a well-functioning expenditure management system. The report also
identified areas of improvement, including in the process of external audit, internal controls,
and quality of financial data. It recommended to integrate financial management systems and
improve selection and performance indicators for public investment projects.
15

The World Bank’s draft country assistance strategy (expected to be approved in
February 2005) envisages policy loans of US$300 million (1.8 percent of GDP) over 2005–08
in support of the authorities’ growth strategy, while the IDB recently approved a policy loan
(US$100 million for 2005) for basic education.

- 17 -

as outstanding central bank paper matures.16 Staff supported the restructuring plan, noting that
the transfer of central bank net liabilities (2½ percent of GDP) to the government—while not
changing the consolidated fiscal position—would enhance fiscal transparency and contribute
to financial stability.17
•
After restructuring, the central bank will focus on a few core tasks. It will continue to
act as fiscal agent of the government, hold liquid reserves of banks, publish macroeconomic
statistics, and conduct macro prudential research. The authorities agreed with staff that over
the longer term some of these tasks could be efficiently performed by other public agencies or
the private sector; the staff encouraged them to undertake a cost-benefit analysis as a basis for
further reforms in these areas.
28.
Since the restructuring process will take time to implement, staff suggested nearterm steps to improve the conduct of the monetary regime. Guidelines for central bank
credit operations should be set to formalize most practices followed thus far—for example,
setting a floor for government deposits in the central bank and a ceiling on the stock of central
bank paper, and avoiding intervention in the interbank market. Government deposits should be
gradually built up to avoid the need for further placements of central bank paper. The
authorities agreed with these suggestions, although they were not sure that formal guidelines
were needed.
29.
Staff recommended to maintain the current level of liquidity requirements. The
authorities saw some scope for lowering the special liquidity requirement (from 6 to
3 percent), in light of reduced political uncertainty and upcoming banking reforms. They noted
that the requirement could be tightened again whenever necessary. In staff’s view, the cushion
provided by the current liquidity requirements (about 30 percent of deposits) should remain in
place at least until the central bank is restructured and the LOLR function strengthened.18
30.
The staff encouraged the authorities to strengthen the LOLR function over the
medium term. The authorities agreed with staff that, once the restructuring was complete, the
central bank could conduct limited systemic liquidity operations as a lender of last resort.
These operations could take place in the amount of excess NIR (over liquidity requirements).
To this end, the government should bolster further the NIR cushion, possibly by issuing longterm external debt. The staff noted that Fund technical assistance could help in developing the
function of lender of last resort.

16

For 2005, the central bank will broadly maintain its NIR position as outstanding central
bank paper will rise slightly to offset maturing medium- and long-term external liabilities.

17

The consolidated public sector includes the central bank, whose debt is included in public
debt statistics.

18

The coverage of bank deposits in El Salvador compares favorably to other fully and
partially dollarized economies in the region (Table 16).

The authorities plan to deepen banking reforms, along the lines of the
recommendations made by staff. Priorities include strengthening prudential and supervisory
rules, the safety net, and state-owned banks.
•
Prudential norms. The authorities plan to issue regulations
in early 2005 to align current norms with best-practice standards,
over a period of four years. Specifically, they will raise
provisioning requirements, tighten loan classification, and
improve valuation of non-loan assets (repossessed and other fixed
assets). The required CAR was also raised from 11½ to 12 percent
starting in 2005—the final step of a schedule that raised the CAR
from 9 percent in 1999.

Supervision. Reforms to be submitted to congress in early 2005 seek to strengthen
consolidated supervision, enhance autonomy of the superintendency of banks (providing legal
protection to the superintendent and superintendency’s staff when they are performing their
duties in good faith, and clarifying the powers of the board and the superintendent), and
integrate the supervisory agencies (banks, stock market, and pensions). The authorities intend
to develop an early-warning system and shift supervision toward risk management, taking into
account the growing reliance on external borrowing by banks.

19

The application of best-practice prudential standards could result in capital shortfalls,
particularly for the state banks. Under these standards, staff estimates that the average capital
adequacy ratio (CAR) could fall to an adjusted 7½ percent, compared with the reported
average CAR of 13 percent.

- 19 -

Box 3. Summary of Staff Recommendations on Financial Sector Reform
The authorities have stated their intention to address virtually all of the staff recommendations
on financial sector reform.
Main findings
•
Indicators of bank soundness suggest that the system has weathered well the recent
sluggishness in economic growth.
•
The central bank holds the liquidity reserves of banks, but has no commitment to act as
lender of last resort, except as an agent of the government in bank resolution. Dollarization has had
a positive impact on financial sector stability by eliminating exchange rate risk and lowering interest
rates.
•
Supervision of the financial system has been strengthened since 2000, notably the
framework for bank resolution, consolidated supervision, and money laundering.
•
Prudential norms have been strengthened with an increase in the required capital asset
ratios (from 9 percent in 1999 to 12 percent in 2005), and with higher country-risk provisioning to
address the risks of increased cross-border lending.
Main recommendations
•
Central bank operations. Replace central bank paper and illiquid claims on the government
with treasury bills, transfer other liabilities to the government, and improve the lender-of-last-resort
function.
•
Supervision. Strengthen capacity to conduct consolidated supervision, provide legal
protection to supervisory staff, and implement risk-based supervision.
•
Prudential norms. Align current norms on provisioning requirement, loan classification,
and valuation of non-loan assets with best-practice standards.
•
Safety net. Improve bank resolution practices by clarifying the roles of, and coordination
among, the central bank, the superintendency of banks, and the deposit insurance fund. Strengthen
the reserves of the deposit insurance fund.
•
Public sector banks. Further restructure the two state banks, including by reducing costs,
raising provisions, cutting bad loans, and tightening lending criteria.

•

Legal environment. Approve a new Securitization Law to stimulate access to credit and
allow for the efficient allocation of credit risk among borrowers, first and second floor financial
intermediaries, and investors. Enhance the legal basis for commercial dispute resolution, corporate
insolvency, and creditor’s rights.

- 20 -

•
Safety net. In an effort to improve bank resolution practices, the authorities are
developing a framework to clarify the roles of, and coordination among, the central bank, the
superintendency of banks, and the deposit insurance fund in addressing failed banks. On the
deposit insurance fund, the staff recommended to raise bank premia to increase its reserves
over the medium term.20 The authorities agreed with this recommendation, while noting that it
would take time to implement as banks first need to absorb the impact of ongoing reforms
(such as tighter prudential norms, adoption of international accounting standards, and
elimination of tax deduction of provisions).
33.
Public sector banks. The two state banks21 are among the weakest in the banking
system, while the social housing fund has issued large amounts of its own bonds that
constitute a potential future drain to the budget. Along the lines of staff recommendations, the
authorities intend to further restructure these institutions (reducing costs, raising provisions,
cutting nonperforming loans, and tightening lending criteria), although they considered that
their privatization would be politically feasible only over the medium term. In the near term,
they will assess whether these banks could be converted into second-tier banks to support
lending to small businesses.
D. Competitiveness and Other Issues
34.
Staff and the authorities agreed that external competitiveness needs to be
strengthened (see ¶9, Box 2 and Figure 2). The authorities seek to bolster competitiveness
and remove obstacles to productivity and private investment. Their strategy is intended to
create new trade opportunities, alleviate constraints on infrastructure and human capital, and
build upon the reform process already made. The staff supported the authorities’ strategy to
rebuild competitiveness under the dollarization regime and stressed, in particular, the need for
measures to improve the investment climate and enhance labor market flexibility.
35.
The authorities recently secured ratification of CAFTA by congress, and are
working toward free-trade agreements with Canada and the European Union. These
agreements will further deepen the economy’s openness and provide access to new markets.
CAFTA will make permanent the benefits of the Caribbean Basin Initiative and further reduce
the average tariff (now 6½ percent), although a few agricultural products will enjoy long
transition periods (up to 20 years). Potential fiscal costs are expected to be relatively small
(less than 0.3 percent of GDP), given already low tariff rates. CAFTA will also provide
incentives for customs reform and enforcement of important norms (anti-corruption, labor,
environment, property rights, and e-commerce). The recently adopted anti-trust law
(November 2004) should strengthen competition practices and complement the reform of
government procurement (Chapter IV of BN).

20

The staff recommends to raise the fund’s reserves gradually to the equivalent of 5 percent of
deposits, from a current level of 1 percent.

21

Banco de Fomento Agropecuario and Banco Hipotecario, together accounting for about
2½ percent of GDP in deposits.

- 21 -

36.
The authorities are pursuing several other reforms to improve the investment
climate. They plan to encourage private participation in infrastructure (electricity, ports,
airport concessions, water, and roads), upgrade human capital to support higher-technology
companies, and enhance the legal basis for commercial dispute resolution, corporate
insolvency, and creditor rights. To further improve the investment climate, the authorities are
also taking steps to reduce violence and crime (viewed as a problem in the business
community), lower the cost of doing business in El Salvador, strengthen the rule of law, and
upgrade the information technology network.
37.
Staff supported these reforms and encouraged the authorities also to seek further
improvements in the labor market. While the labor market is relatively flexible, further
reforms are needed to allow for hourly wages and reduce overtime costs.22 The authorities
agreed with the staff’s recommendations, but indicated that political support for these actions
would be feasible only over the medium term.
38.
Economic statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes, and improvements
along the lines of the 2003 ROSC data module are being implemented. The ROSC
identified poor source data and inadequate compilation techniques as major impediments to
improving the quality of statistics. With STA assistance, the authorities have developed a
timetable to improve the national accounts and government finance statistics. They also plan
to adopt a new framework law to enhance interagency coordination for data sharing, which
would help improve the quality of source data.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
El Salvador has implemented a wide range of structural reforms over the past
decade. The reform effort culminated in the adoption of official dollarization in 2001, which
the authorities view as a cornerstone of their market and stability-oriented policy framework.
This strategy brought rapid growth initially, an investment-grade rating, and substantial
improvements in social conditions. In recent years, however, growth has been sluggish and
new economic vulnerabilities have emerged, such as those related to the rising public debt.
While the slow growth is attributable to adverse shocks and election-related uncertainties—
suggesting a sound basis for stronger growth when the external conditions improve—it will be
crucial for El Salvador to continue on its reform path in the coming years, with focus on
addressing economic vulnerabilities and removing the remaining barriers to growth. This
agenda is, in a nutshell, what is needed to solidify and make the best of dollarization, a most
demanding monetary regime.
40.
Economic conditions remained subdued in 2004, despite the global and regional
recovery. Growth was under 2 percent, owing to sluggish export and investment growth, and
inflation rose due to higher world oil prices. The fiscal deficit declined due to lower
earthquake reconstruction outlays, although the public debt ratio stayed at a relatively high
45 percent of GDP. Increased family remittances helped support incomes and the external
22

laws are among the most flexible in the region (after Costa Rica).

- 22 -

position, but national savings declined further, with possible implications for investment and
future growth prospects.
41.
The new government that took office in June 2004 has adopted a reform agenda
to improve growth and social prospects. The staff welcomes the recent approval by
congress of a revenue package and CAFTA, and supports planned initiatives to improve the
banking system, alleviate investment constraints, and achieve the MDGs goals. These actions
are critical to enhance growth prospects and foster social cohesion, and the staff welcomes the
broad consensus achieved to support them.
42.
Looking ahead, the staff encourages the authorities to broaden the reform agenda
to meet the challenge of reviving growth in a lasting way, reducing vulnerabilities, and
maximizing the benefits from dollarization. There is a need to boost investment and
productivity, reduce public debt and external vulnerability, and build liquidity buffers. To this
end, the policy strategy should focus on raising national savings, improving competitiveness,
further reforming the public sector, strengthening the banking system, and improving the
investment climate.
43.
The staff supports the authorities’ medium-term plans to substantially increase
revenues and priority spending. In particular, the staff endorses the authorities’ aim to raise
tax revenues by 3 percentage points of GDP over the medium term. The implementation of
revenue measures already in train, including ongoing efforts to improve tax administration,
will contribute to this goal, but additional measures would be needed to fully accomplish it.
Moreover, because the authorities also plan to increase substantially social and infrastructure
spending, the staff projects only modest improvements in the primary fiscal balance. In turn,
the public debt ratio would stabilize at a relatively high level, leaving the public finances
vulnerable to shocks and slippages in policy implementation.
44.
The staff therefore recommends further measures to place the public debt firmly
on a downward path while raising priority spending. The authorities’ medium-term fiscal
program should aim at raising the primary surplus to about 1 percent of GDP. To this end,
recent revenue measures should be buttressed by further steps to strengthen the tax effort,
including a possible increase in the VAT rate, and expenditure reforms should include further
pension reform, improved control over local governments’ expenditure, and better targeting of
subsidies. The staff supports the authorities’ debt management objectives of further
lengthening of maturities and reducing financing costs, which would also be helped by the
recommended strengthening of the overall fiscal position.
45.
The staff supports the authorities’ commitment to restructuring the central bank,
consistent with the dollarization regime. The planned transfer of central bank liabilities to
the government will eliminate central bank liquidity risks and contribute to fiscal
transparency. Once this restructuring is complete, the central bank should develop further its
lender-of-last-resort function, and the government should provide for a larger cushion of NIR
over the medium term. Meanwhile, the authorities should maintain prudential liquidity
requirements at current levels to mitigate potential systemic liquidity risks.
46.
The authorities’ strategy for banking reforms is appropriate. The staff endorses
the gradual alignment of prudential rules with best-practice standards, as recommended by the

- 23 -

staff. The envisaged strategy to strengthen consolidated supervision, the autonomy of the
superintendency of banks, and bank resolution practices is commendable. Staff recommends
to continue efforts to strengthen public financial institutions and the deposit insurance fund
over the medium term.
47.
The staff welcomes the recent ratification by congress of CAFTA and the plans to
secure free-trade agreements with Canada and the European Union. To take full
advantage of trade and investment opportunities, policies need to focus on strengthening
competitiveness. In this regard, the staff supports the authorities’ plans to alleviate
infrastructure constraints, upgrade the investment climate, and improve human capital.
Moreover, staff recommends to pursue further trade integration within the framework of
multilateral trade negotiations. Staff also encourages the authorities to further enhance labor
market flexibility and improve the procedures for corporate insolvency, business dispute
resolution, and creditors rights.
48.
El Salvador’s economic statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes, and the
staff welcomes the ongoing efforts to improve them further in line with Fund
recommendations.
49.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with El Salvador be held
on the standard 12-month cycle.

ANNEX

EL SALVADOR—PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. Background
1.
El Salvador’s public sector debt has risen rapidly since 1999, although its
structure has improved. Public debt is projected to reach 45 percent of GDP in 2004
compared to 34 percent in 1999. In contrast, gross financing needs have declined recently,
owing to the substitution of most short-term debt with long-term sovereign bonds in 2002.
Prudent debt management has doubled the average maturity of the public debt to nearly ten
years over the period 1999–2004.
2.
The increase in debt reflects sizable primary fiscal deficits. Primary deficits
averaged nearly 2 percent of GDP per year during 1999–2004, driven in part by postearthquake reconstruction outlays and pension reform costs. Despite low real interest rates,
the interest burden climbed in 2002-03 owing to the rising debt level. The use of privatization
proceeds (nearly 2 percent of GDP) to cover the fiscal deficit is expected to slightly reduce
the debt ratio in 2004.

B. Baseline Scenario
3.
Under the authorities’ planned policies, staff project public debt to stabilize at
about 47 percent of GDP over the medium term. The projection is based on:

- 44 -

ANNEX

•

A shift in the primary balance from a deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP per year in 200506 to a small surplus thereafter;

•

An increase in the real interest rate to 3¾ percent over the period (2.4 percent in
2003), in line with WEO projections; and

•

Real GDP growth of 3 percent per year, due to improved investment and productivity.

4.
Under this scenario, the public finances would remain vulnerable to shocks.
While relatively low gross financing needs would provide some protection against adverse
shocks, a shift in market sentiment could heighten funding costs and shorten average
maturity over time. Standard sensitivity tests indicate that the debt dynamics are sensitive to
fiscal shocks and output growth volatility. Using 2004 as a starting point and two-standard
deviation shocks for 2005–06, a higher primary deficit (or lower GDP growth) would
increase the debt ratio by 6 percentage points (or 3 percentage points) of GDP by 2009,
compared to the baseline scenario (Figure 1)

Shocks to baseline projection (two-standard deviations from historical levels in 2005–06 for output
growth, interest rate, and primary balance):
1.
Real GDP grows by 0.8 percent, compared to 3 percent in the baseline.
2.
Real interest rate increases to 4.9 percent from 3.5 percent in the baseline.
3.
The primary deficit reaches 3.2 percent of GDP from a small surplus in the baseline.

- 45 -

ANNEX

C. Other Scenarios
5.
Reinforced-policy scenario. Further fiscal consolidation and structural reforms as
recommended by staff would improve debt dynamics. This scenario assumes a recovery in
growth to levels in the 1990s (4 percent) and a primary surplus of 1 percent of GDP over the
medium term, mainly as a result of further tax and expenditure reform. This would lead to a
steady decline in the public debt to under 43 percent of GDP by 2009 (Figure 2), or
230 percent of government revenue (compared to nearly 270 percent in the baseline).
External indebtedness would fall to under 140 percent of exports by 2009 (nearly 170 percent
in 2004).
6.
Alternative (adverse) scenario. The main downside risks to the baseline scenario
stem from fiscal slippages. Public debt would rise to nearly 55 percent of GDP by 2009
under the assumption that: (i) the primary deficit remains at 0.7 percent of GDP over the
period, and (ii) growth is the same as in the baseline scenario.

FIN completed the off-site safeguards assessment of the central reserve bank
(BCR) in 2002. The BCR’s safeguards were generally adequate, and a stage two
(on-site) assessment was not needed. Based on the recommendations of the
safeguards assessment, the BCR (i) has agreed to publish the audited general
balance sheet, income statement, and the opinion on the financial statements; (ii)
is adopting International Accounting Standards (IAS), with the expectation that
the 2004 financial statements will be fully compliant with IAS; and (iii)
restructured its audit committee in January 2003 to have a majority representation
of independent directors to ensure objectivity on the audit process.

Exchange Arrangement:
Effective January 1, 2001, the dollar became legal tender and circulates freely.
The dollar is used as a unit of account and a medium of exchange, with no
limitations. All payments may be made in either dollars or colones. The BCR has

APPENDIX I

the obligation to exchange colones in circulation for dollars upon request from
banks, at a fixed and unalterable exchange rate of C 8.75 per U.S. dollar. As a
result, El Salvador has an exchange rate arrangement with no separate legal tender
category.
El Salvador has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.

APPENDIX II

II. Recent and Planned IBRD Activities
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by the Board in November 2001.
The CAS covered the FY02–04 period and supported three interrelated development
objectives: (i) sustaining efforts to reduce poverty and promoting social development; (ii)
accelerating growth and developing new opportunities; and (iii) fine tuning the role of the
public sector. It proposed lending of US$270 million over FY02–04, with a base case of five
planned operations. Only two of the five planned projects were delivered during FY02–04:
the Earthquake Emergency Reconstruction for US$142.6 million and Judicial Modernization
for US$18.2 million. This was largely because some of the projects were postponed by the
government as it faced severe fiscal constraints in the aftermath of the earthquakes. As a
result, the Bank’s current lending portfolio in El Salvador includes six investment projects in
the areas of education, land administration, public sector management and health
infrastructure totaling US$381 million, of which US$184 million (48 percent) had been
disbursed as of November 30, 2004.
The Bank Group’s assistance will be elaborated in a new Country Assistance Strategy
covering FY05–08 which will propose a strategic program of lending and nonlending
services to support the three main pillars of the government’s development plan “Safe
Country 2004–2009”: (i) to accelerate broad-based, equitable economic growth and increase
employment; (ii) to improve equity through building human capital and expanding access to
socioeconomic infrastructure, assets and markets; and (iii) to enhance security and reduce
vulnerability. In this context, Bank assistance would include: (i) support for implementation
of the existing loan portfolio; (ii) new IBRD lending, including a Program of Development
Policy Loans as the central component of the strategy, and investment operations in selective
areas where the Bank has global expertise and comparative advantage and which
complement the activities of other key development partners; (iii) analytical and advisory
work, technical assistance, and facilitation of access by El Salvador to grants administered by
the World Bank; (iv) learning and capacity development programs through the World Bank
Institute (WBI) and the Global Distance Learning Center (GDLN) and (v) targeted private
sector assistance provided by IFC and MIGA. The new CAS is scheduled for Bank Board
presentation in January 2005.
In June 2004, the Bank completed five core diagnostic studies for El Salvador: a Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM), focusing on sources of growth; a Poverty Assessment (PA)
focusing on recent poverty and inequality trends; a Public Expenditure Review (PER)
focusing on broad fiscal issues, the public expenditure management system and social sector
expenditures; a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) assessing the public
expenditure management framework; and a Country Procurement Assessment (CPAR). In
nonformal economic and sector work, the Corporate Social Responsibility Group worked
with the government on strategies to stimulate dialogue around appropriate stakeholder roles
in strengthening the implementation of an education-focused Corporate Social Responsibility
Strategy.

El Salvador: Core Statistical Indicators

- 51 APPENDIX IV

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
January 31, 2005
1.
The information on recent developments presented below has become available since
the staff report was issued. It does not affect the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Inflation rose to 5.4 percent (year-on-year) in December. The increase reflected
mainly higher oil prices, and was in line with the projection in the staff report. Core inflation
(excluding food and oil prices) was 4 percent.
3.
Preliminary data indicate a stronger fiscal performance for 2004 than estimated
earlier. The overall public sector deficit is now estimated at 2.6 percent of GDP in 2004
(3 percent in the staff report), with the primary deficit amounting to 0.3 percent of GDP. The
improvement reflected mainly stronger tax collections and lower capital spending, and led to
a build up in public sector deposits at the central bank.
4.
As a result, the net international reserves position was also stronger than
anticipated. Net international reserves (NIR) reached US$1.9 billion at end-2004, some
US$150 million higher than originally projected.
5.
Congress is expected to approve the 2005 budget shortly. It has already approved
the limit on public sector borrowing proposed by the authorities. The budget coming out of
congress is expected to be broadly in line with the draft submitted by the authorities.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 14, 2005

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with
El Salvador
On January 31, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with El Salvador.1
Background
El Salvador has implemented a wide range of structural reforms over the last decade.
Impressive reforms—including trade opening, privatization, and tax policy, civil service,
and pension reform—have been supported by a broad national consensus. The reform effort
was capped with official dollarization in 2001, which helped reduce interest rates and
consolidated low inflation. This strategy has contributed to considerable improvements in per
capita income and social conditions.
Nevertheless, economic growth in recent years has been dampened by adverse external
conditions (including high oil prices), major earthquakes, and election-related uncertainties.
Real GDP growth is estimated at about 1½ percent in 2004, while inflation picked up to over
5 percent, owing to higher oil prices. The public sector deficit is expected to decline to
3 percent of GDP in 2004 (from nearly 4 percent in 2003), although public debt remained at
45 percent of GDP and the debt of the nonfinancial public sector at 40.7 percent of GDP.

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of the Executive Directors, and this

The new government that took office in 2004 has embarked on a renewed reform effort to
improve growth prospects and social conditions. A recently approved package of tax
measures, including steps to improve tax administration, is projected to raise revenue by
about 1 percent of GDP. Because of budgeted increases in social spending and investment,
however, the fiscal position in 2005 will remain about the same as in 2004 (i.e., a primary
deficit of about 0.7 percent of GDP). Planned banking reforms (including tighter prudential
norms and improved supervision) are aimed at further strengthening the banking system.
congress recently ratified a free-trade agreement with the United States (CAFTA).
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors praised El Salvador’s long-standing record of structural reform and
commitment to sound macroeconomic policies, and considered that official dollarization has
served El Salvador well. Prudent policies and political stability have underpinned economic
growth, significant poverty reduction, low inflation, and increased market confidence as
reflected in El Salvador’s investment-grade credit rating. Directors noted, however, that
major challenges remain. Central among these is the need to revive economic growth, which
has been sluggish as a result of natural disasters, declining terms of trade, and the economic
slowdown in the United States. In addition, Directors stressed that dollarization still presents
significant challenges, and that additional efforts are required to ensure its sustainability.
These efforts should focus on strengthening the public finances and achieving debt
sustainability.
Against this background, Directors welcomed the new government’s reform agenda
designed to consolidate the economic gains and maximize the benefits of dollarization,
improve growth and social prospects, reduce external vulnerabilities, and achieve the
Millennium Development Goals. They supported the agenda’s focus on fiscal consolidation
and structural reforms to raise national savings and improve productivity and
competitiveness. They put particular emphasis on efforts to deepen trade reform, address
infrastructure bottlenecks, increase labor market flexibility, and improve incentives for private
investment. Above all, Directors observed that it will be important to build society’s support
for the reform agenda.
Directors considered that moderate primary fiscal surpluses will be required to place the
public debt firmly on a downward path. In this context, they endorsed the authorities’
medium-term plans to substantially increase tax revenues, including by strengthening tax
administration to reduce tax evasion, and welcomed congress’ recent approval of a package
of revenue measures. Most Directors considered that additional measures may be needed in
light of plans to boost social and infrastructure spending. Apart from further steps to
strengthen the revenue side, Directors also encouraged the authorities to improve public
expenditure management—including through further pension reform, improved control over
local government expenditure, better targeting of subsidies, and other measures
recommended in the 2004 Fiscal Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes. At the
same time, they welcomed the planned increase in social and infrastructure spending, while
containing non-productive spending and the wage bill, noting that well-targeted social

-3investment is crucial for building human capital. They also supported plans to involve the
private sector in infrastructure projects. Directors welcomed recent reforms to the pension
system, stressing at the same time the need for increases in the retirement age.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ debt management strategy, which aims at further
lengthening maturities and reducing financing costs.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to make financial sector strengthening a priority in
the coming years, including the restructuring of the central bank. They encouraged the
authorities to push ahead with the planned transfer of the central bank’s non-monetary
liabilities to the government, in order to eliminate central bank liquidity risks and enhance
fiscal transparency. Some Directors also recommended that the central bank develop further
its lender of last resort function and raise net international reserves over the medium term.
Directors welcomed the findings of the 2004 Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA)
update, which indicate that the financial sector generally is in good health and that
dollarization has strengthened financial stability. They commended the authorities’ strategy
for banking sector reform and the envisaged alignment of prudential rules with international
best practice, in line with the FSSA recommendations. They stressed, in particular,
the importance of plans to strengthen consolidated supervision—especially for cross-border
activities—as well as the autonomy of the superintendency of banks and bank resolution
practices. Directors also called for a strengthening of the two state-owned banks and the
deposit insurance fund. They also considered enhanced access to financial services and
financial literacy programs to be essential for raising the national savings rate and
channeling El Salvador’s significant remittance inflows into investment rather than
consumption.
Directors welcomed congress’ recent ratification of the Central American Free Trade
Agreement. They supported plans to secure free-trade agreements with other important
trading partners, but also stressed the importance of pursuing further trade integration within
the framework of multilateral trade negotiations. They emphasized that enhanced
competitiveness and productivity will be needed to enable El Salvador to take full advantage
of trade and investment opportunities arising from these agreements. In this regard,
Directors welcomed the steps being taken to maintain a prudent wage policy, while stressing
that further labor market flexibility will be important to keep labor costs competitive. It will be
important also to improve the environment for private investment, including by reducing
crime and corruption, strengthening the legal and regulatory environment, and improving
governance and transparency.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ ongoing efforts to improve macroeconomic statistics in
line with Fund recommendations. In particular, they commended plans to improve the
national accounts and government finance statistics within a framework of strengthened
inter-agency coordination and data sharing.
Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.

Statement by Moises Schwartz, Executive Director for El Salvador
and Gerardo Peraza, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
January 31, 2005
On behalf of the Salvadoran authorities, we thank staff for its constructive policy advice
during the Article IV consultation discussions. We would like also to convey the authority’s
appreciation for a very professional and timely technical assistance particularly on tax reform
and financial sector issues. The authorities broadly agree with the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Over more than 12 years, El Salvador has embarked on a path of market-oriented reforms
that have brought in macroeconomic stability and a substantial improvement in
socioeconomic conditions. As reported by staff, El Salvador “is often considered to be the
second-best performer on reforms in Latin America [only after Chile]” while it is the only
country in Central America with an investment grade.
In 2001, El Salvador capped the reform effort by officially adopting the U.S. dollar as a legal
tender. So far, the dollarization has proven very helpful in anchoring expectations by
lowering interest rates and consolidating low inflation. As this Chair indicated during the
2003 Article IV Consultation, the dollarization in the case of El Salvador “makes sense”
given the close ties to the U.S. economy. Nonetheless, the Salvadoran authorities recognize
that the regimen choice places great demand on a policy framework that needs to rely solely
on sound and thorough economic reform as the only viable alternative to achieve sustainable
and faster economic growth.
Moreover, El Salvador still faces important challenges. In this context, the government of
President Saca that took office in June 2004 is confident that the proposed reform agenda
(nicely summarized on table 15 of the staff report) will reinforce the dollarization regime
while reinvigorate growth and facilitate a more effective reduction in poverty. Core elements
of the authorities’ agenda for the next five years are: (i) maintaining fiscal sustainability
while promoting social equity, (ii) strengthening the financial system, and (iii) pursuing
structural reforms to raise productivity. The authorities strongly believe that a successful
implementation of their plans hinges on building the necessary domestic consensus around
key policy issues.
Recent developments and prospects
After experiencing strong economic growth in the first half of the 90’s, El Salvador’s
economy decelerated reflecting an adverse external environment, weak productivity, and two
powerful earthquakes in 2001. In 2004, authorities’ latest estimates put output growth at 1.8
percent (y/y) despite the negative impact of higher oil prices, uncertainty related to the
Presidential elections, and the holdup of new investment projects due to delay in passing the
2004 fiscal budget. Inflation closed at 5.4 percent reflecting mostly higher oil prices while
the external current account narrowed thanks to a sharp pick up in family remittances.
Preliminary fiscal data also indicate a better fiscal balance on account of lower than projected
capital spending and tax buoyancy toward the end of the year. The financial sector remains

-2sound and the banks well capitalized with the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) at 12.8 in
November 2004, with none of the banks reporting a CAR below the minimum requirement.
Looking forward, authorities are optimistic about growth and employment prospects. Strong
capital inflows (in telecommunication, financial and manufacturing sectors) later last year
signal an important backing to the authorities’ policies. In addition, several projects will start
operations during the first half of 2005 including a call center for Dell Computers and two
textiles companies specialized in higher value-added products. Traditional agricultural
products are already showing a strong rebound spurred by new business opportunities.
Lastly, this week passage of the 2005 budget also bodes well for a timing execution of public
investment program.
Achieving fiscal sustainability with social equity
The Salvadoran authorities are fully committed to ensure the sustainability of public debt.
They are also trying to strike the right balance between public debt dynamics and higher
social and capital spending. This is the same dilemma faced by several developing nations
where addressing social inequalities is central to garner needed domestic support for reforms.
Against this backdrop, the authorities moved quickly (within the first six months in office) to
secure the passage of a comprehensive fiscal reform expected to yield about 1.3 percent of
GDP (on annual basis) in additional revenue. Thus, in 2005, they plan to accommodate
higher public investment (almost 1 percent of GDP) at the same time they maintain the
primary deficit at last year level. Investment priorities for this year include the reconstruction
of regional hospitals, rural electrification, water and basic infrastructure, and the beginning of
the Cutuco port. This port facility will reduce cost and increase the capacity to export and the
attractiveness of El Salvador for private investment. In addition, the 2005 budget already
reflects the new social priorities of the government by reorienting public spending to expand
the coverage and quality of health and education. The government has designed a social
safety net program to be launched in the first quarter of 2005, with the assistance of the
World Bank and the IADB, to direct public spending toward the most vulnerable
municipalities.
On public debt management, the Salvadoran authorities have succeeded in lengthening the
maturity of the debt by issuing long-term sovereign bonds and replacing a significant portion
of short-term debt. A recent example is the placement of US$287 million in 30-year bonds at
a fixed interest rate of 7.6 percent (270 basis points over comparable U.S. treasury bills, one
of the lowest in Latin America). As a result, by end-2004, about 75 percent of nonfinancial
public sector debt had a maturity of more than 10 years.
Looking forward, the authorities are confident that greater emphasis on tax administration
will raise tax revenue by 3 percent of GDP in the period 2005-09 while stabilizing the
nonfinancial public sector debt at around 38½ percent of GDP by 2009. Despite this fiscal
constraint, the authorities plan to increase gradually over the next five years social spending
as a percentage of GDP. The authorities will pursue a close monitoring of the fiscal position
and be ready to adopt further fiscal reforms if necessary to achieve the debt objective.

-3Strengthening financial sector
Further strengthening of the financial sector remains a central priority in the authorities’
agenda. Since 2000, the authorities have made important progress toward strengthening the
regulation and supervision of the financial system. Most notably, policy actions include
issuance of provisions for bank regularization and restructuring; improvements in onsite- and
offsite-bank examinations; introduction of anti-money laundering procedures; and adoption
of a plan to converge to International Financial Reporting Standards. In addition, as the
financial sectors in Central America become more integrated and with conglomerates
controlling an important share of the Salvadoran banks, the authorities have issued
supervisory guidelines and improved communication with other regional supervisors to begin
implementing consolidated supervision.
The government’s financial sector agenda for the next coming years aims to restructure the
central bank, strengthen further bank regulation and supervision, reinforce micro-lending,
and enhance the insolvency and creditor rights system. Specific policy actions are in line
with Fund staff recommendations. The authorities plan to request technical assistance in
some of the key areas.
Trade and competitiveness
The authorities are determined to bolster the economy competitiveness by opening new trade
opportunities, improving the investment climate, and enhancing domestic security. A faster
growing economy is essential, along targeted public policy, to cause a significant dent in
poverty.
In this context, El Salvador has pursued a very active and ambitious trade agenda. The
country has already signed a number of bilateral agreements (México, Chile, Panamá and the
Dominican Republic). At the same time, it continues to promote greater integration with
neighboring countries marked more recently with the elimination of physical customs post
between at the Guatemala-El Salvador borders. Honduras is expected to join in later this
year. Regional trade is more diversified than extra-regional trade and benefit directly a larger
number of small- and medium-size enterprises.
In 2004, El Salvador was the first country in Central America to ratify CAFTA. Full
ratification of the trade agreement will cement the benefits under the Caribbean Basin
Initiative and open up new business opportunities. CAFTA could bring lasting benefits in
terms of the modernization of the institutional and legal framework, prior conditions for a
more attractive investment climate. The Central American countries are negotiating a free
trade agreement with Canada and are preparing the groundwork to start negotiations with the
European Union.
On business environment, last November, the authorities secured passage of key anti-trust
legislation to strengthen competition practices and protect trade and commerce from unfair
practices. The Judicial Branch is also undergoing a process of modernization to enhance
private security of individuals and for the protection of contracts and of investors’ rights—

-4both key conditions of a well functioning market economy. In addition, President Saca has
promoted a series of initiatives to tackle crime and violence while preserving human rights
and civil liberties. Finally, the authorities have reiterated their commitment to strengthening
anti-corruption and transparency initiatives to improve El Salvador’s overall investment
climate and a more effective public sector.
