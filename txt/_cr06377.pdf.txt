EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent developments and prospects
A mild recovery is underway but the economic environment remains difficult. Several years
of rapidly rising unit labor costs have substantially undermined competitiveness. Investment
has collapsed, the unemployment rate has doubled, the 2005 fiscal deficit reached 6 percent
of GDP, and the current account deficit has swollen to more than 9 percent of GDP. A
lengthy period of adjustment will be required not only to restore external competitiveness but
also to ensure the sustainability of public finances.
Key policy requirements
The authorities’ program emphasizes fiscal consolidation based on high-quality and durable
expenditure measures and structural reforms to increase productivity and restore
competitiveness. Timely and decisive implementation of these initiatives will be necessary to
maintain the credibility of the government’s program.
Securing fiscal consolidation: The 2006 budget plans a reduction in the deficit to
4.6 percent of GDP, implying just over 1½ percentage points of structural adjustment. The
authorities were confident the deficit target would be achieved but committed to undertake
additional measures if needed. The authorities expect major structural fiscal reforms to be in
effect next year but acknowledged that their yield was difficult to forecast, and the staff
urged that their impact be assessed cautiously in the 2007 budget. Additional adjustment will
be required even after 2008, when the deficit is programmed to fall below 3 percent of GDP,
in light of the projected fiscal effects of population aging.
Restoring competitiveness: Some progress has already been achieved in improving the
business environment and stimulating greater domestic competition. The authorities’
Technological Plan aims to support private investment in R&D and IT, but further
enhancements to the business environment will remain a priority. The authorities continue to
assign a lower priority to labor market reform, arguing that de facto employment protection
is weaker than standardized indicators suggest. The staff views reforms to employment
protection legislation and collective bargaining arrangements as an essential component of
any strategy to contain unit labor costs.
Safeguarding the financial sector: The FSAP found that the financial sector has weathered
the weak macroeconomic environment of recent years well, and no major changes are called
for in prudential arrangements. Key risks arise from high household and corporate debt
levels, concentrated bank lending, and banks’ exposure to equity price fluctuations through
their employee pension funds. Staff encouraged the authorities to keep these risks under
close monitoring and to implement FSAP recommendations.

I. OVERVIEW AND KEY ISSUES
1.
Reestablishing income convergence and resolving large fiscal and external
imbalances remain Portugal’s key challenges. Growth has averaged just over ½ percent
since 2000 (Figures 1 and 2), in part due to rapidly rising unit labor costs that have
substantially undermined competitiveness (Figure 3). Investment has collapsed, the
unemployment rate has doubled, and the current account deficit has swollen to more than
9 percent of GDP (Figure 4). Owing partly to slow growth, but more fundamentally to rising
primary spending and the abandonment of one-off measures, the SGP-monitored fiscal
deficit reached 6 percent of GDP last year, leading to the launching of the second Excessive
Deficit Procedure by the EU in just three years (Figure 5). Portugal confronts a difficult
environment, with sizable fiscal and balance of payments deficits; a weak competitive
position, especially within an enlarged EU; and high private indebtedness.
2.
A sustained period of adjustment will be needed to restore external
competitiveness and the sustainability of the public finances. A sharp fall in total factor
productivity lies at the root of Portugal’s poor

averaged 1.0 percent in the euro area but just
0.2 percent in Portugal. Poor TFP growth can be traced to very low levels of human capital,
but also to shortcomings in the business environment—including excessive regulation and a
slow legal framework—and to insufficient competition in domestic markets, especially in
key network sectors where some former-monopolies maintain a dominant share. While the
growth impact of measures to address these problems is difficult to quantify, it is potentially
very significant: a recent study by McKinsey has estimated that about two-thirds of the gap
between Portuguese per capita GDP and that of the top five EU countries could be eliminated
over time through improvements to the policy environment.1 Meanwhile, growth of nominal
wages has dramatically exceeded that of productivity, notwithstanding a rise in
unemployment, suggesting the presence of significant labor market rigidities. Staff analysis

points to a substantial loss of competitiveness that will take years to fully reverse even with
strong productivity growth and considerable wage moderation (Box 1).2 Restoring the
sustainability of the fiscal accounts will likewise demand continued consolidation into the
next decade.
3.
The strategy laid out last year by the government to confront these challenges
set appropriate objectives. The main elements of the strategy were threefold:
•

Fiscal consolidation to bring the deficit under 3 percent of GDP by 2008 without oneoff measures;

•

Structural fiscal reforms to contain aging-related spending and raise the efficiency
and quality of public spending, to promote the sustainability of the public finances;
and

•

Reforms to enhance competition in product markets and improve the business
environment, with a view toward spurring productivity growth.

4.
Progress with some bedrock structural reforms has been slow, however, and
redoubled efforts are needed to safeguard the credibility of the government’s program.
Reforms of the civil service pension scheme and health sector have been introduced, and
recent initiatives have reduced bureaucratic red tape (Box 2.) However, some critical planned
structural fiscal reforms—to the civil service, to the structure of the public sector, and to the
social security system for private sector workers—had as of mid-2006 yet to be enacted.
Recently, momentum on these reforms has been restored, but even after their approval
rigorous implementation will be required. Some progress has been achieved in improving the
business environment, but more needs to be done—especially in labor markets—to facilitate
investment and innovation, promote wage moderation, and reverse competitiveness losses.
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
5.
A gradual recovery is underway after a largely flat 2005, but the authorities and
the mission expected growth to remain relatively slow in the short-term. Staff projects
growth of 1.2 percent in 2006 and 1½ percent in 2007, in line with official forecasts and
recent high frequency indicators (Figure 6).

Strong foreign demand is expected to lead to a better external contribution to growth
than in previous years.

See the accompanying Selected Issues Paper.

11

Box 1. Measures of Competitiveness
A range of indicators point to a competitiveness gap versus other euro-area
members of 10–20 percent. Portugal’s ULC-based real effective exchange rate has
appreciated by about 10 percent since the mid 1990s (the benchmark period for
Portugal). Over the same period, unit labor costs in manufacturing rose some
20 percentage points faster than for euro-area competitors, and profit margins for
Portuguese exporters fell by 15 percent relative to those of exporters from other euroarea countries. Smidkova and Bulir’s (2004) estimates of fundamental exchange rates
indicate that by end-2003 the euro was 10–20 percent too strong in real terms for
Portugal. Staff estimates suggest that a real depreciation of 12–20 percent would be
needed to generate a trade balance consistent with stabilizing net external liabilities at
their 2005 level.
The loss in competitiveness is

substantial compression of margins.
Closing the competitiveness gap will likely require a long adjustment period, even
with a dramatic jump in TFP growth and strong wage moderation. Assuming
future ULC growth of 1 percent annually for the euro area (as in the April 2006 WEO
projections), even if Portuguese ULCs were to fall at a rate of 2 percent annually it
would still take three–seven years to close the competitiveness gap with the euro area.
Moreover, if capital deepening were to contribute 1 percent annually to labor
productivity growth over that period (slightly above the rate experienced in 2001–04),
even an increase in annual TFP growth to 1 percent (the euro-area average for those
years) would leave no room for nominal wage growth in Portugal under this scenario.
While these calculations are simply illustrative, and are—as the authorities pointed
out—subject to considerable uncertainty, they demonstrate the scale of the problem
Portugal faces and the critical role that reforms to boost productivity and promote wage
moderation must play in restoring competitiveness.

12
Box 2. Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
The authorities’ fiscal strategy emphasizes medium-term expenditure
containment and sets a pace of adjustment in line with Fund policy advice. In
recent years, the Fund has called for fiscal consolidation through structural expenditure
measures, including civil service reform. In 2002–04, though, the government relied on
substantial one-off measures to bring the deficit within SGP limits. In 2005, adjustment
depended mostly on revenue measures, pending the implementation of planned
spending reforms. Progress with Fund-advocated steps to strengthen budget planning
and control and move toward comprehensive multiyear budget targets has been slow,
although steps in this direction are under consideration.
The Fund has advocated structural reforms to strengthen the business
environment and promote competition in product markets, as well as improved
flexibility in labor markets. Steps have been taken to reduce red tape and improve the
working of product markets. Measures to enhance labor market flexibility, though,
have not been a high priority.

•

Domestic demand, by contrast, is forecast to remain weak. Consumption growth is
projected to slow, reflecting weak employment growth and necessary adjustments to
household balance sheets: at end-2005, household debt was close to 120 percent of
disposable income, more than double its level of eight years earlier and the secondhighest figure in the euro area. While some corporate balance sheet restructuring has
occurred, still-high enterprise debt levels will retard investment, as well (Box 3).3
Fiscal adjustment will likewise weigh on domestic demand growth in the short term.

The staff sees a further strengthening of growth over the medium term, rising to about
2¼ percent in 2009, still well below the 3 percent rate foreseen for that year in the
authorities’ December 2005 Stability Program update.

Box 3. Understanding Investment Behavior in Portugal
Does the decline in corporate investment in Portugal reflect a more pessimistic private
sector view of growth prospects, or high levels of indebtedness following the 1990s
investment boom? Estimates using quarterly data from 1987 to 2005 suggest the
answer is “both”: investment reacts strongly to expected future output growth and is
also negatively correlated with enterprises’ lagged debt levels. Thus, while structural
reforms to improve the fiscal environment and raise productivity—thus enhancing
potential growth—should have a positive effect on private investment in the future, its
recovery will be attenuated by the impact of still-high corporate debt. In this sense, the
relatively inefficient corporate investment in the late 1990s could serve as a drag on
growth prospects in the future.

6.
Inflation in 2006–07 is forecast to remain stable. The inflationary effect of last
year’s 2 percentage point VAT rate increase is estimated at about ¼ to ½ percentage point.
With this effect fully incorporated in price data by the second half of the year, inflation is
projected to recede to about 2½ percent by the end of this year and in 2007. Nevertheless, the
relatively high rate of price growth despite an output gap estimated by staff at about
1¾ percent of potential output is suggestive of rigidities in product and labor markets that
contribute to high costs of doing business and compromise competitiveness.
7.
The external deficit is projected to continue widening. Notwithstanding the recent
pickup in exports, the oil price-induced terms of trade loss and still-high imports would bring
the deficit, excluding capital transfers, to about 10 percent of GDP this year and next. The
deficit would continue to be financed by medium- and long-term bank borrowing. Under the
staff’s baseline scenario, the current account deficit would narrow to about 7½ percent of
GDP by 2010, bringing the net international investment position to a deficit of 88 percent of
GDP (versus 66 percent in 2005).4 Portuguese firms have encountered no generalized
difficulty in attracting external financing, which with the advent of the common currency
now depends almost exclusively on individual firm solvency. Nevertheless, to the extent that
the projected sizable external deficit should prove costly to finance, weaker consumption and
investment than envisioned under the baseline scenario—and thus a slower recovery of
medium term growth—would result.
4

A 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would raise the current account deficit by about 1 percentage
point of GDP and the external debt ratio by about 5 percent of GDP by 2010, according to staff simulations.

15

8.
The 2006 budget targets a reduction in the
deficit to 4.6 percent of GDP, implying just over
1½ percentage points of structural adjustment this
year. Revenue and expenditure forecasts in the budget
were not updated to reflect the 2005 outturns and are
therefore each understated by about 1 percent of GDP.
A little more than half of this year’s deficit reduction
is to come from the full-year impact of revenue
measures announced last year, in particular the VAT
increase, with the balance coming mostly from
savings in the public wage bill and intermediate
consumption.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
9.
Discussions were marked by broad agreement on the challenges facing Portugal
and most policy priorities to address them. It was well understood that Portugal required a
fundamental transformation of its economy and its public sector, through reforms that would
strengthen domestic competition, improve the business environment, increase government
efficiency, and reduce the fiscal deficit through expenditure-based measures. However,
proposed fiscal measures had provoked strong opposition from some interest groups,
complicating their development and approval. The mission emphasized (especially in
outreach efforts) that while even with full implementation of the reform agenda the economic
environment was likely to remain difficult—and growth relatively slow—in the near term,
slippages to the reform agenda would have a severe effect on the credibility of the adjustment
effort, increasing its duration and costs. The mission also pressed the case for a fundamental
labor market reform, which has had a low profile in the policy debate.
10.
The authorities recognized the complementarity of actions to address Portugal’s
challenges. High deficits and indebtedness divert resources from more productive uses, and
preclude desirable reductions in marginal tax rates (see ¶14.) They also contribute to
uncertainty about future fiscal policy, further discouraging investment. And, of course, faster
growth would facilitate more rapid deficit reduction. Beyond this, the mission noted, a
history of high tax evasion has introduced distortions that lead to inefficient business
decisions; excessive bureaucracy has discouraged investment; and problems with the
education and training system have contributed to generally low levels of human capital.
Thus, ongoing reforms to create a more dynamic and efficient public sector could boost
private sector competitiveness through several channels. The authorities were therefore
hopeful that a combination of fiscal adjustment and structural reforms to stimulate innovation
and investment could lead to a virtuous cycle of mutually reinforcing output growth and
budget consolidation in the medium-term.

16
A. Fiscal Policy
11.
The authorities and staff agreed that achievement of the 2006 deficit target was
crucial to maintaining public confidence in the fiscal program, but differed in their
view of the risks to the outcome. The authorities noted that revenue performance thus far
had been strong, owing in part to enhancements in tax administration such as increased
computerization and improved cross-checking among the internal revenue service and the
customs and social security authorities. They also observed that spending at the state level
through midyear suggested that budget execution was broadly on track. Thus, while the
mission pointed to risks—including higher spending on social transfers and health care, and
by local governments and autonomous funds—that could together add nearly ½ percent of
GDP to this year’s deficit, the authorities were confident that their target of 4.6 percent of
GDP would be achieved. Nevertheless, they would take additional spending measures if
necessary.
12.
The authorities highlighted recent strides in the development of the bedrock
structural reforms that are to underpin medium-term consolidation (Box 4). While

of GDP by 2008, in line with EDP commitments.
After delays, important progress had been made on some initiatives: Parliament had
approved the civil service reform in July, and the government had agreed with the social
partners on the outlines of the social security reform that same month. The authorities
planned to submit this latter measure to Parliament by September. Steps were also underway
to improve the efficiency of spending on health and education, and to modify the system of
local government financing to reduce a bias to spend in existing arrangements.
13.
The authorities expected the impact of these measures to be incorporated in the
2007 budget but acknowledged that the yield of some was difficult to forecast. Fiscal
benefits from the planned social security reform will rise over time, but some savings should
be realized even in 2007, primarily through changes in early retirement rules and the
indexation of benefits. The yield from the civil service reform and restructuring of the public

17
Box 4. Structural Fiscal Reforms
•

The reform of the social security system for private sector workers follows
last year’s reform of the system for civil servants. Benefits will be indexed to
the inflation rate (though relatively low pensions will enjoy a small real
increase when output growth is above 2 percent and higher pensions will suffer
a small real decline when growth is below that threshold), an explicit link
between benefits and changes in life expectancy will be introduced, the alreadyscheduled shift in the reference period for calculating pensions to encompass a
worker’s entire career will be accelerated, and disincentives for early retirement
will be increased.

•

The reform of the civil service aims to reduce the number of career paths and
increase flexibility within public employment. The reform will allow excess
workers to be transferred to a pool where they will receive reduced benefits and
salaries as an inducement to leave public employment. At the same time, the
government intends to continue replacing only half of all retiring civil servants.

•

The reorganization of the public sector (“PRACE”) seeks to reduce the
number of administrative structures and streamline procedures. In concert with
the reform of the civil service, it should generate an increase in labor mobility
within the public sector, a reduction in the wage bill, and, over time, a decline
in employment.

•

Reforms of health and education spending and changes to the system of
financing local governments are ongoing or planned. Hospitals will continue
being converted into public corporate entities, hopefully improving
management practices. Steps have been taken to reduce spending on
pharmaceuticals and increase copayments for medicines. The government also
envisages efficiency gains through changes in the school network and the
consolidation of small schools. Municipal governments will be given flexibility
to alter tax rates, complementing recent measures that introduced more
comprehensive limits on indebtedness and improved reporting requirements.

sector was harder to project, however. There was no doubt that Portugal’s public sector is
substantially overstaffed. If implemented effectively, these initiatives therefore had the
potential both to increase efficiency—by making it easier to shift public employees across
sectors as needed—and to generate significant savings, as some workers would be moved to
an excess labor pool where they would receive reduced wages and benefits as an inducement
to leave public employment. However, decisions on staffing levels would be made primarily

18
at the unit level, and the authorities understood that inducements for managers to rationalize
staffing might be necessary. The mission encouraged the authorities to base the 2007 budget
on conservative estimates of the yield of these reforms, supplementing them with additional
high-quality spending measures as needed. Continued progress in reducing the deficit in line
with the EDP commitments was jointly seen as essential to maintain confidence in the
adjustment program and minimize the short-term output costs of fiscal consolidation.
14.
Institutional reforms to further strengthen medium-term fiscal performance
were also under consideration. The authorities concurred with the fiscal ROSC’s
suggestion that a binding multiyear budget framework with explicit expenditure ceilings for
outer years would improve budget execution by providing spending units with a clearer
indication of the future resources available to them. A pilot program along these lines might
be introduced in 2009. Consideration was also being given to revenue-neutral simplification
of the tax code, for example eliminating intermediate VAT rates for some goods and
lowering the maximum rate, or further phasing out income tax benefits and cutting marginal
rates. These measures would decrease the cost of compliance with the system, facilitate
administration, and reduce distortions. Given the risk of unanticipated revenue effects,
however, a reform would likely await a further strengthening of the fiscal position.
15.
It was agreed that additional fiscal adjustment would be needed beyond 2008 to
ensure long-term sustainability and to allow fiscal stabilizers to operate. Forecasts of
aging-related spending, including recently by the EC, point to large increases in pension and
health expenditure in the coming years. Staff simulations show that without additional deficit
reduction beyond 2009, the public debt would rise sharply over the medium term.
Preliminary calculations based on updated projections for long-term health and pension
spending that take account of the pending pension reform, and on realistic forecasts for
output growth, suggest that long-run debt sustainability would require a budget surplus of at
least ½ percent of GDP by 2013 (Box 5) implying an additional 2 percentage points of GDP
of fiscal adjustment after 2009. The authorities’ official medium-term objective calls for a
structural deficit of “½ percent of GDP or less,” which they and staff agreed would allow full
operation of automatic stabilizers over the cycle without violating the Stability Pact’s
3 percent of GDP deficit ceiling. They agreed that the adequacy of any medium- to long-term
target would need to be re-evaluated periodically in light of developments with output and
health and pension spending.
B. Revitalizing Growth and Restoring Competitiveness
16.
The government’s Technological Plan is central to its program to raise
productivity growth. The plan seeks to address Portugal’s very low R&D and IT spending
(Figure 7), including by providing fiscal incentives for investment, promoting training, and

19
Box 5. Fiscal Sustainability
Staff’s baseline scenario incorporates the adjustment path in the authorities’ Stability
Program Update, with the deficit reduced to 1.5 percent of GDP by 2009, and keeps
revenue and non-age-related spending ratios to GDP constant thereafter, with no
subsequent fiscal adjustment. Under this scenario, the debt ratio would reach some
100 percent of GDP around 2025 and would continue to rise thereafter.
An alternative scenario takes into account the effect on long-term pension spending of
the proposed pension reform and assumes a budget surplus of some ½ percent of GDP
is achieved by 2013, following which non-age-related spending is kept constant as a
percentage of GDP. Under this scenario, the debt ratio would remain broadly stable
(and just below the 60 percent of GDP SGP ceiling) over the next four decades.

encouraging contacts between firms and universities. The authorities saw these measures as
essential to address market failures, among them the difficulty that small- and medium-sized
enterprises face in financing technological investments, and the generally low levels of
human capital among workers and managers.

Efforts to reduce bureaucratic impediments to investment are also a key element
of the authorities’ program. The authorities observed that different global indices of the
business environment—for example, the World Bank’s Doing Business Indicators and the
World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index—tended to give contrasting, and
insufficiently nuanced, views of the overall investment climate. As such, they cautioned
against relying on any single measure or set of measures when assessing the business
environment. Nevertheless, they recognized that there was scope for improvement and noted
the important progress already made. Bureaucratic requirements have been streamlined under
the SIMPLEX program, eliminating numerous barriers to investment and accelerating the
process of opening new firms and registering trademarks. Thus far, the effort to reduce red
tape had not been prioritized, in the hope that eliminating a large number of bureaucratic
requirements in the first year would raise awareness of, and generate momentum for, the new
program. The mission supported the plan to adopt a more targeted approach to SIMPLEX
next year, focusing on licensing requirements, which private investors consider to be
especially burdensome in Portugal. Steps were also underway to accelerate the legal system,
although separation of powers provisions limit the government’s freedom of action. As
improvements to the business environment would benefit firms throughout the economy, the
mission believed they could have a bigger impact on productivity than would the more
targeted initiatives under the Technological Plan. In any case, reforms to the investment
climate would leverage the effects of the Technological Plan.
18.
The authorities agreed that greater competition and efficiency in domestic
markets was also critical to enhancing productivity. Increased competition in key network
sectors—including telecommunications, electricity, and natural gas—was in the offing, with
potentially important effects on production costs economy-wide. Steps had been taken to
enhance competition in electricity generation, although the immediate impact on energy
prices would be reduced by the decision to pass on to consumers the costs arising from
existing long-term electricity supply contracts with producers (PPAs) and by the policy to
increase the share of renewables in generation. Preparations were also underway for a
gradual opening of the domestic gas market next year. Action by the Competition Authority
had led to the elimination of minimum fees for some professions and had reduced barriers to
entry in a number of retail sectors (e.g., pharmacies and gas stations).
19.
The privatization process has been reinvigorated, with the objective of reducing
the role of the state in the economy and enhancing efficiency. The authorities target sales
of equity stakes worth some €3.7 billion through 2009 (€1.6 billion in 2006), with at least
80 percent of proceeds going to reduce debt.5 Assets in the energy and paper sectors could be
sold this year, and the authorities also expected to initiate the privatization processes for the

national airline, TAP, and the airports authority. They did not, however, foresee a
privatization of Caixa Geral de Depósitos, a fully state-owned financial entity that accounts
for some 25 percent of banking system assets. The FSAP mission had suggested that the
authorities consider whether, over the longer run, financial market globalization and
deregulation implied that full state ownership of the entity might no longer be the most
effective means of achieving their policy objectives. The authorities stated, however, that so
long as CGD operated as a commercial entity subject to the same regulatory framework as its
private competitors, they saw no compelling reason to change its ownership structure. (See
below for further details on the FSAP findings and recommendations).
20.
As in previous consultations, there was disagreement over the priority due labor
market liberalization. The authorities highlighted recent changes to the unemployment
compensation system that broaden the definition of “acceptable employment,” promote more
active job-seeking by the unemployed, and link the duration of an individual’s benefits to the
length of his contribution period. These changes, undertaken jointly with plans to strengthen
coordination between the social protection system and the education and training network (in
line with OECD recommendations), are expected to speed the reintegration of the jobless
into employment. The authorities argued that international indicators that point to high
employment protection in Portugal (Figure 8) are misleading, failing to recognize that firms
typically use negotiated severance packages to shed labor rather than rely on admittedly
cumbersome legal procedures, and discounting the extensive use of short-term contracts and
self-employment. The mission noted, however, that recent steps to limit reliance on
negotiated dismissals—to reduce their budgetary costs—would effectively make prevailing
employment protection legislation more binding, increasing the need for its overhaul. It also
argued that firms’ preferences for short-term contracts and self-employment are symptoms
of—not cures for—excessive employment protection, and contribute to inequities and to low
levels of training while slowing the movement of labor across sectors. Changes are also
needed to collective bargaining provisions, the mission argued, to allow greater flexibility at
the firm level. More generally, the mission stressed that labor market reforms would
contribute to reducing unit labor cost growth from both the wage and productivity sides and
should therefore be a critical component of the strategy to strengthen competitiveness.
C. Financial Sector Issues

The FSAP found that Portugal’s financial system is generally sound (see the
FSSA and Box 6). The system has weathered the weak macroeconomic environment of
recent years relatively well. Banks have diversified income sources, rationalized operating

Box 6. Main Findings of the FSAP
•

Portugal’s financial system is sound, well managed, and competitive. Shortterm vulnerabilities appear well contained, as confirmed by stress test results,
although banks are sensitive to equity market risk through their employee
pension funds. Over the medium term, rising household and corporate sector
debt and significant concentration of banks’ exposure across sectors (especially
real estate) and borrowers may represent important potential risk factors,
especially if economic conditions remain sluggish, and will need to be
monitored closely. Potential domestic channels for contagion risk and crosssectoral spillovers among banks appear quite low.

•

The supervision of banks’ loan classification and provisioning policies—an
area which raised some controversy a few years ago—was assessed to be in full
compliance with international best practices, following some regulatory
changes in 2002–03.

•

In the last few years, the performance and soundness of the insurance sector has
strengthened. While relatively sensitive to various types of market and
underwriting risks, the insurance sector seems able to withstand a number of
severe shocks, though the impact on individual insurers varies widely.

•

The infrastructure for the settlement of payments and securities transactions is
highly developed, efficient, technologically well advanced and—from a risk
management perspective—robust. Supervision of financial institutions as well
as of payments and settlement systems is professional and active, comparing
very well with international standards. The financial autonomy of the insurance
and securities supervisors should be more formally safeguarded, while the
former agency should shed, over time, some nonsupervisory functions.

costs, and enhanced risk management procedures. Portugal’s banking sector compares
favorably with those of other EU countries in terms of asset quality, efficiency, and
profitability, while capital adequacy is about average. The financial soundness of the
insurance sector has improved, reflecting a deepening of the market, better alignment of
premiums to risk in some categories, positive investment yields, and reduced personnel costs.
22.
Risks arise mainly from high household and corporate debt. Lending to
households—especially mortgages for owner-occupied housing—has expanded rapidly,
bringing the private sector credit-to-GDP ratio to about 150 percent, the highest value in the
EU. Household mortgages are typically at floating rates. Loan-to-value ratios have risen as a
result of greater competition among banks, but there is no evidence of real estate

26
overvaluation. The authorities noted that owing to low interest rates and the lengthening of
mortgage maturities, the debt service burden for households has remained moderate. They
also emphasized that high indebtedness reflects in large part improved access to mortgage
credit by households, as well as inefficient rent control laws that constrain the development
of a rental market for housing. Other risks to the financial system include the concentration
of bank lending to a limited number of large corporates (albeit within supervisory limits),
and the exposure of banks’ employee pension schemes to the stock market.
23.
The FSAP considered these risks to be manageable, though worthy of continued
close monitoring. Stress tests showed that the capacity of the financial system to absorb
even severe disturbances to the macroeconomic environment is strong, given comfortable
profitability and solvency buffers. The overall prudential regulatory framework is sound, and
the supervision of financial institutions and payments and settlement systems is professional
and active, comparing very well with international standards. Nevertheless, a number of
specific issues within the financial system merit attention, including the needs to consider
additional capital requirements for mortgages under Basel II, and to continue encouraging
banks to refine systems to measure and control risks.
24.
The authorities broadly agreed with the FSAP analysis and recommendations,
which—it was recognized—were primarily technical in nature. In particular, the
insurance and stock market supervisors welcomed the call for greater financial autonomy.
The Bank of Portugal noted that banks have made considerable strides in assessing credit
risks in recent years, and that this process would continue as they adjusted to new
requirements under Basel II. More generally, the Bank saw many of the FSAP
recommendations as supportive of ongoing initiatives or strands of work, such as the full
implementation by the Bank of a comprehensive risk rating system for supervised credit
institutions. The authorities welcomed the generally positive assessment of compliance with
core principles but felt that in some cases the assessment did not take adequate account of
measures already in place or under development (see also paragraph 19 of this staff report
regarding the authorities’ views on state ownership in the banking system.)
D. Other Issues
25.
The quality of statistical data has improved (Appendix II). Notably, the reporting
of fiscal data during the year has become more comprehensive, permitting a better intra-year
evaluation of budget execution. The authorities have completed the rebasing of national
accounts data to 2000.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Recent months have witnessed important progress in the economic and policy
environment, but the challenges that Portugal confronts remain considerable. A modest
recovery of output is underway, thanks in part to solid export growth in the first half of the
year. In addition, some significant structural reforms have been introduced, while others have

27
moved closer to fruition. Nevertheless, reducing large fiscal imbalances and restoring
external competitiveness will be a lengthy and difficult process. Fortunately, there are
important complementarities between these goals, raising the prospect that successes in each
area could generate a virtuous cycle of faster growth and adjustment in the medium term.
27.
The authorities’ strategy to meet these challenges is generally sound, but firm
implementation is essential to its success. The commitment to bring the fiscal deficit below
3 percent of GDP without one-off measures by 2008 primarily by tackling the public wage
bill and pension spending is wholly appropriate. The growth of these spending categories
over the last decade is a prime cause of the current high deficit. Moreover, international
experience shows that expenditure-based fiscal adjustments tend to be more durable and
effective than revenue-based ones. To maximize the credibility of the adjustment effort,
planned reforms to the civil service, to the structure of the public sector, and to the social
security system for private sector workers must be introduced without delay and
implemented rigorously. Likewise, improvements to the business environment and increased
domestic competition offer the prospect of enhancing Portugal’s medium-term growth
potential, and progress in this area should continue. Slippages in the reform agenda—
especially on fiscal measures—would only damage confidence and increase the duration and
costs of adjustment.
28.
Achieving the 2006 deficit target is fundamental to ensuring the credibility of the
adjustment effort, and the authorities’ commitment to reinforce budget measures if
necessary is therefore welcome. Risks of spending overruns on social transfers and health
care, and by local governments and autonomous funds, call for careful monitoring of budget
execution and tight control of spending. Given the predominant role that revenue measures
have played in deficit reduction so far—including in 2006, when the full-year effect of last
year’s VAT increase will make an important contribution to revenue growth—any additional
measures should operate on the expenditure side.
29.
For 2007–09, it will be essential that expenditure measures move to the
forefront, realizing the planned shift away from revenue-based adjustment. The
authorities anticipate that the public sector, civil service, and private sector pension reforms
should contribute to this goal starting next year. In light of uncertainties regarding their yield,
however, the 2007 budget should be based on conservative estimates of their impact, with
additional specific spending measures incorporated as needed to achieve the deficit target.
The authorities should ensure that adequate incentives are in place to induce unit managers to
maximize staffing efficiency under the civil service and public sector reforms. Steps to
increase the effectiveness of spending on health and education should also continue to be
implemented, with a view to reducing inputs and improving the quality of outputs from the
school and healthcare systems. The pending reform of local government finances will
address incentives to spend under current arrangements, and should—along with the more

28
comprehensive limits on indebtedness and reporting requirements already implemented—
improve medium-term fiscal discipline.
30.
Even with the implementation of recent and planned pension reforms, fiscal
adjustment will be needed after 2009 to ensure long-term sustainability. In light of
projected future increases in aging-related spending, the authorities should commit to a path
of further deficit reduction that would yield a fiscal position consistent with long-run debt
sustainability by 2013. Provisional calculations suggest a surplus of ½ percent of GDP will
be required, though the adequacy of any target will need to be re-evaluated periodically in
light of developments with output and health and pension spending.
31.
A credible deficit reduction strategy is essential to raise potential growth but
cannot do so alone. Reforms to strengthen the business environment and increase domestic
competition are also critical to restarting income convergence. Measures to remove
bureaucratic and regulatory impediments are a highly cost-effective means of promoting
private investment and growth and will reinforce the effectiveness of the Technological Plan.
The intention to focus attention on easing licensing requirements is welcome. Within the
constraints imposed by the constitution, the authorities should continue to promote efforts to
accelerate legal processes. Increased domestic competition would boost the competitiveness
of Portuguese enterprises by reducing prices and promoting innovation and investment, and
work by the government and the Competition Authority in this area should proceed apace.
Faster growth is a virtue itself, but given the complementarities between output growth and
deficit reduction, a failure to make progress with growth-enhancing reforms could
complicate the achievement of the medium-term deficit targets, undermining confidence in
the authorities’ overall policy package. This is especially a concern given that the mediumterm growth projections in the authorities’ Stability Program Update significantly exceed the
staff’s.
32.
In this respect, fundamental labor market reform should be a high priority.
Strong nominal wage growth even in the face of increases in the unemployment rate, high
rates of long-term unemployment, and heavy reliance on fixed term-contracts and selfemployment all testify to the presence of significant rigidities in labor markets. These
rigidities slow the movement of labor to fast-growing sectors, discourage investment in
worker training, inhibit the adjustment of wages to market conditions, and raise serious
equity concerns by contributing to a dual labor market. Measures to increase labor market
flexibility, along with adjustments to collective bargaining provisions to allow greater
responsiveness to individual firm conditions, are critical to raise productivity and promote
wage moderation, thereby strengthening the competitive position. Recent changes to the
unemployment compensation system are welcome but are not a substitute for these reforms.
33.
The financial system is sound and well supervised, but the authorities should
continue to monitor risks closely. The relatively high levels of household and corporate
debt, the concentration of bank lending to the real estate sector and to a limited number of

29
large corporates, and the exposure of banks’ employee pension schemes to the stock market
call for continuous vigilance. The FSAP finding that comfortable profitability and solvency
buffers are capable of absorbing even severe disturbances to the macroeconomic
environment is reassuring. However, as the financial system evolves, the authorities should
reassess periodically its capacity to respond to shocks. The authorities are encouraged to
implement the FSAP recommendations.
34.

Portugal is encouraged to increase its ODA to the 0.7 percent of GNI benchmark.

35.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

1/ Refers to gross external debt and assumes growth at historical (2000-2005) average.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar
terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP. Averages are for
the period 1996–2005.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and both noninterest current account and
nondebt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Appendix II. Portugal: Statistical Issues
1.
Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes. Notwithstanding some
recent improvements, statistical weaknesses continue to hamper the assessment of economic
developments. Portugal subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and the
relevant metadata have been posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Portugal has
taken a flexibility option regarding the timeliness in the reporting of wages. Portugal’s
publication policy is characterized by a high degree of openness and with extensive use of the
Internet. The Bank of Portugal, Ministry of Finance, and National Statistics Office (INE) have
several websites with long- and short-term economic indicators and data.
2.
Real sector statistics were improved in the fall of 2000, when INE published a full set of
national accounts based on ESA95 methodology, including quarterly GDP estimates. The
authorities are in the process of rebasing national account statistics to 2000. As statistical
weaknesses remain, the Bank of Portugal continues to produce separate estimates of the annual
national accounts. Shortcomings in timely and high quality monthly and quarterly data on output,
employment, and total wage compensation hamper the monitoring of within-year developments
in the labor market. Unemployment data also suffer from statistical problems caused, inter alia,
by frequent revisions to the measurement of unemployment and sampling rotations.
3.
Fiscal sector data have undergone a number of revisions during the transition to ESA95,
sizably altering revenue and expenditure and hampering comparisons across years. The 2001–04
budgets have been presented in a manner consistent with recent changes in national and fiscal
accounting methodology. Intra-year budget data is available only on a cash basis. In 2002 INE
started to publish data for the Social Security Fund on a monthly basis with a 45 days delay, and
in 2003 for the Autonomous Funds on a quarterly basis with a 75 days delay. Except for the local
and general government, data broadly meet the SDDS timeliness standards. A project is
underway concerning quarterly general government statistics on an accrual basis, but there is no
timetable for publication.

4.
Trade and balance of payments data are provided according to the IMF’s fifth edition
of the Balance of Payments Manual. Although the external trade data meet the timeliness
standards, frequent and sizeable revisions hamper their usefulness. The portfolio investment
collection system has a simplified threshold (all reporting institutions whose monthly transactions
do not reach €500 million and, at the same time, have less than €500 million in outstanding
amounts may report only once a year, using a simplified form). The authorities estimate however,
that only a very small portion of transactions (in 2005, less than 1 percent) are not captured on a
monthly basis by this threshold, and that this reporting simplification does not significantly
hamper the quality of the monthly balance of payments. Moreover, they believe that all
transactions below this threshold are included in the first release of the annual balance of
payments data, and the monthly numbers are revised accordingly.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
October 18, 2006

1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the
issuance of the Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation. The new information
does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Short-term indicators are mainly positive, further supporting the assessment
that a gradual recovery is underway. Export volumes rose strongly in July and industrial
production grew solidly in August, as did the Bank of Portugal’s coincident indicator of
economic activity. Considered alongside recent developments with oil prices, these indicators
imply that the risks related to the staff’s growth forecasts for 2006-07 are tilted to the upside.
Data on budget execution through September suggest that fiscal performance remains on
track, although the government will of course need to continue monitoring developments
closely.
3.
Further progress has been made with structural reform. The authorities have
signed an agreement with social partners regarding the pension reform and now expect to
submit the reform to Parliament next month, behind the schedule indicated in the Staff
Report but still in time for its effects to be incorporated in the 2007 budget. In addition, the
government has submitted to Parliament new laws on local government financing consistent
with the plans outlined in the Staff Report. It expects to submit new laws on the financing of
regional governments to Parliament next month, with approval anticipated by January 2007.
4.
The 2007 budget proposal submitted to Parliament on October 16 targets a
deficit of 3.7 percent of GDP, in line with EDP commitments. While the staff has not had
an opportunity to discuss the budget proposal with the authorities, our preliminary analysis
suggests that all of the planned deficit reduction of 0.9 percent of GDP is to come from the
expenditure side, consistent with the government’s medium-term strategy. About threequarters of the targeted savings would arise from reductions in the public wage bill,
reflecting wage moderation, the renewed suspension of the system of automatic promotions,
and staff attrition, owing in part to the impact of the public sector reorganization and civil
service reforms. The budget also targets cuts in investment. Continued careful monitoring of
expenditure, as well as vigorous implementation of planned reforms, will be necessary to
achieve the deficit target. This is especially true as the real GDP growth forecast underlying
the budget—1.8 percent next year—is somewhat more optimistic than the staff’s current
baseline forecast of 1.5 percent.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for Portugal
and Luis Saramago, Assistant to Executive Director
October 18, 2006

We start by thanking both the Article IV and the FSAP staff teams for their candid and
constructive approach to these consultations. The Article IV report is broadly in line with the
authorities’ own views and mostly supportive of their policy choices. The FSSA in turn
provides wide-ranging insights that essentially confirm the financial system as a solid pillar
of the Portuguese economy. Staff’s recommendations are welcome and will be taken into due
consideration. As for the Selected Issues Paper, although it addresses relevant matters, we
must nonetheless point out that major caveats preclude firm conclusions (see page 8 below).
Key Points
•

After several years of sluggish growth, the Portuguese economy is now recovering at a
still modest but nevertheless faster-than-anticipated pace, driven by strong external
demand. Inflation remains subdued and unemployment started to decline.

•

That tentative recovery should be seen against the background of an ongoing and long
run shift in the economy’s specialization pattern, towards higher value-added activities,
in turn supported by significant corporate restructuring and structural reforms.

•

The fiscal deficit target agreed under the SGP for 2006 (a cut amounting to 1.4 percent
of GDP) is well within reach. This will mostly result from the lagged effect of the 2005
VAT rate rise, sustained progress against tax evasion and expenditure restraint.

•

The financial system is “sound, well managed and competitive”, according to the
FSSA. Thorough stress tests further indicate its ability to safely withstand even severe
shocks. Supervision of financial institutions and of the settlement and payments
systems was found to “compare very well with international standards”.

•

In office since March 2005 and facing elections only in 2009, the single-party majority
government is strongly committed to fiscal consolidation without one-off measures
and to competitiveness-enhancing structural reforms. Implementation on both counts is
proceeding well and opinion polls consistently show robust public support.

Recent Developments
Economic activity in Portugal has been accelerating since late last year. The initial projection
of a 0.8 percent GDP growth rate in 2006 (against 0.3 percent in 2005) was already updated
to 1.2 percent and may yet be revised upwards again. Indeed, the most recent figures

2
available for leading indicators and from confidence surveys of different economic agents
generally confirm that favorable trend.
The main driving force behind this recovery has been net external demand (a 2.6 p. p.
contribution to year-on-year GDP growth of 0.9 percent in the second quarter of 2006).
Nominal exports of goods increased by 11.1 percent, year-on-year, in the first seven months
of 2006 (30.1 percent to non-EU destinations), outpacing the 7.1 percent increase in imports
(a decrease of 1.0 percent excluding fuel).
The recovery has already proved strong enough to support a decrease of the unemployment
rate, from 8.0 percent in the final quarter of 2005 to 7.3 percent in the second quarter of
2006. As for inflation, the year-on-year HICP rate of change fell to 2.0 percent in August
(1.0 percent in core CPI terms), thus standing below the euro area average for the second
month in a row, as the effect of the July 2005 VAT rate increase wears off.
Macroeconomic Overview
The Portuguese economy has endured a period of low growth, rising unemployment and
increasing external imbalances since the beginning of the current decade. That was largely
the result of a few sizeable exogenous shocks, on top of two major endogenous trends.
First of the latter is slower-growing private consumption and investment, as agents adapted to
rising indebtedness from the mid-nineties onwards – in turn resulting from the sharp decline
of interest rates in the context of first-wave EMU accession (see page 7, third bullet below).
Second, increasingly apparent fiscal imbalances, which weighed on confidence until a
credible consolidation strategy was adopted in 2005 – and require adjustments that put a toll
on internal demand. As for the exogenous shocks, they included the euro area slowdown after
2000 (destination of about 2/3 of Portuguese exports), the increase in oil prices after 2003
(Portugal is relatively more oil-dependent than other EU-15 countries) and enhanced external
competition (from both Central-Eastern European and Asian countries).
Against this difficult background, which can be further aggravated by taking into account a
few other impending risks (such as the perennial prospects of tighter monetary conditions
and possible unfavorable developments in global financial markets), some important
mitigating factors should nevertheless be emphasized:
•

First, the fact that a credible strategy (so perceived by public opinion and the markets,
according to available indicators) has indeed been put forward by the new government,
not only as regards sustained fiscal consolidation but also competitiveness-enhancing
structural reforms, at several levels (see below).

3
•

Second, and so far only partially reflected in economic data, an increasingly apparent
reaction to the changing environment from the private sector itself. This may arguably
amount to a long term shift in the economy’s specialization pattern and can be detected
in a few indicators. One is the decreasing share of lower-technology products in total
exports (from 45 percent in 2001 to 36 percent in the first half of 2006); another is the
evidence of significant corporate restructuring in recent years, perceivable at the sector
and firm level; yet another, the expected recovery of FDI, concentrated in higher-value
added activities (which should be seen against the fact that Portuguese subsidiaries of
several major international corporations are among their most efficient worldwide).

•

Third, the need to take into account the important contribution to macroeconomic
stability and growth prospects that results from having a solid and competitive
financial system – a point to be considered together with the need to put into
perspective the significance of current debt levels (see page 7 below).

Fiscal Policy
An unsustainable expansion of current primary expenditures, coming from the past decade,
led to the emergence of a sizeable budget deficit in 2001, as the economy slowed down and
the EMU-induced effect of falling interest payments wore off. Over the three following
years, one-off measures allowed for the deficit to be kept within SGP-agreed limits, but the
underlying problems were not appropriately tackled. After the current single-party majority
government took office in March 2005, an independent commission was appointed (headed
by the Governor of the Bank of Portugal) to assess the true condition of public finances. It
concluded that the original 2005 budget had significant shortcomings and would result,
without policy changes, in an overall deficit amounting to 6.5 percent of GDP.
Against this background, the new government stated its determination to address the
structural causes of fiscal imbalances, thus pledging to abstain from one-off measures
and to focus on expenditure reforms. A supplementary budget was approved in July 2005,
within the context of a strategy to take the deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2008 – and
further down beyond that year, to long-term sustainable levels. This strategy, supported by
the EU’s Ecofin Council, encompassed an initially larger emphasis on revenue measures –
most notably increases of VAT as well as fuel and tobacco tax rates. The reason was that,
although several measures on the expenditure side immediately started to be prepared,
and many of them were quickly implemented, the kind of structural expenditure
reforms envisaged would necessarily take some time to bear significant fruits.
Actions taken on the expenditure side in 2005 and 2006 included a vast array of specific
measures – such as, for instance, a freezing of public servants’ career progression, a
streamlining of the school network (involving the closure of about 1500 primary schools with
a small number of students, to be redeployed), the ongoing corporatization of public hospitals

4
and a multi-year agreement with the pharmaceutical industry to supply the National Health
System (NHS), among many others. The three latter measures are part of a wide-ranging
effort to improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of public services, especially in the
critical areas of healthcare, education, justice and local administration.
Beyond such specific measures, other important initiatives include the advancement of
privatizations (eight companies to be partly or fully divested in 2006/07, with at least
80 percent of the proceedings going for debt reduction) and new laws on the financing of
local and regional governments, the former submitted to Parliament just a few days ago and
the latter ready for submission in the coming month (with the common feature of setting
heavy penalties for breaching indebtedness limits, while increasing responsibility for revenue
collection, and therefore accountability for expenditure choices). On top of the above, two
major fiscal reforms are being implemented. It is worth noting that both are broadly in
line with their planned timeframes – indeed, the authorities believe that a critical
requirement for deep reforms of this kind to be successful is their careful preparation,
discussion with stakeholders and communication to the public.
Social security. A first stage of reform was implemented in 2005, focusing on civil
servants. It resulted in the elimination of several especially favorable pension and healthcare
regimes, as well as the convergence of the general civil service pension system to the less
generous private sector one. That implied, for instance, a gradual increase of civil servants’
retirement age from 60 to 65 years (or more – see below) and of the minimum service period
for full-pension benefits from 36 to 40 years. The second stage is the reform of the general
social security system itself, which is about to be submitted to Parliament – after an
agreement was reached with most social partners just a few days ago – and will become
operational at the beginning of 2007, as planned. It involves, most notably, the
establishment of a regularly updated link between the retirement age and life expectancy, the
anticipation of another reform previously scheduled for 2017 that will consider a worker’s
entire career as the reference period for pension calculation (instead of the 10 best of the last
15 years, as until now), the strengthening of disincentives to early retirement and the
introduction of a pension cap.
Public Administration. Under this broad caption, and in connection with both the civil
servants’ pension system reform and their career progression freezing, several interlinked
building blocks are being developed. One is the reorganization of public services, which
already resulted in the approval of a new and carefully crafted macrostructure of 331 services
(36 percent less than before), together with an ongoing shake-up of procedures. Another,
expected to be in place in 2007, involves the streamlining of careers (including a significant
reduction in the number of career paths), together with the introduction of a new
merit-based system for the evaluation of civil servants and the adoption of performance
targets for public services (linked to budget allocations). Yet another is the introduction of a
new mechanism for labor mobility within public administration, which aims to increase

5
flexibility and includes the possibility of placing civil servants in a “redundancy pool” with a
gradual decrease in wages (eventually falling to 1/3 of the initial base salary). Finally, the
reiterated commitment to gradually reduce the number of civil servants, translated into a
broad replacement rate of one entrant for every two departed.
Although the authorities’ strategy for fiscal consolidation could only start to be effectively
implemented after the 2005 supplementary budget was in place, meaning well into the
second half of the year, that nevertheless proved sufficient to attain the budgeted deficit
target (6 percent of GDP, without one-off measures – against the 6.5 percent projected, in the
absence of corrective actions, by the above-mentioned independent commission).
The fiscal consolidation strategy calls for a 1.4 p.p. deficit reduction in 2006 (1.7 p.p. in
structural terms), which will take the deficit to 4.6 percent of GDP. This goal is well
within reach, as can be ascertained from available figures for ongoing budget execution.
As regards the State sector, total revenues increased by 7.6 percent in the year up to August
over the same period of 2005, while total expenditures increased by 2.8 percent (1.2 percent
for current primary expenditures). Half-year figures for autonomous services and funds, as
well as for the NHS, are also quite positive – in particular, the increase in expenditures over
the same period of 2005 was 0.7 and 1.0 percent, respectively.
The authorities have reiterated their commitment to take additional measures, if needed, in
order to ensure a successful accomplishment of the deficit target for 2006 (and likewise
beyond that). A final reference should be made to the important contribution to fiscal
consolidation that has been coming from the enhanced efficiency of tax administration
since 2004.
Other Structural Issues
The second major economic priority adopted by the newly-elected government in 2005,
besides fiscal consolidation, was the creation of conditions for a sustained recovery of
growth and employment, through a durable enhancement of productivity and overall
competitiveness. That is being addressed both with a long-term perspective (actions focused
on human capital development) and a shorter-term one (actions broadly aimed at fostering
business activity). Some of the most significant:
•

Technological Plan. Focused on the promotion of technology, innovation and general
knowledge, its first phase (2005/06) encompasses 112 specific measures. Executed at
more than 80 percent, they include such actions as full-country broadband internet
coverage, fiscal incentives for corporate investment in R&D and the development of a
country-wide network of high-tech logistic platforms.

6
•

Simplex. Closely connected with the previous initiative, it focuses on cutting red tape
and generally simplifying public procedures to the benefit of citizens and businesses.
With 333 specific measures being implemented in 2006, its most emblematic one is the
possibility of starting a business online and in less than one hour (more than 8000 firms
thus created so far). This by itself allowed Portugal to climb 5 places in the Doing
Business Indicators ranking of the World Bank – several other measures introduced
after its cut-off date for data submission will likely allow for further progress next year.

•

Education and professional training. A vast set of specific measures aimed at having an
effective impact on the ground, such as longer hours of school operation, broadband
internet connections in all schools, English classes starting at primary grade and
protocols between some of the leading universities worldwide and Portuguese ones, as
well as between the latter and business.

•

Justice system. Broadly aimed at improving the system’s efficiency and swiftness, as
well as its credibility, a formal agreement was signed between the majority party and
the main opposition one in September 2006 (thus securing a broad consensus in this
sensitive area). It comes on top of other specific measures to the same purpose and
includes dispositions for such things as adjusting the territorial boundaries of courts
(relieving overburdened ones), enhancing legal mediation and introducing several
streamlining amendments to the Penal and the Penal Procedure Codes.

•

Competition and market flexibility. Enhanced competition in critical markets such as
those for energy and telecoms is being implemented through regulatory changes, while
the Competition Authority is having an increasingly higher impact on market
conditions at various levels. Other initiatives worth mentioning in this context include
the advancement of privatizations and a new law for the rental housing market – which
will allow for rent levels of older leases (about 60 percent of total residential leases) to
be gradually increased – thus eventually ending a long-term bottleneck that
significantly affected the real estate sector. As for labor market reforms, the authorities
do not see them as a priority at this time. A new Labor Code was introduced about two
years ago and its full impact is still being evaluated.

Financial System Stability Assessment
The Portuguese authorities welcomed this FSAP exercise as a timely opportunity for an
independent and in-depth review of the financial system and they further welcomed the
productive engagement with the FSAP staff team. They now welcome the FSSA and its
supplements, which provide a fairly accurate assessment on the system, appropriately
emphasizing its soundness, competitiveness, profitability, resilience to shocks and high
quality of management. Moreover, they appreciate the references to the excellence of

7
supervision, as regards both financial institutions and the settlement and payments
systems, which was found to compare very well with best international standards.
The authorities further appreciate the fact that staff’s recommendations – which will be
taken into due consideration – mostly refer to actions they are already implementing.
Likewise, the authorities welcome staff’s indications that identified risks to the financial
outlook should continue to be appropriately monitored – they will certainly remain
committed to their responsibilities. Finally, a few clarifying points:
•

Staff’s remarks regarding “exposure to real estate-related activities” (page 15, first
bullet) must be taken with a qualification of paramount importance. A clear distinction
needs to be made between household mortgages (the largest share) and other real
estate-related loans, as the former carry a much lower probability of default – and
so help to keep credit risk under control in case of adverse macroeconomic
developments. Capital requirements for household mortgages are actually half of those
for other real estate-related loans. In addition, there is no indication of an over-inflated
housing market (indeed, house prices have been almost flat overall for more than five
years, in nominal terms – see figure 4 of the FSSA).

•

Likewise, staff’s call for caution as regards credit “concentration in a few large
corporate borrowers” (page 15, second bullet) must also be qualified. Indeed, the
probability of default for large corporate borrowers should be acknowledged as
significantly lower than that for smaller ones. Moreover, risk is appropriately
diversified among large borrowers – large exposures “are closely supervised and
within the prudential limits”, as recognized by staff.

•

On an additional note related to the first bullet above, a few considerations are
warranted regarding household indebtedness – relevant also in line of the Article IV
report (for instance, the bullet on page 12: “necessary adjustments to household balance
sheets”). We would argue that there is no evidence of a household balance sheet
problem under current circumstances. The drastic reduction of liquidity
constraints since the mid-nineties, in the context of first-wave EMU accession,
implied a stock adjustment which translated into buoyant household expenditures
for a number of years – followed later on by a corresponding deceleration, which
still persists. Moreover, as acknowledged in pages 12 and 13 of the FSSA, interest
payments remain manageable, in spite of rising household debt (they are stable since
2003 and more than 100 basis points lower than in 2001, as a percentage of disposable
income); household wealth “quite comfortably exceeds debt levels”, as the former
currently amounts to more than 2.5 times the latter (household debt is also topped by
net financial wealth on its own); finally, the evolution of housing prices in recent years
suggests that no speculative pressures are present in this market (see the second bullet
above).

8
Selected Issues Paper
The authorities acknowledge that both chapters of this paper address relevant issues –
competitiveness and corporate investment. They can further agree that the paper conveys, to
some extent, worthy messages. Nevertheless, they must emphasize that well-known major
caveats do not allow for firm conclusions to be taken from the analysis – much the less
clear-cut policy recommendations.
The chapter on competitiveness is fraught with difficulties, given the shortcomings of
available methodologies. For instance, the endogenous behavior of the real exchange rate,
related to the economic growth process, is usually disregarded by the type of analysis
followed. Moreover, traditional price competitiveness indicators are well known for their
inability to incorporate structural changes associated with different product specialization
across countries and with increasing competition from such countries as emerging market
ones. Profit Margin Indicators, especially when computed in levels or compared across
countries, rely on several structural parameters which may lead to particularly misleading
results. The traditional decomposition used within the Constant Market Share analysis also
presents several limitations that have been extensively discussed in the literature.
The bottom line is that we should be extremely careful about taking conclusions in this
context, especially as regards estimates of a gap between the observed and the
equilibrium exchange rate or the duration of competitiveness adjustments. The key
point acknowledged by staff in the chapter’s Concluding Remarks – “these calculations
are simply illustrative and are subject to considerable uncertainty” (page 16 of the SIP)
should therefore be strongly emphasized.
As for the chapter on corporate investment, the empirical investigation seems to suffer from
significant shortcomings that undermine its conclusions. In particular, the debt overhang
hypothesis as an important reason for the unfavorable performance of corporate
investment in Portugal is not supported by available indicators. Indeed, the adjustment of
a debt overhang episode is usually characterized by a slowdown, or even a decline, in
corporate investment (as recorded in Portugal since 2001). However, for the debt overhang
hypothesis to hold, data on profitability and financing conditions must also reflect this
situation – which usually means a high debt service level, a high number of default
situations and a decline in corporate credit. All of the latter are at odds with available
indicators for Portugal.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Portugal
On October 18, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Portugal.1
Background
A gradual economic recovery is underway after a largely flat outturn in 2005. Year-on-year GDP
growth accelerated to 1 percent in the first half of 2006, on the strength of a pickup in exports and
resilient private consumption, though investment remained weak. Meanwhile, the unemployment
rate reached a seven-year high of 8 percent in the last quarter of 2005, before moderating to
7.3 percent in the second quarter of 2006. Due in part to an increase in the rate of the ValueAdded Tax in mid-2005, inflation rose to 2.7 percent in the first half of 2006. The current account
deficit (including capital transfers) widened to 8.1 percent of GDP last year.
High private indebtedness (especially among households), weak competitiveness, and significant
fiscal consolidation are expected to weigh on growth in the near future, but stronger foreign
demand is forecast to lead to a better external contribution to growth than in previous years. Real
GDP is projected to grow by about 1.2 percent in 2006 and 1½ percent in 2007.
The authorities have committed to reduce the fiscal deficit from 6 percent of GDP in 2005 to below
3 percent of GDP by 2008 without recourse to one-off measures. The 2006 budget targets a
reduction in the deficit to 4.6 percent of GDP. A little more than half of this year’s deficit reduction is
to come from the full-year impact of revenue measures announced last year, with the balance
coming mostly from savings in the public wage bill and intermediate consumption. Several major
structural fiscal reforms are expected to contribute to achieving the medium-term deficit targets,
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

including measures to streamline the public sector, flexibilize the civil service, and overhaul the
social security system for private sector workers. Steps are also underway to improve the
efficiency of spending on health and education, and to modify the system of local government
financing.
A Financial Sector Assessment Program mission undertook an extensive review of Portugal’s
financial system, finding it to be generally sound. The banking sector has proven resilient to the
economic downturn: indicators point to improved capitalization, solid profitability and low
nonperforming loans. Strong growth of bank lending to households, especially for mortgages, has
led to a continued increase in the private sector credit-to-GDP ratio, which reached about
150 percent by the end of 2005 (the highest value in the EU). Bank lending remains concentrated
among a limited number of large corporates (albeit within supervisory limits), and the exposure of
banks’ employee pension schemes to the stock market is relatively high. However, the FSAP
mission considered these risks to be manageable.
Executive Board Assessment
While welcoming the modest recovery of output growth and recent progress on economic reforms,
Executive Directors concurred that Portugal continues to confront considerable challenges to
accelerate growth and resolve large fiscal and external imbalances. Directors encouraged the
authorities to use the opportunity provided by the current favorable environment to address these
challenges through a coordinated approach, noting that decisive progress in each area could
generate a virtuous cycle of faster growth and adjustment in the medium term.
Directors considered the government’s strategy to be broadly appropriate, but underscored that
firm and sustained implementation remains essential to its success. They supported the focus on
expenditure-based fiscal consolidation to bring the deficit under 3 percent of GDP by 2008 without
one-off measures; on structural fiscal reforms to contain aging-related spending, raise the
efficiency and quality of public spending, and promote the sustainability of the public finances; and
on reforms to enhance competition in product markets and improve the business environment, so
as to spur productivity growth.
Directors concurred that achievement of the 2006 fiscal deficit target of 4.6 percent of GDP would
be important to ensuring the credibility of the adjustment effort, and welcomed the authorities’
commitment to reinforce budget measures, if necessary, to achieve the deficit target. Going
forward, they stressed the importance of shifting the fiscal effort from reliance on revenue
measures toward the spending side in order to address the root cause of current fiscal
weaknesses, namely, the steady rise of spending—especially on pensions and wages—over the
last decade. This will require moving forward with planned reforms to the civil service, to the
structure of the public sector, and to the social security system for private sector workers. Directors
urged the authorities to work toward decisive implementation of these structural fiscal measures.
They also supported ongoing efforts to improve arrangements for local and regional government
financing, and the authorities’ consideration of a multiyear budget framework with explicit
expenditure ceilings.
Directors recognized that additional fiscal adjustment would be needed beyond 2008 to ensure
long-term sustainability and to create scope for automatic fiscal stabilizers to operate in future
downturns. Forecasts of aging-related spending point to large increases in pension and health
expenditure in the coming years, and a sustained effort will therefore be needed to prevent the

3
public debt from rising sharply over the long term. It would be important to reevaluate the adequacy
of any medium- to long-term fiscal target periodically in light of developments with output growth
and health and pension spending.
Directors stressed the need for progress with structural reforms aimed at supporting the continued
transformation of the Portuguese economy and its public sector, by strengthening domestic
competition, improving the business environment, and increasing government efficiency.
They welcomed the Government’s Technological Plan and recent steps to remove bureaucratic
and regulatory impediments to business, as well as the authorities’ intention to accelerate legal
processes and ease licensing burdens for firms. Directors saw the reinvigorated privatization
process as a key component of the overall strategy to reduce the role of the state in the economy
and enhance efficiency. They also supported the work of the Competition Authority, and called for
continued efforts to enhance competition, especially in key network sectors. Efforts to upgrade the
educational system should also remain a priority.
While welcoming recent changes to the unemployment compensation system, Directors
encouraged the authorities to pursue more fundamental labor market reform. They noted that
strong nominal wage growth even in the face of increases in the unemployment rate, high rates of
long-term unemployment, and heavy reliance on fixed-term contracts and self-employment all point
to the presence of significant rigidities in labor markets. Against this backdrop, Directors
recommended measures to increase labor market flexibility, including changes in collective
bargaining provisions to allow greater responsiveness to individual firm conditions, with a view to
raising productivity, promoting wage moderation, and strengthening the economy’s overall
competitive position.
Directors welcomed the finding by the FSAP that Portugal’s financial system is sound, well
managed, competitive, and well supervised. They encouraged the authorities to implement the
FSAP recommendations, and called on the authorities to continue to monitor risks closely.
Continued vigilance will be important in a context of relatively high levels of household and
corporate debt, concentration of bank lending to the real estate sector and to a limited number of
large corporates, and exposure of banks’ employee pension schemes to the stock market. While
the financial system’s profitability and solvency buffers appear to be capable of absorbing even
severe disturbances to the macroeconomic environment, Directors cautioned that the system’s
capacity to respond to shocks should be reassessed periodically.
Directors looked forward to increases in Portugal’s official development assistance toward the U.N.
target level.
