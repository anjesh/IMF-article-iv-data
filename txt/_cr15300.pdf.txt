IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Ethiopia

On September 21, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Ethiopia.
Ethiopia’s recent macroeconomic performance has continued to be strong overall, though with
some rising domestic and external vulnerabilities. Economic growth in 2014/15 was buoyant (at
an estimated 8.7 percent), supported by booming manufacturing and construction sectors.
However, inflation has been on the rise, with domestic food prices pushing it above 10 percent.
External vulnerabilities have also increased as exports of goods and services slowed
significantly, while imports continued growing fast. A sharp widening of the current account
deficit (to an estimates 12.8 percent of GDP) was largely offset by robust capital inflows, with a
50 percent increase in foreign direct investment and a much higher public borrowing from
abroad. The general government deficit expanded only marginally (by 0.2 percentage point) to
an estimated 2.8 percent of GDP. At the same time, public enterprises continued to borrow
heavily to finance their accelerated investment plans. As a result, their financing needs increased
to 7.4 percent of GDP, while public and publicly-guaranteed debt reached an estimated
50 percent of GDP in June 2015.
The economic outlook remains favorable, reflecting the country’s significant potential, generally
sound macroeconomic policies, and the government’s efforts to improve infrastructure and
attract foreign direct investment. In the medium term, staff forecast strong growth at
7½ - 8 percent. Public investment is expected to moderate, while private investment is projected
to increase only gradually, reflecting constraints on access to credit and foreign exchange, the

overvalued exchange rate, as well as other competitiveness challenges. The authorities’
medium-term budget targets a general government deficit of less than 3 percent of GDP and
maintains a strong pro-poor focus. Monetary policy, anchored on base money growth, is geared
toward maintaining inflation in single digits. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to
increase, reflecting large financing needs associated with implementation of the second Growth
and Transformation Plan.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the
authorities’ macroeconomic management that has delivered robust GDP growth and poverty
reduction. Directors noted that the outlook for Ethiopia remains broadly favorable but domestic
and external vulnerabilities have increased. Accordingly, they encouraged the authorities to
persevere with policies that safeguard macroeconomic stability, strengthen buffers, and foster
private-sector participation in the economy.
Directors agreed that fiscal policy has been prudent and appropriately pro-poor. However, with
tax revenue below potential, they recommended broadening the tax base and improving revenue
administration to mobilize more resources for needed development spending. Directors
expressed concern over the acceleration of public sector borrowing with attendant risks of
external debt distress and private sector crowding-out. In this regard, they advised careful
selection and implementation of public projects with judicious use of non-concessional external
financing and greater use of public-private partnerships. Directors welcomed the authorities’
plans to establish an agency for the oversight of state-owned enterprises, which will strengthen
the transparency of the public sector.
Directors supported the National Bank of Ethiopia’s tight monetary stance, in light of recent
inflationary pressures. Phasing out the central bank’s direct advances to the government and full
pass-through of lower oil prices would also help reduce inflation. More broadly, Directors
recommended modernizing the monetary policy framework and strengthening liquidity
management. Directors took note of the staff assessment that the exchange rate appears to be

Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

overvalued in real effective terms and encouraged the authorities to allow greater exchange rate
flexibility to facilitate external adjustment.
Directors agreed that further steps to secure positive real interest rates and greater financial
deepening remain key to bolstering domestic savings and investment. To increase credit to the
private sector, Directors also supported phasing out the requirement for banks to channel
resources to the national development bank, which may distort financial intermediation. They
also stressed the importance of maintaining an adequate regulatory and supervisory framework
to support financial development.
Noting a softening of export activity, Directors recommended more decisive action to strengthen
the business climate and enhance external competitiveness. Greater exchange rate flexibility,
less burdensome regulation, and easier private sector access to credit and foreign exchange
would be steps in the right direction. Opening some strategic sectors to foreign investment could
also improve the provision of critical services.
Directors emphasized the importance of timely and comprehensive data for effective policy
design and evaluation. They called for continued improvements in Ethiopia’s statistical capacity,
particularly as regards national accounts and financial sector statistics.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Ethiopia's state-led development model has delivered rapid economic growth,
reduced poverty, and improved social welfare. However, structural transformation has
proceeded less quickly than planned, and slow export growth has increased external
vulnerabilities. In addition, over the past year the economy has faced a sharp appreciation of
the real exchange rate, a significant widening of the current account deficit, and (more
recently) an increase in inflation. Large public borrowing from abroad, combined with weak
exports, resulted in the risk of external debt distress increasing from “low” to “moderate”.
Outlook and Risks. The outlook for Ethiopia remains largely favorable, reflecting its
significant economic potential, policies that generally support macroeconomic stability, and
reforms aimed at improving competitiveness. There are some external downside risks,
including a possible weakening of foreign demand and a tightening in foreign financing
conditions. Domestically, risks stem from the gradual pace of economic and financial
reforms, as well as weather-related shocks that could hike inflation and have large social
costs. A persistent overvaluation of Ethiopia’s exchange rate is another notable downside risk
to a pick-up in exports. On the upside, more ambitious reforms could deliver faster growth
and greater poverty reduction.
Key Challenges. The discussions focused on how to address short-term macroeconomic and
external challenges (including inflation and real exchange rate appreciation), and how to
overcome longer-term challenges related to structural transformation and equitable growth.
An important theme of the discussions was how to increase domestic resource mobilization,
which remains critical to secure sustainable financing to meet Ethiopia’s significant social and
economic investment needs.
Policy Recommendations. Key policies recommended by staff include: (i) tight monetary
policy to contain inflation; (ii) strengthening tax administration to bolster revenue;
(iii) slowing public investment, to safeguard debt sustainability; (iv) increasing real interest
rates, to promote savings; (v) enhancing competitiveness, through a more flexible exchange
rate, reducing the cost of doing business, and easier access to credit for the private sector;
and (vi) attracting more private capital flows, by opening key sectors to foreign investors.

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

GROWTH AND TRANSFORMATION:
ON THE ROAD TO MIDDLE-INCOME STATUS
1.
Ethiopia has achieved remarkable economic and social development gains during the
past decade. Income per capita has more than doubled in real terms since 2004/05.3 At the same
time, poverty has fallen (to 29.6 percent in 2010, and likely even more since then), while inequality
has remained low (Gini coefficient of 0.30 in 2010). Ethiopia is also making progress towards
achieving the Millennium Development Goals (Table 7).
2.
Economic growth remained buoyant in 2014/15, though primarily driven by domestic
demand (Figure 1 and Table 1).4 Real GDP growth is estimated at 8.7 percent, with manufacturing
and construction performing particularly well. Exports were depressed by weak oilseed and gold
prices, while the Ebola crisis lowered travel receipts. With imports growing rapidly, the current
account deficit widened to an estimated 12.8 percent of GDP. Capital inflows were buoyed by a
50 percent increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) and higher public borrowing from abroad.
Foreign reserves rose to $3.3 billion by end-June 2015, increasing import coverage to two months.
3.
While macroeconomic policies have remained generally sound, pressures have
increased in some areas. Through June 2015, reserve money was growing more slowly than
nominal GDP, which helped contain inflation to single digits. However, rising food prices (reflecting
below-average rainfall) have pushed headline inflation to 11.8 percent in July, with non-food
inflation nearing 10 percent. While the exchange rate continued its steady depreciation against the
U.S. dollar (6 percent year-on-year through June 2015), it appreciated by about 21 percent in real
effective terms. The general government deficit increased marginally, to an estimated 2.8 percent of
GDP. Public salaries were raised by 33-46 percent—the first increase since January 2011. The cost
(1.1 percent of GDP) was mostly offset by improved tax collection (particularly in domestic
value-added and direct taxes), higher non-tax revenue, and windfall gains in the Oil Stabilization
Fund (Tables 2 and 3). The financing needs of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) increased to
7.4 percent of GDP (up from 5.7 percent in 2013/14), reflecting accelerated investment. Total public
debt reached an estimated 47 percent of GDP in June 2015.
4.
Large-scale public investment in infrastructure is supporting structural transformation
and growth. Major hydropower projects (including the Grand Ethiopia Renaissance Dam, which at
6,000 MWs will be the largest in Africa) will help Ethiopia triple its generation capacity to roughly
9,000 MWs—enough to meet domestic demand and generate significant export earnings. Mobile
telephone subscriptions have increased four-fold since 2010. A new rail link to the port of Djibouti
will lower Ethiopia’s high transportation costs.

3

The fiscal year runs from July 8 to July 7.

4 Historical GDP data published by the IMF are those issued by Ethiopia’s Central Statistical Agency. Staff projections
for GDP are based on an underlying growth rate that is lower than that of the authorities, and that reflect identified
weaknesses in national accounts data (see paragraph 45).

5.
In December 2014, the government issued its first Eurobond. The $1 billion issue (at a
10-year maturity) was priced favorably compared to regional peers, at 6.625 percent, and spreads
narrowed considerably after issuance. However, along with other frontier markets, Ethiopia’s spread
rose sharply in August in the wake of heightened global financial market volatility. Its sovereign
rating was reaffirmed at “B” by Fitch and “B1” by Moody’s in early 2015. The proceeds are being
used to finance industrial parks, the sugar industry, and power transmission infrastructure.
6.
Policy implementation has only aligned partially with the Fund's 2014 Article IV
recommendations (Annex I). A prudent monetary and fiscal stance has supported macroeconomic
stability. Competitiveness has been improved, though challenges in some areas (for example
customs and logistics) remain significant. However, Fund recommendations on interest rate,
exchange rate, and financial sector policies have gained relatively little traction. Disbursements of
non-concessional loans to SOEs were accelerated significantly rather than curtailed, as had been
advised by the Fund.

A FAVORABLE OUTLOOK, THOUGH RISKS ARE RISING
7.
The government's outlook for the economy is highly positive. The authorities’ Growth
and Transformation Plan II (GTP II, 2015-20), to be launched later this year, has as its ultimate goal for
Ethiopia to reach middle-income status by 2025. GTP II targets 11 percent growth per year
(underpinned by strong manufacturing and exports), an improved external balance, and higher
foreign reserves. The private sector will play an increased role in the economy, though public
investment will remain strong. With the ruling coalition winning all 547 seats in the May 2015
parliamentary elections, the government has wide scope for policy implementation.
8.
Staff also forecast rapid growth,

9.
Staff’s generally positive outlook is subject to some downside risks (Annex II).
Domestically, constraints on financing for development, slow implementation of structural reforms,
and deterioration of SOE loan quality are the principal risks. Ethiopia also remains vulnerable to
weather shocks, which would drive up inflation and have significant social costs. Weaker foreign
demand would depress exports and foreign reserve accumulation. However, if demand in China
rebalances towards consumption, this may benefit Ethiopia (which exports mainly vegetable products
to China). A potential tightening in global financing conditions (as well as a faster slowdown in China)
could affect FDI and other foreign financing. On the upside, if resource and competitiveness
constraints are addressed more decisively, medium-term growth could be faster.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
10.
The discussions focused on the policies needed to support rapid and inclusive growth,
while safeguarding macroeconomic and debt sustainability. Ensuring that the policy framework
supports the development of the private sector is also essential to achieve economic diversification,
promote exports, and create jobs for Ethiopia’s young population.
11.

The following policy challenges anchored the discussions:



Preserving macroeconomic sustainability. A stable macroeconomic environment remains
essential for catalyzing private investment. While economic growth has remained buoyant,
inflation is on the rise, the exchange rate has appreciated sharply, the current account deficit has
widened significantly, and the risk of external debt distress has increased. Reducing these
vulnerabilities will require adjusting monetary, exchange rate, and public investment policies.



Securing sustainable financing for development. While domestic savings has increased, it
remains well below the authorities’ investment target of roughly 40 percent of GDP. Staff
recommended reforms to increase mobilization of domestic resources through the tax system,
and financial sector policies to promote longer-term savings and greater private sector access to
credit and foreign exchange.



Increasing competitiveness and reducing external risks. Export development has been
hampered by the high costs of doing business in Ethiopia. Reforms that improve
competitiveness therefore remain critical to promote private investment (including FDI), bolster
exports, and rebuild foreign reserves.



Sustaining equitable growth.5 While structural transformation generally raises incomes, it can
have adverse distributional impacts. To sustain equitable growth, economic and financial sector
reforms should be accompanied by policies that help all groups benefit from reforms.

A. Preserving Macroeconomic Stability
12.
Monetary policy should remain geared to keeping core (non-food) inflation below
10 percent. Reserve money continues to serve as an effective nominal anchor, given that indirect
monetary policy instruments are not yet in active use (and Ethiopia’s weak monetary transmission
more generally). With core inflation on the rise, staff recommend reserve money growth below that
of nominal GDP, and phasing out NBE advances to the government (estimated at about 1 percent of
GDP in 2014/15). Lower oil prices should also be passed through fully, rather than saved as windfall
gains by the Oil Stabilization Fund. Given the large share of food prices in inflation, measures to
support domestic agricultural supply (especially for major staples) remain important.6 Increased
food aid may also be needed to protect the most vulnerable. If secondary effects of food inflation

Economics (2013).

become significant, staff recommend halting NBE financing of the deficit and slowing credit growth
by state-owned banks.
13.
Staff encouraged the NBE to modernize the monetary policy framework, which will
support financial market development and improve intermediation. Enhancing the NBE’s
capacity to monitor and forecast economic activity will help monetary policy become more
forward-looking (Box 1). To increase the use indirect instruments and interest rates to signal the
monetary policy stance, the NBE needs to strengthen its ability to forecast and actively manage
liquidity. More flexible interest rates and exchange rates are prerequisites for developing interbank
money and foreign exchange markets, improving the transmission mechanism, and developing
secondary markets.
Box 1. Tracking Economic Activity in Real Time
Tools that allow policymakers to monitor economic activity with short lags facilitate
timely policy responses. The authorities (with support from AFRITAC East) and AFR staff are
both working on high-frequency indicators (HFI) of economic activity. The Article IV mission
provided an opportunity to discuss methodologies and experiences with Ethiopia-specific
challenges, with a view to enhancing HFI tools.
Ethiopia produces many timely monthly
data series (fiscal, monetary, trade)
which contain useful information about
economic momentum. Building an HFI
involves (i) selecting the most relevant
variables and (ii) aggregating the selected
series into a single index. Staff’s
methodology assigns a score to each
series, reflecting criteria including the
correlation with GDP growth and volatility
(see figure), and selects the five series
with the highest score. These series
are then aggregated using the
Conference Board methodology.
Results from staff’s initial approach
provide fairly successful out-ofsample predictions. The five selected
series (out of nearly 2000 series of
trade data) are: exports of coffee, and
imports of used tires, fabric, office
machine accessories, and bandages.
Through mid-2015, the HFI suggests continued strong growth momentum.

On the exchange rate, staff stressed that greater flexibility would support Ethiopia’s
competitiveness and help bolster foreign exchange reserves.7 Staff estimate that as of
June 2015, the birr was overvalued by over 30 percent in real terms (Annex II). The fact that the
parallel market premium has increased significantly (Figure 2) and that businesses report at times

15.
Turning to fiscal policy, the overall public sector position should support
macroeconomic and debt sustainability. The general government fiscal position should remain
cautious (with a deficit below 3 percent of GDP, as targeted by the authorities), with spending
maintaining its pro-poor focus. External non-concessional public borrowing should however slow
down, in light of the increase in the risk of external debt distress from “low” to “moderate” (Debt
Sustainability Analysis), caused by higher-than-expected non-concessional borrowing and export
underperformance in 2014/15.9

Against this backdrop, public investment should be paced carefully, and be subjected to
careful cost-benefit analysis.10 SOE products (for example, electricity) should be priced to ensure a
good return on the government’s investment. Staff recommended enhanced oversight of
SOEs—ideally through a dedicated agency—and more careful monitoring of the financing
requirements of the consolidated public sector. This would enhance transparency of fiscal policy and
reduce fiscal risks and external vulnerabilities from contingent liabilities. To diversify sources of
external financing, the government should consider innovative financing structures. For example,
public-private partnerships could mobilize private equity financing while allowing the government
to maintain ownership control.

Authorities’ views
16.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to maintaining price and exchange rate
stability. Prudent monetary and fiscal policies would continue delivering low inflation (though
administrative measures would be taken if needed to increase the supply of critical food items). They
indicated that NBE’s direct financing of the government will decline over the medium term. The NBE
is strengthening its liquidity forecasting capabilities and re-designing its liquidity management
framework (and plans to introduce standing credit facilities and management of liquidity through
open market operations). On the exchange rate, the NBE reaffirmed their policy of gradual
depreciation vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, which seeks to retain competitiveness while minimizing the
inflationary impact of a weaker exchange rate. While acknowledging that the appreciated birr
presented headwinds to exporters, the NBE highlighted the cost of a weaker birr to the government
(higher external debt service) and to importers (especially of capital goods needed for infrastructure
and manufacturing).11
17.
The authorities agreed with the Fund's recommendations to improve SOE oversight.
They announced plans to establish an independent ministry to monitor the largest public
enterprises. They also plan to privatize some smaller companies still under state control.
18.
The authorities disagreed with the results of the DSA, arguing that the telecoms SOE
should be excluded from the analysis. They noted that just like Ethiopian Airlines (which is
excluded from the DSA), Ethio Telecom is run on a commercial basis, and its debt is not guaranteed
by the government. Staff noted that including SOEs was the norm for DSAs, and that Ethio Telecom
did not yet meet the conditions required for exclusion (which include regular publication of audited
financial accounts).

B. Securing Sustainable Financing for Development
19.
Ethiopia requires higher domestic savings to finance its significant infrastructure and
social development needs. Total savings has increased to about 18-19 percent of GDP, reflecting
solid growth in private savings. However, given the authorities' investment target of 40 percent of
GDP, more resources are needed. Staff advocated a strategy based on two pillars—fiscal policy and
financial sector policy—to help finance Ethiopia's development strategy.
Fiscal Policy
20.
A more effective tax system could help raise more resources to finance development.
With an estimated tax-to-GDP ratio of 12.9 percent in 2014/15, Ethiopia falls short of its revenue
potential. Measures that increase the tax base—such as promoting private sector growth and
increasing coverage of commercial agriculture—would support revenue. The Ethiopian Revenue and
Customs Authority should accelerate its reform program, focusing in particular on improving
11

With regards to fiscal costs of depreciation, staff estimate that higher tax revenue from exporters would largely
offset higher debt service.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

taxpayer registration, strengthening customs administration, upgrading IT systems, and
implementing a compliance management and enforcement strategy.
21.
Tax incentives and tax expenditures should be used judiciously, to minimize foregone
revenue and potential economic distortions.12 Measures that do not deliver significant economic
and/or social returns should be phased out. Staff also recommended caution with regards to tax
benefits being considered for investors in industrial zones. Rather than providing incentives through
tax policy, the government could use these resources to finance infrastructure in these zones. This
would benefit the Ethiopian economy over the longer term.
22.
The public sector should avoid crowding out the private sector in credit and foreign
exchange markets. SOEs continue to absorb

and the Private Sector
(Figure 3). They may also benefit from

consider this goal achievable, though additional tax policy measures would be needed. With regards
to tax incentives, the authorities consider them important for attracting FDI, since many other
countries offer them. However, they acknowledged that the associated revenue losses were sizable.
Financial sector policies
24.
Policies that encourage savings are also critical elements to mobilize financing. The
importance of savings in the development experience of Asian countries may be relevant in this
regard (Annex IV). In Ethiopia, while deposits have been growing rapidly, further mobilization is
needed to satisfy the significant demand for financing. Policies that promote the expansion of bank
branches, increase financial awareness, and diversify savings instruments will help boost savings.
Maintaining Ethiopia’s well-developed social safety net program will reduce the need for the poor to
maintain cash buffers.

The IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department has estimated that tax exemptions on capital goods and income tax holidays
alone may have cost Ethiopia about 3 percent of GDP in 2010. They may also distort consumption and investment
decisions.
12

25.
For banks to increase their lending in support of structural transformation, they need
to extend the average maturity of their deposit base. Longer-term deposits currently only
account for 11 percent of the deposit base. Banks pay about 10 percent on longer-term deposits,
roughly twice the interest rate on savings accounts. However, even these higher rates do not ensure
a positive real rate of return. If real interest rates on banks’ “safe” assets (e.g., government securities)
were higher, banks would have more financial space to increase the rates they pay on term deposits.
Raising rates on government and NBE securities could therefore lead to more term deposits.
26.
The private sector needs greater access to credit if is to contribute more to growth.
The state-owned Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, which accounts for two-thirds of system-wide assets,
can play a critical role in making more credit available to the private sector. Exploring new
modalities for funding the Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE) could also help. Since 2011, private
banks have been required to invest the equivalent of 27 percent of their new lending in NBE bonds
(at a negative real rate of return), with the proceeds used to help DBE fund its loans to priority
sectors. While this policy has a good objective—namely to promote longer-term lending—DBE has
faced challenges in disbursing all the resources it receives from private banks. Staff therefore
recommended phasing out the NBE bond financing policy, in order to leave more resources for
private banks to lend to the private sector. Staff also recommended allowing Ethiopia's banks to tap
foreign credit lines, with safeguards in place to limit currency and maturity mismatches.13 Policies
that help small- and medium-sized firms gain better access to credit markets would also help.14
27.
Maintaining a healthy financial sector is essential for successful intermediation.
Ethiopia’s banking sector has favorable aggregate indicators: in March 2015, the average riskweighted, system-wide capital adequacy ratio was 16.6 percent (double the minimum requirement);
profitability was robust; and the non-performing loan ratio was only 2.4 percent (Table 8). However,
the absence of detailed bank data precludes the assessment of potential vulnerabilities in individual
banks. One source of risk is credit concentration, given the potentially large exposure of some banks
to single borrowers. Staff encouraged the NBE to remain vigilant in this regard. Liquidity
management may also be an issue, with short-term liquidity pressures having surfaced at a few
banks during the year.
Authorities’ views
28.
The authorities presented their strategy for promoting deposit growth, and
emphasized that the financial system remains resilient. To promote savings, banks were being
encouraged to expand their branch network and to develop better-targeted savings instruments (for
example for homebuyers and Ethiopia's Diaspora). The NBE agreed with staff that higher interest
rates (especially for term deposits) could also promote savings, though they saw greater impact
from structural policies. With regards to the DBE funding mechanism, the NBE explained that they
were considering other funding options (including DBE bonds), and that the bank was being
External borrowing is subject to approval by the NBE.
A recent World Bank study found that financing constraints of micro, small and medium enterprises are one of the
key obstacles to job creation and growth in Ethiopia.
13

restructured to enhance its lending capacity. The NBE expressed some doubt whether private banks
would make use of additional liquidity if the DBE funding model was changed, noting past episodes
of banks accumulating excess reserves.

C. Increasing Competitiveness and Reducing External Risks15
29.
Ethiopia’s investment-led development model entails some external risks. The country
has considerable potential to move its exports up the value chain, especially in leather, textiles, and
agro-processing—sectors in which Ethiopia already exports raw materials. There is also potential to
export processed coffee, if better logistics reduced export times. Developing the infrastructure to
support these export industries has required substantial imports of intermediate and capital goods,
as well as business services. But because the export response takes time (Figure 4), foreign reserves
have remained under pressure. Given the volatility of Ethiopia’s terms of trade and its less flexible
exchange rate regime, staff consider the overall level of reserves as inadequate (Annex V).
30.
Easing the trade-off between growth and stability will depend critically on structural
reforms that improve competitiveness (Figure 5). The World Economic Forum ranked Ethiopia
118th out of 144 countries in its 2014–15 report. Ethiopia does relatively well with regards to the
level of wages, business security, and quality of air transport. Weaker areas include customs,
administrative procedures, the quality of logistics, and access to credit and foreign exchange
(especially for small and medium enterprises).
31.
Ethiopia’s slower approach to multilateral trade negotiations may dampen foreign
investment in industries that are critical for growth. Accession to the World Trade Organization
(underway since 2003) is currently at the stage of discussing service sectors (banking, telecoms, and
logistics). Full accession to the free trade area of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) is now expected by 2021.
32.
Industrial parks (IPs) are expected to feature prominently in GTP II as a way to
overcome structural bottlenecks and boost investment.16 Incentives include income tax holidays
for 5–7 years (and up to 9 years for exporters), and exemption from customs duties on raw materials
and capital goods and from value-added taxes; a reduced waiting period for foreign exchange;
access to developed land at subsidized rates; streamlined customs procedures; and better power
and telecoms services.
33.
Other countries’ experience with IPs suggests several lessons.17 First, strengthening
administrative procedures is essential for the success of “one-stop shop” reforms. Second, to
generate spillovers to the broader economy, IPs should be integrated in the local value chain. Third,
fiscal incentives may make IPs more attractive, but they are seldom the decisive element in investors’
decisions. As with any tax incentive, staff encouraged the authorities to undertake a careful

Greater foreign financing can also play an important role in supporting development,
but should be consistent with macroeconomic and debt sustainability. External borrowing on
commercial terms should be for high-return projects that will generate sufficient returns to service
the debt. Public-private partnerships could be a good way to catalyze foreign financing, while
allowing the government to retain control of high-priority sectors (Figure 6). FDI can also play a key
role in improving efficiency and bolstering growth. In particular, opening up telecoms and banking
could have a major impact on the cost and quality of these critical, growth-enhancing services.

Authorities’ views
35.
The authorities expressed their commitment to overcoming competitiveness
challenges, and their expectation of a rapid export response to their promotion policies.
Continued public investment in infrastructure, the creation of IPs, and structural reforms would
increase FDI and domestic investment, and bolster growth. Strategic sectors were expected to
remain closed to FDI for now. Regarding trade negotiations, the authorities explained that domestic
industries needed more time to develop before facing foreign competition. Regarding the foreign

reserves policy, they reiterated their medium-term target of achieving an import cover of three
months.18

D. Sustaining Equitable Growth19
36.
As Ethiopia's structural transformation accelerates, it may become more challenging
to sustain equitable growth. Ethiopia has an impressive track record of low inequality despite very
rapid growth (although more recent studies suggest that inequality may be on the rise in urban
areas). This outcome reflects the fact that Ethiopia allocates a high share (about 70 percent) of its
expenditure to poverty-related programs, and that its Productive Safety Net Program (which
integrates income support with public employment) delivers transfers in a well-targeted and costeffective way. Government policies supporting agriculture have also played a major role in
sustaining equitable growth, given that poverty is primarily in rural areas.
37.
Looking ahead, as Ethiopia seeks to accelerate its structural transformation, growth
may become less equitable. As the economy shifts into manufacturing and services, measures may
be needed to support those who are less likely to gain from this transformation.
38.
Fiscal policy can play a central role in sustaining equitable growth. Enhanced tax
collection and lower tax exemptions would increase the fiscal space for poverty reduction. Staff also
recommended updating nominal income tax thresholds, which have lost their progressivity since the
last revision a decade ago. With regards to spending, staff support the government’s plans to
continue its pro-poor focus.
39.
Financial sector policies should also have a pro-poor dimension. Financial instruments
targeted to rural savers are important in this regard. Mobile banking (such as M-Pesa in Kenya)
holds great promise for promoting financial inclusion. The authorities should also continue
encouraging banks and particularly MFIs to increase their outreach.
40.
Complementing economic reforms with social policies can help sustain rapid and
equitable growth. Using a dynamic general equilibrium model tailored to Ethiopia, staff analyzed
the macroeconomic and distributional impacts of selected policy recommendations, such as
streamlining tax incentives and leaving more funds with private banks (by changing the DBE funding
modality). As more resources are channeled to private investment, manufacturing and services
expand, and economic growth accelerates. Private consumption also increases. Some of the policies
would have distributionally regressive outcomes if implemented on their own. However, if combined
with increased social protection, greater financial inclusion, and support for rural-urban migration,
the overall impact of the package could be positive even for the poorest members of society
(Figure 7).

18 The authorities exclude imports related to foreign aid and franco valuta imports when measuring the
reserves-to-imports ratio.
19 The Selected Issues Paper analyzes policies that can promote structural transformation and sustain equitable
growth.

Authorities’ views
41.
The authorities welcomed staff’s focus on equitable growth and their analysis of the
distributional impacts of economic and financial policies. On income taxes, they acknowledged
the need for a regular revision of thresholds to ensure progressivity over time. With regards to
staff’s model-based analysis, they noted that the presence of excess labor in urban areas could
reduce the positive impact of the proposed reforms. They also questioned whether private banks
would actually lend the additional resources they would receive if the DBE funding modality was
changed, noting banks’ accumulation of excess reserves in the past.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

E. Alternative Scenario
42.
Implementation of staff’s recommended policies could ease Ethiopia’s financing
constraints and promote rapid and inclusive growth, while reducing external vulnerabilities
(Table 6). The implications of these policies would be (i) higher tax revenue (with stronger growth
adding 0.5 percentage point, and reduced tax exemptions adding 3 percentage points to the tax-toGDP ratio), allowing more social spending and a lower deficit; (ii) higher savings, in response to
positive real interest rates; (iii) enhanced competitiveness, reflecting a more flexible exchange rate
and more ambitious structural reforms; and (iv) higher capital inflows, reflecting greater
competitiveness and opening key sectors to FDI. Inflation would be higher initially (reflecting faster
depreciation), but lower in the long run as greater competition reduces mark-ups. Such measures
could increase growth between 1-2 percentage points on average over the next five years, and
accelerate poverty reduction. Improved export performance would bolster foreign reserves and
enhance macroeconomic stability.

OTHER ISSUES
43.
While data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, the quality and timeliness of
some key data still need to improve. Publication of an extensive and timely set of macroeconomic
statistics by the NBE has been an important positive development. However, national accounts
statistics (especially from the expenditure side) remain a work in progress, and data on economic
growth, savings, and investment are subject to considerable uncertainty. The authorities noted that
the TA they are receiving from AFRITAC East is helping them build capacity in monitoring economic
activity and in compiling quarterly national accounts statistics. In the financial sector, staff
encouraged the authorities to provide more detailed information, including commercial banks’
income, non-performing loans, and loan-loss provisions. The government is working with the largest
SOEs so that they publish audited financial reports. This would improve public sector transparency
and enhance monitoring of potential financial risks.
44.
Ethiopia is encouraged to address the exchange restrictions maintained on current
international transactions. These relate to: (i) the tax certification requirement for repatriation of
dividends and other investment income; (ii) restrictions on the repayment of external loans and
supplies and foreign partner credits; (iii) rules for issuance of import permits by commercial banks;
and (iv) the requirement to provide an NBE clearance certificate to obtain import permits.

STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
As Ethiopia embarks on GTP II, the time is right to adjust policies in support of greater
structural transformation. While Ethiopia’s state-led development model has delivered in many
respects, success going forward will depend critically on a greater role for the private sector. This will
require adjustments in many policy areas. At the same time, Ethiopia is facing more immediate
challenges, with rising inflation, an overvalued exchange rate, a large external imbalance, and
increased risk of debt distress. These too will need to be addressed in order to maintain investor
confidence and bolster private capital inflows.
46.
Enhancing revenue mobilization and improving oversight of state-owned enterprises
should be given high priority. Improved tax administration and a more judicious use of tax
incentives and expenditures can bolster government revenue. With regards to SOEs, it is critical that
their borrowing and investment plans are consistent with macroeconomic and debt sustainability, in
particular given the increased risk of external debt distress. Staff encourage the government to
consider innovative forms of financing, such as private-public partnerships and other options that
could help mobilize private non-debt financing.
47.
Monetary and financial policies should remain consistent with single-digit inflation,
and further steps need to be taken to promote financial intermediation. To contain core
inflation to single digits, the monetary policy stance should remain tight. Additional measures (such
as slowing credit creation by state banks) may also be needed if inflationary expectations become
more entrenched. Improved capacity to monitor economic indicators would allow monetary policy
to be more forward-looking. Staff also encouraged the authorities to enhance liquidity forecasting
and increase the use of indirect tools for monetary management. Bringing real interest rates on key
securities to a positive level would enhance the transmission mechanism and promote financial
intermediation. Policies that support the growth of credit to the private sector—including a new
funding modality for DBE—are also needed.
48.
Decisive reforms are needed to foster export growth and diversification. Greater
flexibility of the exchange rate would reduce overvaluation, enhance competitiveness, and support
reserve accumulation. Improving customs, logistics, and access to credit and foreign exchange
(especially for small and medium enterprises) would be particularly important. Industrial parks could
help boost investment, but fiscal costs should be contained.
49.
Data deficiencies present challenges to effective surveillance. In the absence of timely
and comprehensive data, it is more difficult to analyze economic and financial developments and to
provide effective policy advice. Intensified efforts to address data weaknesses, combined with

The RAM shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff).
The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a
probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and
50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the
authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate
that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Annex II. Traction of Past IMF Recommendations
1.
Past policy recommendations have only gained partial traction. Fiscal and monetary
policy remained committed to preserving macroeconomic stability, while measures to attract foreign
direct investment in export-oriented industries were stepped up. However, IMF recommendations to
promote financial sector liberalization (including to bring real interest rates to positive levels) and to
rationalize access to foreign exchange for the private sector have not been addressed. Moreover,
reforms to improve the business climate and to enhance the role of the domestic private sector in
the structural transformation have yet to gain momentum.

Specific Recommendation
 Establish consolidated fiscal position (including public
enterprises) as an overall fiscal anchor
 Strengthen data collection on public enterprises,
including disclosure of audited financial statements, to
improve monitoring of contingent liabilities
 Rationalize tax incentives and tax expenditures
 Strengthen customs and tax administration, by ensuring
full implementation of ERCA's reform agenda
 Introduce cash registry machines in all regions, and
enhance taxpayer education
 Maintain the momentum in the PFM reforms
 Phase-out NBE's financing of the fiscal deficit
 Maintain a cautious monetary stance
 Allow for flexible determination of nominal interest rates
to activate the government securities market and
enhance monetary policy transmission mechanism
 Improve liquidity management
 Phase out requirement for private banks to invest
equivalent of 27 percent of new loan disbursements in
NBE bonds
 Enhance access to credit for private sector
 Enhance access to foreign exchange for private sector
 Improve market functioning and price setting
mechanisms for the exchange rate, and increase
exchange rate flexibility
 Increase foreign exchange reserves to 3 months of
imports in medium term
 Open up key sectors to domestic and foreign private
investors
 Increase efforts to attract FDI in export-oriented sectors
 Implement reforms to encourage entrepreneurship

Annex III. Exchange Rate Assessment
1.
Developments in the current account, the real effective exchange rate, and the parallel
foreign exchange market all point to a rising overvaluation of the birr. Through June 2015, the
CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) had appreciated by 21 percent (y-o-y). Considering
that the 2014 Article IV assessment estimated an overvaluation of 10 to 13 percent, the further
appreciation observed since then indicates even greater overvaluation. The evolution of the REER is
in part explained by the recent strong appreciation of the US dollar (which serves as the anchor of
Ethiopia’s exchange rate policy) against the currencies of Ethiopia’s other main trading partners.
Moreover, Ethiopia continues to have a positive inflation differential relative to its trading partners.
A further sign of overvaluation is that the premium in the parallel foreign exchange market has
increased in recent months, and that importers do not have ready access to foreign currency (with
waiting times up to several months). These developments have contributed to a further drag on
competitiveness and to a widening of the current account deficit.
2.
The model underlying the Fund’s new EBA-lite methodology for exchange rate
assessments provides a fairly good fit for Ethiopia, but does not capture several
country-specific developments. Since
CA: Actual, Fitted, and Norm
2000, the fitted current account tracks the
actual values remarkably well, suggesting
a REER undervaluation following the
August 2010 devaluation and a steep
appreciation thereafter. The current
account deterioration since 2011,
however, has been driven largely by
equipment imports for large-scale public

by the model. The acceleration of these
imports, as well as the Ebola-related shock to travel receipts in 2014/15, has led to an exacerbation
of the current account deficit that cannot be attributed to movements in the real exchange rate. The
current account norm in the quantitative analysis is therefore adjusted downward.

An assessment using quantitative methods confirms the observed signs of REER
overvaluation. The new EBA-lite methodology yields an estimated overvaluation of 32.5 percent, in
the range predicted by traditional CGER methodologies (Table II.1). While the results are not
statistically significant, the joint significance level of the four approaches taken together is higher.

Annex IV. Reserve Adequacy Assessment
1.
Ethiopia is a low-income country with a high dependence on commodity exports, as
well as imports of fuel and capital goods. As a result, the economy is highly vulnerable to
terms-of-trade shocks. Due to low foreign exchange reserves, Ethiopia has limited room to absorb
such shocks.
2.
Foreign reserves have stagnated at low levels of import coverage. At the end of
November 2014, reserves covered only about 1.8 months of prospective imports. A $1 billion
Eurobond issued in December 2014 caused foreign reserves to spike to $3.4 billion. But as the
Eurobond proceeds are spent by the government (with a high share expected to be used to import
investment-related goods), the temporary accumulation is beginning to unwind. The ratio of foreign
reserves to broad money has been falling, and was just below 20 percent in mid-2015.
3.
Ethiopia’s foreign reserves do not provide adequate coverage of imports, given the
country’s managed float exchange rate regime. A formal reserve adequacy assessment based on
a cost-benefit analysis shows that for a country with a heavily managed float system (similar to a
fixed exchange rate regime), the optimal reserve coverage is between 5 and 6.8 months of imports.1
The model evaluates shocks in external demand, terms of trade, FDI, and aid flows for different cost
levels of holding reserves (using the cost of borrowing as a proxy). The methodology has been
updated to cover LICs and resource rich countries, and uses up-to-date data in the panel regression.
4.
Staff expect the adequacy of reserves to improve gradually over the medium term,
though without reaching adequate levels. Solid growth in cargo and passenger transport services
as well as electricity exports, together with gradual growth in merchandise export volumes, offer
some potential to bolster foreign reserves. However, as demand for imports—driven by high
investment and rising consumption—is expected to remain strong, the reserves coverage of imports
is forecast to remain well below three months through the medium term. Concerns about external
stability are alleviated somewhat by the fact that in the absence of portfolio investment, the risk of
sudden capital outflows is small

Annex V. Mobilizing Domestic Savings:
The Experience of Asian Countries
1.
Financial sector development plays a critical role in mobilizing domestic savings, a
critical prerequisite for higher investment and economic growth.1 As noted in the Addis Ababa
Action Agenda, mobilization and effective use of domestic resources is central to the pursuit of
sustainable development.
2.
The financial reform experiences of China, India, and Korea seem particularly relevant
for Ethiopia. These countries had state-led development models with initially tightly managed
financial sectors. In the 1980s and 1990s, they began phased financial reforms, with the aim of
increasing domestic saving.2 While the timing and

3.
A critical prerequisite for mobilizing savings—especially longer-term—is to have
positive real interest rates. While negative interest rates imply cheap budget financing and lower
borrowing costs for businesses, they undermine the efficiency of financial intermediation and
discourage savings. Reducing inflation and allowing key policy rates to reflect market conditions can
help bring real interest rates into positive territory.

Safeguards Assessment
The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) was subject to an update safeguards assessment with respect to
the ESF arrangement approved on August 26, 2009.1 The updated assessment found improved
financial reporting and internal audit practices. Notwithstanding these developments, the
assessment noted significant weakness. Recommendations focused on strengthening oversight of
risks and controls, improving accounting records and the external audit process, and legal
amendments to address safeguards weakness in the Law. As of now, some progress has been
reported on the outstanding safeguards recommendations, particularly in the area of operations of
audit committee and staff training. Staff has recently received audited financial statements for the
previous years together with the management letters issued by the NBE’s external auditor. A full set
of audited financial statements should also be made available to the public, and published on the
NBE’s website.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
The de-facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The authorities
describe their exchange rate regime as a managed float with no predetermined path for the
exchange rate. The pace of depreciation of the nominal exchange rate, however, has been stable.
The NBE continues to supply foreign exchange to the interbank market based on plans prepared at
the beginning of each fiscal year, which take into account estimates of supply and demand. The
transaction-weighted average interbank market exchange rate as of August 13, 2015,
was Br 20.6698 = US$1.
The assessment, completed on December 2009, followed up on an initial safeguards assessment from
September 2001.

Ethiopia maintains four restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions,
which relate to: (i) the tax certification requirement for repatriation of dividend and other investment
income; (ii) restrictions on repayment of legal external loans and supplies and foreign partner
credits; (iii) rules for issuance of import permits by commercial banks; and (iv) the requirement to
provide a clearance certificate from the NBE to obtain import permits. These restrictions are
inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2(a), of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and remain
unapproved.

Ethiopia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle, in accordance with the Decision on
Article IV Consultation Cycles (Decision No, 14747-(10/96), 9/28/2010). The last consultation was

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of August 26, 2015)

I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has shortcomings that hamper surveillance. In 2014/15 some data reported to
the Fund were subject to delays and there are data weaknesses and gaps reflecting capacity constraints
which the authorities are seeking to address through technical assistance.
National Accounts: Although the authorities are continuing efforts to strengthen the national
accounts methodology, deficiencies in the source data and compilation practices affect the accuracy
and reliability of the GDP statistics. The reliance on various assumptions remains significant and the
weaknesses are particularly evident in respect to the estimation of private consumption, saving,
investment, and fixed capital formation. The statistical discrepancies between the expenditure
categories and output remain large. Information provided to the Fund is subject to frequent revisions
and discrepancies. Staff has stressed the need to further improve national accounts statistics. The
authorities have been receiving TA in this area from AFRITAC East.
Government finance statistics: Despite recent improvements, government fiscal statistics continue to
be affected by shortcomings in terms of coverage. Data on the consolidated fiscal operations of
general government and wider public sector are lacking and hinder proper assessment of the overall
public sector’s borrowing needs and its capacity to repay.
Monetary statistics: Monetary survey data for commercial banks are subject to substantial revisions.
Timely data collection and reporting continue to be crucial for policy making purposes and the
authorities should strengthen efforts to reduce revisions.
Financial statistics: Information gaps about the financial sector have implications for conducting an
in-depth assessment of financial sector health. Staff have not received commercial banks’ income
statements, information on distribution of non-performing loans, maturity of credit, net open position,
and bank-by-bank financial soundness indicators.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments data require improvements in coverage, valuation, timing,
and classification of current account transactions. Financial and capital account transactions are also
incompletely covered (for example, private sector borrowing from abroad). Data on FDI are based on
an estimation method developed by the NBE. An exploratory survey needs to be conducted to verify
the actual investment made in Ethiopia and to establish the universe of the enterprises with private
cross border capital. A survey on cross-border financial flows and stocks for the private sector should
also be undertaken. Implementation of BPM6 methodology is recommended.

II.

Data Standards and Quality

Ethiopia participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and metadata were partially
updated in early 2008. No Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes has been completed.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Michael Atingi-Ego and
Masato Miyazaki (IMF)
and John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared jointly by staff of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the International Development Association (IDA)

Ethiopia’s external debt remains sustainable, but the risk of external debt distress has
increased from “low” to “moderate” due to weak export performance and higher than
expected non-concessional borrowing, reflecting faster execution of the government’s
investment program. Over the longer term, a recovery in exports and a moderation of
non-concessional borrowing would improve external debt indicators. In assessing the risk
of external debt distress, the DSA calls for the use of judgment, focusing in particular on
capacity to repay. In this regard, the fact that external loans are being used primarily to
finance growth-enhancing infrastructure helps reduce the risk of debt distress. However,
uncertainties related to foreign demand and foreign financing for investment present
downside risks to export growth. Total public sector debt (domestic and external) also
remains sustainable, though vulnerable to risks. To enhance debt sustainability, it remains
essential to promote the growth and diversification of exports. Ensuring an appropriate
pace of public borrowing—especially from external, non-concessional sources—is also
critical to ensure that public investment does not undermine debt sustainability. These
findings highlight the importance of having a medium-term debt management strategy,
and of increasing oversight of state-owned enterprises, which have been in the lead for
major infrastructure projects and thus have contracted much of the external,
non-concessional debt.

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

BACKGROUND AND KEY ASSUMPTIONS
1.
Ethiopia's large-scale public investment in infrastructure has been financed by significant
borrowing, which has resulted in higher public debt. Ethiopia reached the completion point under the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in 2004 and benefited from debt relief under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in 2006.1 Public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt2 fell in
the years that followed, reaching a low of 18 percent of GDP in mid-2012.3 It rose to 23 percent of GDP by
mid-2014 (and total public debt was 42 percent of GDP).
2.
The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) prepared in 2014 concluded that Ethiopia's risk of
external debt distress was "low", though on the cusp of "moderate". No indicative threshold was
breached in the baseline. However, the indicator showing the ratio of the present value of debt to
exports (PVDE) temporarily breached the 150 percent threshold under the most extreme shocks scenarios. 4
With other risk indicators far below their respective thresholds, Ethiopia was considered a borderline case,
for which the use of the probability approach was warranted. This analysis indicated a very low probability
of debt distress, which underpinned the final assessment that Ethiopia’s risk of external debt distress was
“low”. Incorporating remittances to determine the risk of debt distress did not change the final assessment.
3.
Since last year, there has been a significant increase in disbursements of non-concessional
external loans. The government issued a US$1 billion Eurobond in December 2014 (which had not been
anticipated in the 2014 DSA), and disbursement of commercial loans to state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
accelerated. In total, SOEs borrowed $4.1 billion during 2013-15, broadly as expected in the 2014 DSA. As
SOE commercial borrowing is expected to remain significant in the coming years, the grant element of total
public borrowing will fall further. However, as the large-scale public investment program begins to wind
down and associated external financing for public enterprises declines, the non-concessional share of

While Ethiopia has received debt relief from most of its creditors, it has not been able to reach agreement with a
few bilateral creditors (Bulgaria, Libya, and FR Yugoslavia) and commercial creditors from Italy, the former
Czechoslovakia, India, and FR Yugoslavia. These outstanding loans (US$382.9 million) accounted for 3.2 percent of
the debt stock in 2013/14. HIPC terms are assumed for these loans. While negotiations with Russia on outstanding
loans (US$161.6 million) have not completed, the debt service on these loans is assumed to be given HIPC
comparable treatment.
1

2 PPG debt includes the debt of the federal government, regional governments, and major state-owned enterprises
except Ethiopian Airlines (EAL). EAL meets the criteria for exclusion set out in the 2013 Staff Guidance Note on the
DSF for LICS (Annex 3) because it is run on commercial terms, has a sizeable profit margin (as reflected in audited
accounts published annually), enjoys managerial independence, and borrows without government guarantee.
3

The Ethiopian fiscal year runs from July 8 to July 7.

Based on its 2014 Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) score (3.4), Ethiopia is classified as a medium
performer. The thresholds for the debt burden for medium performers are 150, 40, and 250 percent for the PV of
debt to exports, GDP, and revenue, respectively; a 10 percent band is applied to the thresholds to determine if the
country is a borderline case; debt service thresholds are 20 and 30 percent of exports and revenue, respectively. In
the scenarios that include workers’ remittances, the corresponding threshold for the PV of debt to exports and
remittances is 120 percent, and is 16 percent for debt service to exports and remittances; the PV of debt to GDP and
remittances is 36 percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

external financing is expected to fall for total external debt (general government and SOEs). Other key
assumptions include:


Non-concessional loan disbursements will average about US$1.7 billion per year in the next five years,
and around US$750 million per year over the entire projection period (FY2015/16−FY2034/35).



The maturity on all new external loans will average 26 years, and 13-16 years for new non-concessional
loans.



The interest rate on all new external loans will average 2.2 percent, and 3-5 percent on new nonconcessional loans.

4.
The accelerated disbursement of previously contracted commercial loans to state-owned
enterprises reflects the ramping up of Ethiopia’s infrastructure development. Total non-concessional
borrowing in 2014/15 is estimated at US$4 billion. The DSA projects such borrowing to average
US$1.9 billion over the next two years. Major ongoing projects include the following:


Ethiopian Railway Corporation: Awash Woldia / Hara Gebeya Railway Projects, the Addis Ababa Light
Railway. Commercial disbursements are projected at US$2 billion through 2016/17.



Ethio Telecom: purchased US$1.1 billion of equipment using commercial loans during 2014/15.



Power related projects (mostly in electricity transmission): disbursements for the Genale Dawa
dam and the final phase of the Gilgel Gibe III dam could reach US$0.6 billion.



US$1 billion Eurobond and other loans to support development of industrial parks, the sugar
industry, and power transmission infrastructure; also expansion of the road network and Bole
International airport in Addis Ababa.

5.
IDA has reduced Ethiopia's ceiling for new non-concessional borrowing to US$750 million for
2015/16 and, in principle, for 2016/17. The ceiling was lowered in July 2015 (from the US$1 billion
ceiling that had been in place for 2012/13-2014/15) in light of rising risks of external debt distress. The
reduced ceiling was seen as striking a good balance between encouraging the authorities to focus on
concessional financing for public investment, while leaving room to tap non-concessional financing
sources. At the same time, IDA revoked the 5 percent volume cut introduced for FY15 given that the
authorities contained new non-concessional borrowing within the IDA limit of US$1 billion. IDA will
continue to support Ethiopia on regular credit term.
6.
The medium-term macroeconomic outlook remains broadly unchanged compared to the
assumptions used in the 2014 DSA, though the outlook for exports is somewhat weaker (Box 1).
Real GDP growth is estimated at 8.7 percent in 2014/15 and projected at 8.1 percent in 2015/16, reflecting
strong public infrastructure investment and favorable agricultural production. The projected long-run GDP
growth rate is maintained at 6.5 percent. Compared to the 2014 DSA, the outlook for the level of exports is
lower, reflecting underperformance in 2014/15. Exports of goods and services are projected to rebound in
2015/16—growing at 19.5 percent—and sustain healthy growth over the following years, reflecting

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

improved product diversification (for example in light manufacturing, horticulture, and electricity). Export
growth is expected to taper off to 8.3 percent in the longer run. This fairly optimistic outlook faces
downside risks if structural reforms are not sufficiently ambitious to address Ethiopia’s considerable
competitiveness challenges. The uncertain global outlook presents another downside risk to export growth.
Weaker economic growth in Ethiopia’s major trading partners could depress exports, and tighter global
financing conditions could weaken FDI growth.1 With respect to China, slower economic growth is a risk for
Ethiopia. However, a rebalancing of China’s demand towards consumption could boost Ethiopia’s exports
to China, which so far have been primarily vegetable products.

Box 1. Ethiopia: Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario
Real GDP growth is projected at 8.7 percent in 2014/15, 8.1 percent in 2015/16, and at 6.5 percent over the
longer term. CPI Inflation is projected at 8.5 percent in the long run. The primary deficit of the public sector
is projected to average 2.7 percent of GDP during the next five years, with better tax collection largely
offsetting large public investment and current expenditures. An improvement in the fiscal balance is
constrained by the slow pace of improvement in revenue as a share of GDP, reflecting a narrow tax base,
significant tax exemptions and tax expenditures, and tax administration challenges. Also, as import growth
slows, revenue from customs duties may also decline as a share of GDP.
The external current account deficit (before official transfers) is estimated at 14.7 percent of GDP in 2014/15.
Improved export performance, a slowdown in capital imports and steady remittances will lead to a gradual
decline of the deficit over the longer term. Economic transformation is expected to ameliorate the large
external imbalances, with more dynamic and diversified exports and a phase down in the imports of capital
goods.
Exports of goods and services are estimated to have declined by 5.9 percent in 2014/15. Exposure to volatile
commodity prices—especially for gold and oilseeds—largely offset gains in export volumes. A recovery in
traditional exports and the development of new exports could raise average growth to 16–17 percent over
the next three years, and 11.3 percent in the long run. Investments in industrial parks and targeted sectors
that receive government support are expected to contribute to export growth and diversification. Imports of
goods and services are projected to slow down but increase well above GDP in the medium term as demand
for imported capital goods is expected to remain strong during the second phase of the GTP. In the long run,
imports are expected to grow in line with domestic output.
Remittances have played a key role in supporting the balance of payments and in 2014/15 are estimated at
7.4 percent of GDP. Economic stability in Ethiopia and solid growth in developed countries is expected to
keep remittances rising in dollar terms but declining to 2.7 percent as a share of GDP by 2034/35.
Foreign direct investment is projected to increase from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2014/15 to 5.0 percent in the
medium term, reflecting improved competitiveness and policies to attract foreign investment.
The exchange rate is expected to remain determined by the NBE’s crawl-like arrangement with the real
effective exchange rate remaining constant over time. Export growth will be driven by FDI, domestic
investment, competitiveness reforms, better infrastructure, and labor productivity gains.

Ethiopia, and downside risks.

The authorities requested that Ethio Telecom be excluded from the DSA. In their view, Ethio
Telecom meets most of the conditions for exclusion of an SOE: it is run as a commercial entity, its external
commercial loans are not guaranteed by the government, and audited financial statements indicate its
profitability. While some audited reports for Ethio Telecom have now been made available to staff, they are
only through 2012, and do not provide sufficient information to assess whether there may be remaining
contingent liabilities that could pose risk for the government. The government expects to have more recent
audited financial reports for Ethio Telecom available in the coming year. The 2015 DSA includes Ethio
Telecom’s external debt (as was done in the 2014 DSA).

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
8.
The 2015 DSA projects external debt to peak as a share of GDP in 2017/18. The present
value (PV) of PPG external debt increases to 18.8 percent of GDP in 2014/15, and reaches 24.5 percent of
GDP by 2017/18, reflecting the assumed sharp increase in disbursements to finance public investment
projects. It would decline after that, falling below 10 percent of GDP in the long run.
9.
Under the baseline scenario, the ratio of the present value of debt-to-exports (PVDE)
breaches the indicative threshold (Table 1 and Figure 1). The PVDE ratio is estimated at 192 percent by
end-June 2015. Despite the expected recovery in exports, it is projected to continue increasing, peaking at
220 percent in 2016/17. This would entail a baseline breach of 7 years, until 2020/21. All other debt
indicators remain below their indicative thresholds in the baseline scenario. For the indicators related to
debt service, the peaks in 2024/25 reflect the assumption that the Eurobond is repaid in full.
10.
Looking at alternative scenarios, a terms-of-trade shock appears to present the largest risk to
external debt sustainability. The breach of the indicative threshold for the PVDE ratio would last three
more years, and extend to 2023/24. A depreciation shock would also have a significant impact, in particular
on the debt service to revenue indicator (with a large share of imports exempt from customs duties,
depreciation would not lead to as much of an increase in the birr value of customs duties than might
otherwise be the case). As in the baseline, no other indicator breaches its indicative threshold in the
alternative scenarios.

In assessing the risk of external debt distress, the DSA calls for the use of judgment, focusing
in particular on capacity to repay. In the case of Ethiopia, external loans are being used primarily to
finance infrastructure investment, which are expected to have growth pay-offs that will boost tax revenue
and enhance debt repayment capacity. Large investments in energy, railroads, and roads will enhance
competitiveness, boost export revenue, and promote economic diversification. While this is to some extent
factored into the baseline growth projections, staff’s assumptions are fairly conservative in this regard. The
DSA provides for additional tools to evaluate the risk of external debt distress. Results from this extended,
judgment-based analysis indicated the following:


Probability approach. This approach assesses the evolution of the probability of debt distress
over time, taking into account past economic performance. For Ethiopia, no indicator breaches
the threshold in the baseline, and the breach of the threshold for the PVDE ratio in one shock

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

scenario is short-lived (2 years) and less than 3 percentage points from the threshold (Figure 2).
In the historical scenario, the debt indicators would be lower than under the baseline. This
reflects persistently high real GDP growth in the recent past and the better export performance
prior to the recent stagnation, which lowers the debt ratios in the first years of the forecast and
increases them in the outer years.


Including remittances.1 In Ethiopia, strong and relatively stable remittances play an important
role in bolstering external stability. When remittances are included in the DSA, the breach of the
augmented indicator (namely the ratio of the PV of debt to exports of goods and services plus
remittances) reaches a maximum value of 149.8 percent and lasts 5 years (Figure 3). Other
indicators are well below the revised thresholds even under the most extreme shocks.

12.
This augmented analysis indicates that Ethiopia has greater resilience to debt distress than
suggested by the standard methodology. Supported by robust past economic performance, the path of
debt and debt service indicate that only in the most extreme shock (to exports) would the PVDE probability
ratio be pushed above its policy threshold. These results support the assessment of Ethiopia’s risk of
external debt distress as “moderate”.
13. The increased risk of external debt distress calls for caution going forward regarding the pace of
foreign borrowing. Projects should be assessed carefully to ensure that they meet stringent economic
and/or social rate of return assessments, in particular if they are being financed on non-concessional terms.
Priority should also be given to those projects with solid growth-enhancing effects. Policies that promote
exports will also be essential to bolster Ethiopia’s foreign exchange earnings, which remains a weakness for
the economy overall. A more competitive exchange rate, better access to credit for the private sector, and
fewer structural bottlenecks would all help in this regard

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
14.
The projected path of total public sector debt-to-GDP has essentially remained the same as
forecast in the 2014 DSA: rising in the coming years, and falling after that. This reflects large domestic
and external borrowing by SOEs to finance infrastructure investment. As these projects reach completion,
total public sector expenditure would revert to lower levels in the long run.
15.
The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio remains below the threshold in the baseline. However, there is a
five-year threshold breach under the most extreme shock (a one-time depreciation). This is explained
largely by the fact that Ethiopia has increased its exposure to external commercial debt. The breach
provides additional evidence of a heightened risk of public debt distress.
16.
Debt stock related indicators are relatively flat and most extreme shocks do not alter
significantly the results. All debt indicators show a mild increase in the medium term, before returning to
1

Remittances must be presented as the base case in the DSA if they are both greater than 10 percent of GDP and greater than
20 percent of exports of goods and services. Both ratios should be measured on a backward-looking, three-year average basis.
While remittances in Ethiopia do not meet this criterion, they are large: in 2014/15 they accounted for about half of exports of
goods and services and 5.5 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

levels similar to 2014/15. This result is predicated on the continuation of robust GDP growth, moderate
public sector primary deficits, and—most crucially—low domestic interest rates (such that real interest rates
remain mildly negative, as inflation is forecast at 8.5 percent in the long run).
17.
Public sector debt would grow in the long run as a result of a permanent negative shock to
GDP growth, but debt service-to-revenue could absorb this shock (Figure 4). The scenario that fixes
the primary balance at its 2014/15 level shows a particularly sharp deterioration because of the unusually
large primary deficit in that particular year, reflecting the high level of investment activity. The other two
alternative scenarios (a shock to real GDP growth and primary balance at the historic average) show
trajectories with no important changes in the debt ratios over the DSA horizon.
18.
The baseline scenario understates the public debt burden for the economy, because it is
based on nominal interest rates on public sector borrowing remaining significantly below inflation.
Like in the 2014 DSA, with inflation projected to remain at a single-digit level, under current policies interest
rates on SOEs’ domestic borrowing would be negative in real terms. Ethiopia’s relatively benign public
sector debt outlook hinges strongly on the continuation of these financing conditions. If the actual cost of
borrowing were to rise above inflation, the debt indicators would worsen or fiscal adjustment would be
required to maintain sustainability.
19.
This assessment, with a moderate risk of debt distress, assumes the acceleration of external
borrowing to achieve the investment required for the development plan. The ongoing large public
investment projects rely heavily on domestic financing and would lead to a large accumulation of public
debt. Without an appropriate balance in the financing and pacing of the public investment projects in the
GTP, resources for the private sector could be squeezed. Monitoring the operations of the consolidated
public sector, including contingent liabilities arising from financial transactions among public entities, is
thus important.

CONCLUSION
20.
Ethiopia’s risk of external debt distress has increased from "low" to "moderate". This finding
reflects the use of judgment in assessing the likely impact of Ethiopia’s external public borrowing on
growth, and hence on its capacity to repay. The risk assessment remains vulnerable to further delays in the
recovery of exports, a terms-of-trade shock, higher external borrowing, and deterioration in external
borrowing conditions. The exposure to a terms-of-trade shock is reflected in a more protracted breach in
the PV of debt-to-exports ratio under the most extreme shock. However, robust economic performance
and a continued favorable outlook help to reduce the probability of debt distress.
21.
Containing the risk of debt distress will depend critically on bolstering export performance.
Addressing competitiveness concerns, facilitating greater access to credit and foreign exchange for the
private sector, and continued macroeconomic stability will play important roles in promoting export
growth and export diversification. A more competitive exchange rate would also reduce headwinds for
exporters, and contribute to increased availability of foreign exchange to finance imports of critical capital
and intermediate goods.

22.
Ensuring that public sector borrowing is consistent with debt sustainability is also essential.
The authorities need to monitor closely the debt levels and the terms of the new loans, especially those on
commercial terms. A dedicated agency that monitors the financial positions of SOEs would increase
transparency regarding their overall impact on public finances, and reduce fiscal risks. The authorities are
also encouraged to increase non-debt sources of financing for GTP II. For example, private-public
partnerships could bring in valuable equity financing while maintaining state control. The authorities should
also ensure adequate concessionality of new external loans.
23.
As advised in previous DSAs, the authorities are encouraged to systematically update their
medium-term debt management strategy (including SOEs) and to start monitoring the overall debt
(external and domestic) of the consolidated public sector. A joint work from the World Bank and the
IMF in collaboration with UNCTAD on medium-term debt management strategy advised Ethiopia on the
growing vulnerabilities derived from SOEs borrowing strategy, including substantial domestic borrowing
from the state-dominated banking system.
24.
The authorities disagreed with the DSA’s finding of an increased risk of external debt
distress. In their view, this assessment does not accurately reflect the Ethiopian government’s capacity and
commitment to repay its external debts, emphasizing that the financing is being used for
growth-enhancing investments, which should bolster exports and tax revenue. They also noted that the
deterioration in the debt indicators was due in large part to the very poor export performance in 2014/15,
which they expected to reverse in the coming years. They also argued for the exclusion of Ethio Telecom
from the DSA, noting that it is run on a commercial basis, is profitable, has audited financial accounts
(though only through 2012), and borrows externally without a government guarantee. Staff noted that
including SOEs was the norm for DSAs, and that Ethio Telecom did not yet meet the conditions required
for exclusion (which include regular publication of audited financial accounts).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly a
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Ms. Kapwepwe, Executive Director for The Federal Democratic Republic
of Ethiopia, Mr. Tucker, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director, and
Ms. Gasasira-Manzi, Advisor to the Executive Director
September 21, 2015
1.
The Ethiopian authorities are appreciative of the constructive engagement with the
Fund over recent years. They thank staff for the frank and constructive dialogue during the
2015 Article IV mission, which will help inform implementation of their macroeconomic
policy and development agenda. They remain committed to pursuing prudent
macroeconomic policies and further deepening their structural reform agenda in support of
their Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP).
2.
Consistently strong economic growth over the past decade and a broadly stable
macroeconomic environment has placed Ethiopia among the top performing economies in
Sub-Saharan Africa. With broad-based expansion and increased diversification of the
economy, growth has been rendered increasingly inclusive and employment-generating.
Poverty has reduced significantly and the income gap narrowed substantially.
Implementation of the authorities’ GTP is on course to deliver remarkable socio-economic
gains, and the authorities are committed to mobilizing the required financing for sustainable
development. The economic outlook continues to be greatly favorable, reflecting the
country’s huge economic potential, prudent macroeconomic management, and
productivity-enhancing reforms.
Recent economic developments
3.
The Ethiopian economy continues on a strong growth trajectory, supported by the
successful implementation of the GTP I, over the last five years. Real growth averaged
10.1 percent between FY2010/11 – FY2013/14 on account of favorable outturns in all key
economic sectors, notably industry (20.0 percent), services (10.7 percent), and agriculture
(6.6 percent). The growth momentum continued in FY2014/15, with real GDP estimated to
have expanded by 8.7 percent.
4.
Monetary policy has been geared towards achieving single digit inflation, with the
National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) appropriately calibrating its policy instruments to achieve
this objective. Accordingly, reserve money growth has been kept in line with growth in
nominal GDP and well within its annual target of 20 percent. However, to address short-term
liquidity challenges during FY 2014/15, the NBE certificates of deposits held by the
Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, which were issued in March 2013 following the lowering by
NBE of the reserve requirement ratio, were redeemed. Moreover, the NBE extended shortterm credit facility to several banks against NBE-bills. Inflationary pressures, exerted mainly
by the higher food prices, drove inflation to low double digits, recording 11.8 percent in July
2015. The balance of payments came under immense pressures, reflecting a widening of the
current account deficit. The exchange rate depreciated against the US dollar, though it
appreciated markedly in real terms.

2

5.
Fiscal policy implementation has remained prudent, with the authorities mobilizing
most of the anticipated revenues and grants during FY2014/15. Tax collection increased in
real terms with the tax-to-GDP ratio estimated at 12.9 percent. Budget execution kept in pace
with the realized revenues, thus containing the deficit below the authorities’ target of
3 percent of GDP. To further strengthen execution, the authorities continued implementation
of program-based budgeting and the rolling of the integrated financial management
information system to all federal budgetary agencies.
Medium-term outlook and policies
6.
The policy interventions over the medium term will be defined by the priorities set
out in the authorities’ second Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP II) which aims to
elevate the country to middle income status by 2025. Broadly speaking, policies will focus on
attaining high and sustainable economic growth, within a stable macroeconomic
environment. Continued scaling up of investment in critical infrastructure, with due
consideration to debt sustainability, and enhanced delivery of basic social services, coupled
with increasing private sector participation, will form an integral part of the strategy. To this
end, the authorities will seek to achieve an average real GDP growth rate of 11 percent and
address underlying macroeconomic imbalances to support their medium-term objective.
Fiscal policy
7.
Implementation of the authorities’ fiscal program for FY2015/16 and over the
medium term will largely focus on attaining the priorities identified in the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) which is a major ambition of the authorities’ five-year GTP. To
this end, over 70 percent of the total federal government’s budget has been allocated to key
priority areas, including education, agriculture, health, rural electrification and urban
development. On the revenue front, the authorities will continue efforts to enhance domestic
revenue mobilization through strengthening tax administration and streamlining tax policies.
In this context, the Ethiopian Revenue and Customs Authority will vigorously pursue its
reform program which seeks to, among other things, improve technical tax collection
capacity and increase awareness against tax evasion and fraud. While mindful of the financial
implications of tax incentives, which are mainly in the form of export promotion duty
waivers, the authorities consider these schemes crucial to accelerating industrial growth and
improving foreign exchange earnings needed for investment and development.
Debt sustainability
8.
My authorities note the updated joint Debt Sustainability Analysis(DSA) undertaken
by the Fund and World Bank staff which indicates that Ethiopia’s risk of external debt
distress has increased from ‘low’ to ‘moderate’, though external debt remains sustainable.
While acknowledging the downside risks to export growth including from uncertainties
related to foreign demand, the authorities disagree with staffs’ overall assessment of an
increased risk of external debt distress. They believe that the growth-enhancing benefits of
the significant public investments primarily directed at critical infrastructure were not
adequately taken into consideration. In this vein, the authorities underscore the fact that
proceeds from the successful issuance of 1 billion in Eurobonds on international capital

3

markets will go towards developing critical infrastructure, including industrial parks, and are
confident that as all these projects come on stream, the country’s exports and tax revenues
will be strengthened, thus eliminating any doubts about the Ethiopian government’s capacity
and commitment to repay its external debt. Further, the authorities reiterate their view that
the inclusion of the debts of Ethio Telecom in the DSA is unwarranted given that the
enterprise does not generate contingent financial liabilities on the central government. They
emphasize that it continues to be profitably operated and maintains audited financial accounts
in line with international standards.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
9.
Monetary policy will aim at maintaining price and exchange rate stability so as to
create a macroeconomic environment that is conducive to rapid and sustained economic
growth. To achieve these objectives, the NBE will, over the medium term, maintain a
monetary targeting regime, with reserve money target set consistent with developments in the
other key sectors. The NBE remains committed to containing inflationary pressures and
considers the recent spike in inflation (year-on-year) to low double digits in July 2015 as
driven by seasonal factors. An appropriate mix of monetary and fiscal policies will be
employed going forward to keep inflation within single digits. In addition, the NBE’s direct
financing of the government will be placed on a declining path over the medium term.
Furthermore, the authorities are determined to ramp up efforts at managing domestic
liquidity by adopting a robust liquidity forecasting and management framework and
introducing indirect monetary instruments.
10.
On the exchange rate, the authorities recognize the need for greater flexibility of the
exchange rate, in terms of benefits as an absorber of exogenous shocks, in supporting
external competitiveness, and in strengthening foreign exchange reserves. However, while
sharing staff’s view that the birr may be overvalued in real terms, the authorities are inclined
to pursue a path of gradual depreciation given the weak export responsiveness to real
effective exchange rate movements but yet pronounced pass through into inflation.
Financial sector policies
11.
The NBE will continue to strengthen its financial stability monitoring tools to
preserve the stability and soundness of the banking system which is assessed to be liquid,
adequately capitalized and profitable. To this end, the recently-adopted risk-based
supervisory framework combined with regular on-site examination will be utilized to
mitigate any emerging financial risks. To mobilize savings and promote greater access to
finance, the authorities will continue to build on the recent initiatives to promote financial
inclusion, including development of national financial education and consumer protection
strategy and implementation framework. The expansion of bank branch networks and the
development of more innovative savings instruments will remain policy priorities going
forward. The authorities emphasize that the current funding mechanism of the Development
Bank of Ethiopia (DBE) has served the economy well by providing much-needed long-term

4

financial resources. Nonetheless, they undertake to continue exploring additional funding
options that will further enhance the DBE’s lending capacity.
Structural reforms
12.
The authorities are cognizant of the fact that attaining their goal of structurally
transforming the economy and delivering equitable growth would require steadfast
implementation of far-reaching structural reforms. To this end, they welcome the focus of the
accompanying selected issues paper on poverty reduction and the macro-social impacts of
policies on income distribution. The authorities intend to give due consideration to the policy
recommendations when refining their pro-poor policy interventions, which already have
proven to be effective and highly successful. Additionally, they are committed to enhancing
the role of the private sector in the development process by providing greater access to credit
and creating a favorable business climate. Finally, addressing the underlying impediments to
increased external competiveness will remain at the center of the authorities’ policy strategy.
Conclusion
13.
The Ethiopian authorities recognize the challenges of macroeconomic management
in the midst of scaled up investments in infrastructure and social development and are
committed to instituting appropriate measures to address emerging macroeconomic
imbalances and mitigate potential downside risks to the growth outlook. They are determined
to persevere with efforts at structurally transforming their economy through enhanced
domestic resource mobilization, increased investment in infrastructure, and more broadbased, pro-poor growth. Finally, the authorities consider the Fund’s policy advice and
technical assistance useful as they proceed with implementation of their development agenda.
