INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with
Trinidad and Tobago
Approved by José Fajgenbaum and David Marston
December 23, 2008

• Economic and political setting. Helped by a booming energy sector, Trinidad and Tobago
has achieved an impressive improvement in economic indicators and has established itself as the
Caribbean’s main industrial and financial center. Falling energy prices require policy
adjustments, following years of fiscal expansion and a more recent rise in inflation. Elections in
November 2007 gave the incumbent People’s National Movement party a solid majority.
• Financial crisis spillovers. The direct impact from the global financial crisis has been
limited, reflecting a liquid and well-capitalized banking sector that has relied little on foreign
borrowing. Resilience also arises from large international reserves and low debt ratios.
• Focus of consultation. The discussions focused on two key policy challenges: preparing for
the risk of contagion and preserving macroeconomic stability, in the face of declining energy
revenues and still high inflation. The mission made the following recommendations:
¾

Contagion preparedness. The authorities need to identify contingency measures to permit a
quick and comprehensive response to potential problems of liquidity or solvency in the
financial sector, and accelerate regulatory reforms and crisis-management planning, jointly
with supervisors in the region.

¾

Macroeconomic stability. The government needs to constrain spending to limit the negative
fiscal impact of lower energy prices, while letting automatic stabilizers operate in the case of
an even sharper-than-envisaged slowdown. The central bank will have scope for monetary
easing after concerns over second-round effects have abated. More exchange rate flexibility
would be advisable, once global conditions have stabilized, while medium-term policies need
to focus on reducing large non-energy fiscal deficits and improving the business climate.

• Authorities’ views. The authorities are in broad agreement with these recommendations—
except on exchange rate policies—and have announced decisive spending cuts for 2008/09.
• Exchange system. Trinidad and Tobago has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on current account
transactions. The system, a de jure managed float, would be classified as a stabilized arrangement
under the Fund’s revised methodology.
• Mission. The team, comprising Christina Daseking (head), Werner Keller, Padamja
Khandelwal, and Masahiro Nozaki (all WHD), visited Port of Spain during November 4–17.
Ms. Anne Joseph (OED) participated in several meetings.

Faced with a prospective decline in energy resources, the government has
embarked on an ambitious development and diversification strategy. With the energy
sector, including petrochemicals, accounting for nearly half of GDP, close to 90 percent of
recent exports, and almost 60 percent of central government revenue, the prospective
depletion of reserves over the next 20 years will require a major economic transformation.
The government’s Vision 2020 lays out its strategy for managing this process, with the aim of

attaining developed-country status by 2020. It relies on using the gradually declining energy
revenues to support downstream activities and a diversified non-energy sector through subsidies
and public investment in infrastructure, education, and social programs. However, the
associated fiscal stimulus has fueled excess liquidity and inflation.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
3.
Direct spillovers from the international financial crisis have been limited, but the
country is not immune from contagion (Box 1). External vulnerability is low as a result of
large international reserves and low debt ratios, and the banking sector has entered the period of
global turmoil from a position of strength and with little reliance on external borrowing. This
has limited direct spillovers and should contain the risk of liquidity shocks transmitted through
foreign parent banks, should these come under stress. Nevertheless, risks could arise from
exposures of large and complex financial conglomerates that operate across the region and
deteriorating balance sheets in the event of a further sharp drop in energy and asset prices. In
light of Trinidad and Tobago’s position as a regional financial center, its institutions are
exposed to potential economic difficulties in neighboring countries, and problems in Trinidad
and Tobago could have important ripple effects throughout the Caribbean.
The banking system is profitable, well-capitalized, and non-performing loans are low and well-provisioned.

While energy production has slowed, the expansion of the non-energy sector has
led to capacity constraints and, together with rising food prices, to double-digit inflation.
After an impressive boom period, energy production is slowing, and overall growth is projected
to decelerate to 3½ percent this year, down from 5½ percent in 2007 (Figure 3). However,
growth in the non-energy sector has remained robust, and with record low unemployment and

Box 1. Potential Spillovers from Global Financial Crisis
Trinidad and Tobago is well placed to weather the crisis (Figure 2):
•

External vulnerability is low, as demonstrated by a large current account surplus,
official reserves that cover about 10 months of imports and more than 100 percent of
broad money, favorable credit ratings, and comparatively low risk spreads on
government bonds.

•

Disruptions in financial markets have been limited, as both money and foreign
exchange markets have continued to function normally. However, the possibility of
contagion and an associated tightening of market conditions cannot be ruled out, if
global tensions persist.

•

Banks have entered the global financial turmoil from a position of strength, being
well capitalized, liquid, and profitable. Although four institutions, comprising about half
of all banking sector assets, are owned by Canadian and U.S. parents, banks are funded
mainly through domestic deposits and equity, as opposed to external borrowing. This has
helped contain direct spillovers.

•

Institutional arrangements have also alleviated vulnerabilities. The requirement that
insurance companies must hold at least 80 percent of their statutory funds in domestic
assets has limited their exposure to foreign assets. Also, the upper threshold of the
deposit insurance system, while not high, implies a large coverage.

However, Trinidad and Tobago’s financial sector and economy are not immune from
contagion, with the following channels warranting particular attention:
•

Large financial conglomerates. The financial system is dominated by conglomerates,
with engagements in commercial banking, investment banking, insurance businesses, as
well as non-financial activities. The 2005 FSAP pointed to high levels of crossshareholding and related lending across various subsidiaries, as well as considerable
leverage at the group level. Moreover, a substantial portion of major conglomerates’
revenue, in a range of 20–40 percent, is attributed to activities in the wider Caribbean.
Thus, a shock originating in one country could be rapidly transmitted throughout the
region.

•

Exposure to energy prices. A further sharp deterioration in energy prices could have
significant adverse implications, particularly if it forces a strong fiscal retrenchment with
spillovers to domestic consumption, investment, and consequently, asset prices—notably
real estate and equity. This would, in turn, affect bank collateral against the backdrop of
recent buoyant growth in consumer loans, as well as asset positions of insurance
companies and pension funds, that are heavily invested in the domestic stock market.

•

Size of financial sector. A financial sector crisis would also have significant direct
income and wealth effects, with financial services accounting for about one-quarter of
non-energy GDP, 9 percent of total employment, and 70 percent of the country’s stock
market capitalization at end-2007 (corresponding to about 50 percent of GDP).

sharply rising food prices, inflation has accelerated to a projected average of 11¾ percent in
2008—despite a lack of pass-through of the earlier spike in global energy prices.
5.
Following years of expansionary policies, declining energy revenues will lead to a
deterioration in the fiscal position. While the government’s balance sheet improved over the
past five years, due to booming energy prices, the non-energy deficit doubled to about 15
percent of GDP (28 percent of non-energy GDP) in FY2007/08 (Table 3). This reflected high
capital spending but also rapidly growing transfers and subsidies. The 2008/09 budget (October
– September) was based on an oil price of $70 per barrel and would have implied broadly

unchanged expenditures, as a share of GDP. However, with updated energy price projections,
the same spending envelope would now translate into a deficit of about 3½ percent of GDP.
6.
The fiscal expansion has also complicated monetary policy, especially in the context
of a de facto peg to the U.S. dollar. The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) has
responded to the rapid expansion in broad money, driven by the fiscal spending of large energy
revenues, with successive increases of the repo rate; stepped-up open market sales of treasury
bills and bonds; and increases in reserve requirements (Table 5 and Figure 4). While the
resulting interest differential with the U.S. has not triggered large capital inflows—likely
reflecting limits in the substitutability of financial assets—the de facto peg has circumscribed
the CBTT’s ability to mop up liquidity more aggressively through foreign exchange sales and to
reduce inflation via an exchange rate appreciation. Nevertheless, the CBTT’s tightening
measures have eventually been effective in slowing private credit growth, which should decline
further in response to a weaker economic outlook and a prospective tightening of lending
standards, notwithstanding still ample liquidity in the banking system.
7.
Looking ahead, economic growth and inflation are projected to slow in the face of
a deteriorating external environment. Recessions in advanced economies, their spillovers to
the tourism-dependent economies of the region, and sharply lower prices for energy products
are projected to reduce growth to 2 percent in 2009. This, together with falling international
food prices, should help dampen domestic price pressures. Nevertheless, the base effect of this
year’s food price shock, combined with still tight capacity constraints and labor market

conditions, is projected to limit the decline in headline inflation to 7½ percent in 2009. At the
same time, the external current account surplus is projected to decline by 15 percentage points
to about 12 percent of GDP, in response to falling energy export earnings, with an assumed oil
price decline of about US$43 per barrel to US$54 in 2009. These projections, however, are
subject to an unusually high degree of uncertainty, given the unsettled global outlook and
volatile commodity prices.

that takes explicit account of the prospective decline in
energy reserves, suggests the need for a significant reduction in the non-energy current account
deficit to preserve long-term sustainability. This analysis is subject to a number of caveats,
however, including potentially higher export capacity in the non-energy sector as a result of
current investments.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
The discussions focused on two challenges: preparing for the risk of contagion and
preserving macroeconomic stability with falling energy revenues and still high inflation.
Although contagion has been limited, there was agreement about the importance of preparing
for the possibility of more severe spillovers from the global financial crisis by strengthening the
crisis-response framework and developing contingency measures. At the same time, the
authorities need to safeguard fiscal and external sustainability in the face of falling energy
revenues, while containing harmful second-round effects on inflation, just at a time when the
external environment is deteriorating dramatically.
A. Preparing for the Risk of Contagion
10.
The authorities were keenly aware of the risks arising from the worldwide
financial crisis and were determined to react swiftly, should the need arise. Even though
they considered the country’s financial sector to be relatively secure, due to high liquidity and

12
Box 2. Exchange Rate Assessment 1
Exchange rate assessments for nonrenewable resource exporters are complex. During a commodity
price boom, improved terms of trade lead to an increase in the equilibrium real exchange rate. In these
circumstances, unless the actual real exchange rate moves in tandem, regression-based analyses typically
suggest that the currency is undervalued—a conclusion that is also supported by an implicit large current
account (CA) surplus. On the other hand, large CA surpluses tend to be temporary, reflecting the
appropriate desire to save for the future, when the nonrenewable resources are depleted. Analyses that
focus on external sustainability and take the prospective depletion of these resources explicitly into
account can incorporate such intertemporal aspects. However, they are normative in nature and depend
on a number of assumptions—the resource prices, the pace of extraction, and the effect of resourcefinanced spending on economic growth—as well as on the specific definition of sustainability.
In the case of Trinidad and Tobago, a regression-based analysis suggests that the real effective
exchange rate (REER) is in line with fundamentals. As the terms of trade have improved through
2008, and both tradable sector productivity and government consumption have risen, the equilibrium
real exchange rate has increased. However, so has the actual REER, with the result that the two rates are
closely aligned on the basis of staff’s estimated model.
In contrast, an analysis that focuses on long-term external sustainability suggests that the large
deficit in the non-energy
CA is unsustainable. In

terms; in percent of nonenergy GDP; or in real per capita terms. In each case, the sustainable deficit is lower than the current
and projected deficits, but the magnitude of deviations differs considerably between 5½ and
12 percentage points of GDP over the medium term. An important caveat to this analysis is, however,
that investments that raise the CA deficit in the medium term may durably boost export capacity in the
non-energy sector. Thus, the long-term CA could be much stronger than what is projected over the
medium term, without the need for a real depreciation of the currency.
In sum, the exchange rate assessment yields different results, depending on the methodology and
time frame underlying the analysis. This explains why recent appreciation pressures in the presence of
a high overall CA surplus are compatible with the assessment that the non-energy CA will need to
strengthen over time to preserve long-term sustainability. Fiscal adjustment will be key in this regard.

strong capital positions, they realized that even ample liquidity in the system was no guarantee
for banks’ willingness to lend to each other or to domestic firms. Thus, the CBTT was
monitoring the situation closely and was prepared to respond promptly to signs of problems,
taking note of measures that have recently been taken by other central banks to ease and
broaden access to liquidity and to preserve interbank lending. The CBTT has also requested
financial institutions to conduct regular stress tests of their most important exposures. The
mission welcomed this, while urging the CBTT to accelerate its development of in-house
capacity for stress testing and its work on a crisis-management plan, in conjunction with
regional supervisors.
11.
The authorities agreed that the global situation added urgency to the enactment of
improved financial sector legislation and the strengthening of supervisory practices. The
mission welcomed the passage in the lower house of Parliament of a new Financial Institutions
Act, which was subsequently also passed by the Senate. Its swift implementation will be crucial
to enhance the central bank’s ability to supervise the country’s complex financial sector and lay
the foundation for follow-up legislation in the areas of insurance, securities, pensions, and
credit unions. The mission encouraged the authorities, in implementing the improved
framework, to (i) press for changes in conglomerates’ holding structures, with a clear separation
of financial and non-financial activities; (ii) review risk-management practices and enforce
prudential standards on a consolidated basis; and (iii) coordinate closely with regional and
international supervisors on the basis of clear home/host country responsibilities. The
authorities confirmed their commitment to act accordingly.
B. Preserving Macroeconomic Stability
12.
There was broad agreement on the need to adjust fiscal policy to already lower
energy prices and the possibility of considerably slower growth in 2009. Even though the
government has cushions to weather shocks, spending adjustment will be needed to contain a
rapidly deteriorating fiscal position and safeguard sustainability under more difficult
circumstances. The mission welcomed the authorities’ commitment not to tap into the savings
accumulated in the Heritage and Stabilization Fund (HSF) and recommended maintaining
nominal spending in FY 2008/09 at the level of the previous year. While the authorities were
still debating the overall spending envelope at the time of the visit, they have since identified
savings (beyond those on fuel subsidies) of nearly 2½ percent of GDP relative to the budget—
about ½ percent of GDP more than suggested by the mission. These cuts will be achieved by
spending restraint across all ministries and the postponement of a range of projects that were
scheduled to commence this fiscal year. As a result, expenditures will be 2 percentage points of
GDP lower than in the previous year, and the central government deficit would be contained at
1 percent of GDP under current energy price projections. In the event of an even larger decline
in energy prices and economic activity in 2009, the mission advised the government to let
automatic stabilizers operate to cushion the adverse impact on the domestic economy.

14
13.
Beyond the immediate challenges, the mission argued that further policy
adjustments would be needed over the coming years to preserve long-term sustainability.
While public spending on infrastructure and education are important components of the
government’s development strategy, the magnitude of the recent fiscal expansion has been
excessive. It has not only contributed to high inflation and risks of Dutch disease, but also
implied large non-energy deficits that cannot be sustained in the longer term. To generate
adequate savings in the HSF that would allow the country to benefit permanently from its
existing energy wealth, the mission urged a further reduction in the non-energy deficit over the
medium term, combined with a return to more conservative energy price assumptions. Informed
by an analysis of long-term sustainability, it advised the government to reduce the non-energy
deficit by another 4 percentage points of GDP beyond the 2 percentage points already
identified for the current fiscal year (Box 3). This would reverse the increase in primary
spending, as a share of GDP, that has occurred since 2002/03 when energy revenues were only
about 2 percentage points of GDP lower than projected for 2008/09.
14.
The authorities acknowledged the need to preserve long-term sustainability, but
stressed the importance of growth-enhancing investments and economic diversification.
While they recognized that fiscal policy had contributed to inflation, they pointed out that the
key driver—the surge in food prices—was a global phenomenon whose inflationary impact
should soon recede or even be reversed. At the same time, the government considered
infrastructure and human capital investments critical for removing supply bottlenecks and
enhancing productivity. Thus, while they were committed to accumulate additional savings in
the HSF, they also believed that increased tax revenues from a growing non-energy sector
would help reduce the non-energy deficit over the medium term. The planned Central Revenue
Authority will be instrumental in further strengthening revenue administration, while the soonto-be established macro-fiscal unit in the Ministry of Finance will provide the analytical
underpinnings for sustainable medium-term expenditure planning.
15.
The mission saw scope for further targeted expenditure restraint that would be
conducive to long-term growth. While acknowledging the benefits of many public investment
projects, it argued for:
¾ a careful prioritization, phasing, and monitoring of projects, combined with an overall
streamlining of public sector activities to avoid duplication and inefficiencies;
¾ a better-targeted approach to social programs, which would also permit more effective
support to those in need; and
¾ more generally, a significant reduction in the amount of transfers and subsidies, that has
increased sharply in recent years.
In this regard, the mission welcomed the recent increase in electricity tariffs and the price of
premium gasoline, but argued for a comprehensive approach to phase out unproductive

15
Box 3. Fiscal Sustainability Analysis
The large non-energy deficits of recent years are not sustainable. Sustainability is defined
here as maintaining a constant primary non-energy deficit, in real terms, that could be
financed permanently from projected energy revenues. As the economy grows, this constant
primary deficit—which is estimated at about 8 percent of GDP (15 percent of non-energy
GDP) in FY 2007/08—would shrink in relation to GDP to 6½ percent (12 percent of nonenergy GDP) by 2012/13 (Figure 5). With an actual primary non-energy deficit of just above
12½ percent of GDP in 2007/08, the needed adjustment would amount to some 6 percentage
points of GDP over the medium term under a front-loaded adjustment path. In contrast, an
unchanged primary deficit would cause a depletion of net assets by 2019, requiring a sharp
fiscal adjustment of almost 25 percent of non-energy GDP thereafter.

This assessment is predicated on energy prices that, despite the recent decline, remain
significantly above their longer-term historical averages. The analysis implicitly assumes
that a significant part of the increase in real energy prices since the mid-1990s is permanent,
reflecting greater global demand. Alternatively, the sustainable non-energy primary deficit
would be 5 percent of current GDP (and 4 percent of GDP in 2012/13), if real energy prices
fell back to their historical averages. Other factors that would change the assessment include
possible discoveries and exploration of new reserves or changes in the energy tax regime.1
Prospective energy price volatility can create additional challenges. Even if energy prices
remain at higher levels, on average, the temporary decline from the global economic
slowdown could become steeper. Indeed, energy prices have previously been below their
long-run average for sustained periods. Should this be the case, assuming the same pattern of
volatility observed in the past, it would also have an adverse impact on sustainability.

At the same time, they stressed that a further reduction in subsidies needed to be phased in
carefully. In the case of water, for example, a move to a pricing system based on usage required
major investments to improve service delivery and establish meters.
16.
There was agreement that the challenge for monetary policy was to combat
inflation without intensifying the prospective slowdown in economic activity. The mission
agreed with the successive tightening of monetary policy in response to rising inflation rates
and rapid credit growth, and shared the CBTT’s concerns about second-round effects on
inflation in still tight labor markets. While the CBTT believed that inflation would be more
persistent than projected by staff, both parties concurred that pressures were likely to ease with
falling international food prices and a weaker economic outlook. Thus, once concerns of
second-round effects diminished, the CBTT would have scope to ease monetary policy by
reversing the earlier increases in reserve requirements, while managing liquidity flexibly
through open market operations. In this context, the mission welcomed the introduction of
additional sterilization paper in the form of treasury bonds, which should facilitate domestic
liquidity management and a more effective transmission of repo rates to domestic interest rates.
17.
The mission also encouraged the authorities to move, over time, to a more flexible
exchange rate policy, consistent with its de jure regime of a managed float. It was agreed
that the current turbulent times were not right for a fundamental shift in exchange rate policies.
However, the mission argued that once global conditions have stabilized, a gradual move to
more exchange rate flexibility could bring important advantages. It would cushion the impact of
large swings in the terms of trade; provide an additional tool for managing domestic liquidity
and inflation in an environment of volatile energy revenues and capital flows; provide impetus
to the development of foreign exchange markets; and more generally, discourage currency
mismatches and associated vulnerabilities in private sector balance sheets. The authorities
stressed that the lumpiness of foreign exchange transactions within a narrow market required

18
active management to prevent excessive volatility. Overall, they felt that exchange rate stability
had served the country well and that the system provided sufficient flexibility, if needed.
C. Supporting Viable Diversification
18.
The mission commended the authorities for their readiness to confront the
country’s development challenges in a pro-active manner in their Vision 2020. It concurred
with the rationale for investing in physical and human capital to support the development of a
diversified, knowledge-based economy before energy resources are depleted. At the same time,
it alerted the authorities to three important risks in the implementation of their strategy:
¾ macroeconomic instability and competitiveness problems, when spending becomes too
large;
¾ waste and mismanagement, when projects are not carefully prioritized, phased, and
monitored; and
¾ future competitiveness and viability problems, when firms become overly dependent on
government support and artificially low energy prices.
The authorities acknowledged that the mission’s suggested fiscal adjustment measures would
help reduce these risks. At the same time, they stressed the need for the government to be an
active promoter of diversification, pointing to successes in developing a profitable downstream
energy industry—which would not have occurred in the absence of direct government
involvement.
19.
The mission encouraged the government to focus efforts primarily on measures
that would improve the overall business climate. Global comparisons of competitiveness
suggest that Trinidad and Tobago’s ranking has slipped, with considerable room for

welcomed the

enhancement of information-technology-based service provision, stressing that further
improvements in the business climate would also buttress the authorities’ plans for establishing
an International Financial Center (IFC)—the prospects of which may have become more

19
challenging in light of global financial developments. The authorities acknowledged that the
IFC’s success will depend on finding the right niches that could also provide links and
synergies with existing businesses and expertise. At the same time, they agreed with the
mission that a modern regulatory framework and market infrastructure are important requisites,
not just for the IFC but also to promote financial deepening and efficient resource allocation,
more generally, pointing to their ongoing efforts to modernize the tax, legal, and regulatory
frameworks.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
20.
Following a period of strong growth and large energy earnings, the authorities are
now facing the challenge of adjusting to a deteriorating external environment. The main
immediate tasks are to prepare for the risk of contagion from the global financial crisis, while
preserving macroeconomic stability in the face of declining energy revenues and still high
inflation.
21.
Trinidad and Tobago is better placed than many countries to weather the
international financial crisis, but is not immune from contagion. Direct spillovers from the
global turmoil have been limited, reflecting low external vulnerability and a fundamentally
sound banking system. However, falling energy prices and the possibility of a more severe
global slowdown than is currently envisaged pose risks, including from exposures of regional
conglomerates and the possibility of rising non-performing loans.
22.
The authorities are encouraged to accelerate the implementation of important
financial sector legislation and to strengthen their crisis-response framework. The recent
adoption of a new Financial Institutions Act is a crucial step for enhancing the central bank’s
power to effectively supervise the country’s complex financial sector, while also laying the
groundwork for important follow-up legislation. At the same time, it will be important to
identify contingency measures that would ease and broaden market access to liquidity in the
event of emerging tensions, and to accelerate work on a robust framework for in-house stresstesting and a joint regional crisis-management plan.
23.
The government’s recent decision to trim fiscal spending is an appropriately
prudent response to lower energy prices. The magnitude of the announced cuts, equivalent to
some 2 percentage points of GDP relative to 2007/08, should be sufficient to contain the deficit
at 1 percent of GDP under current energy price projections and is an important first step in a
much needed effort to strengthen the public finances. The adjustment strikes a reasonable
balance between containing a fiscal deterioration and limiting a procyclical withdrawal, and
also provides room for the operation of automatic stabilizers in the event of an even sharper
decline in energy prices or economic activity.
24.
Further policy adjustments will be needed over the coming years to preserve longterm sustainability. Non-energy deficits at the level of recent years will not be sustainable in

20
the context of declining non-renewable energy resources. To allow future generations to benefit
from the country’s existing energy wealth, the authorities should reduce the non-energy deficit
to about 8½ percent of GDP over the medium term—an adjustment of 4 percentage points of
GDP beyond the tightening envisaged for the current fiscal year. Such adjustments are feasible
without sacrificing development objectives, mainly through better prioritization and targeting of
programs that have expanded rapidly in recent years. Importantly, restraint over the medium
term would avoid a much larger, forced, adjustment in the future.
25.
Monetary policy faces the challenge of reducing inflation without intensifying the
prospective slowdown in economic activity. Following an appropriate cycle of policy
tightening, the CBTT has scope to respond to an easing of price pressures with a gradual
loosening of monetary policy, provided second-round effects on inflation are contained. In such
circumstances, reversals of earlier increases in reserve requirements should be combined with a
flexible management of liquidity through open market operations, which has been facilitated by
the welcome introduction of additional sterilization paper.
26.
The authorities should also consider moving, over time, to a more flexible exchange
rate. Once global conditions have stabilized, a gradual move to more exchange rate flexibility
could bring important advantages in stabilizing the domestic economy, managing liquidity,
strengthening market development, and discouraging currency exposures.
27.
The authorities are commended for their readiness to confront the country’s
development challenges in a pro-active manner in their Vision 2020. Investments in
physical and human capital are important to achieve this vision and develop a diversified,
knowledge-based economy before energy resources are depleted. At the same time, excessive
spending entails risks for macroeconomic stability and future competitiveness. Thus, the
authorities are encouraged to shift the focus of policies away from subsidies and direct
government involvement toward improvements in the business climate and the provision of
high-quality public goods and services.
28.

It is recommended to hold the next consultation on the standard 12-months cycle.

1/ Gross debt of the nonfinancial public sector, excluding debt issued for sterilization. Fiscal year data.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency

Appendix I. Methodology of Exchange Rate Assessment
Exchange rate assessments for nonrenewable resource exporters are complex. During a
commodity price boom, improved terms of trade lead to an appreciation of the equilibrium
real exchange rate. This phenomenon can be captured by regression-based analyses. On the
other hand, large CA surpluses tend to be temporary, reflecting the appropriate desire to save
for the future, when the nonrenewable resources are depleted. Analyses that focus on external
sustainability and take the prospective depletion of these resources explicitly into account can
incorporate such intertemporal aspects.
Approach Based on Estimation of Equilibrium Exchange Rate
This approach is based on a single-country time-series regression of the real effective
exchange rate (REER) on its fundamentals to estimate a cointegrating relationship among
these variables. This determines the “equilibrium” REER, and its discrepancy from the actual
REER. The analysis suggests that the estimated equilibrium REER is close to the actual
REER in 2007, with an undervaluation of about 0.7 percent.
Dataset. The dataset is on an annual basis from 1975–2007 and consists of Trinidad and
Tobago’s CPI-based REER (in log, called “lreer”), government consumption in percent of
non-energy GDP (“gcons”), manufacturing productivity relative to trading partners (in log,
“lprod”), and the crude oil price in real terms (in log, “lrealoil”). 1 Standard unit-root tests
suggest that these variables contain unit roots. A dummy variable is added to the dataset to
control for an abrupt adjustment of the REER in 1985 (“dummy_84_85”, which equals one
for 1984 and 1985 and zero for other years). The increase of the REER through 1984 partly
reflects the appreciation of the U.S. dollar in nominal effective terms, and its abrupt
downward adjustment is due to the large devaluation of the Trinidad and Tobago dollar in
December 1985.
Estimation. The cointegrating relationship is estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS) of
lreer on lrealoil, lprod, gcons, and dummy_84_85. OLS yields consistent estimates of the
cointegrating vector under the assumption that there is only one cointegrating relationship. 2
The estimated result is (with t-value in parentheses):

1

CPI-based REER is from the IMF INS database, the real crude oil price is based on the WEO oil price and
deflated by the US CPI, and government consumption, manufacturing productivity, and non-oil GDP are from
the Trinidad and Tobago authorities and staff estimates. Manufacturing productivity for Trinidad and Tobago is
for the non-energy sector.

2

However, if the residual of equation (1) and the first differences of independent variables are correlated, a
cointegrating vector estimated by small-sample OLS is subject to a bias and OLS t-test is not valid.

33

lreer = 3.651 + 0.074*lrealoil + 0.093*lprod + 0.014*gcons + 0.305*dummy_84_85 (1)
(16.40) (2.40)
(3.56)
(3.58)
(4.68)
This implies that the equilibrium REER appreciates by 0.07 percent in reaction to a one
percent increase in the real oil price; by 0.09 percent in reaction to a one percent increase in
relative productivity; and by 0.01 percent in reaction to an increase of government
consumption by one percent of non-energy GDP.
The residual of equation (1) appears stationary since the regression of the residual on its
lagged value generates the coefficient estimate of 0.57, substantially smaller than unity. This
observation is corroborated by a residual-based cointegration test, which rejects the null
hypothesis of no cointegration.
Result. The estimated equilibrium REER, i.e., the predicted value of leer from equation (1), is
close to the actual REER in 2007, with an undervaluation of about 0.7 percent (see chart).
The significant rise in the oil price in 2008 does not substantially affect this assessment: a
comparison between the average REER for January–June 2008 and the equilibrium REER
based on equation (1) with an average oil price of US$ 100 per barrel for 2008 and 2007
values for manufacturing productivity and government spending implies an estimated
undervaluation of the exchange rate by only 2 percent.

Sensitivity to variable choice. Table A.1 shows the result of the OLS regression with various
other variables. While net foreign assets (in percent of GDP or trade) are expected to
influence the real effective exchange rate, the coefficient estimate for this variable is
statistically insignificant. If lrealoil is replaced with terms of trade for goods and services, the
coefficient becomes larger, reflecting smaller volatility of the terms of trade than oil prices.
The effect of a dummy variable for trade restrictions is statistically insignificant. In any

34
event, the degree of undervaluation or overvaluation for 2007 under any of these alternative
specifications is less than 2 percent.
Sensitivity to estimation methodology. An alternative estimation, which was used in the 2007
Article IV consultation, is based on the Johansen maximum likelihood method. As presented
in Table A.1, its results are highly sensitive to the vector error correction specification. The
suggested number of cointegrating relationships ranges between 0 and 2, depending on the
lag length. Under the assumption of one cointegration relationship, the estimated
cointegrating vector is highly sensitive to the lag length, and yields an implausible negative
coefficient for lrealoil.

Approach Based on Long-term External Sustainability
Under this approach, sustainable paths of the non-energy current account (CA) deficit that
can be financed by Trinidad and Tobago’s energy wealth are calculated and compared with
its projected path. The analysis suggests that the large deficit in the non-energy current
account is not sustainable, because the sustainable non-energy CA deficit is lower than the
projected path. However, this result is subject to significant caveats.

35
Methodology. The basic idea is the same as for the fiscal sustainability analysis. Specifically,
the country accumulates external assets by transforming energy wealth into financial wealth,
and uses proceeds from these assets to finance its non-energy CA deficit. Under a sustainable
path for the non-energy CA deficit, net external assets will be maintained constant in
perpetuity. These paths depend on the definition of sustainability—external assets can be
maintained constant in real terms, in percent of GDP, or in real per capita terms.
More precisely, let A0 be the initial external assets, which are the sum of the net present
value of residents’ take of energy wealth and other external financial assets at period 0. The
dynamics of external assets in real terms, At , is expressed by At +1 = (1 + r ) At − Bt +1 , where
Bt and r is the non-energy CA deficit in real terms and real rate of return, respectively. Let
Yt and Lt be the country’s real non-energy GDP and the population at time t, respectively,
and y and l be the growth rate of real non-energy GDP and the population growth rate,
respectively. Under this terminology, the dynamics of external assets (i) in real terms, (ii) in
percent of non-energy GDP, and (iii) in per capita terms, are characterized by a difference
equation with a form of
at +1 = (1 + q )at − bt +1 = at + (q at − bt +1 ) .
From this equation, at = a0 for all t if and only if bt = q a0 for all t. This means that if
external assets (either in real terms, in percent of non-energy GDP, or in real per capita
terms) need to be maintained at a constant level in perpetuity, the non-energy CA deficit
must be equal to the initial external assets a0 times q , which can be interpreted as a rate of
return, defined somewhat differently in the three specifications. More specifically, for the
three definitions of sustainability described above, the difference equation and the sustainable
level of non-energy CA deficit are described as follows.

The parameter values are set as follows. The initial value of external assets, A0 , is the sum of
the net external assets as of end-2007 and the net present value of residents’ take from the
production value of crude oil and natural gas. The latter comprises the government’s take as
assumed in the fiscal sustainability analysis, and the private sector’s take, which is assumed
to be 5 percent of the production value of crude oil and natural gas (reflecting an estimate of
the labor share in value added). The parameter values of r and y are set at 0.04 and 0.03,
respectively (the same as for the fiscal sustainability analysis), and l is set at 0.01 (taking
into account historical population growth). 3
The computed sustainable levels of the non-energy CA deficit are then compared with the
projected path of the non-energy CA balance. The non-energy CA balance is defined as the
CA balance excluding the net export of the energy sector and net interest payments. 4 The
sustainable and projected paths of non-energy GDP are expressed in percent of GDP (i.e.,
energy and non-energy GDP).

Similarly, if sustainability is defined as constant in percent of GDP and in real per capita

Caveat. An important caveat to this analysis is that investments that raise the CA deficit in
the medium term may durably boost export capacity in the non-energy sector. Thus, the longterm CA balance could be much stronger than what is projected over the medium term,

APPENDIX II. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF APPENDICES
Discussion. The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Port of Spain during
November 4–17, 2008. The staff team comprised Christina Daseking (head), Werner Keller,
Padamja Khandelwal, and Masahiro Nozaki (all WHD). Ms. Anne Joseph (OED)
participated in policy discussion meetings. The mission met with Hon. Karen NunezTesheira, Minister of Finance; Senator Hon. Mariano Browne, Minister in the Ministry of
Finance; Mr. Ewart Williams, Governor of the CBTT; government and central bank officials;
and representatives of the private sector, labor unions, and the opposition. A press conference
was held after the concluding meeting with the authorities.
Exchange Rate Arrangement. Trinidad and Tobago has accepted the obligations of Article
VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on current
account transactions. The system, a de jure managed float, is classified as a stabilized
arrangement under the Fund’s revised methodology.
Fund Relations. Trinidad and Tobago has no outstanding purchases and loans with the
Fund. The last financial arrangement was a Stand-by Arrangement from April 1990 to March
1991, totaling SDR85 million. Recent technical assistance included standardization of
monetary and financial statistics (STA, January 2008), setup of institutional arrangements for
a medium-term fiscal framework (FAD, January 2008), and assignment of resident experts
for insurance supervision (MCM, since October 2007).
Relations with the World Bank Group. The last Country Assistance Strategy for Trinidad
and Tobago was discussed at the Board in 1999. Its current operation includes an HIV/AIDS
Prevention and Control Program, with total commitment of US$20.0 million.
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The IDB is the main source
of overseas development assistance for Trinidad and Tobago. The current loan portfolio
consists of approved loan operations of US$454 million, and an undisbursed value of
US$305 million. The IDB is preparing a new country strategy for Trinidad and Tobago, with
a focus on improving quality of public expenditure and enhancing private sector
development.
Statistical Issues. Trinidad and Tobago produces a wide range of economic and financial
statistics that are largely based on sound methodological principles. Data provision has some
shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The country has participated in the
General Data Dissemination System since 2004.

Currently, the IDB is the main source of overseas development assistance for Trinidad and
Tobago. Since 2002, annual disbursements and approvals have averaged US$37 million and
US$32 million per year, resepectively. However, cash flow has been quite strongly negative
as the portfolio has gradually diminished in size.

Areas of future focus

The IDB is currently preparing a new Country Strategy for Trinidad and Tobago for the
period of 2008-2012. Based on an analysis of the current economic conditions, the strategy
for sovereign financing is expected to focus mainly on quality of public expenditure and
(non-energy sector) private sector development. The Bank will also continue to provide
support in the health and housing sectors, and bring to fruition long-standing preparations
for an environmental program in Southwest Tobago.
•

•

Quality of public expenditure: The Bank proposes to support: (i) the modernisation
of procurement and financial management systems; (ii) the gradual introduction of a
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework; and (iii) the strengthening of results-based
management in key sector agencies.
Private sector development: The Bank is already assisting in the establishment of
new framework for Public-Private Partnerships, and plans to develop a support
program for Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises.

In addition, the Bank anticipates an expansion of its non-sovereign guaranteed financing to
Trinidad and Tobago’s private sector, possibly in the areas of energy, tourism,
infrastructure, and financial services.

7
APPENDIX IV. TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO—STATISTICAL ISSUES

Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. On
September 30, 2004, Trinidad and Tobago started participating in the IMF’s General Data
Dissemination System. However, metadata and plans for improving the statistical system
need to be updated in line with commitments under the GDDS. Institutional arrangements
need to be strengthened to facilitate improved compilation and reporting as well as
collaboration among the central bank, the central statistical office, and the ministry of
finance, planning, and development, and to avoid duplication of data production efforts and
some inconsistencies across sectoral databases.
Real sector statistics

The Central Statistical Office (CSO) revised the GDP base year from 1985 to 2000,
improved the methodology for calculating value added at each sector level, and switched
from valuation at factor cost to market prices. The upgrading of the national accounts has
involved, in particular, the inclusion of the large gas sector production (which came on
stream in 2000) in the GDP calculations; and a review of the value added estimation
techniques for the telecommunications sector (using the number of call units instead of the
number of callers) and the financial sector (by constructing individual extrapolators for each
sub-industry and then aggregating them). The CSO does not produce quarterly GDP
estimates, although the central bank compiles quarterly volume indicators. A STA technical
assistance mission on national accounts in September 2005 encouraged the CSO to start the
compilation process of quarterly macro indicators. The mission also found that while there
was no serious staff shortages that could affect the production of statistics, a staff reallocation
would improve efficiency.
The public has direct access to the retail price index which is published in the CSO’s website.
The retail price index was rebased from 1985 to January 2003 to incorporate information
from the 1997/98 Household Budgetary Survey, and to correct the index’s aggregation
formula.
Government finance statistics

Data on central government operations and debt are compiled separately by the Ministry of
Finance, Planning, and Development (MFPD) and the central bank, and show significant
differences. The MFPD compiles fiscal data using a national classification system for
government transactions and debt of the central government. These data are sufficiently
detailed for use in compiling cash data according to GFSM 1986 methodology. Reporting of
these cash-based data in the GFSM 2001 framework is also being undertaken by the MFPD.

8
Data for the period 2003-05 were published in the 2007 Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook (GFSY) and a submission of 2006 data has been received by STA for publication in
the 2008 GFSY.
Data on selected public enterprises and statutory bodies are compiled by the investment
division, the domestic debt division, and the budget division of the MFPD. The data
compiled by these divisions are subject to differences, particularly with respect to transfers.
Expense data are sometimes misclassified, as the distinction between consumption of fixed
capital and use of goods and services is not made.
Monetary and financial statistics

The monthly monetary account for other depository corporations (ODCs) currently covers
only financial institutions that are licensed by the central bank under the 1993 Financial
Institutions Act. No licensed ODCs only report voluntarily on a quarterly basis. No data are
reported by credit unions and the Post Office Savings Bank. The lack of these data has
prevented the compilation of a more comprehensive Depository Corporation Survey. The
authorities should also consider developing systems for reporting balance sheet accounts for
the mutual funds, with a view to compiling a more comprehensive financial survey in the
future. Trinidad and Tobago has not yet migrated to the standardized report forms (SRFs) for
the submission of monetary statistics. In January 2008, a mission assisted the authorities in
producing the SRF for the central bank.
External sector statistics

Quarterly aggregate balance of payments estimates and annual balance of payments data are
disseminated by the central bank in its national publications. Annual balance of payments
data are also sent to STA, although with considerable delay. The presentation of the balance
of payments data is in broad conformity with guidelines outlined in the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. The Private Sector Capital Flows and Investor Perception
survey needs to be improved on the quantity and quality of responses, and by estimating the
market value of shares. There are sizable differences between some items of the external
public debt compiled by the Central Bank and the MFPD. The Central Bank should expand
its current debt reporting system to include comprehensive coverage of external loans and
debt of the entire public sector, as well as publicly guaranteed debt.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 6, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Trinidad and Tobago
On January 14, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Trinidad and Tobago.1
Background
Supported by a booming energy sector, Trinidad and Tobago has achieved an
impressive economic track record, with real GDP growth averaging 9 percent a year
during 2002–07. Per capita income has doubled, and both the unemployment and public
debt ratios were halved. Moreover, with official reserves covering close to 10 months of
imports, the country has acquired one of the strongest credit ratings in the region. Low
external vulnerability, together with a well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable banking
system, have also limited direct spillovers from the international financial crisis, but
falling energy prices and a more challenging external environment pose risks.
Faced with a prospective decline in energy resources, the government has embarked on
an ambitious development and diversification strategy. Its Vision 2020 aims at attaining
developed-country status by that year, relying on gradually declining energy revenues to
support a diversified non-energy economy through subsidies and public investment in
infrastructure.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
The economy grew by 5½ percent in 2007 on the basis of sustained growth in the nonenergy sector. Growth in the energy sector, which accounts for nearly half of GDP, fell
below 2 percent. However, robust energy prices kept the current account surplus close
to 25 percent of GDP.
Fiscal policy was expansionary. While the overall central government balance fluctuated
considerably with volatile energy prices, the non-energy deficit remained at around
15 percent of GDP (28 percent of non-energy GDP) in recent years. This contributed to
robust growth and record low unemployment, but also, together with sharply rising food
prices, to rising inflation.
The fiscal expansion also complicated monetary policy, especially in the context of a de
facto peg to the U.S. dollar. The large inflows and spending of energy revenues fueled
money growth and excess liquidity in the banking system. The central bank responded
with a successive tightening of policies, using its entire arsenal of instruments. While
these measures have been effective recently in reducing private credit growth, they will
take time to be reflected in lower inflation rates.
In the face of a deteriorating external environment, economic growth is projected to slow
to 3½ percent in 2008 and 2 percent in 2009. This, together with falling international
food prices, should also help dampen domestic price pressures, with inflation projected
to decline to 7½ percent in 2009, down from 11¾ percent this year. At the same time,
the current account surplus is projected to shrink to 12 percent of GDP in response to
falling energy export earnings, while the central government balance would register a
deficit of 1 percent of GDP under current energy price projections, despite recently
announced expenditure cuts.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed that Trinidad and Tobago has achieved an impressive
improvement in economic performance in recent years, supported by a booming energy
sector. But now the deteriorating external environment, marked by falling energy prices
and a severe global slowdown, poses risks to the economy. Directors observed that
Trinidad and Tobago seems better placed than many other countries to weather this
adverse external environment, reflecting the high level of international reserves and the
fundamentally sound banking system. Nonetheless, they advised the authorities to
accelerate the preparation of contingency plans to preserve macroeconomic stability
under more difficult circumstances.
Directors welcomed the recent passage of a new Financial Institutions Act, which will
enhance the ability of the central bank to supervise the financial sector. Directors
encouraged the authorities to adopt important follow-up legislation and to push ahead
with identifying contingency measures in case of emerging liquidity pressures. They
further stressed the importance of establishing a robust framework for the stress-testing
of financial institutions and a crisis management plan on a regional basis.

3

Directors commended the authorities’ decision to trim fiscal spending for 2008/09 in
response to lower energy revenue. They were of the view that the envisaged cuts strike
a reasonable balance between containing the fiscal deterioration and limiting a
procyclical withdrawal, leaving room for automatic stabilizers to operate. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ intention not to tap the resources of the Heritage and
Stabilization Fund.
Directors stressed that further fiscal adjustment will be needed over the coming years
to reduce the non-energy deficit in the fiscal and current accounts to levels that are
sustainable in the long run. Over the medium term, a further fiscal tightening would be
advisable and feasible through better prioritizing and targeting of expenditure, without
sacrificing development objectives.
Executive Directors concurred that the recent cycle of monetary policy tightening had
been appropriate to stem inflationary pressures. At the same time, they underscored the
need to remain vigilant in balancing the risks of inflation and slower economic activity.
They considered that the central bank has scope to gradually loosen monetary policy,
once concerns over second-round inflationary effects have abated.
Directors noted the staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate of the
Trinidad and Tobago dollar is broadly in line with current fundamentals. They agreed
with the authorities that now is not the right time for a fundamental shift in exchange rate
policies. Once global conditions have stabilized, however, some Directors encouraged
the authorities to consider greater exchange rate flexibility under their managed float
arrangement.
Directors commended the authorities for their Vision 2020 strategy to achieve
developed-country status, and for their pro-active approach to addressing the country’s
development challenges in anticipation of diminishing energy resources. Going forward,
they encouraged the authorities to shift the focus of policies further away from subsidies

The authorities wish to express their appreciation for the quality of dialogue with
staff during the consultation, as well as for the recommendations and advice contained in the
report.
Recent Economic Developments
2.
The Trinidad and Tobago economy has enjoyed over 14 years of economic
expansion, and during this time, the country has established a solid record of macroeconomic
stability. The unemployment rate, currently around 5 percent, is the lowest on record. The
external position is strong, with very high current account surpluses, reserves of about 11
months of import cover at the end of 2008, and a sovereign wealth fund of approximately
11.8 percent of GDP. The public sector accounts are also strong. There has been a build-up
of fiscal surpluses over the last seven years and the public sector debt to GDP ratio has fallen
to 27.2 percent of GDP. Consequently, the economy is well placed to weather the present
global economic storm, although some adverse impact has occurred and is expected in 2009.
3.
Over the past five years, GDP growth has averaged 7.1 percent, with both the
energy and non-energy sectors recording buoyant activity with increases of 8.1 percent and
6.1 percent, respectively. Moreover, reflecting the government’s efforts to diversify the
economy, the non-energy sector was the main driver of economic activity in 2007 and 2008,
with buoyant conditions in manufacturing, tourism and financial services. Moreover, activity
in the agriculture sector rebounded sharply with growth accelerating to 8.6 percent in 2008
after years of contraction. Admittedly, GDP growth slowed somewhat in 2008 to 3.5 percent.
Growth in energy sector output was only 0.4 because of lower production of crude oil and
flat growth in the capacity-constrained petrochemicals industries. In contrast, the non-energy
sector recorded stronger growth of 4.8 percent.
4.
In 2008, inflation was the major challenge confronting the authorities, as domestic
prices increased by 11.8 percent in the first eleven months of 2008, compared with
7.9 percent in January-November 2007. The economy suffered as did the global economy,
from escalating international food prices. Core inflation, which filters out the food
component, was more moderate at 6.1 percent. However, this was 1.7 percentage points
above the rate for 2007, as second round effects had begun to pass through the economy.
One of the other major influences on inflation has been the non-energy fiscal deficit, which is
estimated at 14.7 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2007/2008. This, together with sharp
increases in private sector credit, fueled demand pressures that ran up against supply
bottlenecks. Rising inflationary expectations have begun to influence the level of wage
demands, as well as decisions to spend rather than save and have also prompted businesses to
increase margins as a hedge against rising prices.
5.
The central bank has used every available tool at its disposal to tighten liquidity
and hence contain demand pressures. The monetary authority raised its key policy rate three

2
times during 2008, supported by open market operations, which more than doubled in fiscal
year 2007/08, as well as sales of foreign exchange to the market. Rising inflationary
pressures also led the central bank to further tighten its monetary policy stance by raising the
primary reserve requirement by 2 percentage points on three separate occasions. In addition,
the authorities have periodically been issuing government bonds and Treasury Notes to aid in
liquidity absorption. The proceeds from these securities have been sterilized. These
measures have begun to have an impact as credit expansion, in particular, consumer lending
has slowed considerably, reflecting higher interest rates. On the supply side, the government
embarked on a number of initiatives to improve the efficiency of the distribution network for
agricultural produce, as well as to increase the supply of these items with the establishment
of a number of mega farms, the first of which began harvesting in the last quarter of 2008. It
is expected that the increase in the supply of domestic agricultural produce would dampen
price pressures. In addition, investment in the sector should improve the linkages with other
sectors of the economy and provide an incentive for private sector participation in
downstream agri-businesses. Moreover, the government eliminated or significantly reduced
import duties and value added taxes on a wide range of food items, which cushioned the
impact of higher food prices on vulnerable groups in the society.
6.
The fiscal position has been strong over the past seven years, reflecting mainly
increased revenues from the energy sector. The government recognizes that the widening of
the non-energy fiscal deficit has helped to fuel inflationary pressures, and sees the reduction
of the latter as an economic and social priority. To this end, in the 2008/2009 Budget, the
government reduced the subsidy on premium gasoline and intends to reduce the fuel subsidy
further, over the medium term, with the provision of a viable fuel alternative for the
population - compressed natural gas. At the same time, the government sees the growth in the
non-energy deficit as temporary and in keeping with its prioritization of investments in
education, health, housing, social services and infrastructure. These investments are intended
to enhance economic growth and provide impetus for the expansion of the non-energy sector
and the diversification of the economy.
Outlook and Measures to Mitigate the Impact of the Global Economic Slowdown
7.
The authorities concur with staff that the economy should grow by about 2 percent
in 2009, on the back of the impact of the global recession on output of oil, gas and
petrochemicals, while activity in the non-energy sector is projected to show a modest
increase. The external current account surplus is expected to decline and the fiscal account to
balance or record a small deficit. The major challenge remains the control of inflationary
pressures, which should recede in 2009 and in the medium term, in response to the fall in
international food prices, increased domestic food supply and lower government spending.
This fall may be tempered in light of the heightened inflationary expectations in the
economy, and the time lag in the response of domestic prices to the fall in international food
prices.
8.
The government, keenly aware of the impact of the external environment on the
economy, and having benefited from similar previous experiences, moved quickly to adjust
both recurrent and capital expenditure, in light of an expected reduced revenue stream. The

3
authorities also announced that social spending would not be reduced, in an effort to mitigate
the impact on vulnerable groups. Moreover, in negotiating a soft landing for the economy,
the government is also intent on maintaining momentum in economic activity. This will be
helped by the fact that approximately 60 percent of government revenues are currently
derived from natural gas, the price of which has been falling at a less precipitous rate than
that of oil. In addition, the government has declared its intention not to tap into the resources
of the Heritage and Stabilisation Fund, but to access accumulated savings, if necessary.
9.
The central bank’s priority remains the containment of inflationary pressures, the
prospect of which appears attainable, especially in light of an expected reduction in
government spending, lower international food prices and a projected increase in agricultural
production. However, the bank intends to maintain a tight monetary stance in order to further
reduce bank credit and rein in demand pressures. Staff has stated that a more flexible
exchange rate would provide an additional tool for managing inflation. However, the
authorities are of the view that exchange rate stability has served as a solid anchor for the
economy’s growth and development.
10.
The financial sector is sound and contagion from the global financial turmoil has
been minimal. The banking sector is profitable, liquid, well capitalized and does not depend
much on foreign borrowing. In addition, a new Financial Institutions Act became law in
November 2008, strengthening the regulatory framework. The Act upgrades and improves
the oversight of financial conglomerates and makes provision for the sharing of information
with other regulators in the Caribbean and addresses the issue of inter-institutional cooperation. The legislation also provides for reporting requirements for financial holding
companies on a consolidated basis and with respect to connected parties of licensees. A new
Securities Act should be laid in Parliament in 2009, which will establish the foundation for a
modern securities market and make the country’s capital market more attractive to both
foreign and domestic investors. Plans are also progressing to improve regulatory oversight of
credit unions. The authorities have taken note of staff’s recommendation with respect to the
identification of contingency measures in the event of tensions in the financial system and
have begun work in this area. In this regard, given the fact that some of the country’s banks
have a presence in many Caribbean jurisdictions, the authorities are working on a
contingency plan with other regulators in the region. Moreover, the limit on deposit
insurance was already raised by 50 percent in 2007.
Structural Reforms and Other Issues
11.
The authorities are intent on continuing to improve tax administration. To this
end, plans to establish the Trinidad and Tobago Revenue Authority are well advanced and
the enabling legislation should be passed in 2009. This would enhance efficiency in the areas
of tax and customs administration and improve service delivery to the government as well as
the population. Work on property tax reform is also ongoing. In addition, the authorities plan
to implement a new system for delivery of social services that will involve decentralization
and collaboration with civil society. This should enhance efficiency and facilitate the
reporting and monitoring process. The authorities are appreciative of the technical assistance

4
provided by the Fund in 2008, to assist them in strengthening macro-fiscal capacity and in
setting up a medium-term fiscal framework.
12.
The authorities are also advancing their plans for the diversification of the
economy. One major project in this area is the establishment of an International Financial
Center, work on which is at an advanced stage. The government will work with the private
sector to develop other sectors that have been identified. In addition, the government
proposes to establish a Business and Investment Secretariat, which should improve
administrative efficiency and allow investors to access information on the necessary steps to
establish a business. Plans are also afoot to form a National Productivity Council, which
would seek ways to improve competitiveness in light of the country’s fall in the ranking of
the Global Competitiveness Index. The authorities have also initiated dialogue with business
and labor to discuss, in the first instance, the outlook for the domestic economy in 2009. This
should lay the foundation for ongoing discussions on many issues including the improvement
of the business climate.
