STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 13, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context. After emerging from a long struggle for independence and internal conflicts
between 1999 and 2006, Timor-Leste has made substantial progress toward restoring
stability and rebuilding the country. Rising government spending has supported strong
economic growth, but inflation has increased to double digits. The government launched
its Strategic Development Plan to step up development.
Focus. Discussions centered on an appropriate fiscal stance to manage near-term
inflation risks and sustain high growth, and on financial sector development.
Fiscal stance. The planned investment in infrastructure is welcome, but given doubledigit inflation, staff advised slowing the planned increase in capital spending over the
next few years to better align with the absorptive capacity of the economy and
administrative constraints. In the absence of monetary policy (Timor-Leste uses the U.S.
dollar), sound fiscal policy is key to containing high inflation and sustaining strong
growth. Staff supported the government’s plan to reduce the non-oil fiscal balance to a
sustainable level over the next 10 years, to provide an anchor for fiscal policy.
Public financial management (PFM). The government has improved the PFM system. A
well managed Petroleum Fund is in place, and new institutions have been established to
manage large public investment programs. The authorities need to further strengthen
institutional capacities and develop human resources.
Financial sector. Foreign bank branches dominate the sector, but financial services are
underdeveloped and nonperforming loans are high. Developing the financial sector and
strengthening the credit culture are crucial for sustained growth in the private sector.

Box 1. Infrastructure Development Needs
Infrastructure bottlenecks are a fundamental constraint
to economic development in Timor-Leste. According to
the Global Competitiveness Report 2011–12, inadequate
infrastructure is the most problematic factor for doing
business in Timor-Leste, and Timor-Leste ranks at the
bottom in the Asia Pacific region and among fragile states,
marked by an inadequate electricity supply and poor roads.

The SDP puts infrastructure development as a
central pillar to promote the country’s
development. To improve poor infrastructure,
capital spending has increased rapidly and is
expected to remain very high compared with that
of other countries, including fragile states (text
figure). The government is focusing on electricity,
roads, and the rural housing program. It is also
investing in infrastructure on the South Coast to
attract investment in the downstream petroleum
sector.

The infrastructure of Timor-Leste was largely destroyed
in the 1999 civil conflict. One third of the population has
no access to improved drinking water, 60 percent lack
decent sanitation facilities, and two thirds are living without
electricity. Around 90 percent of roads are in poor condition
and seaport, airport, and telecommunications need urgent
improvements.

1/ The program includes a supply base, a refinery and petrochemical center,
and an LNG plant.

To better manage large public investment
programs, the government established several
new institutions. In 2011 the Infrastructure Fund
was set up to facilitate the development of large,
multi-year projects. The Secretariat of Major
Projects at the MOF was given responsibility for
reviewing projects proposed by line ministries, and
the final approval is decided either by the Board of
the Infrastructure Fund (for projects less than
$5 million), or by the Council of Ministers (for
projects above $5 million). The National
Development Agency was established to supervise
project implementation, and the Procurement
Commission to assist in the procurement for large
scale projects undertaken by the Infrastructure
Fund.
Large infrastructure spending is mainly to be
financed by withdrawals from the Petroleum
Fund. The government is also considering other
financing options such as borrowing and publicprivate partnerships (PPPs).

Box 2. Inflation and the Poor
Inflation in Timor-Leste has remained in double
digits and above that of other Asian low income
countries from early 2011. Inflation picked up
following the rise in global commodity prices in 2010.
Imported and local food inflation has been the main
driver of inflation, but non-food inflation has also risen
to double digits, contributing 4 percentage points to
inflation. Timor-Leste is a net importer of foods, and
food comprises about 60 percent of its consumer price
index basket, placing it above other Asian low income
countries. A weak US dollar and strong demand from
rising government spending have also contributed to
the high inflation.
A few factors distinguish the current inflation
episode from the one in 2007–08. Staff estimates
indicate that the contribution of local inflation to
headline inflation is much bigger and persistent this
time and that local inflation is about 5 percentage
points higher than imported inflation. Local products
and services are estimated to comprise about

Previous studies indicate that the poor suffer more
from inflation than the rich do. Easterly and Fischer
(2000),1 for example, found that the poor are more likely
than the rich to mention inflation as a top concern and
that high inflation tends to lower the income share of the
bottom quintile and increase poverty. Agenor (1998) also
found poverty rates to be positively related to inflation in
cross-country data.2 A recent ADB study estimates that a
10 percent rise in food prices in Timor-Leste could increase
poverty incidence by 2¼ percentage points.3

39 percent of household consumption (47 percent of food
consumption and 27 percent of non-food consumption).
Government spending has more than tripled since 2007
and continues to rise rapidly, which has increased
inflationary pressure given the small non-oil economy. In
2008, the government introduced a rice subsidy program
to dampen the impact of rising global rice prices, but the
subsidy program will end soon. Rice is the main staple and
comprises about 15 percent of the CPI basket. Moreover,
wage pressures are reportedly rising recently but no
reliable data are available.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 3. Poverty and Food Security in Timor-Leste
A recent World Bank study indicates a sharp decline in
poverty to 41 percent in 2009 from 50 percent in
2007.1 The decline is due to high economic growth and
increased public spending, particularly on social
protection programs and labor-intensive infrastructure
works; moreover, poverty incidence spiked in 2007
because of the 2006 civil unrest and lower agricultural
production. The 2011 living standards survey outcomes
with the latest poverty estimates will be available in 2012.
The poverty line in Timor-Leste was $0.88 per day in
2007, which increased from $0.52 in 2001. The $0.88 per
day represents, in December 2007 prices, the typical cost
of attaining 2,100 calories per day ($0.54) and meeting
some basic non-food needs ($0.34). The extreme poverty
line was $0.71 per day, below which one-third of the
population lived in 2007.

Rural poverty (52 percent) is higher than urban
poverty (45 percent) according to the 2007
estimates, owing to low agricultural productivity
and limited access to roads. Poverty incidence also
varies widely among regions; the Central region’s
poverty rate (58 percent) is more than double that of
the Eastern region (27 percent).
Food security is one of the key elements in poverty
reduction in Timor-Leste. Subsistence farming is the
main source of livelihood for 75 percent of the
population. About one-fourth of the population lived in
hunger in 2010. 70 percent experienced food shortages
in 2007, and the agricultural production data indicate
that little progress has probably been made in recent
years. Food shortage usually occurs for at least 2-3
months before the maize and rice harvest. Although
food imports could address the shortage, poor roads
and transportation systems are the major constraints to
food supply to rural areas.
Improving food security and reducing poverty are
integral parts of the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) for Timor-Leste. The government aims to
develop the agriculture sector to reduce rural poverty,
achieve food security by 2020, and promote economic
growth in rural areas. Following India’s “green
revolution” model, it has focused on providing high
yielding seeds and fertilizers and improving irrigation.

VIII. Article IV Consultations
The 2010 Article IV consultation discussions
with the authorities were held during October
26–November 9, 2010; the consultation was
concluded on January 28, 2011. The Public
Information Notice may be found at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2011/p
n1131.htm
IX. Technical Assistance
Since late 1999, a significant amount of
technical assistance has been provided by the
Fund as part of the international community’s
efforts to reconstruct the Timor-Leste
economy. The Fund’s technical assistance has
focused on establishing key economic
institutions (especially fiscal and monetary
authorities) essential for macroeconomic
management, as well as on developing local
capacity to manage them. It also played a key
role in the adoption of a new currency
arrangement based on the U.S. dollar. Since
late 1999, Timor-Leste has been one of the
largest recipients of Fund technical assistance.
FAD: A series of multi-topic FAD missions took
place early on to establish and develop the
Central Fiscal Authority (CFA, February 2000),
which developed into the Ministry of Planning
and Finance. Assistance was provided to
develop budget preparation, establish tax
policy and administration, strengthen treasury
and expenditure management, and advise on

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

oil sector fiscal regimes. Long-term resident
advisors were assigned to the Ministry of
Planning and Finance and the Revenue Service
of Timor-Leste to cover a wide range of issues,
partly under a cost sharing arrangement with
the UN. Over August 2004–July 2005, an FAD
resident advisor assisted in the design and
establishment of the Petroleum Fund, which
started operations in August 2005. An FAD
resident advisor to the Treasurer of the
ministry finance started work in December
2006 to help strengthen expenditure
management, reporting and budget
execution—after a short break, a replacement
has continued this work since July 2008. In
2007, an FAD TA mission provided guidance
for future reform of the non-oil tax regime. In
April 2009 an FAD technical assistance mission
provided advice on implementation of the
fiscal regimes for petroleum. In addition to
PEFA and fiscal ROSC, in 2010, FAD sent a
follow-up mission on treasury management.
Also in 2010 and 2011, FAD TA missions
provided advice on the calculation of
estimated sustainable income from petroleum
and other selected petroleum fiscal issues. In
2011, an FAD TA mission provided advice on
non-oil tax policy and administration.
LEG: A number of LEG missions have been to
Timor-Leste to advise the authorities on key
fiscal and financial legislation. These included
tax legislation, the budget and financial
management law, and banking regulations
(relating to the monetary authority, the
banking system, and the payments system).
Jointly with MFD (now MCM), technical
assistance has been provided to assist in
drafting an Anti-Money Laundering and
Combating the Financing of Terrorism
(AML/CFT) Law. LEG also provided assistance,
in collaboration with FAD, for the drafting of
the Petroleum Fund Act and tax consolidation,

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

and in collaboration with MCM, for the
drafting of the Central Bank Law.
MCM: A large number of missions took place
early on to establish and develop the Central
Payments Office (CPO, January 2000), which
was transformed subsequently into the
Banking and Payments Authority (BPA)
(November 2001). Assistance was provided to
establish a payments system, prepare banking
legislation, and develop key functions of the
monetary authority, including banking
supervision, asset management, accounting,
and organization and management. Assistance
was also provided on the introduction of a
dollar-based currency system and to issue
domestic coins to supplement the use of U.S.
dollar coins. More recently, assistance has
been provided to (i) draft the insurance law
and develop a framework for insurance
supervision; (ii) strengthen banking
supervision; (iii) address a broad range of
issues related to AML/CFT; (iv) establish and
train the investment unit responsible for
managing petroleum fund assets (funded by
Norway, a resident adviser commenced in
March 2005 and, after a break due to contract
renegotiations, a replacement continued this
work from November 2008); (v) prepare for the
establishment of the central bank; (vi) design a
more effective organizational structure at the
BPA; and (vii) modernize payment systems and
accounting for the Petroleum Fund. In
addition, up until 2006 long-term resident
advisors, including on banking supervision,
payments, and accounting, were assigned to
the BPA under a cost-sharing arrangement
with the UN. A long-term resident advisor
assisted the BPA General Manager from
February 2005 until February 2008, with that
support subsequently provided on a
peripatetic basis and funded by a Japanese
grant.

STA: A multi-sector statistical mission took
place in November 2000 to assess the
availability and quality of official
macroeconomic data, and help establish the
Statistic Division of the Ministry of Planning
and Finance. Assistance was provided by long
term statistical advisors during November
2001-October 2005. Since 2007, a peripatetic
statistical advisor has provided assistance for
improving data compilation and developing
local capacity to prepare balance of payments
statistics—responsibility for this was
transferred to the BPA in 2007. Provisional
annual balance of payments statements for
2006 and 2007 were published in December
2008. In early 2008 a monetary and financial
statistics (MFS) mission helped introduce the
standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting
monetary data to the IMF and an integrated
monetary database. Subsequently, Timor-Leste
published a country page in IFS for the first

time. A March 2009 follow-up MFS mission
assisted in expanding the institutional
coverage of depository corporations to include
microfinance institutions and in revising the
call report form that will be used to collect
balance sheet data. In 2010, STA sent a followup mission on balance of payments statistics
and a mission providing assistance on
updating the CPI basket. In 2011, STA missions
provided advice on external sector statistics
and national accounts statistics.
X. Resident Representative
The resident representative office in Dili closed
at end-June 2009, which was established in
August 2000.

ANNEX II. TIMOR-LESTE: WORLD BANK-IMF
COLLABORATION
1.
The Bank and Fund country teams for
Timor-Leste, led by Mr. L. Constantino (World
Bank country manager) and Mr. B. Jang (Fund
mission chief), have closely cooperated on
macroeconomic issues and macro-critical
structural reforms. The Bank team joined the
2011 Article IV consultation mission.
2.
The two teams have worked closely on
the following:
 Macroeconomic developments and economic
updates: There has been close dialogue
throughout the year on macro policies and
economic developments. There is regular
sharing of information, including Fund
comments on the Bank’s semi-annual
economic updates.
 Public finance management: Bank staff have
been following up on the PEFA and ROSC
recommendations, including helping the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) put together a
Strategic Plan. There is regular coordination
between Bank staff on the ground and the
IMF’s Treasury Adviser at the MOF.
 External debt: The teams have engaged very
closely on discussions around government
plans to borrow. A joint DSA has been
conducted in November/December 2011,
which is an important building block for the
Bank’s creditworthiness assessment.
3.
The teams agreed that Timor-Leste’s
main macroeconomic challenge is to manage the
country’s petroleum wealth effectively and
sustainably to develop a stronger non-oil
economy and reduce poverty. To meet this
challenge Timor-Leste needs to prioritize public
expenditure; to strengthen public financial
management; and to accelerate reforms to
promote productivity and competitiveness. The

effectiveness of scaling up public investment will
depend critically on progress in these areas. The
government launched the Strategic Development
Plan (SDP) 2011–30 in July 2011 to step up
development.

4.
Based on this shared assessment the
following structural reform areas were identified
as macro-critical:
 Medium-term development plan (MTDP): The
SDP envisages a rapid scaling up of public
investment. The MTDP should help prioritize
public expenditure and promote sustainable
growth and fiscal sustainability.
 Public financial management reform: The
recent fiscal ROSC and PEFA missions and the
Bank’s review of the Planning and Financial
Management Capacity Building Program found
solid progress but also highlighted pressing
issues around medium-term budgeting,
expenditure (in particular public investment)
management and procurement, and auditing.
These areas are critical for the quality of
expenditure.
 Promoting productivity and competitiveness:
Timor-Leste faces a number of challenges to
promoting productivity, competitiveness and
diversification in the non-oil economy. Three
key priorities include addressing skills deficit;
improving access to land; and strengthening
the business environment, in particular access
to finance and contract enforcement.
5.
The teams agreed to continue the close
cooperation going forward. Table below details
the specific activities planned by the two country
teams over the December 2011/2012 period. In
summary, the Fund will continue to lead on
macro issues, and the Bank will continue to lead
PFM and macro critical structural reform issues.

ANNEX III. TIMOR-LESTE: RELATIONS WITH THE
ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of December 2011)
1.
Timor-Leste joined the Asian
Development Bank (AsDB) on July 24, 2002.
The AsDB has been actively involved in the
reconstruction and development of the
economy since late 1999. To date, there has
been no lending to the country.
2.
AsDB assistance to Timor-Leste over
1999–2005 had concentrated on emergency
infrastructure works. The ADB country strategy
for 2006–2010 continued the focus on
infrastructure, while completing a transition to
rehabilitation works. Over the 2011–15 period
AsDB will help the government begin to
upgrade infrastructure.
3.
The Timor-Leste country partnership
strategy (CPS) 2011–15 aligns AsDB support
with Timor-Leste’s Strategic Development Plan
2011–2030. It outlines a five-year strategic
partnership with the government in support of
infrastructure, financial services, and the skills
training to meet the needs of a growing
economy. It will support the private sector to
help Timor-Leste make the transition from a
public sector-led economy.
4.
AsDB resources for infrastructure over
the 2011–2015 period are expected to be
concentrated in road and urban water supply
and sanitation. Support will be private sectororiented, with AsDB playing an “honest broker”
role in facilitating private sector engagement
in infrastructure.
5.
Timor-Leste first accessed the Asian
Development Fund (ADF) in 2005. ADF
supported activities include an ongoing road

rehabilitation project ($46 million grant), a Dili
water supply project ($6 million grant), a
district capital water supply project
($11 million grant), and a technical and
vocational education and training project
($11.5 million grant). Timor-Leste is the
recipient of one of AsDB’s largest ever
technical assistance (TA) grant, the
Infrastructure Project Management TA. This
$15 million six-year package, co-financed with
AusAID, helps plan, prepare, and execute the
Government’s capital development program.
Other AsDB activities include support for
regional economic integration, the finance
sector, small-scale infrastructure, and the
strengthening of statistics and macroeconomic
management, the civil service, and
environmental management.
6.
To date AsDB has provided a total of
11 grants (5 from the ADF and 6 from the Trust
Fund for East Timor) for total amount of
$137.8 million, and TA projects for a total of
$32.1 million. Four ADF grants ($75.0 million)
and 8 TA projects ($19.0 million) are active.
7.
Timor-Leste became eligible to borrow
from the ADF in 2011. The $27.7 million in ADF
resources available for 2011–12 are a mix of
grants and loans: $18.5 million as grants, and
$9.2 million as concessional loans. From 2013–
14, all ADF resources will be available on a loan
basis. In October 2011, the ADB Board
approved the reclassification of Timor-Leste as
a ‘B’ member country. This provides access to
ADB’s Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR), while
retaining access to ADF.

I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision to the Fund has
shortcomings that significantly hamper
surveillance. Weaknesses remain in the
macroeconomic data, especially the national
accounts and trade statistics.
National Accounts: Since April 2009, the
authorities have been employing a World Bank
funded advisor to develop annual estimates of
GDP. The national accounts advisor, with
assistance of Fund technical assistance, is
finalizing compilation of the national accounts
statistics for 2004–10 for the first time. The
responsibility of compiling the national
accounts data will be handed over to the
National Statistical Directorate from the MOF’s
Macroeconomic Directorate in early 2012. To
improve national accounts data further,
appropriate staff and substantial efforts in data
collection and compilation are needed.
Price statistics: A technical assistance mission
during November 8–19, 2010 assisted in
rebasing the CPI using data derived from the
Timor-Leste Living Standards Survey that was
conducted in 2006–7. The CPI basket weights,
however, have not been updated yet.
Shortcomings in data collection also need to
be addressed and products and outlets
updated.
Labor market statistics: Annual data on
public sector employment and wages are
available in official budget documentation. No
official data are compiled regularly on private
sector employment and wages, except for
partial data from various household surveys

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

conducted by UNDP, ILO, ADB, and the World
Bank. In 2010, the Macroeconomic Unit in the
Ministry of Finance has started to conduct
wage surveys.
Government finance statistics: The
compilation of revenue and expenditure
follows the classification of the Manual on
Government Finance Statistics (GFSM 1986)
(including expenditure based on both
functional and economic classification). These
data are bridged to the GFSM 2001
classifications for the compilation of Table 2 of
the Staff Report. Only partial data are available
on fiscal and quasi-fiscal activities undertaken
by bilateral donors outside the central
government budget. A technical assistance
mission is tentatively scheduled for early 2012.
Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics are
compiled by the Central Bank of Timor-Leste
(CBTL), generally following the methodology of
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
However, data are incomplete because of the
absence of official data on public currency
holdings—which are difficult to compile under
the current currency regime—and of banks’
positions with public nonfinancial
corporations.
Detailed monthly monetary data are available
from July 2002 onward, following the
introduction of the standardized report forms
(SRFs). A mission in March 2010 assisted the
authorities in finalizing the design of the call
report form (CRF) and derived the SRF for the
other depository corporations (ODCs) based

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE

on this revised CRF. A follow-up mission is
scheduled for early 2012 to assist the
authorities in introducing the SRFs for the
central bank based on the new chart of
accounts of the CBTL and for the ODCs based
on the revised CRF and to include the credit
unions in the institutional coverage of the
ODCs.
Balance of payments: A major data gap in the
monthly data on merchandise exports and
imports is the significant underestimation of
imports of goods. Also not included are oil and
gas exports; an estimate of the large,
unrecorded border trade; and some goods
exempt from customs duties. Further, customs
data may underestimate imports because of
undervaluation of declared goods. Monthly
merchandise trade data are now published
regularly but there are significant gaps in the
series for 2006 and 2007. In the Fund staff
estimates, data on oil/gas revenue are
currently recorded as current income based on
fiscal data.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

While methodology for the production of basic
annual estimates of the balance of payments
statistics are in place, further development
work is needed to address limitations of
existing data sources, in particular,
merchandise trade statistics and travel exports.
The coverage of the survey of foreign direct
investment enterprises needs to be expanded,
and the exploration and extraction activities in
the Joint Petroleum Development Area and in
the exclusive territory, require ongoing
monitoring. As the economy grows, it will be
important to monitor new activities such as
new direct investment. Currently, there is
limited information on remittances from
Timorese working abroad and improvement in
the estimation/compilation procedures of such
remittances should be pursued.
Some data on stocks of financial assets and
liabilities have been collected, and the annual
international investment position statements
should be finalized. Development of quarterly
balance of payments statistics should also be
pursued.

With technical assistance provided by the
IMF’s Statistics Department, annual balance of
payments data are now available for 2006–10.

CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

January 13, 2012

Approved By

Ray Brooks and Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)

Prepared By

International Monetary Fund
International Development Association

Timor-Leste remains at a low risk of debt distress.2 This debt sustainability analysis (DSA)
updates the joint IMF/IDA DSA from December 3, 2010, to integrate the authorities’ new
fiscal plans, including new borrowing plans in the proposed 2012 Budget and the
Strategic Development Plan. The new fiscal plans aim to frontload capital spending to
improve poor infrastructure, which is one of the key constraints to developing the non-oil
sector. Under the baseline scenario, all the debt burden indicators remain below their
policy-dependent indicative thresholds. However, debt vulnerability may increase as
suggested by the higher level of debt service in the longer term associated with the
repayment of non-concessional borrowing as evidenced by stress tests. This calls for a
cautious approach to such borrowing and emphasizes the importance of prudent debt
management.

1

This DSA has been prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank staffs, using the debt sustainability framework for
low-income countries approved by the Boards of both institutions.
2

The DSA presented in this document is based on the standard low-income countries (LIC) DSA framework.
See “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Proposal for an Operational Framework and Policy
implications” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/020304.htm) and “Debt Sustainability in LowIncome Countries: Further Considerations on an Operational Framework, Policy Implications”

According to the Asian Development Bank, there are
two types of loans available for Timor-Leste: the Asia
Development Fund (ADF) loans, which are highly
concessional, and the Ordinary Capital Resources
(OCR) loans, which are non-concessional. The ADF
loans are similar to the IDA loans, and the OCR loans
are similar to the IBRD loans. Loans with grant
elements less than 35 percent are considered nonconcessional.

quality of policies and institutions; weak performers

Donor assistance to Timor-Leste is mainly composed
of grants from multinational and bilateral donors such
as the United Nations, the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank, Australia, and Japan. Historical
experience indicates that their commitments are not
subject to unexpected, big changes. Moreover, if
donor assistance decreases, imports of goods and
services for the related projects will decline
accordingly. It is also highly unlikely that official
transfers will turn negative suddenly, which means
Timor-Leste as a poor country begins to provide large
grants abroad.
9

With declines in official transfers, imports are
assumed to decline by 70 percent, which are lower
than about 80 percent import components of donor
assistance in Timor-Leste.

2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes changes in the PF balances; and valuation adjustments.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.

Sources: Timor-Leste authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 1, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with the
Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste
On January 31, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste and considered, and
endorsed, the staff appraisal without a meeting. 1
Background
After emerging from a long struggle for independence and internal conflicts between 1999 and
2006, Timor-Leste has made substantial progress toward restoring stability and rebuilding the
country. Rising government spending and a rebound in agriculture supported strong non-oil
gross domestic product (GDP) growth since 2007, averaging 12 percent. Despite unseasonal
rain that damaged agricultural produce, growth is estimated to have remained strong at about
10 percent in 2011 on the back of high government spending. Inflation in Dili, however, rose to
17½ percent (year-on-year) in December 2011, due to high food prices, a weak U.S. dollar, and
strong demand from rising government spending, and is becoming broad-based.
The government launched its Strategic Development Plan to transform Timor-Leste into an
upper-middle-income country by 2030. To achieve this goal, the government plans to scale up
public investment to improve poor infrastructure. Capital expenditure increased rapidly in 2011
so total government spending is estimated to have risen to $1.2 billion, from $0.8 billion in 2010.
Owing to rising petroleum revenue, however, the overall fiscal balance is expected to have
continued to record a large surplus of 50 percent of GDP in 2011, and the Petroleum Fund to
have risen to about $9 billion. Most of the Petroleum Fund is invested in US government bonds.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

2
Credit to the private sector has recently started rising after being stagnant for a few years.
However, it remains low at only 13 percent of non-oil GDP, reflecting the lack of collateral and
weak contract enforcement. These weaknesses together with high nonperforming loans have
contributed to high lending rates in Timor-Leste. Nonperforming loans are high at almost
40 percent of total loans but are fully covered by provisions. Three foreign bank branches
dominate the financial sector. The Banking and Payments Authority was recently transformed to
a central bank, with no change in its function. The U.S. dollar is the legal tender.
The current account surplus is estimated to have remained large at over 50 percent of GDP in
2011 due to high oil revenue. Non-oil exports, excluding coffee, are minimal and the country
depends highly on imports given almost no domestic production base except subsistence
farming and coffee. Foreign assets rose to an all-time high at 170 months of imports. The real
effective exchange rate appreciated by 6 percent in 2011.
The outlook for growth and poverty reduction is promising as Timor-Leste stands to benefit
enormously from its petroleum wealth in coming years. Using this wealth, the government has
resolved to step up development. With rising government spending, non-oil GDP growth is
projected to remain strong at about 10 percent in 2012 and over the medium term and the
current account surplus is projected to decline. Key risks to the outlook are high inflation, a fall
in oil prices, and slow progress in building public financial management capacity.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2011 Article IV consultation with Timor-Leste, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal as follows:
Rising government spending has supported strong economic growth, but inflation has jumped to
double digits. Using its petroleum wealth, the government has resolved to step up development
by scaling up investment in infrastructure. Real non-oil GDP growth is projected to remain
strong at about 10 percent in 2012 and over the medium term. Key risks to the outlook are oil
price volatility and the possibility that inflation continues to rise on the back of large increases in
government spending.
Given development needs, investment in infrastructure is welcome, but the planned increase of
spending over the next few years needs to be slowed to better align with the absorptive capacity
of the economy and administrative constraints. Continued large increases in government
spending would raise inflationary pressure further, and high inflation will impose significant costs
on the poor. In the absence of monetary policy, sound fiscal policy is key to containing high
inflation and sustaining strong economic growth. The government’s intention to consider
adjusting the pace of 2012 budget execution if inflation remains high is welcome. Staff stressed
the importance of continued progress in improving the capacity to implement capital projects.
The authorities’ plan to reduce the non-oil fiscal deficit to a sustainable level over the next
10 years is appropriate. This will provide an important anchor for fiscal policy. To achieve this

3
goal, the government may need to take substantial measures, including containing spending
growth and increasing domestic revenue. In addition, the medium-term budget framework
needs to be strengthened by including the full costs of planned major projects and recurrent
costs once they are available. The authorities’ intention to review the recent Fiscal Affairs
Department mission’s recommendations to raise non-oil revenue, including the introduction of a
value added tax over the medium term, is welcome. Repealing the very generous tax holidays
under a new private investment law is recommended.
The government has made solid progress in improving public financial management (PFM). A
well-managed Petroleum Fund is in place. Further progress has been made in addressing the
weaknesses in PFM by establishing new institutions to strengthen public investment
management. The lack of skilled personnel is the key constraint to PFM so the government’s
focus on training Timorese should help build capacity.
Developing the financial sector and strengthening the credit culture are critical for sustained
growth in the private sector. The Central Bank’s continued efforts to strengthen financial sector
supervision and regulations are welcome. Banks tightened their lending standards and
improved credit assessments. Speeding up the passage of key legislations such as the land law
would help financial sector development.
The use of the U.S. dollar is appropriate given the limited capacity for independent monetary
and exchange rate policies. Non-oil exports, excluding coffee, are minimal and the country
depends highly on imports. Accelerating structural reforms is needed to improve
competitiveness. Prudent fiscal policy will be key to maintaining external stability over the long
term.
Data quality and availability need to be improved. More staff and training are needed to improve
the data necessary for policy analysis and formulation.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2011 Article IV Consultation with the Democratic Republic of TimorLeste is also available.
