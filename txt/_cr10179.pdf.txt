REPUBLIC OF CROATIA
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with the Republic of Croatia
Approved by Adam Bennett and Michele Shannon
June 3, 2010

Discussions. Zagreb, April 28 to May 10, 2010. The mission met with Prime Minister
Kosor; Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Šuker; Croatian National Bank (CNB)
Governor Rohatinski; other senior officials; and representatives of social partnerships, think
tanks, and private sector.
Team: Ms. Murgašová (head), Mr. Atoyan and Ms. Rahman (all EUR), and
Mr. Prokopenko (MCM). Mr. Lambregts (OED) also joined the discussions.
Previous IMF advice: At the time of the 2009 Article IV Consultation (concluded on
June 2, 2009), Executive Directors stressed the importance of rationalizing public spending
and accelerating structural reforms to raise productivity growth. In this regard, they
encouraged the authorities to step up efforts to modernize the civil service, improve cost
recovery for social services, reduce subsidies and better target social spending. The
authorities’ recently-adopted Economic Recovery Program (discussed in this report)
addresses reforms in many of these areas.
Consultation focus: Discussions focused on policies to increase room for policy maneuver,
enhance Croatia’s competitiveness to attain sustainable growth, and reduce external
vulnerabilities.
Policy advice. The staff advocates: (i) fiscal consolidation through expenditure reforms in
public administration, social spending, and privatization; (ii) advancing structural reforms
to enhance labor force participation and improve business environment; (iii) income and
wage policies to improve competitiveness given the authorities’ policy to maintain a
broadly stable exchange rate; (iv) careful monitoring of banks’ liquidity and credit
portfolios.
Exchange rate. De jure managed float with no predetermined path; de facto stabilized
under the Fund’s classification. Croatia has accepted the obligations under Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions.

I. IMPACT OF THE CRISIS
1.
The global economic and financial crisis has significantly affected the Croatian
economy (Figure 1). Reduced private capital inflows and external demand aggravated
Croatia’s existing imbalances. With a large current account deficit, a high level of external
debt, and significant balance sheet exposures to interest- and exchange rate-induced risks,
market confidence in Croatia deteriorated sharply in early 2009. Financial asset prices
collapsed, sovereign spreads shot up, and the Zagreb stock market plunged.
2.
The authorities moved swiftly to support macroeconomic and financial stability.
The Croatian National Bank (CNB) appropriately addressed liquidity shortages in the
banking sector through relaxation of regulatory requirements, repo auctions, and simplified
rules for banks to access CNB’s emergency liquidity assistance. Intermittent foreign
exchange interventions alleviated downward pressures on the kuna. To offset plunging
revenues and contain the 2009 budget deficit to financeable levels, the authorities adopted
three supplementary budgets with a number of short-term measures. The measures included
expenditure cuts, a

Despite this, the
general government overall fiscal deficit widened to just under 4 percent of GDP (including
the payment for a called guarantee of a public shipyard) and the deficit of the broader public
sector grew to almost 5 percent of GDP (text table). Public debt also rose sharply to
50 percent of GDP (including guaranteed debt).
3.
The timely policy response has helped improve financial market sentiment. The
kuna has fully retracted its losses, official reserves have been replenished, and bond spreads
have declined considerably. Croatia successfully tapped international capital markets twice
in 2009. Liquidity pressures have abated as domestic deposits have been stable, while credit
lines to domestic subsidiaries from foreign parent institutions have been maintained. Banks
have weathered the crisis relatively well and have been able to maintain adequate
capitalization, although credit quality has worsened significantly and profitability has
declined, largely reflecting an increase in the provisioning for nonperforming loans. Private
sector credit growth fell sharply, as the uncertain macroeconomic environment lowered
demand for new loans and banks tightened underwriting standards.

4
4.
The economic downturn has, nevertheless, been severe (Table 1, Figure 2). With
tight credit conditions and subdued external demand, real GDP has fallen by 5.8 percent
in 2009, led by large drops in investment and private consumption, and unemployment rose
sharply to 17 percent. Exports plunged on the back of weak external demand, though the
decline was more than offset by a reduction in imports. The current account deficit thus
nearly halved to 5 percent of GDP. Headline inflation has declined from its peak of 6 percent
in mid-2008 to 0.6 percent in April 2010, consistent with a significant negative output gap
(about 2 percent of GDP by staff estimates).

II. DIAGNOSIS
A. Pre-crisis Growth Relied on Domestic Demand as Competitiveness Declined
5.
The pre-crisis domestic-demand driven growth was built on weak fundamentals
(Figure 3).1 Abundant foreign capital inflows fueled a credit boom and raised vulnerabilities
to historically high levels. Debt dominated the composition of inflows, while much of the
foreign direct investment (FDI) went into the financial and wholesale/retail trade sectors.
Notwithstanding the CNB’s efforts to lean against large capital inflows through prudential
and regulatory measures, the foreign-owned banking system revved up credit growth,
including through cross-border borrowing. Most of this borrowing financed activities in the
non-tradable sector, exacerbating its already pronounced bias in the structure of Croatia’s
economy. As a result, during 2001–08, private consumption and investment (mostly in the
construction sector) became the main drivers of economic growth, while net exports made a
negative contribution.
6.
Weak export performance points to competiveness problems (Figure 4). Trade
deficits remained high even by regional standards, penetration into world export markets was

Paper No. 10/92.

5
meager, and Croatia’s economy remained relatively closed.2 Tourism receipts, which account
for half of exports of goods and services, failed to benefit from large-scale FDI inflows
during the boom years. A prolonged period of nominal exchange rate stability and structural
rigidities in the economy likely played a role.

recent years (Figure 4). Staff’s quantitative estimates show that the real effective exchange
rate could be slightly overvalued

reflects non-competitive wage setting
and strong trade union presence in the public sector, which employs a quarter of the labor
force, excluding public enterprises.
8.
Croatia’s economy is also saddled with more pervasive rigidities and higher
government involvement than many of its transition peers (Figure 5). These dampen
labor market participation, hamper the emergence of a dynamic private sector, and add to
fiscal costs.

2



Incomplete privatization. Almost two decades after the beginning of transition,
Croatia lags behind its European peers in large-scale privatization, enterprise
restructuring and competition policy. Continued provision of state subsidies has
become a fiscal burden and kept production in the hands of a few large firms.



Rigid labor market and low participation. Strict labor regulations severely constrain
labor market flexibility, resulting in high employment in the gray economy,
proliferation of temporary work contracts, and reduced employers’ incentives to
expand employment during the boom years. Retirees account for about a quarter of
Croatian population reflecting generous pension and social benefits conditions, which
poses a burden on the employed and contributes to labor shortages. An aging
population is likely to further aggravate these pressures.

In 2000-09, Croatia’s exports of goods and services averaged at around 45 percent of GDP, well below the 5565 percent of GDP range for most other countries in Central and Eastern Europe.

6


Restrictive and costly business environment. Croatia’s business regulations are
cumbersome. For example, it takes twice as long to register a business in Croatia
compared to the regional average. Moreover, para-fiscal fees at the local government
level (over 200 categories) add to the costs and uncertainty of doing business. In
general, the state exercises excessive control in strategic decisions in public
enterprises.
B. Financial and Macroeconomic Policies Fell Short in Some Areas

9.
The CNB pursued proactive policies, which helped ensure financial sector
stability. Since 2003, the CNB used a variety of conventional (higher reserve requirement
and higher risk weights for unhedged foreign currency loans) and unconventional measures
(credit ceilings, marginal reserve requirements on foreign borrowing, and foreign currency
liquidity requirements) to limit the increase in vulnerabilities associated with the rapid
growth of bank credit. These measures built up liquidity and capital buffers which contained
pressures as the crisis unfolded. This, together with the transfer of credit risk to the books of
their foreign parents, has enabled the banks to withstand the deterioration in credit quality
that has occurred since early 2009.
10.
A stable nominal exchange rate provided an anchor for inflation expectations
and financial stability, but also contributed to the accumulation of vulnerabilities.

the corporates. Financial euroization—
traditionally high in Croatia—increased during the crisis: at end-December 2009, about
70 percent of the total bank credit and over 65 percent of bank deposits were denominated in
or indexed to foreign currency.
11.
Croatia’s fiscal policy did not take sufficient advantage of the boom years to
create adequate space for demand management (Table 2).3 While the cyclically-adjusted
fiscal balance was improved by an impressive 3 percentage points of GDP during 2004–06, it

7
was then relaxed during 2007–08. Challenging reforms in the public sector were left
untackled, creating rigidities in public expenditure. As a result, at the onset of the crisis,
Croatia found itself with constrained policy space, unable to support growth with a fiscal
stimulus.

III. OUTLOOK
12.
Economic recovery is expected to be gradual, with positive growth resuming in
the second half of 2010 (Table 1). The outcome for the first quarter of this year remains
mixed: while the fall in industrial production has stopped and retail services show signs of

recovery in the second half of the
year—mainly driven by net exports and inventories’ restocking—is thus likely to be fragile.
Overall, the staff expects zero economic growth and an average inflation of about 2 percent
in 2010 (text table).
13.
External financing needs will remain substantial but, absent contagion, private
capital inflows should be sufficient (Table 3). The current account deficit is projected to
remain broadly stable at around 5½ percent of GDP on the back of a tepid economic
recovery. Nevertheless, the sizable currect account deficit and the large stock of maturing
external debt, mostly private, imply a significant external financing need (40 percent of
GDP) in 2010 (Table 4). The weak economic outlook will continue to hold back FDI inflows.
However, parent banks appear to be committed to maintain exposure to local subsidiaries and
corporate clients (as they did during the crisis), and are expected to continue facilitating
sufficient rollover of maturing private sector debt.

8
14.
Risks to the near-term outlook are tilted to the downside. Croatia remains
vulnerable to contagion risks from adverse market sentiment in the region. This could be
manifested in tightening financial constraints—a rise in borrowing costs, or a reduction in
cross-border flows. In addition, weak fiscal fundamentals in Croatia and large financing
needs could telescope into short-term financing strains. However, the absence of Greek banks
in Croatia and the limited real sector linkages with Greece should minimize the risks of direct
spillovers. Moreover, the diversity of parent bank countries (Austria, Italy, France, Germany,
and Hungary) should reduce the vulnerability of Croatian banking system to sudden funding
pressures from abroad, unless these encompass the euro area as a whole.
15.
Over the medium-term, growth is unlikely to recover to its pre-crisis trend and
vulnerabilities will remain high (Figure 7, Table 5). The authorities and the staff agreed
that heightened global risk aversion makes it unlikely that capital inflows will return to precrisis levels, thus curbing future credit and domestic demand growth. A highly-leveraged
household sector will further weigh down credit growth, while poor competitiveness will not
allow exports to take full advantage of a euro area recovery, and a lack of fiscal space will
limit the scope for fiscal stimulus. The output gap may close as early as 2012, but mediumterm potential growth is projected at 3 percent, falling significantly short of its pre-crisis
level (Figure 7). Similarly, vulnerabilities will remain large with an external debt-to-GDP
ratio hovering around 100 percent, and the reserve coverage of short-term debt staying well
below 100 percent (Table 3).
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
16.
The policy discussions centered on the authorities’ medium-term strategy of
Croatia’s integration with the European Union (EU). The authorities view EU accession
as a near-term priority that would bolster market confidence and guide the reform agenda,
and euro adoption as a subsequent objective that would anchor their exchange rate policy.
Discussions focused on the set of policies needed to serve this goal, including reforms
envisaged in the recently-adopted Economic Recovery Program (ERP) that are intended to
enable Croatia reap the maximum benefit of accession, and taking into account the
authorities’ strong commitment to continuity in the exchange rate regime.
A. Strengthening Fiscal Discipline
17.
The sizable fiscal consolidation envisaged in the original 2010 budget
appropriately addresses financing constraints and crowding out concerns, but is
unlikely to materialize without additional expenditure cuts (Table 2). The 2010 budget
incorporates the full-year impact of tax measures adopted last year and a nominal
expenditure freeze. However, with a worsened growth outlook and the authorities’ plan for
an early withdrawal of the solidarity tax and a reduction in personal income tax rates from
mid-2010, the staff projects the fiscal deficit to reach 3.6 percent of GDP (broadly unchanged
from 2008 on a cyclically-adjusted basis) versus 2.7 percent of GDP estimated in the budget.

9
The staff projects the broader public sector deficit to remain at 5 percent of GDP and public
sector debt, inclusive of guaranteed stock, to rise further to 54 percent of GDP. The
authorities indicated their intention to propose a supplementary budget to contain the deficit.
18.
The authorities and the staff agreed that the financing gap (6 percent of GDP) is
sizable but likely manageable given recent strong demand for government securities by
domestic banks. Nevertheless, with over 60 percent of the debt stock denominated in foreign
currency and one third in short-term maturities, financing is subject to exchange rate and
rollover risks. Additional fiscal risks relate to the likely execution of outstanding government
guarantees on shipyards that could reach up to an additional 2 percent of GDP in 2010, as
well as possible revenue underperformance in the event of a longer-than-expected recession.
19.
In the medium term, staff estimates suggest that unchanged policies would keep
the general government fiscal deficit above the Maastricht criterion of 3 percent of
GDP, with the public debt stock on a rising trend (Table 2, Figure 8). The lifting of the
temporary tax measures in 2010 and reductions in personal income tax rates will reduce the

approaching EU accession. Meanwhile, expenditure rationalization from structural measures
already in place will result in modest savings, likely to be offset by increasing interest
payments. 4 As a result, the general government deficit is expected to stay above 3½ percent
of GDP (text table). The broader public sector deficit would remain around 5 percent of
GDP, though with considerable upward risks depending on the performance of the off-budget
entities. To the extent EU accession would raise expenditure through co- financing needs, the
fiscal deficit could further worsen, absent compensating measures. The total stock of public
debt, including guarantees, will likely rise above 60 percent of GDP, raising sustainability
concerns.

Structural reforms undertaken in 2009 consist of the passage of a new compulsory health insurance act,
reduction of the maximum level of unemployment benefits, introduction of personal tax identification numbers,
and reduction in privileged pensions of government officials, members of the parliament, and judiciary. These
measures are assumed to reduce social benefits expenditure by half a percent of GDP in the medium-term.

10

A more appropriate medium-term fiscal target would be a cyclically-balanced
budget that would create adequate space for countercyclical maneuvers in the future
and also put public debt on a downward path (Figure 8). For a small open economy with

enough space to absorb revenue losses resulting from an output gap of up to 3½ percent
without exceeding the Maastricht deficit limit. Achieving such a balance by 2014 would
require an adjustment of less than 1 percent of GDP per year, a goal the authorities had
achieved previously during 2003–06. Given Croatia’s high tax rates, and numerous
inefficiencies in public expenditure, this consolidation should be achieved via expenditure
cuts in priority areas identified by past FAD technical assistance missions, namely public
administration, health, pension, and subsidies, and better targeting of social assistance
expenditure (text table).
21.
The authorities’ recently-adopted ERP aims for fiscal reforms (Annex 2). It
targets fiscal consolidation as well as many of these expenditure reforms. The staff urges the
authorities to frontload measures that would curtail expenditure: reducing the size of the
public administration, completing reforms in pension, health and social assistance
expenditures, and stepping up privatization. Only after implementing these reforms would
there be room for tax reductions which should further stimulate long-term growth. The staff,
therefore, advises the authorities to reconsider their current sequencing of reforms, where tax
cuts precede difficult expenditure reforms. The staff welcomes the decision to adopt a Fiscal
Responsibility Law and encourages the authorities to set the medium-term target ambitiously
at a cyclically-adjusted zero balance.
B. Maintaining Financial Sector Stability
22.
Ensuring a smooth resolution of the asset deterioration is a key priority. The
ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans (NPL ratio) has been steadily increasing, and
reached 7.8 percent at end-2009 (Table 7). The profitability of banks has declined, largely
reflecting increased provisioning. However, the aggregate capital adequacy ratio (CAR) has
remained stable at around 16.0 percent throughout 2009, well above the minimum regulatory
CAR, partly reflecting a growing share of government securities in bank assets. Asset quality
is expected to deteriorate further in light of weak growth prospects (even in the baseline
scenario). Nevertheless, results of recent stress tests conducted by the CNB suggest that most
banks would be able to withstand a significant rise in NPLs. The CNB’s decision to increase

11
the minimum CAR from 10 percent to 12 percent from April 1, 2010, to ensure a broadly
unchanged level of capital buffers in connection with the adoption of the Basel II framework,
was appropriate.5
23.
Liquidity indicators have marginally improved in late 2009, but vulnerability of
banks to liquidity risk remains. This risk may arise from funding pressures from abroad,
particularly as Croatian banks have substantial external liabilities; as well as the significant
domestic refinancing needs of the government. Close monitoring of the situation therefore
remains appropriate. Regarding the deposit insurance fund, the recent recapitalization of
public banks using the resources of this fund is a matter for concern: ailing banks should be
recapitalized by the owners of these banks, not by the deposit insurance fund, whose
resources should be invested in liquid assets. The authorities view this as a temporary
solution.
24.
While the authorities’ concerns about a lack of credit recovery are justified, the
recently introduced measures to stimulate bank lending to the economy require caution.
The three schemes involve (i) the conditional reduction of reserve requirements for
increasing the supply of loans to finance working capital and improve liquidity of corporates,
(ii) the provision of government guarantees on long-term investment loans, and (iii) the
conversion of debt to the government, owed by companies in financial difficulty, into
government equity (Annex 3). The combined size of the schemes remains modest (less than
3 percent of GDP, if fully implemented) and safeguards against weakening of credit
underwriting standards are in place. Nevertheless, the staff calls for close supervision of the
quality of the issued loans and risk management practices of banks involved in these
schemes. The fiscal risks from a rising stock of government contingent liabilities also require
special attention. Furthermore, the proposed scheme to exchange debt of troubled companies
to the government into equity goes against the spirit of intended privatization efforts and
should only be used for companies with viable restructuring plans.
25.
Despite low inflation pressures and a sizable output gap, the authorities and staff
agreed that the monetary stance should not be eased further in the short run. This is
because excess reserves of the banking system remain sizable, and the credit support schemes
have been slow to take off. In addition, market confidence remains brittle and the financing
outlook is susceptible to risks.
26.
The existing exposures of the financial sector highlight the need for an effective
financial sector policy framework. The overall financial sector regulatory and supervisory
framework is effective, and the few weaknesses identified by the 2007 Financial Sector
5

According to the CNB’s calculations, the adoption of the Basel II framework since April 1, 2010, increased
the aggregate capital adequacy ratio of the banking system by around 2 percentage points, reflecting the
decrease in risk weights on foreign currency loans.

12
Assessment Program have been subsequently addressed. However, there is room to
strengthen inter-agency coordination on crisis preparedness and management: although a
memorandum of understanding between the Ministry of Finance, the CNB, and the HANFA
(the supervisor of nonbank financial institutions) was signed in November 2009, no formal
meeting of the signatories of this memorandum has yet taken place.
C. Enhancing Competitiveness
27.
The authorities are strongly committed to continue a broadly stable exchange
rate. While recognizing the difficult trade-offs they face in deciding on the appropriate
exchange rate policy, they emphasized that adjustments in the exchange rate would be costly
given the economy’s large net foreign currency exposure. In staff’s view, with negative net
positions of corporate and public sectors at 64 and 23 percent of GDP respectively, the
balance sheet deterioration that would result from even a moderate nominal depreciation of
the kuna would be significant, particularly if limits of existing debt restructuring mechanisms
and the potential for negative feedback loops (including through declining growth with
adverse implications for public sector finances, banking sector balance sheets, and external
debt ratios) are recognized.6 Furthermore, while a more flexible regime would improve
competitiveness of export-oriented sectors, these gains could be muted by still constrained
growth in trading partners and the relatively inward-oriented structure of Croatia’s economy.
The authorities also consider that it would be difficult to conduct a gradual depreciation in an
orderly way, given the high market sensitivity to even small changes in the exchange rate.
28.
Maintaining a stable exchange rate will require significant internal adjustment
to ensure that the necessary gains in competitiveness are made. This would involve
competitiveness-enhancing income policies relying on negotiations of wage restraints with
labor unions in return for the expectation of higher growth, with the public sector taking the
lead. Internal adjustment will likely result in a period of inflation below that of trading
partners, slower growth in the near term, and higher nonperforming loans. The costs will be
evident from the start, but the growth pay-off will only materialize over the medium-term.
29.
The authorities acknowledged the need to rebalance growth from the
nontradable to the tradable sectors and stressed the role of structural reforms. The ERP
aims to reduce the role of the state in the economy through sales of minority shares, improve
labor market flexibility through limiting the time length for unemployment benefits, and
reduce business costs through the reduction of para-fiscal fees and judiciary reforms. The
6

While it is difficult to estimate the full balance sheet impact of exchange rate changes (including in light of
uncertainty regarding second round effects), back-of-the-envelope estimates suggest that the first round effects
of a 10 percent nominal devaluation could worsen the overall net position of non-financial sector balance sheet
by some 7 percent of GDP. Debt sustainability analysis indicates that a 30 percent real depreciation could
increase public and external debt to about 60 percent and 140 percent of GDP, respectively (Figures 9 and 10).

13
staff supports these measures and advocates their forceful implementation to improve the
business environment. At the same time, the staff urges actions to introduce greater
flexibility in the Labor Law in order to reduce firing costs that would positively impact job
creation.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
The staff commends the authorities for skillfully navigating through the global
financial and economic crisis. The swift policy measures taken in 2009 aimed to preserve
stability in the financial sector and contain fiscal deficits paid off. After an initial plunge in
financial markets and sharp declines in revenues, the authorities’ actions helped restore
stability. Croatia managed to maintain investor confidence, retained access to international
capital market, and rolled over maturing debt.
31.
Although the Croatian economy is bottoming out, it faces stagnation in 2010
before recovering in 2011. The staff expects a fragile recovery in the second half of 2010,
driven by inventory restocking and the external sector, as the fall in domestic demand slows
down. Growth could resume to 2 percent in 2011. This growth path is, however, subject to
considerable downside risks, given uncertain global outlook, unsettled financial markets and
large vulnerabilities of the economy.
32.
The authorities should continue with vigilant monetary and financial sector
policies. The moderate pace of recent monetary easing is adequate against the background of
a stable foreign exchange market and subdued inflation outlook. While the credit support
measures include safeguards to prevent weakening of the credit underwriting standards, close
supervision of the quality of the issued loans is needed. In light of sizable excess reserves and
the slow take off of the credit schemes, the staff would advise against further monetary
easing in the short term as confidence remains weak and financial outlook uncertain.
33.
The crisis has exposed fundamental weaknesses in the Croatian economy and
policies should create foundations that would allow the country to reap the maximum
benefits of EU accession. The pre-crisis growth model, fueled by foreign capital and
domestic absorption, has created mounting vulnerabilities, weakened competiveness and
generated growth that could easily be reversed by changes in international financial
conditions. Future capital inflows and credit growth are unlikely to be repeated in light of the
heightened global risk aversion. Croatia thus needs to create an open, flexible and
competitive economy that could attract quality investment enabling the economy to
experience robust growth without piling up imbalances. To attain such a goal, strong
complementary macroeconomic and structural policies are needed.
34.
The authorities face a difficult choice of the exchange rate regime, as both
options are costly. The authorities’ strong preference for a broadly stable exchange rate
policy implies the need for other measures to be adopted to strengthen competitiveness.
Croatia would, inter alia, need to maintain a sustained period of inflation below those of

14
partner countries. The staff urges the authorities to pursue income and wage policies that
would improve competitiveness, with public sector taking the lead.
35.
The staff recommends a strong fiscal consolidation in the medium-term. In the
absence of exchange rate flexibility, the burden of demand management falls largely on fiscal
policy. The authorities should bring the budget to structural balance over the medium-term to
provide adequate room for counter-cyclical measures, and ensure debt sustainability. This
should be achieved mainly by expenditure consolidation via a reduction in public sector
employment and subsidies to loss-making public enterprises, and a better targeting of social
assistance expenditure. In addition, rising contingent fiscal liabilities need to be contained.
The authorities’ intention to adopt a Fiscal Responsibility Law is welcome, and staff urges
them to be ambitious in setting the deficit target.
36.
Structural policies should aim to remove existing inefficiencies in the labor
market and business environment. Greater flexibility needs to be introduced in
employment termination procedures. The staff also advises the revision of social benefit
parameters, particularly for pension and unemployment benefits, which create adverse
incentives for labor force participation. Improving business environment requires a vigorous
pursuit of privatization (including of companies with majority government ownership),
reduction of para-fiscal fees, and simplification of business entry requirements.
37.
The Government’s recently-announced ERP is a commendable and
comprehensive plan, and its speedy and well-sequenced implementation will be
instrumental. The staff urges the authorities to frontload measures that would reduce public
expenditure and eliminate structural rigidities in labor market and business environment. The
envisaged tax cuts should come into effect only after enough fiscal room has been created
through reductions in inefficient public expenditures. The success of the ERP will require
considerable political consensus. Its timely and well-sequenced execution will help instill
market confidence and enable Croatia to enter the EU from a position of strength.
38.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation with Croatia be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

ANNEX I. ASSESSING CROATIA’S REAL EXCHANGE RATE
Staff’s quantitative estimates of misalignment suggest that Croatia’s real effective exchange
rate could be slightly overvalued. Point estimates, which are subject to significant
uncertainties, indicate overvaluation margin in the range of 4-10 percent (imposing
multilateral consistency).

ANNEX II: GOVERNMENT’S ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROGRAM (ERP)
The ERP aims to generate economic recovery and create a competitive economy using the
following five levers.1


Reduce public sector expenditures, while increasing its effectiveness and
transparency;



Redirect budget resources to targeted social transfers and economically viable capital
investments;



Reduce government intervention in economic activities through further privatization,
and professional management of public enterprises and government institutions;



Start a new investment cycle with economically measurable long-term effects, and
maximum participation of the private sector; and



Speed up implementation of reforms in judiciary, health care, pension insurance, and
state and local government.

This comprehensive ten-year plan includes 131 measures in ten reform areas to be
implemented during 2010–20. The authorities have developed a timeline and identified
agencies for the implementation of these reforms. However, many of the measures are yet to
be fine-tuned, and fiscal and growth impact of these measures has not been quantified. The
following are some key measures expected to be implemented or commenced
during 2010/11.

1



Reduce the level and number of income tax rates.



Abolish all tax exemptions in the income tax system.



Reduce or abolish non-tax levies imposed by local government units and public
agencies.



Establish a central regulatory body for water, utility and similar fees within the
competence of local self government.



Prepare a plan for the reduction of government expenditure.

The ERP was announced in late April and adopted in early May.

37



Reduce illiquidity through one-off payment of all debts under the Government’s
purview that are falling due by June 1, 2010.



Maintain the payment schedule of 60 days and introduce the payment schedule of 45
days from January 1, 2011.



Gradually harmonize the legal ages for early and mandatory retirement for men and
women.



Increase penalty for early retirement and introduce incentives for late retirement.



Continue health care reform by rationalizing operations and health care institution
network.



Launch privatization of companies where the government owns minority shares.

38
ANNEX III. CREDIT SCHEMES
Model A. This model aims to stimulate the provision of short term loans (up to 3 years) to
finance working capital of companies. To provide banks with liquidity for such loans, the
model involved a reduction in the reserve requirement from 14 to 13 percent, which released
about HRK 2.9 billion (1 percent of GDP). The banks then provided a syndicated loan of
HRK 2 billion at 3 percent interest rate to the Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (HBOR). HBOR has subsequently started lending these funds to enterprises
(selected by the banks) at an interest rate fixed below the market rates through commercial
banks, which co-finance 60 percent of the loans using their own resources. The final interest
rate charged to enterprises is determined in the loan auctions to bank organized by the
HBOR. The model involves a risk sharing arrangement between banks and the HBOR. There
has been a substantial interest in this model, and the first few auctions were significantly
oversubscribed. However, the effective disbursement of these loans to the ultimate borrowers
has been slow.

Model B. Under this model, the authorities established a fund for guaranteeing 25-50 percent
of the risk on bank loans for developmental and investment projects with a maturity of up to
10 years. This model has had limited success so far, as the demand for long term loans is
very weak.

Model C. This model envisages debt-to-equity swaps. Government would write off the debt
of troubled enterprises in exchange for an ownership stake transferred to the specially created
economic cooperation funds. The enterprises would need to present a restructuring plan, and
the intention is to provide this type of assistance for a period of 5 years or less. As of early
May, this model has not been activated.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
In December 1991, Croatia left the Yugoslav dinar area and adopted the Croatian
dinar as its sole legal tender. The Croatian dinar was replaced by the Croatian kuna
on May 30, 1994. The exchange rate of the kuna is determined by supply and
demand in the interbank market, with tight management by the CNB. Croatia’s de
facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as “stabilized arrangement” from July
1, 2009. The CNB transacts only in euros, U.S. dollars, and SDRs. On May 4, 2010
the official exchange rate was kuna 7.258114 per euro (middle rate).

VIII.

Exchange Restrictions:
Croatia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2–4 and maintains an
exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions, except for restrictions that Croatia maintains solely for
the preservation of national or international security that have been notified to the
Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision 144(52/51).

Annex II. Croatia: Statistical Issues
1.
Data provision is broadly adequate for effective surveillance, though some
improvements would be desirable. While remedial action has been taken to improve data
coverage and reliability in most cases, progress in some instances has been impeded by
insufficient resources and issues regarding coordination among government agencies. Croatia
subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard.
A. National Accounts
2.
The national accounts have undergone substantial improvements in the last few years.
The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) publishes constant and current price data compiled in
accordance with the 1995 ESA. Quarterly GDP estimates are disseminated at current prices
and at constant (2000) prices for the main categories of expenditure and main industry
groupings. Nonetheless, shortcomings remain. Significant discrepancies exist between
expenditure-based and value-added-based GDP data, stemming from: (i) problems of
coordination between the CBS and the Croatian National Bank (CNB) in reconciling tourism
receipts estimates; (ii) incomplete coverage of unincorporated businesses and the selfemployed (farmers, traders, and craftsmen); (iii) inadequate data for measuring changes in
inventories; (iv) incomplete coverage of the informal sector; and (v) a lack of quarterly data
for the seasonally volatile agricultural sector.
B. Prices
3.
The CBS produces a monthly consumer price index, with expenditure weights
(updated every five years) derived from a 2005 Household Budget Survey. Between
rebasing, the weights are price-updated annually to December of the previous year. Data are
collected at different time periods in the month for different product groups but in all cases
between the thirteenth and the twenty-first day of each month. The indices are released
around the fifteenth day of the following month. The price collection is confined to nine
towns, but the weights are based on a sample of households in the whole country. A
harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) is also calculated in line with Eurostat
methodology, but is not released for the time being to avoid confusion. A core CPI is also
calculated based on a methodology developed by the CNB. The CBS also releases a monthly
producer price index (PPI), usually on the eighth day of the following month. The weighting
system of the PPI is based on the 2000 Annual Report of Industry and is changed every five
years, while weights are partially corrected every year.
C. Wages and Employment
4.
The CBS produces data on average net and gross earnings per person and
employment by sector. Earning data include bonuses, sick pay, and meal allowances, and are
based on monthly surveys covering 70 percent of workers in permanent employment in each
industrial category. They do not cover a significant part of the working population, including
persons employed in trade and crafts, contract workers, farmers, and the military and police.

7
5.
The number of registered unemployed overstates the actual level of unemployment. A
preliminary Labor Force Survey, which meets ILO standards, was conducted for the first
time in 1996 on 7,200 households. The sample was subsequently expanded and the survey is
now being conducted on a regular basis. The CBS released semi-annual results from 1998,
and began releasing quarterly results in 2007 with a lag of about four months.
D. Government Finance Statistics
6.
The authorities have started presenting budget plans based on the ESA 95 framework,
but government finance statistics produced on a monthly basis on the GFSM framework
(GFS) have been available in the Monthly Statistical Review of the Ministry of Finance
(MoF). Data normally come with a lag of about one quarter. Revenue data are reliable, and
expenditure data on a cash basis are available according to GFS classifications (economic
and functional) for the central budget and the budgetary funds. The data on central
government financing in the MoF reports are not reconciled with those in the CNB’s
monetary survey and balance of payments data, with substantial discrepancies owing partly
to different methodologies and definitions of government. Following the recommendations of
the October 2002 GFS mission, a task force, comprising staff from the MoF, CNB, and CBS
was formed to reconcile central government financing data produced by these institutions.
7.
The detailed data on domestic public bonds published in the Monthly Statistical
Review are now augmented by a central government debt table in the CNB Monthly Bulletin,
which also reports stocks of central government guaranteed debt. The MoF prepared a
database with government guarantees in July 2003 that has been used to monitor
developments in the stock and flows of guarantees.
8.
Data on the operations of local governments and consolidated general government are
available on a quarterly basis. Local government data are partial as they include the
operations of the 53 largest municipalities.
E. Monetary Data
9.
Compilation of monetary statistics published by the CNB is consistent with the
recommendations of the IMF’s 2000 Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Data on the monetary survey, including separate records for deposit money banks and the
balance sheet of the CNB, are published monthly with four- and two-week lags, respectively.
The CNB is planning to extend its statistical framework to balance sheet information of
investment funds and insurance companies. In March 2002, the CNB started collecting
financial information (balance sheets and investment structure) from investment and pension
funds; the data are not yet published, but used for internal purposes. According to the CNB,
the inclusion of other financial corporations in monetary statistics depends on the
harmonization process of the monetary statistics with the statistical reporting requirements of
the European Central Bank. In November 2006, the CNB reported monetary data in the
format of Standardized Report Forms for December 2001 to the present. These data accord

8
with the concepts and definitions in MFSM and were published, along with the corresponding
metadata, in IFS and the IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics.
F. External Sector Statistics
10.
Quarterly balance of payments data are compiled broadly in accordance with the fifth
edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual. Data are generally available with a lag of
three months and are subject to substantial revisions in subsequent releases; trade data are
available with a lag of one month and data on international reserves are available the next
day on request. Travel survey methodologies were modified in 2002, 2004, and again
in 2005, while the method for estimating the cost of insurance and freight was modified in
early 2004. Net errors and omissions have ranged from 2½ to 3¾ percent of GDP since 2003,
and are negative. The coverage and quality of portfolio investment data are reasonably
complete and accurate.
11.
A large part of external debt was contracted prior to the dissolution of the former
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia’s share was agreed with Paris and
London Club creditors in 1995 and 1998, respectively. The CNB compiles external debt data
according to the requirements of External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and
Users, 2003, and began disseminating external debt data in the second quarter of 2003. The
inclusion of hybrid and subordinated debt instruments, repos, late interest, and interest
accruals and arrears has caused an upward adjustment in the external debt series compared to
previously released data. Quarterly data on the international investment position are available
on the CNB website up to 2009:Q4.

Annex III. Croatia: World Bank Relations
1.
The World Bank’s Board endorsed the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Croatia
for FY09–12 in September 2008, just before the full onset of the global financial crisis. The
goal of the CPS is to support the completion of Croatia’s EU accession process, the rapid
convergence of its income level with that of current EU member states in a fiscally, socially
and environmentally sustainable fashion. This overarching goal is in line with the
Government’s priorities expressed in various government programs. In pursuing this goal,
the Bank Group program aims at contributing in the following four areas:





sustaining macroeconomic stability;
strengthening private sector-led growth and accelerating convergence with the EU;
improving the quality and efficiency in the social sectors; and
increasing the sustainability of long-term development.

2.
The EU accession agenda remains a cross-cutting theme in the design and
implementation of the Bank Group program. In the selection and design of operations,
primary consideration is given to the assessment of proposed projects’ support of Croatia’s
EU accession agenda. In the case of social sectors not covered under the EU acquis,
consideration is also given to how projects complement the EU accession efforts. Project
components that enhance Croatia’s capacity to absorb EU funds, especially following the
accession, have high priority.
3.
The CPS envisages an indicative base-case lending envelope of about US$1.0–
1.4 billion for investment operations over the four-year period. The CPS also includes an
upside scenario, with possible development policy lending amounting to some US$1.4–
1.8 billion. The lending program will be based on and complemented by analytical work,
particularly in the areas of public expenditure reform, governance, investment climate, and
climate change.
4.
In FY10, the Bank’s Board has approved three loans amounting to US$475 million, to
help mitigate the impact of the global economic crisis and provide funding for the private
sector, through a credit line of about EUR100 million for exporters, , and through a Fiscal,
Social and Financial Sector Development Policy Loan of EUR200 million. In addition, an
investment operation for judicial sector has been approved. The future Bank program might
be adjusted to help the authorities in implementing recently adopted Economic Recovery
Program aiming to address the vulnerabilities and competitiveness issues of the economy.
5.
Currently, the World Bank finances 19 operations in a wide range of sectors with a
combined loan amount of close to US$1.2 billion. IFC’s portfolio amounts to about
US$335 million, and MIGA guarantees exceed US$40 million.

Statement by the Staff Representative on the Republic of Croatia
Executive Board Meeting
June 21, 2010
1.
This statement reports on recent developments and adds to the information contained in
the staff report for the 2010 Article IV consultation. It does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
First quarter preliminary flash GDP estimates surprised on the downside,
highlighting the risks of weaker growth prospects for 2010 than what was assumed in
staff’s baseline scenario. GDP fell by 2½ percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2010 vis-àvis staff’s projected decline of ½ percent. While there is significant uncertainty around these
estimates and the demand components driving this decline are not known at this time, the staff
now sees greater downside risks to the 2010 growth projection, with associated negative
implications for unemployment, fiscal revenues and non-performing loans.
3.
The authorities have taken steps to implement reforms in all ten areas envisaged
under the Economic Recovery Program (ERP). In particular, the parliament has approved two
laws to (i) reduce privileged pensions of selected groups, and (ii) rationalize the hospital network
in Zagreb and reduce exemptions from health service copayments. Both laws will be effective
from July 1, 2010. The combined annual fiscal savings from these two measures are estimated to
be around 0.1 percent of GDP in 2010, and 0.3 percent of GDP per annum over the mediumterm. The stock of public enterprise arrears (0.3 percent of GDP in end-April) was reported to
have been halved in May, helping alleviate the tight liquidity position of the corporate sector. The
government has prepared amendments to the Income Tax Act to reduce the tax burden on labor
income and eliminate numerous exemptions, and to the Profit Tax to increase the tax base and
reduce evasion. Both proposals have been submitted to the Parliament for approval.1 The
government has submitted amendments to the Labor Law to the Parliament with the objective to
limit the duration of collective bargaining and eliminate the automatic extension of the collective
agreements to entire sectors, and is currently in discussion with the labor unions to prepare
further amendments. Non-tax levies were decreased to lessen the tax burden on businesses
through amendments in a number of Acts. The authorities also received four bids for three of the
shipyards slated for privatization, and are currently considering these offers.

1

The amendments to the Income Tax Act propose three personal income tax rates, 12 percent (up to HRK
3,600), 25 percent (HRK 3,601- HRK 10,800), and 40 percent (＞HRK 10,800), which replace the current four
rates: 15 percent (up to HRK 3,600), 25 percent (HRK 3,601 - HRK 5,400), 35 percent (HRK 5,401 - HRK
16,200) and 45 percent (＞HRK 16,200). The authorities intend to contain the negative impact of the rate
changes on revenue collections through elimination of exemptions. The amendments to the Profit Tax Act
include, among other things, elimination of personal expenses as tax deductibles, and expansion of the 20
percent rate to all types of services paid to companies not based in the EU or to companies based in countries
where nominal profit tax rate is below 12.5 percent.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Croatia
On June 21, 2010 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Croatia.1
Background
The global economic and financial crisis has significantly affected the Croatian economy. With
reduced capital inflows, and subdued export demand on the external front, and tight credit
conditions on the domestic front, real GDP fell by 5.8 percent in 2009, and unemployment rose
sharply to 17 percent. While exports plunged, an even larger contraction in imports resulted in a
near-halving of the current account deficit to 5 percent of GDP. The economy remains in the
midst of a severe downturn in the early part of 2010, and positive growth is expected to resume
gradually in the second half of the year, with a forecast for zero growth in 2010.
The authorities’ policy response to the crisis has been swift. The Croatian National Bank (CNB)
appropriately addressed liquidity shortages in the banking sector in 2009 through relaxation of
regulatory requirements, repo auctions, and simplification of rules for banks to access CNB’s
emergency liquidity assistance. The timely policy response helped improve financial market
sentiment: the kuna has fully retracted its losses, official reserves have been replenished, and
bond spreads declined, which allowed the authorities to tap international capital markets twice
in 2009. Liquidity pressures abated during the course of 2009 as domestic deposits remained
stable and foreign parent institutions maintained their credit lines to domestic subsidiaries.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The authorities also took strong fiscal actions in 2009 to offset plunging revenues and contain
the 2009 budget deficit to financeable levels. Three supplementary budgets were adopted with
a number of short-term measures that included expenditure cuts, a wage and pension freeze, a
VAT rate hike, and the introduction of a temporary “solidarity tax” on incomes and pensions.
These measures, helped, but the fiscal deficit nevertheless widened to just under 4 percent of
GDP (including the payment for a called guarantee of a public shipyard). Public debt also rose
sharply to 50 percent of GDP including the guaranteed stock.
While banks have weathered the crisis relatively well owing to high capital buffers, profitability
has decline largely reflecting an increase in the provisioning for nonperforming loans which
reached 7.8 percent at end-2009. Private sector credit growth fell sharply as the uncertain
macroeconomic environment lowered demand for new loans, and banks tightened underwriting
standards. Concerns about the lack of credit recovery prompted the authorities to introduce
earlier this year three schemes to revive credit to corporates, through loans to finance working
capital as well as provision of government guarantees for investment loans. These schemes are
expected to be in place until end-2010.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for skillfully navigating the economy through the
global financial and economic crisis, as their swift intervention had helped preserve financial
stability, contain the fiscal deficit, and maintain investor confidence and access to international
capital markets. Directors noted the incipient recovery faces considerable downside risks given
the uncertain global outlook, unsettled regional financial markets, and significant domestic
economic vulnerabilities. Well-focused medium-term fiscal consolidation and ambitious
structural reforms will be needed to increase competitiveness and attract investment to bring
about stronger and more balanced growth.
Directors noted that the burden of demand management falls largely on fiscal policy, given the
stable exchange rate policy. They agreed that a cyclically-balanced budget over the mediumterm would provide needed policy room and ensure debt sustainability. Directors considered
that fiscal adjustment could be best achieved through expenditure measures, including
reductions in the public sector wage bill and public enterprise subsidies, rationalization of
pension and health expenditure, and better targeting of social assistance expenditure. They
welcomed the inclusion of many of these measures in the Economic Recovery Program (ERP),
while recommending that expenditure reforms should precede the envisaged tax cuts. In
addition, Directors encouraged containment of rising contingent fiscal liabilities and endorsed
plans to adopt a Fiscal Responsibility Law.
While recognizing the difficult trade-offs, Directors considered that maintaining a broadly stable
exchange rate provides an appropriate anchor given market volatility and high financial
euroization. They emphasized the importance of structural reforms to improve competitiveness,
including by removing inefficiencies in the labor market and business environment, and
pursuing appropriate income and wage policies to achieve internal adjustment of the economy.

3
Directors recommended greater flexibility in employment policies and social benefits to remove
adverse incentives for labor force participation. They also observed that improving the business
environment would require privatization, reduced para-fiscal fees, and simplified business entry
requirements. Directors welcomed the recent introduction of reforms in many of these areas
under the ERP, noting that speedy, well-sequenced and full ERP implementation would be
instrumental in strengthening market confidence and assisting Croatia in entering the EU from a
position of strength.
Directors called for continued vigilant monetary and financial sector policies, as banks remain
vulnerable to credit and liquidity risks. They viewed the moderate pace of monetary easing as
adequate and cautioned against further easing as the financial outlook remains uncertain. While
noting safeguards to prevent weakening of credit underwriting standards, Directors
recommended close supervision of the quality of loans issued under the credit support
measures. They expressed concerns about the recapitalization of public banks from the deposit
insurance fund.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mr. Age Bakker, Executive Director on the Republic of Croatia
June 21, 2010
Like many countries in the region, Croatia faces challenging times in the aftermath of the crisis.
The authorities value the continued close cooperation with the Fund, also in order to help
addressing the challenges. They had productive discussions with staff in the context of the 2010
Article IV consultation, and broadly agree to their recommendations.
The impact of the crisis
As a small and open economy, Croatia was significantly affected by the global economic and
financial crisis. The impact has been felt chiefly through a decline in external demand and private
capital inflows, which until 2008 acted as the country’s engine of growth. Admittedly, these
inflows also fuelled rapid credit growth which led to higher domestic and external imbalances in
the run up to the crisis. To safeguard macroeconomic and financial stability, the authorities
promptly stabilized the foreign exchange market and provided liquidity at a time when foreign
markets were effectively closed. By freezing wages and pensions as well as increasing direct and
indirect tax rates, the authorities also contained the impact of the crisis on the 2009 fiscal
balance. Helped by this welcome response, and the general improvement in risk appetite among
investors, financial market conditions towards Croatia markedly recovered, as observed by the
replenishment in reserves and narrowing sovereign bond spreads.
Although financial market sentiment improved in the course of 2009, GDP growth fell sharply by
close to 6 percent, as the economy adjusted to lower capital inflows, tighter credit conditions and
a collapse in exports. A broad gauge of seasonally-adjusted unemployment has also sharply
increased from 13 percent in end-2008 to more than 17 percent early-2010, illustrating that the
labor market is susceptible to output developments. Driven by import contraction, the current
account deficit almost halved in terms of GDP between 2008 and 2009. Inflation retrenched amid
the sizable negative output gap and lower energy and food prices.
The economic outlook
Croatia’s economic prospects are challenging. While the recession has bottomed out, high
frequency data suggest that the economy is likely to recover only modestly in the second half of
2010. Industrial output is showing some signs of improvement and exports are picking up, but
private sector demand, particularly consumption, is likely to remain soft in the face of falling
disposable incomes, rising unemployment, tighter credit conditions and the need to deleverage
balance sheets. Against this background, the authorities broadly share staff’s economic prospects
for 2010, and its risk assessment which is skewed to the downside.
Although the current account deficit has fallen substantially, external financing requirements for
2010 remain substantial, particularly owing to large private sector debt repayments. These large
requirements make Croatia potentially vulnerable to a reversal in sentiment. A mitigating factor
however is that parent banks have until now remained fully committed to maintain exposures.
Even during the crisis, these companies fully rolled over maturing private sector debt. Attracting

2
funding for sovereign needs is likely to be manageable in light of the strong demand for
government paper. So far, the impact of problems in Greece on Croatian funding costs has
remained fairly limited, but the authorities are cognizant that wider euro area problems could
trigger funding pressures for Croatian issuers.
The policies
EU accession remains the authorities’ top priority, and entails a wide range of far-reaching
administrative, social and economic reforms. The authorities are working vigorously to complete
the legislative reforms in the context of EU accession negotiations by the end of this year, with
the aim to enter the EU in 2012. In the view of the authorities, accession to the EU constitutes a
significant step to further European integration with potentially large economic benefits. The
authorities fully share staff’s views that to reap the largest benefits of EU accession, Croatia
needs to boost its competitiveness and secure wider macroeconomic policy space to future
demand shocks. The government has therefore launched a comprehensive, far-reaching and
multi-year Economic Recovery Program.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
For years Croatia’s monetary policy has been aimed at maintaining a broadly stable nominal
exchange rate in relation to the euro. Such a policy is appropriate, as it has served this small and
open country well, also in view of its high level of euroization and strong financial integration
with the rest of Europe. As staff rightly stresses, a stable nominal exchange rate has provided
Croatia with a strong anchor for inflation expectations and financial stability. This policy is
widely supported domestically. The authorities are of the view that the existing vulnerabilities are
not the result of the stable exchange rate regime. Overleveraging in foreign currency occurred in
many other countries in the region, irrespective of their exchange regime. Foreign currency
lending in Croatia is related to the historically high level of foreign currency deposits, which
dates back to periods of hyperinflation in the eighties and early nineties.
The authorities agreed with staff that given the sizable net foreign currency exposure of the
corporate private sector even a moderate exchange rate adjustment would cause substantial
negative balance sheet effects and credit losses. Such a shock would be costly in terms of output
loss, partly due to non-linear effects triggered by a fall in confidence. The authorities do not
consider it useful to target gradual exchange rate adjustment, as they are not convinced this
would materially boost exports. Gradual adjustment would also be hard to engineer in the context
of large cross-border capital flows and actors’ high sensitivity to exchange rate movements.
Looking at both the benefits and costs, the authorities are strongly committed to maintaining the
broadly stable exchange rate. In their view, the benefits of the current regime clearly outweigh
the costs. Competitiveness needs to be improved were it should; and that is in the real sector.
They fully realize that this will entail painful adjustments, but this is a price they consider well
worth paying. The implementation of the Economic Recovery Program also demonstrates that the
authorities are working on policies that support the current exchange rate regime.

3
Fiscal Policy
Current conditions underscore the need of securing sustainable public finances and creating large
enough fiscal room to address future economic shocks. The authorities are aware that action is
needed. After an important improvement between 2004 and 2007, the cyclically-adjusted fiscal
balance has deteriorated over the last couple of years, albeit to a lesser extent than in a number of
other countries in the region. Originally, the 2010 fiscal deficit was expected to decrease
substantially relative to the 2009 deficit on account of expenditure containment, but slower
growth, the withdrawal of the solidarity tax and changes to the personal income taxes are likely
to have a negative impact on revenues. The latter measures are part of the Economic Recovery
Program and bring tax rates more in line with Croatia’s peers. Limiting the impact of lower
revenues requires compensatory measures. The authorities will reduce privileged pensions, save
on health care spending through higher co-payments and hospital reorganizations and address
corporate tax evasion. These measures become effective in July. They will undertake further
measures, including abolishing most income tax exemptions and reducing a number of subsidies.
Going forward, medium-term fiscal consolidation will be supported by measures envisaged under
the Economic Recovery Program. The authorities share staff’s view that medium-term fiscal
adjustment should be largely expenditure-based. In order to achieve that goal, they are committed
to reducing the number of public-sector employees, for which the authorities have prepared the
necessary legislation. Moreover, they are committed to downsizing the number of state agencies,
outsourcing non-core government activities, speeding up privatization and reforming the pension,
health care and social security system. The introduction of personal identification numbers last
year will also help in better targeting social assistance.
Financial Sector
Conservative prudential and regulatory policies together with maintaining a stable exchange rate
have proved to be of great value in safeguarding financial stability during the crisis. The banking
sector remains resilient, despite the fact that nonperforming loans are on the rise. Profitability is
declining, but is still at roughly 6.5 percent. While losses are likely to increase further due to
slower growth, stress tests indicate that the banking sector is able to absorb a significant decline
in asset quality, reflecting both decent profitability levels and very strong capital buffers. The
aggregate capital adequacy ratio further increased to 18.9 percent in the first quarter of 2010, as a
consequence of implementation of Basel II framework.
Croatian banks have large external liabilities, which make banks potentially susceptible to
liquidity risks. However, as staff rightly stresses, foreign banks, coming from a diverse group of
countries, have so far been strongly supportive of their subsidiaries in Croatia. Moreover, the
high ratio of liquid assets to short-term liabilities further lowers liquidity risks. The authorities
have taken note of staff concerns about the measures to stimulate bank lending. In the meantime,
they have decided not to further ease monetary conditions to facilitate an increase in loan supply.
They also stressed that the scheme to exchange debt for equity is only meant for companies with
viable restructuring plans. It is not the intention of the government to hold on to these stakes for
longer than necessary.

Structural reforms
To improve competitiveness a number of structural reforms in the labor markets and business
environment is required. The authorities’ Economic Recovery Program recognizes the need to
move forward in these areas. Croatia’s unit labor costs rose faster relative to those in many of its
trading partners over the last couple of years. However, adjustment is underway, as nominal net
private-sector wages are dropping in response to growing labor market slack, and public-sector
wages are frozen for this year. Non-competitive wage setting is also being tackled by the
government, as they have recently submitted laws to the parliament to limit collective bargaining
and eliminate the automatic extension of collective agreements. To help increase labor market
participation, the authorities are taking legislative steps to limit the height and duration of
unemployment benefits. The lower marginal income tax rates will also increase incentives to
seek employment.
The authorities continue to work on improving Croatia’s business environment. An interministerial working group will be established to identify all barriers to direct investment, and
draft a plan to eliminate these barriers. One of the major factors adding to the cost of doing
business is the high number of non-tax levies imposed by local governments on investors. The
authorities have started to reduce these levies in the areas of utilities, tourism and real estate. In
order to curb the government’s footprint in public enterprises, the authorities are planning to sell
their minority stakes in companies, for which legislation will be submitted to parliament by
September this year. The authorities also received four bids for three of the shipyards scheduled
for privatization.
The authorities consent to the Fund’s publication of the staff report.
