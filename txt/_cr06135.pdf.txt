Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for
the 2005 Consultation with Suriname
Approved by Christopher Towe and Michael Hadjimichael
February 8, 2006
Discussions for the 2005 Article IV consultation took place in Paramaribo during
November 10–21, 2005. The mission consisted of Messrs. B. Fritz-Krockow (Head), M. Nozaki,
R. Portillo, and Ms. M. Torres (all WHD). The mission met with Minister of Finance Hildenberg,
Central Bank President Telting, and other senior government officials, representatives of the
business community, labor unions, and political parties. Ms. K. Florestal (OED) participated in the
policy discussions.
Last Article IV consultation. At its conclusion on March 25, 2005, Directors commended the
authorities for their efforts to maintain stability in the economy through a tight fiscal and monetary
policy stance. They stressed that macroeconomic stabilization should remain a priority, particularly
in view of the forthcoming elections. They also highlighted the need to reform the public sector.
Political and economic developments. President Venetiaan returned to power as the head of an
expanded coalition after the May 2005 parliamentary elections. Economic activity strengthened
during the past year, reflecting increased mining output and investment. Headline inflation has
picked up, reflecting the recent doubling of domestic fuel prices.
Key policy issues. The principal short-term challenge for Suriname is to maintain disciplined fiscal
and monetary policies, especially to contain the inflationary impact of the recent increase in
domestic fuel prices. Over the medium term, the priority will be to entrench a consistent
macroeconomic policy framework and advance critical public sector reforms in order to minimize
the vulnerability to exogenous shocks and improve the competitiveness of the non-mining sectors.
Exchange arrangement. The authorities have made progress towards unifying the official and
market exchange rates under a de facto managed float regime. Suriname has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4, but maintains multiple currency practices subject to
Fund approval.
Statistics. Except for monetary data, the quality and timeliness of economic statistics are inadequate
for surveillance purposes, in particular national accounts and trade statistics.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Suriname is benefiting from the boom in global commodity markets. Growth remains
strong, fueled by investment and exports in the gold, bauxite, and oil industries. The
completion of major investments in the mining sector and the strength in global commodity
prices supported buoyant growth in exports and an increase in foreign exchange reserves.
However, inflation has increased with the near-doubling of domestic fuel prices in September
2005.
Macroeconomic policies remain broadly appropriate. Revenues from oil exports reduced
the fiscal deficit to around 1 percent of GDP in 2005, while the recent increase in domestic
fuel taxation will support the fiscal position. The central bank has absorbed liquidity created
by a reduction in reserve requirements in the last two years by placing Treasury bills in the
market. As a result, reserve money growth has slowed and private sector credit growth is
projected to decline to 18 percent in 2005.
The outlook appears favorable, but significant vulnerabilities remain. Export growth and
a continued cautious policy stance are projected to limit short-term risks. Over the medium
term, the outlook remains positive. However, Suriname remains vulnerable to exogenous
shocks and has a history of sudden and highly destabilizing policy shifts in the aftermath of
shocks to global commodity prices.
The key challenges are to maintain and entrench stable macroeconomic policies and
reduce the country’s vulnerability to shocks. In the short-run, it is important to resist
second-round effects from the recent fuel price increases, including pressures for further
compensatory wage increases or subsidies. Over the medium term, the authorities should aim
to reduce the vulnerability of the fiscal position to changes in global commodity prices,
including by establishing a stabilization fund abroad with revenues from new extractive
industries. Similarly, there is scope for establishing a firmer anchor for monetary policy,
based on targets for a monetary aggregate, while moving to a unified and more flexible
exchange rate regime. In addition, it will be important to reform the civil service and to deal
with the large number of public enterprises.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Although Suriname is presently benefiting from the global boom in commodity
prices, the country is highly vulnerable to external shocks and has been prone to poor
macroeconomic management. Exports of alumina, gold, and oil are equivalent to roughly
60 percent of GDP while a large and inefficient public sector includes about 120 public
enterprises and accounts for about 60 percent of formal employment. Inappropriate fiscal and
monetary policy responses to terms-of-trade shocks have led to episodes of nearhyperinflation and depreciation, significant output volatility, and external payments arrears.

2.
Suriname’s economic and social indicators are close to the median for Latin
America and the Caribbean. However, the economy offers limited employment
opportunities outside the mining and public sectors, and there is widespread poverty in rural
areas.1
3.
President Venetiaan’s coalition was returned to power in the May 2005
parliamentary elections, albeit with a smaller majority. His New Front coalition lost its
majority and after protracted negotiations, a new coalition was formed in August consisting
of eight parties controlling 30 of 51 seats in Parliament. The increased diversity of political
views in the new coalition is expected to make it more challenging to maintain
macroeconomic discipline and the momentum for reform.
1

National accounts statistics are unreliable and there are indications that GDP is grossly underestimated on
account of a large and burgeoning informal economy.

-6-

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Economic activity remains buoyant reflecting the surge in global commodity
prices and increased mining output, and inflation has rebounded after a hike in fuel
prices. Real GDP increased by 8 percent in 2004, boosted by a new gold mine in Rosebel
that became operational in April 2004, an expansion of the Suralco alumina refinery, and
investment in the bauxite sector. Gold and oil exports, as well as continued investment to
replace aging bauxite mines in Lelydorp and Mungo, are estimated to have supported growth
of around 5 percent in 2005. Inflation moderated to 9 percent in 2004 and the exchange rate
stabilized. However, inflation is estimated to have risen to about 17 percent in 2005, largely
as a result of a doubling of domestic fuel prices in September 2005.
5.
The fiscal position has strengthened, notwithstanding pre-election spending
pressures. The central government’s overall deficit declined from around 3 percent of GDP
in 2004 to an estimated 1 percent of GDP in 2005. This improvement resulted from a
substantial increase in revenue from the oil sector, which more than offset higher capital
expenditure during the pre-election period and a 2 percent of GDP revenue loss due to delays
in adjusting domestic fuel prices.2 As a result, the public sector debt-to-GDP ratio is
estimated to have dropped to 41½ percent by end 2005.
6.
Central bank financing of the budget has been limited. Fiscal financing by the
Central Bank of Suriname (CBvS) is expected to decline from about 1 percent of GDP in
2004 to ½ percent in 2005. Although the CBvS has lowered the effective reserve requirement
on domestic currency deposits since mid-2004, private sector credit growth has moderated as
additional liquidity has been sterilized by a larger issuance of Treasury bills.3

2

The authorities maintained a system of variable residual taxation, in which the difference between world
prices and fixed domestic prices accrued to the government as a tax. Besides this revenue source, the
government is highly dependent on revenues from the natural resources sector—roughly one quarter of tax
revenue was collected from the gold, bauxite, and oil industries in 2002–05. However, world price volatility has
meant that revenue from these sources has fluctuated widely in the past between 7–11 percent of GDP.
3

The effective reserve requirement ratio is lower than the stated ratio as commercial banks are allowed to
invest up to 7 percentage points of required reserves in low-interest mortgages and state banks have a lower
ratio. Reserve requirements on domestic deposits are unremunerated.

-7-

Box 1: Treasury Bills
The government has increasingly relied on Treasury bills for domestic financing. As of September 2005,
the stock of Treasury bills stood at SRD 215 million (6 percent of GDP), up from SRD 162 million a year
before. Nearly 90 percent of these were held by commercial banks, and the rest were held by pension funds,
insurance companies, and corporations. Terms for the Treasury bills have been set by the CBvS (they presently
yield 12.5 percent for a maturity of 6 months) and they are traded bilaterally between the CBvS and commercial
banks. The Treasury bills can be sold by holders to the CBvS without delay or penalty at the discount value plus
accrued interest.
Treasury bills yields have remained unchanged for several months and, in the absence of formal auctions
or a secondary market, do not reflect market conditions and are not an effective as a monetary policy
instrument. It appears that commercial banks have only limited interest in intermediating bills to their retail
customers due to their high yield, limited availability, and high degree of liquidity.

7.
The economy has become increasingly dollarized in recent years. 4 During
2002-October 2005, the share of foreign currency deposits rose from 47 percent to 59 percent
of the total deposit base, and the share of

8.
Financial sector soundness has improved, but weaknesses remain. Assets in the
system total about 80 percent of GDP, but nearly 50 percentage points are concentrated in
three banks—one of these is a fully-owned subsidiary of an international bank and the two
others have minority government ownership.6 Although banking sector indicators point to a

Foreign currency deposits and loans are denominated in Euros and U.S. dollars.

5

The reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits were increased from zero in January 2003 to
33⅓ percent in February 2005, compared with 23 percent for domestic deposits. Required reserves for foreign
currency deposits can be held in interest-bearing accounts abroad, while those for domestic currency deposits
are held as unremunerated deposits at the CBvS. The spread between lending and deposit rates in 2004 was
11 percentage points for domestic currency and 7.8 percentage points for foreign currency instruments.

The assets of smaller banks are around 6 percent of GDP, and the assets of the pension funds, the insurance
companies, and credit unions total around 25 percent of GDP. A comprehensive review of the financial system

relatively robust financial system (for example, the capital adequacy ratio for the system rose
to 9½ percent in September 2005), non-performing loans have increased, while dollarization
has risen in recent years to around 50 percent of total loans, suggesting potential balance
sheet vulnerabilities. In addition, there are substantial loan performance, management, and
capitalization problems at three small state-owned banks. Implementation of new banking
supervision regulations has suffered from a lack of staff resources and delays in reporting.
9.
The external current account deficit has remained large, financed largely
through foreign direct investment. Although the current account deficit narrowed to
5 percent of GDP in 2004, reflecting the effects of buoyant prices of gold and alumina
exports and the opening of the Rosebel gold mine, a surge in capital goods imports for the
mining sector are estimated to have increased the current account deficit to 16 percent of
GDP in 2005.7 These were largely matched by a continued large inflow of foreign direct
investment, and foreign exchange reserves remained at around 1½ months of imports.
10.
The more stable macroeconomic environment has laid the foundation for a
gradual unification of the exchange rate regime. After the successful launch of the
Suriname dollar in January 2004 and the elimination of the spreads between the official and
the free bank/cambios exchange rates, the CBvS has periodically adjusted the official rate in
response to market conditions, while using moral suasion to limit the day-to-day volatility in
the bank/cambios rate.8
11.
The external competitiveness of the non-mining sector has been adversely
affected by the appreciation of the real effective exchange rate. Although the nominal
effective exchange rate has been relatively stable during the past three years, the strength of
mining exports has contributed to domestic price pressures causing the real effective rate to
appreciate by a cumulative 33 percent between January 2002 and October 2005. The limited
competitiveness of the non-mining sector is illustrated by the stagnant agricultural exports
since 2002.

Issues, IMF Country Report No. 05/142 (April 2005).
7

Gross remittances, mainly from the 300,000 Surinamese living in The Netherlands, accounted for about
11 percent of GDP in 2004 and have remained about stable in recent years. However, data collected from the
various money remittance institutions (mostly banks and cambios) are partial and unreliable, and a recent
survey in The Netherlands indicates that remittances could be underestimated by about 3-4 percent of GDP.
8

The official rate is determined by the CBvS. It is only used for government debt service and for tax payments
by mining companies, which are paid in foreign currency and constitute the main source of CBvS international
reserves. The free bank/cambios rate is determined by commercial banks and foreign exchange houses
(cambios) and accounts for most transactions in the market place. The black market rate became unimportant
after the CBvS eliminated the ceilings and floors for the bank/cambios rate in 2003. There is also a subsidized
official exchange rate for infant formula imports.

12.
Suriname has maintained substantial arrears on bilateral external loans since
the 1990s, despite the country’s relatively comfortable reserve position. At endSeptember 2005, these arrears were the equivalent to US$137 million or 10 percent of GDP,
and were owed mainly to the United States and Brazil. Citing the country’s stable
macroeconomic performance in recent years, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) revised its outlook to
positive in November 2005, but maintained a B- rating on account of the country’s arrears
and weak debt payments record.
13.
Progress on structural reforms has been limited. A key priority identified by the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has been a comprehensive civil service reform,
which would involve reducing staff, overlapping responsibilities, and absenteeism, and
improving recruitment and remuneration policies. The IDB is also supporting efforts to
restructure the three ailing state-owned banks and the introduction of a new investment law.
In addition, efforts are underway to privatize the banana, rice, and saw-mill companies.
III. SHORT-TERM OUTLOOK
14.
The staff’s short-term projection for Suriname is broadly favorable. The
economy is projected to grow by almost 5 percent in 2006 reflecting continued growth in oil
and mining exports. The second-round effects of the recent increase in domestic energy
prices are anticipated to be limited, keeping inflation at about 8 percent in 2006.
15.
Macroeconomic policies are expected to remain disciplined. The central
government deficit is projected to decline to less than 1 percent of GDP in 2006, mainly
reflecting a post-election decline in capital expenditure. Although revenues from oil and
mining exports are expected to fall by about 1½ percent of GDP in the absence of the special
2005 dividends from the state-owned oil company, this would be offset by a rebound in taxes

- 10 -

on domestic fuel consumption.1 The reduced fiscal financing needs of the central government
are expected to contain the growth in the monetary and credit aggregates about in line with
nominal GDP growth.
16.
The 2006 external current account deficit is projected to narrow and external
financing is expected to be ample. In particular, the current account deficit is projected to
decline from around 16 percent of GDP in 2005 to 12 percent, reflecting the effects of
continued growth in alumina production and buoyant gold prices on exports and the impact
of the completion of the major investment projects in the mining industry on capital goods
imports. With continued inflows of foreign direct investment, reserves would increase by
about US$15 million, remaining at around 1½ months of imports by end-2006.
IV. POLICY ISSUES AND DISCUSSIONS
17.
Discussions focused on the importance of maintaining policy discipline and of
developing a consistent and forward-looking macroeconomic policy framework. The
authorities indicated that they were committed to maintaining a tight policy stance to avoid
potentially destabilizing second-round effects of the recent fuel price increase, and that they
would resist pressure to increase expenditure in response to the continued buoyancy in
revenue from the mining and oil sectors. The authorities also agreed on the need to establish
a framework to entrench stable policies, coupled with reforms to limit the impact of global
commodity price fluctuations on fiscal revenue and expenditure, reduce the size of the public
sector, and bolster the competitiveness of the non-mining sector. However, they cautioned
that a measured pace of reform was needed to maintain social consensus.
A. Medium-Term Outlook and Risks
18.
The staff’s medium-term baseline for Suriname is relatively favorable,
reflecting the strength of its natural resources sector. Real GDP growth would ease to
4½ percent, while the primary fiscal surplus would average around 2½ percent of GDP
during 2007–10, taking into account the fiscal impact of existing mining and oil operations.2
This fiscal target appears appropriate in light of the high commodity prices and the
manageable levels of external debt. The current account deficit would narrow only modestly,
reflecting the limited prospects for a pick up in nontraditional exports, but continued foreign
direct investment is expected to finance a small balance of payments surplus. As a result of

1

As in previous years, the 2006 budget envisages a substantial increase of capital expenditure, which is unlikely
to be fully executed.

2

The projection does not incorporate the possible impact of future large-scale new mining projects, but takes
into account the peak in fiscal revenue from present gold mining operations in 2007 and their decline thereafter.

- 11 -

continued primary fiscal surpluses, public sector debt would fall from around 47 percent of
GDP at end-2004 to around 27 percent at end-2010.

Nonetheless, the team noted that Suriname remained vulnerable to shocks,
especially given its dependence on mining and oil exports:
•

External shocks: Although alumina, oil, and gold prices are projected to remain buoyant
over the medium term, exports of these products would represent about 50 percent of
GDP, and the international prices of these commodities have tended to be volatile and
highly correlated.

•

Policy slippages: The current administration has maintained relatively disciplined
policies and has been successful in stabilizing the economy. However, the challenge will
be to ensure that this prudent approach is sustained, especially given Suriname’s history
of highly destabilizing economic policy responses to exogenous shocks.

•

Competitiveness: The strength of the mining and oil sectors is likely to place further
pressure on domestic costs and could complicate the ability of other sectors to remain
competitive, especially in the absence of substantive reforms of the public sector and the
investment and legal environment that have weighed on the economy’s flexibility.

•

Upside opportunities: There is the possibility of additional large-scale foreign direct
investment projects in the mining sector, which would tend to boost growth and improve
Suriname’s longer term balance of payments, especially if the associated increases in
fiscal revenue are managed carefully.

- 12 -

Box 2: Medium-Term Investment Projects
The bauxite sector. Two international mining companies are studying the feasibility of building and operating
a large-scale bauxite and alumina complex in the west of Suriname and an aluminum refinery. The latter project
involves the construction of an aluminum smelter with an annual capacity of about 300,000 metric tons and a
650 MW hydroelectric dam and requires investment in an amount well exceeding the current GDP of Suriname.
Pending the outcome of the feasibility studies, construction could start in 2007
The oil sector. Suriname’s state oil company signed exploitation and production sharing agreements with three
international oil companies in 2004–05, and seismic surveys are underway.
The gold sector and other minerals. While the gold mine in Rosebel is expected to continue its production
through 2014, Canadian and U.S. mining operators are exploring the possibility of new gold mining sites in the
country, and the possibility of establishing nickel and kaolin mines.

20.
Debt sustainability analysis illustrates the country’s vulnerabilities, especially
to fiscal shocks. The primary fiscal balance is projected to remain in a surplus of about
2½ percent of GDP, on average, during 2005–10, but Suriname’s fiscal position has tended to
fluctuate widely during the past decade in response to changes in world commodity prices
and highly destabilizing policy responses to exogenous shocks, as commodity price downcycles were followed by episodes of sharp fiscal expansion. Stylized shocks include:
•

Historical performance: Fiscal policies in the past have tended to be unsustainable, so
setting the key fiscal indicators at their 10-year averages would cause the debt-to-GDP
ratio to rise steadily to 55 percent by 2010.

•

Fiscal shock: A deterioration of the primary fiscal balance of half of one standard
deviation relative to the baseline during 2006–10 would limit the reduction of the debt-toGDP ratio to 42 percent by end-2010, 15 percentage points above the baseline scenario.

•

Output and commodity price shock: A shock to real GDP growth during 2006–10 of
one-half standard deviation relative to the baseline would limit the decline in the debt-toGDP ratio to 37 percent by 2010. Furthermore, a deterioration of alumina, oil, and gold
prices by only one-quarter standard deviation relative to the WEO baseline in 2006–10
would—assuming no corrective policy response—reduce the primary fiscal balance by
about 2 percentage points of GDP in each year during 2006–10 and place the debt-toGDP ratio on a upward path beginning in 2008.

B. Fiscal Policy
21.
The staff welcomed the maintenance of fiscal discipline in recent years and
underscored the importance of resisting pressures to loosen fiscal policy. As illustrated
by the team’s debt sustainability analysis, present policies appeared consistent with the fiscal
position moving gradually into a modest surplus, which would provide a welcome offset to
the stimulus being provided to the economy by the boom in the mining sector and ensure an
improvement in the public debt ratio. The authorities agreed with the team’s medium term
fiscal path and reiterated their intention to maintain a tight control over both current and
capital spending, in particular to resist offering public sector wage increases or offsets to the
recent fuel price increases. The authorities also agreed with the team on the need to refrain
from introducing new constituency-specific investment projects and to rely instead on
bilaterally and multilaterally financed projects, especially in light of the authorities’ limited
implementation capacity.
22.
The authorities and the mission agreed on the need to establish an institutional
basis for reducing revenue and expenditure volatility over the medium term. The team
noted that over a quarter of fiscal revenue was tied to the fortunes of the bauxite, gold, and
oil export sectors leaving the fiscal position highly vulnerable to commodity price shocks.3
An eventual decline in international commodity prices would require a swift adjustment in
public finances. This suggests the possible merits of mechanisms to accumulate windfall
fiscal gains and reduce the dependence of the public finances on revenue from the mining
and oil sectors. Moreover, revenue and expenditure volatility was further amplified by the
domestic fuel tax system and the ineffective budget process. Therefore, discussions centered
on the following issues:
•

Domestic fuel taxes: The team recommended modifying the fuel taxation system
from a de-facto variable residual tax to a specific tax, in order to reduce the
vulnerability of revenues to world prices and to de-politicize fuel prices. The
authorities welcomed the proposal and implemented the staff’s recommendation on
December 1, 2005. It is projected that the new regime will stabilize fiscal revenue
from domestic fuel taxes at around 3½ percent of GDP.

•

Fiscal framework: The authorities agreed with the team that framing annual budget
submissions against a medium-term fiscal plan could provide a more effective tool for
spending control.4 They noted that a number of recent steps had already been taken to
strengthen the fiscal framework. These include initial steps to streamline the budget
procedure, an April 2005 review of tax policy and administration, as well as ongoing
efforts to review the tax and customs legislation and administration and establish a

large taxpayers unit. Moreover, a fiscal responsibility law had been passed that
established a ceiling on public sector debt of 60 percent of GDP and a sub-ceiling on
domestic public sector debt of 15 percent of GDP. The team endorsed these steps but
cautioned that the debt ceilings appeared high, especially given the country’s
vulnerability to exogenous shocks and revenue volatility.5 Moreover, these ceilings
would not represent binding constraint on policies given the staff’s baseline fiscal
projection.
•

Revenue stabilization fund: The mission suggested establishing a revenue
stabilization fund abroad using tax and royalty proceeds from future projects in the
natural resources sector. These types of funds have helped other countries to mitigate
fiscal spending and exchange rate pressures in the face of commodity price shocks
and help ensure that revenues from non-renewable resources were shared in an intergenerationally equitable fashion. Mechanisms could be established to ensure a
continued and stable flow from the fund to the budget, e.g., by limiting the flows to
the investment returns earned. The team noted that it would be helpful to have such a
system in place in time to absorb revenue from the possible large-scale mining and
offshore oil projects that were being contemplated in 2007–11. The authorities
acknowledged the possible merits of a revenue stabilization fund and expressed
interest in technical assistance from the Fund on their design and implementation.
23.
The authorities agreed on the need to broaden the revenue base and improve
tax legislation and administration to support non-mining private sector activity.
Following up on the CARTAC and the IDB reviews of the tax system in April 2005, the
authorities agreed that the priorities were to establish a large taxpayers unit, review the tax
and customs legislation and administration, and introduce a broad-based VAT, and they
expressed interest in receiving further technical assistance in these areas. The team also
stressed the importance of strengthening the draft investment law, pointed to the need to
simplify the tax regime and to reduce, streamline, and clearly codify tax exemptions granted
to the private sector. The team also noted that stronger protection of property rights and
dispute settlement procedures would boost confidence in the authorities’ commitment to a
stable and rule-based investment climate.

The September 2003 World Economic Outlook illustrates that developing country debt ratios should fall into
the 20–60 percent range, with the higher end reserved for countries with higher credit ratings and revenue-toGDP ratios, and lower revenue volatility.

Domestic fuel prices had been fixed since March 2003, causing fuel tax revenue to fall from around 4
percent of GDP in 2003 to around 2 percent of GDP in 2004, and leading to subsidies of around
1 percent of GDP during March-August 2005. In September, domestic retail gasoline prices were
raised from US$0.57 to US$1.09 per liter.

The government introduced a new fuel pricing and taxation mechanism effective December 1,
2005. Under the new regime, maximum pump prices are set for each of the three oil-import
companies on the fifth working day of each month, based on the average c.i.f. price of the previous
month of each company. All taxes are incorporated into one single specific tax and are denominated
in U.S. dollars per liter.

- 17 -

24.
The authorities agreed on the need to reduce the size of the public sector.
Efforts toward a comprehensive civil service reform were under way, aimed at increasing
efficiency by restoring a competitive wage scale, eliminating redundancies, and curtailing
widespread abuse such as corruption, patronage, and absenteeism. However, the authorities
underscored that a cautious approach was needed to maintain social cohesion and prevent the
emergence of large-scale unemployment.
25.
The mission called for a comprehensive plan to deal with the large number of
public enterprises and monopolies.14 The authorities responded that they were committed
to strengthening these enterprises, and noted the impending sales of the banana, rice, and
saw-mill companies which, in the former case, had been delayed by the lack of clarity in the
EU banana import regime. The authorities were also attempting to gather information and
improve management practices at other enterprises, including by withholding government
transfers.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
26.
The team underscored the importance of maintaining a firm monetary policy
stance to contain inflation expectations.15 In the past, the authorities had often met price
shocks with accommodative increases in money growth, triggering cycles of cost-push
inflation, depreciation, and financial dollarization. Building on this experience, the mission
underscored the importance of resisting second-round effects from the recent increase in fuel
prices, and encouraged the CBvS to contain growth in monetary aggregates to below nominal
GDP growth.16 The monetary authorities broadly agreed and indicated that they stood ready
to tighten policies if necessary, but suggested that reserve growth, the withdrawal of fiscal
stimulus, and the moderate growth in credit to the private sector pointed to the adequacy of
the demand policy stance.
27.
The team suggested strengthening the monetary policy framework. Especially
against the background of measures already taken to limit the government’s call on central
bank financing, the mission suggested that the CBvS’s ability to meet its mandate for price
stability could be improved by the following steps:
•

Monetary anchor: In the mission’s view, the limits that have been placed on CBvS
financing of the central government and the introduction of greater exchange rate

14

See a list of public enterprises, which includes social foundations and associations, in the accompanying
Statistical Appendix paper.
15

Monetary policy instruments consist of reserve requirements on domestic and foreign currency deposits,
CBvS credit to the government, and—to a limited extent—the management of Treasury bills by the CBvS.

16

The two near-hyperinflation episodes in the 1990s were preceded by substantial increases in the broad money
to GDP ratio. A staff estimate of a three-variable vector-autoregression (broad-money growth, inflation, and
exchange rate depreciation) over the period 1988-2004 suggests that a 1 percent increase in broad money is
associated with a 1.1 percentage point increase in inflation. The estimate is statistically significant.

- 18 -

flexibility provided scope for anchoring monetary policy more firmly on a preannounced target for a monetary aggregate. The mission noted that this would require
the CBvS to maintain firm control over its NDA, since the CBvS’s reserve position
was largely determined by tax payments in foreign currency by the mining and oil
sectors. However, the authorities did not feel there was sufficient institutional
capacity at present to put in place a more formal and announced monetary target.
•

Reserve requirements: The mission cautioned against using reserve requirements as
an instrument of social policy, and recommended a gradual elimination of mortgages
from the list of approved reserve assets. The team suggested that any incentives for
construction activity or for lending to low-income households should be delivered
transparently through the budget. However, the authorities felt it politically
inopportune to modify the subsidy mechanism at this time.

•

New monetary policy instruments: The mission recommended the gradual
introduction of indirect instruments, such as open market operations and rediscount
and overdraft facilities, and reducing the CBvS’s reliance on adjustments to reserve
requirements to achieve its policy objectives. The authorities welcomed the team’s
analysis of the Treasury bill market and indicated their intention to gradually modify
the bills’ yields to render them more market-determined and thereby improve their
use as an indirect policy instrument.

28.
The mission recommended moving to a unified and more flexible exchange rate
regime. 17 While welcoming the steps that led to the convergence of exchange rates and
greater exchange rate flexibility, the team noted Suriname’s poor track record in maintaining
a free and market-determined exchange rate in parallel with measures to improve liquidity
management. Therefore, the mission reiterated its recommendation to adopt the
bank/cambios daily rate as the official rate. This would facilitate greater exchange rate
flexibility, which was preferable given Suriname’s position as a commodities’ exporter, its
vulnerability to terms of trade shocks, and the relative inflexibility of its domestic labor and
product markets.18 The elimination of a possible divergence by more than 2 percent between
the two rates would also eliminate this multiple currency practice. Similarly, the mission
suggested the elimination of the special exchange rate for infant formula imports in favor of
direct budgetary subsidies.

17

Suriname accepted the obligations under Article VIII, sections 2, 3 and 4, but maintains multiple currency
practices subject to Fund approval. These arise from (i) the absence of a mechanism to prevent a possible
deviation of more than 2 percent between the official exchange rate used for government transactions and the
market-determined bank/cambios rate and (ii) the preferential exchange rate for infant formula imports.
18

The adoption of the bank/cambios rate as the official rate would not likely affect the exchange rate level or
the pace of reserve accumulation by the central bank, given that the bank/cambios rate accounts for about
83 percent of all foreign exchange transactions and the official rate is used only for government debt service and
tax payments by mining companies, or about 17 percent of all foreign exchange transactions.

- 19 -

29.
The authorities were reluctant to consider the mission’s recommendation at
this stage. They argued that the official rate played an important role in anchoring
expectations in the free market. They were also of the view that the CBvS would need to
continue to exercise moral suasion to minimize fluctuations in the free bank/cambios rate,
that could undermine the competitiveness of the non-mining sector, but they reiterated their
commitment to adjust the official rate to any fundamental movement in the bank/cambios
rate. However, they expressed interest in technical assistance to draft a new foreign exchange
law to facilitate and liberalize foreign exchange transactions at commercial banks.
D. Financial Sector, Structural, and Other Issues
30.
A number of indicators in the financial sector point to possible vulnerabilities.
The staff suggested a number of particular areas of concern:
•

Non-performing loans: The recent increase in non-performing loans is attributable
to a few large corporate insolvencies and cases of fraud. The staff recommended
increased efforts to strengthen banks’ risk assessment capabilities and limit further
exposure.

•

Weak supervision: This reflects inadequate staff resources, delays in data collection
to monitor compliance, and inadequate controls to prevent money laundering,
particularly among the large number of casinos and the unregulated foreign exchange
houses. The staff recommended strengthening money-laundering controls and
prudential regulations, particularly for the non-bank system. The authorities
expressed interest in receiving technical assistance in this area.

•

State-owned banks: There are three small state-owned banks that provide credit to
low-income households for agriculture and housing under mostly social criteria.
Since these institutions were insolvent, the mission encouraged the authorities to
follow the IDB’s recommendations and liquidate these banks in order to maximize
the salvage value of their assets.

•

Dollarization: The staff cautioned that dollarization exposed the banking system to
balance sheet risks. The authorities responded that the decline in the loan
dollarization ratio was a sign of improved risk assessment by banks, but they agreed
with the mission’s recommendation to strengthen banking supervision in these areas.

31.
The mission urged the authorities to normalize relations with external creditors
and eliminate payment arrears. External debt is high but appears manageable and
legislation to limit public borrowing and the establishment of the Suriname Debt
Management Office (SDMO) have improved transparency, data management, and intergovernmental coordination and information sharing. However, Suriname’s erratic payment
record and long-standing arrears to bilateral creditors (US$137 million in September 2005)
have weighed on Suriname’s credit rating and access to export credit facilities. The
authorities acknowledged these costs and noted that they were beginning to address the issue
of bilateral payment arrears.

- 20 -

32.
Suriname has a relatively open trade system, but the team noted that the policy
environment could weigh on private investment. In particular, Suriname’s simple average
rate tariff is estimated at 11 percent and there are no significant non-tariff barriers. Suriname
has also enacted the CARICOM Single Market and Economy Treaty and implemented the
fourth phase of the common external tariff (a maximum of 20 percent for non-agricultural
goods and 40 percent for agricultural goods). However, the mission observed that investment
and tax legislation, pricing regulations, and public sector monopolies and state enterprises
create barriers to foreign direct investment and hinder the development of the non-mining
private sector.
33.
There are serious data reporting problems in Suriname. Notwithstanding the
accession to the GDDS and improvements in the coverage and timeliness of monetary data,
there are severe shortcomings in the quality, coverage, and provision of economic statistics,
in particular with respect to national accounts and trade data.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The authorities have successfully maintained a welcomed degree of
macroeconomic stability over the past years. Continued expenditure moderation and
higher tax revenue supported by buoyant export growth have resulted in a substantial
improvement in the public finances. Fiscal discipline, supported by a cautious monetary
policy stance and a favorable external environment, has helped reduce inflation expectations
and stabilize the exchange rate, while supporting a solid growth performance.
35.
Nonetheless, Suriname faces important challenges. While the near-term outlook
appears favorable, the monetary and fiscal authorities will need to resist second-round effects
from the recent sharp increases in fuel prices, including pressures to grant compensatory
salary increases or subsidies. Over the medium term, the strength of the mining sector will
continue to affect the competitiveness of the non-mining sector and the fiscal position and the
overall economy will remain vulnerable to global price shocks. Therefore, further
improvements in fiscal and monetary policy institutions are needed to help insulate the
economy from the effects of commodity price and other shocks, coupled with structural
reforms to reduce the size of the public sector and bolster the competitiveness of non-mining
industries.
36.
The authorities have already taken important steps to strengthen the fiscal
framework, but there remains substantial scope for further improvements. The
modification of the domestic fuel tax and pricing system has helped reduce the vulnerability
of revenue to fluctuations in world oil prices, but the fiscal position is still highly dependent
on the bauxite, gold, and oil export sectors. Placing tax revenue from future large-scale
mining investments in a stabilization fund abroad would help mitigate budget and exchange
rate pressures that have proven highly destabilizing in the past and assist in ensuring intergenerational equity. On the expenditure side, civil service reform will be critical for reducing
the size and improving the efficiency of the large public sector, and the authorities are urged

- 21 -

to advance the IDB-supported project in this area. Framing annual budget discussions in the
context of a medium-term policy framework would also help ensure that annual budgets
provide a more credible and effective tool for spending control.
37.
In addition, there is scope for strengthening the monetary policy framework. In
the past, monetary policy has been largely determined by the financing needs of the central
government, with limited regard for inflation or macroeconomic stability. Coupled with the
establishment of a medium-term fiscal framework and measures to reduce fiscal volatility,
the central bank should anchor monetary policy more firmly on a well-defined and preannounced target for a monetary aggregate to signal a strong commitment to price stability.
This would be coupled with the introduction of more indirect policy instruments, such as
open market operations and rediscount and overdraft facilities.
38.
The authorities should move quickly to a unified and more flexible exchange
rate regime. The authorities have taken steps that led to the convergence of exchange rates
and greater exchange rate flexibility, while policy stability has diminished depreciation
expectations. The authorities are urged to seize this opportunity to move to a unified and
floating exchange rate regime by adopting the daily commercial rate as the official exchange
rate, which would also eliminate one of the multiple currency practices. The staff does not
recommend Fund approval of the multiple currency practices that Suriname maintains in
view of the absence of a clear timetable for their elimination.
39.
The authorities are urged to normalize relations with external creditors and
eliminate payment arrears. Although debt levels are manageable, Suriname’s erratic
payment record and long-standing arrears to bilateral creditors have undermined the
country’s creditworthiness and impeded access to export credit coverage.
40.
The non-mining private sector needs opportunities to generate sustainable
employment and income growth. In this respect, the authorities are encouraged to revise
the investment law to simplify licensing procedures, promote a more stable and rule-based
climate for investment, and limit and clarify tax exemptions. It will also be important to
establish a comprehensive plan to improve the efficiency of state-owned companies and
encourage non-mining private sector activity, including privatizing the banana, rice, and sawmill companies, and closing the small insolvent state-owned banks.
41.
There are serious data reporting problems in Suriname. There are severe
shortcomings in the quality, coverage, and provision of economic statistics, in particular with
respect to national accounts and trade data, which have hampered the timeliness and accuracy
of economic analysis and planning, and the authorities are urged to improve the provision
and accuracy of statistics.
42.
The staff proposes that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ For commercial banks data, a new data compilation method in line with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual was adopted from May 2002 onward,
resulting in an irreconcilable data break. Therefore, pre- and post-2002 data are not comparable. Figures involving percentage changes in 2002 over 2001 are
calculated on basis of estimates for end-2002 data as according to the old methodology, to achieve compatibility with data prior to May 2002.
2/ Foreign currency deposits in percent of total commercial bank deposits.
3/ Foreign currency credit in percent of total private sector credit by commercial banks.
4/ Excludes commercial bank use of required reserves for mortgage lending

1/ Public sector debt covers the central government. Public external debt is on a gross basis. Public domestic debt held by the domestic banking system is on a net basis.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).

Nonfinancial Relations with the Authorities

Exchange rate arrangements
The national currency is the Surinamese dollar (SRD), which replaced the Surinamese
guilder in January 2004 at a conversion rate of 1,000 guilders per SRD. The central bank uses

- 33 -

an official exchange rate of SRD 2.75 per U.S. dollar for government debt service and tax
payments by mining companies and a special rate of SRD 1.4 per U.S. dollar for baby milk
powder imports. Most transactions take place at a commercial bank/cambio rate. In June
2004, the central bank removed the ceiling and the floor on this rate, which had previously
been set at SRD 2.8 and 2.6 per U.S. dollar respectively. Since then, the commercial
bank/cambio rate has traded between SRD 2.8 and 2.71 per U.S. dollar and the central bank
has not intervened.
Last Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on March 25, 2005
(IMF Country Report No. 05/143). Suriname is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.
Participation in the GDDS
In July 2004, the IMF officially announced Suriname’s formal participation in the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS).
Technical Assistance since 2004
STA:
•

(MAB)—A follow-up mission from the Money and Banking Division of the
Statistical Department visited Suriname in February 2005 to address issues on
reporting of commercial banks’ data.

•

(GDDS)—A GDDS mission visited Suriname in March of 2004 to assist authorities
in preparing their meta-data.

•

(MAB)—A mission from the Money and Banking Division of the Statistical
Department visited Suriname in January 8, 2001 to make recommendations for
improving the compilation and reporting of Banking Statistics, particularly, those of
the central bank, and to complete a diagnostic study of the Banking system. A followup mission visited Paramaribo in February 2005.

Consents and acceptances: Quota increase approved.
Resident Representative: None.

APPENDIX II

I. SURINAME: RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
AND THE WORLD BANK GROUP
A. Inter-American Development Bank
Suriname joined the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in 1980. Since then, the IDB
has approved 16 loans to Suriname amounting to US$103.4 million and 100 technical
cooperation operations totaling US$29.7 million.
The IDB is the major multilateral lender operating in Suriname at this time. The other main
sources of financing for public sector investment are The Netherlands and the European
Union. As of December 2005, Suriname’s outstanding debt to the IDB stood at
US$41.1 million, mostly on Intermediate Fund Financing (IFF) terms.
Bank strategy in Suriname is outlined in the Suriname Country Strategy. The current version
was approved in 2000. Based on the premise that Suriname’s development is constrained by
a deficient policy and institutional framework, the main thrust of the IDB strategy since 2000
has been to support policy and institutional reforms as the basis for promoting private-sectorled-growth. In addition, this approach has been followed with the help of an active Technical
Cooperation program. A new country strategy is being prepared for Board approval in for
consideration in the first half of 2006.
Structural reform projects
Public sector. In June 2004, the IDB approved a US$5 million loan to Suriname to support
the strengthening of public sector management, which is considered a critical element of
institutional reform in the country, given the large size and importance of the public sector.
The loan is complemented by TC (technical cooperation) to elaborate a road map, which will
help to guide implementation of the public sector reform project. The road map should be
ready in 2006, and will guide future IDB supported activities designed to modernize the state.
Banking system. The authorities are working with the IDB to develop a reform and
rationalization of the state banks. To this end, the IDB approved in May 2003 a technical
cooperation project (Financial Sector Strengthening and Rationalization—US$500,000) that
will support a financial evaluation of the state banks and identify reform options. If
authorities decide to pursue a reform strategy consistent with sound financial and public
policy criteria, the project would also finance the development of a detailed implementation
plan that could be executed with IDB financial support through a subsequent loan program.

- 35 -

Financial relations (as of December 2005)
At present, 8 loan projects are in execution amounting to US$55.7 million in IDB
contribution and 17 technical cooperation projects in execution with total IDB contributions
of US$7.7 million. The undisbursed portion of the loan portfolio in execution is entirely on
OC terms with IFF subsidy.

The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) of the IFC completed a report in April
2003 that outlined recommendations on how to structure and improve the country's new
investment initiative, including the 2001 Investment Law and the investment promotion
agency InvestSur. A workshop to present the findings was held in Paramaribo in July 2003.
The Government requested a follow-up report on fiscal incentives, amendments to the
Investment Law, and setting up of the Investment Promotion Agency, which was delivered to
the Government in October 2004, and subsequently presented at a workshop.

APPENDIX III

SURINAME—STATISTICAL ISSUES
OVERVIEW
The quality and timeliness of economic statistics has somewhat improved over the past two
years. The authorities have worked with STA to improve national accounts, monetary, and
balance of payments statistics. Suriname started participating in the GDDS in June 2004, and
its metadata are posted on the IMF's Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. These provide
information on Suriname’s statistical production and dissemination practices, as well as plans
for improvement. In addition, the newly created Suriname Debt Management Office started
operations in 2004, improving the quality of public debt data. Notwithstanding these
advances, continued effort is required to bring statistics up to a level that is adequate for
policy analysis.
Real Sector
The latest national income accounts data are 2002. Preliminary estimates for 2003 became
available in late-2004, but without the details on informal sector activity.
Some efforts were made to improve the GDP data by production approach. The constant
price series were rebased to 1990 and the estimates in the different economic sectors are now
based on indicator variables. However, indicators of sectoral activities still suffer from poor
response rates to questionnaires.
There are no national accounts by expenditure approach and no labor statistics. There is also
no reconciliation between the national accounts and the balance of payments data.
The production and dissemination of Suriname’s consumer price index (CPI) was disrupted
by the temporary cessation of work by the General Statistics Bureau (ABS) due to a fire
(June 2003 - March 2004). In the absence of data collection and processing, it will not be
possible to publish those monthly data or annual figures for 2003 and 2004.
Public Finances
The only public sector financial data available are those for the central government. In
addition, a substantial amount of additional information is needed to derive an accurate
picture of the fiscal accounts. With respect to revenue, data are collected on a cash basis by
the Inland Revenue Department and the Nontax Revenue Division. There is a Central
Paymaster Department that also provides revenue and expenditure data on a cash basis,
which is used by the Central Bank of Suriname (CBvS) to furnish a statement of central
government operations, (produced daily, weekly, and monthly) and these, in turn, are the
basis for the liquidity report on revenue and expenditure prepared by the Ministry of Finance
(MoF). Some capital expenditure items are recorded by the Central Paymaster, but the
majority of them seem to be recorded only at the ministerial level. As there are also no

- 37 -

centralized records for receipts of external grants, capital expenditure has to be inferred from
partial donor information.
As the estimates for revenue and expenditure components can differ significantly among the
MoF, the Treasury department, the CBvS, and the Central Paymaster data, the authorities
have begun the process of streamlining the system of fiscal reporting, improving the
reconciliation process and standardizing the reporting format. There is a pressing need for
standardization of expenditure by economic classification and more coordination between the
MoF and other ministries for GFS compilation and reporting, as well as between the MoF
and the central bank. Since 1991, no data on central government operations have been
published in the IFS and no data are reported for publication in the GFSY.
For the rest of the public sector, the collection of comprehensive and consistent financial data
remains a challenge. The Netherlands has recently provided technical assistance in this area.
The actual number of public enterprises remains unknown, and estimated at 120 companies,
but some are dormant, others are social associations (for the blind, handicapped, etc.) and
many of them are small enterprises.19 Most of them do not produce accounts on a timely
basis and their impact on fiscal operations, domestic credit and employment is not known
with any certainty.
Statistics on public external debt and external payment arrears suffer from non-transparent
reporting procedures across ministries. However, the startup of the Suriname Debt
Management Office in 2004 has helped centralize the flow and quality of data.
Monetary Accounts
An STA mission visited Suriname in January 2001 to advise on the country’s reporting
format on monetary data, to help prepare a template for more transparent accounting of the
assets and liabilities of the CBvS, and to advise on ways to prepare and promote a faster and
more accurate dissemination of monetary data. In response to the mission’s
recommendations, data on central bank activities are reported with lags of less than a month
since mid-2001. The quality of the accounts makes them suitable for publication in IFS.
To address remaining difficulties with the reporting of commercial banks’ data, STA
missions visited Suriname in September 2001 and February 2005. The missions helped
design new report forms to allow a proper sectorization of the accounts. The quality and
periodicity of the reported data has improved significantly as a result of these missions and
the time-lag was reduced to two months.

Balance of Payments
The balance of payments data are still prepared on a cash basis in Suriname. While trade data
are relatively reliable, data on services and capital inflows suffer from poor compilation
systems and procedures, misclassification, and poor procedures of reconciliation. In addition,
the ABS does not provide a sufficiently detailed breakdown of merchandise exports by
products and destination. During October 2002, a STA technical assistance mission assessed
progress in improving balance of payments compilation consistent with the Balance of
Payments Manual Fifth Edition (BMP5), and to design new survey and reporting formats that
would allow for detailed BPM5 classifications. A GDDS mission that visited Suriname in
March 2004 found that little progress had been made in implementing the recommendations,
although a proposed revision to the CBvS Act on compulsory reporting of statistical
information to the CBvS was approved by Parliament on May 20, 2005.
ADEQUACY OF DATA PROVISION TO THE FUND FOR SURVEILLANCE PURPOSES
Data provision can generally be considered inadequate for surveillance purposes. There are
serious shortcomings in the areas of the expenditure breakdown of national accounts, exports,
and informal sector activity, which significantly hinders staff’s analysis and hampers the
development of a reliable quantitative medium-term policy framework:
•

Real sector performance. Poor collection and presentation methodologies and long
delays in the provision of data compound the lack of data on the informal sector and
seriously undermine the accuracy of GDP estimates.

•

Saving-investment balances. As an expenditure breakdown of national accounts is
unavailable, the estimate of saving and investment balances relies largely on balance
of payments data, rendering problematic the estimation of private investment.

•

Public finances. A substantial amount of additional information is needed to derive
an accurate and timely picture of the fiscal position.

•

Exports. The lack of detailed data on exports by goods and destination requires
trading partner country inferences of exports and renders timely and accurate analysis
difficult.

SURINAME: TABLE OF COMMON INDICATORS REQUIRED FOR SURVEILLANCE

- 39 -

Statement by Eduardo Loyo, Executive Director for Suriname
and Ketleen Florestal, Advisor to Executive Director
February 24, 2006
1.
On behalf of our Surinamese authorities, we would like to thank staff for a candid
report. Staff has provided useful and timely policy advice to the Minister of Finance and to
the Governor of the CBvS and its suggestions continue to serve as valuable inputs in the
decision making process. We take this opportunity to also thank management for technical
support given to Suriname, particularly in improving the reporting of data to the Central
Bank.
2.
The coalition government, which was confirmed for a second term in the 2005
elections, has established a track record of good macroeconomic management. Salient
features include enhanced confidence, sustained growth, and a stable exchange rate.
Recognizing the strengthened macroeconomic framework, last November Standard and
Poor’s revised to positive its outlook for Suriname (while keeping its rating at B-). The
authorities’ commitment to maintaining stability and promoting growth is steadfast and the
reelection of the coalition government should renew opportunities to carry forward structural
reforms. The coalition government has repeatedly shown its determination to undertake
difficult measures and it strongly believes that successful outcomes are achieved only with
adequate timing of reforms and the appropriate level of social and political consensus. It has
resisted yielding to pressures calling for salary adjustments both during the period preceding
the elections and following the adjustment in fuel prices.
3.
In 2005, growth reached 5 percent, propelled by a buoyant mining sector. Favorable
prices in the alumina and gold markets and continued FDI inflows allowed for the
strengthening of NIRs and the reduction of external debt. As a result of prudent fiscal
management and increased petroleum revenues following the authorities’ decision to increase
the retail prices of fuel, the fiscal deficit declined from 2.9 percent of GDP in 2004 to 1
percent of GDP in 2005. The current account deficit tripled mostly as a result of a spike in
capital goods imports associated with large investment projects financed by FDI. The latter
increased by 29 percent in 2005, reaching 13.8 percent of GDP. The increase in fuel prices
had a significant impact on inflation, which increased from 9 percent in 2004 to 15.8 percent
in 2005. With the tightening of fiscal policy reinforced by a prudent monetary policy stance,
inflation pressures should remain contained in 2006. In fact, there are preliminary indications
that second round effects of the petroleum price adjustments have been limited.
4.
The financial sector is robust. Capital adequacy ratios in the banking sector have
increased and financial dollarization has been checked following the gradual increase of
reserve requirements on foreign currency liabilities and the consolidation of prudent
monetary and fiscal policies. Efforts to strengthen bank supervision and increase the
efficiency in the conduct of monetary policy will need to be carefully phased in and
prioritized in light of the limited availability of human resources and the incipient state
of policy instruments at the disposal of the CBvS. The monetary authorities are seeking

-2assistance from the IMF to strengthen supervision and further develop the Treasury bill
market.
5.
Our authorities believe that the exchange rate system in place has served the
country well and that the official central bank rate provides economic agents with a
trustworthy and stable indicator of the evolution of the foreign exchange market. Since
the spread between the market and official rate has generally remained under 2 percent, they
do not believe that the publication of the official exchange rate creates disturbances in the
foreign exchange market. As a result, the CBvS has no immediate plans to adopt the free
bank/cambios rates as the official exchange rate. Nevertheless, they would welcome
technical assistance to draft a more liberal foreign exchange legislation.
6.
Suriname is committed to regularizing its obligations to bilateral creditors. It has
recently eliminated arrears with Japan and is pursuing discussions with Brazil and Italy. The
establishment of the Suriname Debt Management Office (SDMO) has enhanced the capacity
of the government to manage its debt.
7.
In spite of the political complexities it entails, in September 2005 the authorities
decided - as they had announced last year - to adjust by a factor of around two the
prices of petroleum products in order to strengthen the fiscal position and to allow for a
more efficient allocation of resources. Subsequently, an increase in electricity tariffs was
adopted in order to allow the electric company (EBS) to cover the additional costs of fuel. In
order to further reduce the vulnerability of the public finances to the variation in international
oil prices, a flexible pricing and a new taxation mechanism were also adopted. Price ceilings
are now fixed every month based on monthly averages of oil import costs plus taxation,
which has been transformed into a unique specific tax denominated in US dollars.
8.
There is general consensus among all political forces on the need to undertake a
civil service reform. In order to achieve a successful and durable outcome, the Government
is of the view that the process of civil service reform has to be inscribed in the larger
framework of the Public Sector Reform (PSR), for which an implementation unit has been
created within the Ministry of Finance. This unit is presently coordinating the creation of the
roadmap for the PSR due to be presented to the Government within the next three months.
9.
The privatization of key SOEs is also an important priority. The negotiation for
the sale of the Bruynzeel Suriname Timber Company (BSH) is being led by a cluster of
ministries and is at an advanced stage. The privatization process of the SML is also well
advanced and the government expects to conclude negotiations within the next six months.
10.
Another key reform concerns the restructuring of the tax administration. With
assistance from the IADB and CARTAC and drawing on the Jamaican experience, the
Ministry of Finance is working on the creation of a new Tax Authority. The model being
envisaged is one in which the revenue authority could be lifted out of the civil service in
order to attract well-trained and experienced experts with competitive salaries and benefits.
The hiring of new staff will have to be accompanied by training, the creation of new

-3infrastructure, and the upgrading of information technology. The implementation process is
estimated to take approximately two years.
11.
A comprehensive review of the tax regime was completed in April 2005 with the
assistance of the IADB and CARTAC. The implementation of recommended reforms will
require substantial technical support, including for the review of tax and customs legislation
and the introduction of a broad-based VAT. Also, technical assistance is being requested
from the IADB and CARTAC to strengthen budgetary policy and public financial
management. Additional assistance is needed to perform a needs assessment for improving
financial management and communication among government institutions.
12.
Suriname is vulnerable to external shocks on account of its high degree of openness
(imports plus exports reached more than 150 percent of GDP in 2005) and high level of
export concentration. Reforms currently under study to strengthen the economy’s
resilience to external shocks are geared towards facilitating an efficient and sustainable
use of natural resources and promoting diversification by enhancing private sector
competitiveness. The creation of a revenue stabilization fund as a means to ensure continued
and stable increases in fiscal revenues and avoid exchange rate volatility is currently under
discussion within the Government. A new investment law and revisions to the income tax
law through the formulation of a new “umbrella law” to promote private investment have
been drafted and are expected to be presented to the Council of Ministers within the next
month. Also, a new law on withholding taxes on interest, royalties, and similar payments is
to be presented to the Cabinet. The drafting of these pieces of legislation has been undertaken
with active participation of the private sector.
13.
Under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance, a committee is working with
the private sector to improve the investment climate. A law on the Suriname Business
Forum has been drafted with the involvement of the private sector and the Ministries of
Trade and Industry, of Planning, and of Finance. The draft law is currently with the State
Council and is expected to be sent to the National Assembly for approval very soon.
14.
Growth is projected to remain strong in 2006 and beyond, fueled by the
expansion of mining activities as well as alumina and oil production. Two recent
undertakings are noteworthy. First, the exploration and production agreement signed with
Occidental Petroleum in October of 2005. The company will invest about $350 million in
exploration and possible production of crude oil and Suriname will earn 6.25 percent in
royalties from gross production and 36 percent in income taxes. Negotiations have also been
initiated with BHP Biliton and Suralco for the mining and processing of bauxite into alumina
in the Bakhuys area.
15.
The official launching in January 2006 of the Caribbean Single Market
Economy (CSME) and the phasing out of preferences for exports of rice and banana to
the EU pose new challenges for the public and private sectors. To face these challenges,
the government believes that improving the business climate, including the legal
environment, is crucial. In December 2005, it obtained from the IADB a $4 million loan to
strengthen the country’s technical and institutional capacity to formulate, negotiate, and

-4implement trade policy and related agreements. As part of the preparations for the loan, the
IADB assisted the government in reviewing the draft law establishing the Bureau of
Standards. The latter was approved by the National Assembly last week. The IADB is also
assisting the Government in defining a trade strategy as a basis for future activities under the
loan program. The CSME has the potential to create new markets for Surinamese products
and attract advanced technology, know-how and capital.
16.
Our authorities are fully cognizant of the limitations of the statistical base, as
this weakens their ability to monitor adequately the evolution of key macro economic
indicators and to evaluate effectively the policies being implemented. Several factors
hinder the production of reliable statistics. The poor flow of information within and across
governmental entities, lack of trained human resources, and the reluctance of certain sectors
to participate in surveys are important limiting hurdles. The CBvS Act of May 2005, which
includes provisions relative to the compulsory reporting of statistical information to the
Central Bank, should enhance its ability to produce timely BOP accounts. The authorities are
appreciative of the valuable assistance the Fund has been providing both through the
Statistics Department and through training by the IMF Institute. Nevertheless, as staff
underscores, several shortcomings remain, particularly in the production of data on real
sector activity, exports of services and capital inflows. Additional help in this area is being
sought from the Netherlands, the IADB, and CARTAC.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 06/39
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 10, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Suriname
On February 24, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Suriname.1
Background
Suriname is benefiting from the global boom in commodity prices and from increased mining
output. Real GDP increased by 8 percent in 2004 and by around 5 percent in 2005, boosted by
the opening of a new gold mine and investment in the alumina and bauxite sector. Inflation
moderated to 9 percent in 2004, partly reflecting the effects of exchange rate stability, but is
estimated to have risen to about 17 percent in 2005, largely as a result of a doubling of
domestic fuel prices in September 2005.
The strong growth has been supported by a cautious macroeconomic policy stance. The central
government overall deficit declined from around 3 percent of GDP in 2004 to an estimated
1 percent of GDP in 2005. This improvement resulted from a substantial increase in revenue
from the oil sector, which more than offset higher capital expenditure during the pre-election
period, and revenue losses from delays in adjusting domestic fuel prices. Reflecting the lower
financing needs of the government, fiscal financing by the central bank declined from about
1 percent of GDP in 2004 to ½ percent in 2005. Although reserve requirements have been
lowered on domestic currency deposits since mid-2004, private sector credit growth has
moderated as liquidity has been sterilized by a larger issuance of Treasury bills.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.
1

-2–
The external current account deficit has remained large. A surge in capital goods imports for the
mining sector increased the current account deficit to 16 percent of GDP in 2005 from around
5 percent of GDP in 2004. These were largely matched by a continued large inflow of foreign
direct investment, and foreign exchange reserves were maintained at around 1½ months of
imports.
The near-term outlook remains favorable, owing to the strength of global commodity prices and
the impact of recent and ongoing investment in the extractive industries. The economy is
projected to grow by almost 5 percent, and inflation would ease to about 8 percent. The current
account deficit is projected to decline from around 16 percent of GDP in 2005 to 12 percent,
reflecting the effects of continued growth in alumina production and buoyant gold prices on
exports, and the impact of the completion of the major investment projects in the mining industry
on capital goods imports.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Suriname authorities for their successful macroeconomic
management over the past years. Fiscal discipline, supported by a cautious monetary policy
and a favorable external environment, has helped reduce inflation expectations and stabilize the
exchange rate, while underpinning buoyant economic growth.
Directors agreed that the near-term outlook for Suriname appears favorable, especially in view
of the strength of global prices for the country’s commodity exports. Nonetheless, maintaining
macroeconomic stability in the past has proven difficult, especially in the face of external
shocks. Directors underscored the importance of containing pressures on domestic prices and
competitiveness by resisting second-round effects from the recent increases in fuel prices.
They cautioned, in particular, against granting compensatory salary increases or subsidies that
would exacerbate cost-push pressures. Over the medium term, Suriname would benefit from
establishing firmer anchors for fiscal and monetary policies, reducing the size of the public
sector, and bolstering the competitiveness of the non-mining sectors.
Directors commended the important steps that have already been taken to strengthen the fiscal
framework, including the new Fiscal Responsibility Law. They welcomed the recent modification
of the domestic fuel tax and pricing system, which will reduce the vulnerability of fiscal revenue
to fluctuations in world oil prices. Directors noted that historically volatile prices for Suriname’s
bauxite, gold, and oil exports—on which the budget relies for a large part of its revenues—have
complicated budgetary management. To cushion the impact of export price changes on the
budget, Directors supported building up a stabilization fund, by investing the increased royalty
and tax revenues expected from future large-scale investments in extractive activities in an
internationally diversified portfolio. The stabilization fund would also help mitigate exchange rate
pressures, and facilitate the equitable intergenerational sharing of revenues from finite
resources. On the expenditure side, Directors underscored the importance of the envisaged civil
service reform to reduce the size and improve the efficiency of the public sector. They urged the
authorities to set the annual budget discussions in a medium-term policy framework.

-3–
Directors recommended a strengthening of the monetary and exchange rate policy framework.
In particular, they suggested that, once sufficient institutional capacity is in place, establishing a
defined and pre-announced target for a monetary aggregate would help anchor policies and
send an important signal of the authorities’ commitment to price stability. At the same time,
they encouraged the authorities to reduce their reliance on reserve requirements as their
principal policy instrument, and to instead strengthen the role of indirect instruments such as
open market operations. Directors welcomed the convergence of the official and bank/cambio
exchange rates and the willingness to permit greater exchange rate flexibility. They urged the
authorities to take advantage of the present favorable environment to adopt the marketdetermined commercial rate as the official exchange rate, thereby unifying the regime.
Directors noted that the financial sector is generally sound, and welcomed the improvement in
bank capital adequacy ratios. At the same time, they recommended that efforts be strengthened
to bolster bank risk assessment capabilities with a view to reducing the level of nonperforming
loans. There is room to improve bank supervision and prudential regulation, including the
assessment of potential balance sheet risks related to the high degree of dollarization of the
banking system. Directors called for the implementation of more effective anti-money laundering
controls. They supported the authorities’ request for technical assistance from the Fund to
strengthen financial sector supervision and to develop the Treasury bill market, and encouraged
them to consider participation in the Financial Sector Assessment Program.
Directors stressed the importance of normalizing relations with external creditors and
eliminating payment arrears, noting that Suriname’s long-standing arrears to bilateral creditors
undermine the country’s creditworthiness and impede its access to export credit coverage.
Directors considered that structural reforms will be key to enabling the non-mining private sector
to provide sustainable employment and income growth. Efforts should be enhanced to simplify
licensing procedures, promote a more stable and rule-based climate for investment, and limit
and clarify tax exemptions. The efficiency of a large number of state-owned enterprises needs
to be raised, and consideration given to their corporatization or privatization. Directors
welcomed efforts to privatize the banana, rice, and sawmill companies, and to deal with the
small insolvent state-owned banks.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve the provision and accuracy of statistics,
in particular with respect to national accounts and trade data.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
