IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation
with the Kingdom of Lesotho

On January 29, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with the Kingdom of Lesotho, and considered and
endorsed the staff appraisal on a lapse-of-time basis2.
Real GDP growth averaged about 4.5 percent a year from 2010 to 2014, before dipping to an
estimated 2.6 percent in 2015, mainly reflecting recent weaknesses in the manufacturing and
construction sectors and spillovers from slower growth in neighboring South Africa. At the
same time, unemployment rates have remained high, especially among the youth, and the
incidence of poverty is virtually unchanged from a decade ago. Most health, education, and
social indicators have shown little or no improvement, even with considerable government
spending in these areas (about 30 percent of GDP a year). Looking ahead, real GDP growth
is projected to remain about 2.5-3.0 percent in 2016, but could be lower depending on the
severity of the current drought. Inflation is expected to remain moderate at around
5-6 percent, despite rising food prices and the recent depreciation of the South African rand.
Overall Government expenditures remain comparatively high. Government expenditures
have amounted to about 60 percent of GDP or more in recent years, with spending becoming
increasingly slanted toward recurrent expenditures. The government wage bill rose to
21.5 percent of GDP in 2014/153—the highest in sub-Saharan Africa—and is budgeted to
increase to 23 percent of GDP in the current fiscal year. Lesotho relies heavily on revenues
from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) for government financing, but these

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

revenues have been highly volatile. After a sharp drop in 2010/11-2011/12, SACU revenues
rebounded to an average of about 29 percent of GDP a year over the following three years.
The rebound in SACU revenues contributed to Lesotho’s recovery from a severe fiscal crisis
and supported the rebuilding of fiscal and external buffers, with official international reserves
reaching 6.3 months of imports by end-March 2015. However, SACU revenues have fallen
once again. After slipping to R 6.6 billion (about 26 percent of GDP) this year, Lesotho’s
allocation will drop sharply to R 4.5 billion (about 16 percent of GDP) in 2016/17, with
much of this decline expected to be long-lasting.
Lesotho’s current business environment has weakened, partly because of political difficulties
around the collapse of the country’s first coalition government in 2014. Despite early
elections in February 2015 and a smooth transition to a new coalition government, tensions
have persisted. Implementation of Lesotho’s National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP)
has stalled in this environment and investment has slowed. Also, some development partners
have dampened their economic support.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2015 Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of Lesotho, Executive
Directors endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Lesotho achieved solid economic growth for several years with only moderate inflation. In
recent years, the authorities were able to rebuild fiscal buffers and international reserves,
largely due to a temporary rebound in SACU revenues. However, there has been little
progress in the fight against poverty and unemployment, despite considerable spending on
social sectors and transfers.
Lesotho faces a challenging economic outlook. The imminent sharp drop in SACU revenues
could threaten macroeconomic stability, unless a major fiscal adjustment is implemented.
While existing buffers provide a cushion to allow an orderly adjustment over the next 23 years, it is critical that the authorities take a substantial first step in the upcoming fiscal
year to ensure credibility. Containing recurrent expenditures—most importantly, the
extraordinarily large government wage bill—should be central to the adjustment effort. In
addition, social protection can be better targeted toward the most vulnerable. The measures
that the authorities intend to include in the 2016/17 budget would indeed make a significant
contribution toward fiscal adjustment.
Reforms to strengthen public service administration and public financial management are
urgently needed, not only for a successful fiscal adjustment, but to also improve the delivery
of government services. A lack of basic controls—such as the inability to fully reconcile
government bank accounts on a regular basis—contributes to severe government
inefficiencies. Staff urges the authorities to make good use of extensive technical assistance
currently available to build capacity in critical management areas.

3
To achieve greater inclusiveness, the private sector needs to step up job creation.
Implementation of the National Strategic Development Plan, which provides a viable
approach for transitioning from government dependence to private sector led growth over the
longer term—particularly in sectors with potential for high employment—needs to be
restarted. In the near term, to quickly stimulate job growth, measures could be taken to
eliminate unnecessary obstacles and bottlenecks to doing business. Continued
implementation of the Financial Sector Development Strategy would improve access to
credit and financial services.
To ensure financial stability, building capacity for bank and nonbank supervision and
coordinating on cross-border supervision need to be continued. While indicators point to a
generally sound financial system, the authorities need to remain vigilant regarding weak
individual institutions and financial linkages to sectors that would be affected by fiscal
adjustment.
The loti’s parity with the South African rand has served Lesotho well by supporting
macroeconomic stability and integrating the economy with the region. It is critical that an
adequate level of international reserves is maintained to ensure this exchange rate regime.
Looking ahead, a rules-based approach to fiscal policy could strengthen fiscal discipline and
better manage volatile revenues. Building up the institutional PFM framework, including
robust medium-term planning and budgeting, is a necessary first step toward this goal.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 12, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. For several years, Lesotho achieved solid economic growth with only moderate
inflation; however, this growth lacked inclusiveness and poverty has remained
widespread. Most recently, growth has begun to slow, partly reflecting spillovers from
South Africa, as well as uncertainty at home. Lesotho relies heavily on revenues from the
Southern African Customs Union (SACU) to finance large government expenditures, but
these revenues are highly volatile.
Need for Fiscal Adjustment. SACU revenues will fall sharply in fiscal year 2016/17
(April-March), with much of this fall expected to be long-lasting. Although Lesotho has
built substantial international reserves and fiscal buffers, a major fiscal adjustment over
the next 2–3 years will be needed to maintain macroeconomic stability. Containing the
government wage bill—which at 23 percent of GDP is the largest in sub-Saharan
Africa—will be central to a successful adjustment. Progress on reforms to public service
administration and public financial management is also critical. Better targeting of
government transfers is necessary for social protection.
Enabling Private Sector-Led Growth. To strengthen inclusiveness, the private sector
needs to be the engine for job creation. Measures can be taken to improve the business
environment in the near-term. Restarting implementation of the National Strategic
Development Plan (NSDP) is also a priority.
Increasing Access to Financing. Continued implementation of the Financial Sector
Development Strategy (FSDS), along with greater capacity for supervision, is critical for a
sound deepening of financial intermediation and easing an important constraint on
doing business.
Challenges to the Medium-Term Outlook. A prolonged slowdown in South Africa’s
economy would further weaken the outlook for Lesotho. In addition, diminished trade
preferences could set back Lesotho’s international competitiveness.

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

CONTEXT
1.
Over the past several years, Lesotho achieved solid economic growth with only
moderate inflation; however, this growth lacked inclusiveness and poverty has remained
widespread (Figure 1 and Tables 1–5). Real GDP growth averaged about 4½ percent a year from
2010 to 2014, led by the mining and construction sectors. Since 2012, annual inflation has been less
than 6 percent, anchored by the loti’s parity with the South African rand under the Common
Monetary Area (CMA). Despite this performance, unemployment rates have remained high,
especially among the youth, and the incidence of poverty (57 percent of the total population) is
virtually unchanged from a decade ago (Table 6).1 Moreover, most health, education, and social
indicators have shown little or no improvement, even with considerable government spending in
these areas (about 30 percent of GDP in recent years), suggesting some severe shortcomings in the
delivery of public services.
2.
To finance large government expenditures, Lesotho relies heavily on revenues from
the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), but these revenues are highly volatile. Even after
deep spending cuts during the fiscal crisis in 2010/112 and 2011/12—when SACU revenues
plummeted to about 15 percent of GDP and the overall fiscal deficit jumped to more than
10 percent of GDP—government expenditures have totaled about 60 percent of GDP or more every
year. In addition, spending has become increasingly slanted toward recurrent expenditures, with the
government wage bill increasing to 21½ percent of GDP in 2014/15—the highest in sub-Saharan
Africa. A rebound in SACU revenues in 2012/13–2014/15 (to an average of 29 percent of GDP a
year), together with consistently strong domestic tax and non-tax collections, enabled the
government to achieve a more balanced overall fiscal stance in recent years, including a small
surplus in 2014/15. This fiscal stance supported the accumulation of government deposits at the

Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL) and the rebuilding of official international reserves (to 6.3 months of
imports of goods and services as of end-2014/15). Government’s capital spending, however, has
fallen in recent years, mainly because of a drop-off in grants from development partners (by several
percentage points of GDP) and, most recently, an under execution of the capital budget.3
3.
Spillovers from slower growth in neighboring South Africa have begun to weigh on
the Lesotho economy. Diminished employment opportunities for migrant workers, particularly in
the mining sector, have reduced remittances and consumers’ purchasing power at home. Also, with
a lag, SACU revenues depend on South Africa’s collection of import duties, which fell considerably
short of expectations in 2014/15. South Africa is also an important source of private sector
investment in Lesotho, which also appears to have fallen. However, beyond water transfers,
Lesotho’s principal export markets (diamonds, textiles) lie outside the sub-region and are not
strongly affected by economic developments in South Africa. Finally, Lesotho’s financial system has
close linkages with South Africa and under the CMA, South Africa’s monetary and exchange rate
policies have a direct impact on Lesotho. Most years, several of Lesotho’s financial institutions have
accumulated assets in South Africa leading to a net outflow of financial resources.
4.
Recent political and security developments have weakened implementation of
economic policies and the investment climate. Lesotho’s first coalition government, which came
into power in 2012, collapsed in 2014 amidst much turmoil, including the suspension of parliament
and conflict among the security services. Despite early elections in February 2015 and a smooth
transition to a new coalition government, tensions once again escalated a few months later,
particularly within the army.4 In addition, opposition party leaders fled the country. Implementation
of Lesotho’s National Strategic Development Plan 2012/13-2016/17 (NSDP) has stagnated in this
environment, while disruptions in parliamentary procedures have delayed a number of legislative
proposals. Business investment has slowed and, most recently, some development partners have
expressed concerns that political and security developments could dampen their economic support
for Lesotho.

Lesotho’s relations with the Fund
5.
In September 2013, Lesotho successfully completed a three-year program supported
by the Fund’s Extended Credit Facility (ECF); the previous Article IV consultation was
concluded on June 4, 2014 (Box 1). Under the ECF, Lesotho achieved fiscal consolidation and
rebuilt fiscal buffers and international reserves. The authorities also elaborated the Financial Sector
Development Strategy (FSDS), which was adopted in early 2014. Although implementation of the
FSDS has progressed, in other areas, the structural agenda has largely stalled. Bills for public debt
and aid management, public sector audit, anti-money laundering, and a new fiscal regime for the

The conclusion of Lesotho’s compact with the U.S. Government’s Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was an
important factor in the drop-off in grants and lower capital expenditures.

security issues. The Commission’s report has yet to be made public.

mining sector are still awaiting consideration by parliament. Implementation of the public financial
management (PFM) action plan has also been limited, although the recent establishment of a
ministerial-level steering committee could help PFM reform regain momentum.
Box 1. Implementation of Fund Advice
Key Recommendations

Implementation Status

Create fiscal space to scale up public
investment under NSDP, including by
containing recurrent expenditures—in
particular, the government wage bill.

Implementation of the NSDP has stalled, while the
wage bill has continued to grow (to 23 percent of
GDP in 2015/16 budget). The capital budget
continues to be under executed.

Maintain international reserves at an
adequate level (5 months of the following
year’s imports).

Fiscal surplus in 2014/15 enabled an accumulation
of reserves (to over 6 months of imports).

Over the medium term, move toward a
rules-based approach to fiscal policy to
reduce vulnerability to volatile SACU
revenue.

The authorities continue to discuss a rules-based
approach to fiscal policy. Progress is needed on
public financial management (PFM) reform,
especially medium-term budgeting.

Step up efforts to strengthen public
financial management framework and
improve planning, appraisal, and
implementation of public investment
projects.

PFM steering committee was recently elevated to
the ministerial level and a new PFM reform
coordinator was put in place. However, only limited
progress has been achieved in strengthening the
cash management unit and reconciling
government’s bank accounts. Project preparation
and execution is still weak and undermines
implementation of capital expenditure.

Strengthen banking supervision and begin
implementation of Financial Sector
Development Strategy.

The CBL is building supervisory capacity and
continues to strengthen coordination with South
Africa’s banking supervision. Credit information
bureau is operational, a collateral registry is being
developed, and insurance regulations have been
prepared.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
6.
Lesotho faces a challenging near- and medium-term economic outlook. Real GDP
growth is estimated to have fallen to about 2½ percent in 2015 and is projected to remain subdued
in 2016, mainly reflecting weaknesses in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Uncertainty
about Lesotho’s favored access to the U.S. market and an increasingly competitive global

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

environment have dampened production of textiles, Lesotho’s leading manufacturing export,5 while
construction activity has stalled from lower investment spending by both the public and private
sectors. Over the medium term, the underlying weakness in the economy is expected to persist, as a
sharp and prolonged decline in SACU revenues will necessitate a major fiscal adjustment that would
curtail government demand. Nevertheless, GDP growth is expected to get a boost from the coming
on line of a large new diamond mine in 2017 and, in the following year, commencement of
construction on phase two of the water transfer component of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project
(LHWP-II). Annual inflation is projected to be around 5 percent over the medium term—in line with
South Africa’s inflation projections. Currently, inflation is still low (4.4 percent as of October 2015),
despite sharp increases in food prices. Exchange rate depreciation could add to inflation pressures,
although for the time being, low international fuel prices have softened the impact for Lesotho.
7.
There are several risks to this outlook—most notably, there could be severe
consequences if fiscal adjustment is not implemented in a timely manner. Without an
appropriate adjustment, the magnitude and duration of the drop in SACU revenues would lead to
unsustainable fiscal deficits, which would jeopardize debt sustainability and the maintenance of
international reserves needed to ensure the loti’s parity with the rand under the CMA (Box 2). Other
significant risks include: (i) spillover effects if emerging market countries, and especially South Africa,
experience a prolonged and more severe slowdown in growth than is currently projected;
(ii) diminished competitiveness if new trade agreements do indeed cut into Lesotho’s relatively
favorable access to export markets; and (iii) the prospects of severe drought in the region (Table 7).
To some extent, Lesotho’s current stock of international reserves mitigates these risks, by providing
a cushion against most temporary shocks. The reserves, along with fiscal buffers, would also allow
time for an orderly adjustment to more permanent shocks, such as the loss of SACU revenues in the
baseline scenario. Finally, while the risks are to the downside, there are also potential upsides to the
baseline, notably if Lesotho’s policy framework garners greater support from development partners.6

5

In the baseline scenario, textile exports are projected to remain flat due to uncertainty surrounding Lesotho’s trade
preferences. Total exports dip in 2015/16, mainly because of a temporary drop in production at a major diamond
mine.
6

The baseline scenario does not incorporate any grants under a possible second compact with the Millennium
Challenge Corporation or budget support from other development partners.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

Box 2. Downside Scenario
Delaying or not fully implementing additional fiscal measures as outlined in the baseline scenario could still
threaten macroeconomic stability. As an example, an illustrative downside scenario with fiscal measures that
achieve permanent fiscal gains of 1 percent of GDP a year from 2016/17 to 2018/19 (cumulative gain of 3 percent
of GDP by 2018/19) would lead to a substantial increase in domestic debt and lower in international reserves.
Assuming that the financing of additional fiscal needs is accomplished through the combination of issuance of
government securities and running down the government deposits at CBL, by the end of the medium-term
projection period (2019/20) international reserves would fall to about 4 months of import coverage and total
public debt would reach 60 percent of GDP. In addition, the increased government borrowing leads to some
crowding out of credit to the private sector, which negatively affects GDP growth.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
Policy discussions focused mainly on the principal challenge facing Lesotho: the
ongoing drop in SACU revenues and fiscal adjustment. As highlighted by the Minister of Finance
in the 2015/16 budget speech in June, the Lesotho authorities recognize the need for fiscal
adjustment to maintain macroeconomic stability, including the necessity to contain the government
wage bill. Policy discussions also addressed the need to strengthen Lesotho’s business environment
and international competitiveness, so that the private sector can step up as the driving force for job
creation and more inclusive growth. Financial sector stability and development issues were also
discussed, with a view toward enhancing a sound deepening of financial services and intermediation
to support growth. Other issues discussed during the Article IV consultation included debt
sustainability and structural reforms, particularly in the area of public financial management (PFM),
which would be instrumental for paving the way for longer-term fiscal reforms such as
decentralization and a rules-based approach to fiscal policy.

A. Fiscal Adjustment and Supporting Reforms to Ensure Macroeconomic
Stability
9.
Lesotho’s SACU revenues are expected to fall by about 12 percentage points of GDP
between 2014/15 and 2016/17, with much of this drop expected to be long lasting. After
falling by 3½ percentage points of GDP in 2015/16 (to just over 25 percent of GDP), they are
projected to plunge another 8½ percentage points to about 16½ percent of GDP the following
year.7 Although a modest rebound is expected in 2017/18, SACU revenues are projected to remain
relatively low (below 20 percent of GDP) over the foreseeable future, largely due to the slowdown in
import growth in South Africa, which is the main determinant of the size of the SACU revenue pool.8
The government’s latest budget projections envisage a modest fiscal consolidation of only a
3 percentage points of GDP over the medium term, implying that additional measures to raise
domestic tax and non-tax revenues and curb government spending will be necessary to close a
substantial gap. Indeed, considering that government spending has been budgeted to expand in the
current year—to over 63 percent of GDP, with the wage bill alone rising to 23 percent of GDP—the
task of adjusting the fiscal stance will require a strong reversal of expenditure trends.
10.
To reduce the shock to the economy and to allow time for much needed structural
reforms, Lesotho’s fiscal adjustment could be spread over the next 2-3 years; however, a
significant first step would be needed to establish credibility. In the baseline scenario, the path
for additional fiscal measures—that is, measures beyond the modest consolidation already reflected
7

SACU revenues have fallen from R 7.0 billion in 2014/15 to R 6.6 billion in 2015/16 and R 4.5 billion in 2016/17. The
allocation in 2016/17 is derived from the projected base revenue of R 5.5 billion and a negative correction of
R 1.0 billion for actual collections in 2014/15 that were lower than projected.
8

In addition to South Africa’s lower imports, Lesotho’s base revenue projection was reduced by a permanent
correction (R 0.6 billion) which removes fuel levies from the SACU revenue pool.

in the government’s recent budget projections (Text Table 1)—call for adjustments on the order of
3, 3½, and ½ percentage points of GDP in 2016/17, 2017/18, and 2018/19, respectively. Given that
domestic revenue collections are already quite high relative to GDP, a larger share (about twothirds) of the adjustment could come from expenditure measures, particularly by containing the
wage bill. Other possible measures include better targeting of social transfers; phasing-out transfers
for tuition loans and reforming financial management of the National Manpower Development
Secretariat; raising fuel levies; enacting the new mining taxation regime; and broadening coverage
of the corporate income tax. With the proposed adjustment, the overall fiscal deficit is projected to
widen considerably in 2016/17 (to about 7½ percent of GDP, from just over 3 percent of GDP in
2015/16), before returning to near zero in 2017/18, and beyond. A combination of domestic
borrowing and a drawdown of government deposits at the CBL could be used to finance the deficits,
while still preserving debt sustainability and reserve adequacy (Annexes 1 and 2). Gross international
reserves are projected to fall during the adjustment period, but then stabilize at about 5–5½ months
of imports beginning in 2018/19.

11.
Structural reforms—notably, to address the government payroll and the budget
process—would be critical for a successful fiscal adjustment with protection for vulnerable
segments of the population. Severe weaknesses in public service administration have contributed
to the high government wage bill, while poor public financial management has added to the under
execution of the capital budget and poor delivery of public services. To overcome capacity issues
and enable much needed progress on the structural agenda, the government should work closely
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

with development partners and technical assistance experts. In particular, the World Bank’s project
for the modernization of government aims to help clean up and efficiently manage the government
payroll and improve the allocation of human resources, using biometric identification for civil
servants, improved control systems, and, over time, a functional review of government agencies. To
strengthen social protection, while also generating fiscal savings, income transfers and subsidies
could be targeted more effectively.9 Several development partners provide technical assistance for
the action plan for the comprehensive PFM reform, the implementation of which has received a
boost from the new ministerial-level steering committee and PFM coordinator. With respect to the
wage bill, actions—such as identifying and eliminating “ghost” workers through payroll audits—
could generate considerable fiscal savings (1.3-4.3 percent of GDP a year)10 in the near term.
However, in the event that fiscal savings take more time to materialize, the authorities could impose
a temporary ceiling to contain the wage bill. Within such a cap, there could be discretion on staffing
and wage rate decisions.
12.
PFM reforms are also urgently needed to strengthen budget execution and
monitoring. In line with past recommendations, professional positions in the Cash Management
Unit (CMU) of the Office of the Accountant General (AcG) need to be filled with qualified staff. Full
reconciliation of all government bank accounts on a regular basis, including accounts in commercial
banks, is a basic prerequisite to establish accountability. A strategy could then be formulated to
finally make proper use of the Treasury Single Account at the CBL. Efforts also need to be stepped
up in the areas of medium-term planning and budgeting, which are necessary components for a
rules-based approach to fiscal policy.
Authorities’ views
13.
There was broad agreement to undertake the necessary fiscal adjustment in steps, as
recommended by Fund staff. The authorities prefer to rely predominantly on spending cuts to
achieve fiscal adjustment, particularly focusing on the wage bill and expenditures on goods and
services. With technical support from the World Bank, payroll audits in a few pilot ministries—along
with steps to strengthen personnel management—could begin in early 2016/17. Procurement
procedures will be reviewed with a view to reduce the cost of supplies, while also outsourcing more
services with the potential for fiscal savings. In addition, measures to be incorporated in the budget
proposal for 2016/17 include:


Zero adjustment for inflation in government wages and no new hiring, except for key positions
(such as, qualified accountants);



Increases in non-tax revenues (fees, charges, and penalties); and



Increase in fuel taxes.

9

Negotiations on the World Bank’s social protection project, which focuses on this issue, are at an advanced stage.

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

On PFM reform, the authorities emphasized that the elevated status of the steering committee is a
demonstration of their intentions to make good progress on the action plan going forward. It was
noted that without improved PFM systems it would be difficult to implement a major fiscal
adjustment.11

B. Enabling Private Sector Growth and Job Creation to Bolster
Inclusiveness
14.
With the government in need of significant fiscal adjustment, Lesotho must rely on
private sector-led growth to generate employment opportunities and improve inclusiveness.
However, transforming from a heavy dependence on government to a more private sector-led
economy will be a lengthy and challenging process. Moreover, Lesotho’s international
competitiveness is in a precarious position, which suggests that achieving greater export growth will
also be a challenge.12 The NSDP, which was adopted essentially by all political parties in 2012,
provides a viable roadmap to more dynamic private sector growth, but implementation has been
sketchy at best. In particular, the NSDP identifies manufacturing, tourism, information and
communications technology (ICT), and commercial agriculture as sectors with strong potential job
creation. Discussions with the authorities and representatives of the business community focused on
identifying near-term measures—within the government’s budget limitations—that could have an
immediate impact on unemployment pressures during the fiscal adjustment.
15.
As suggested by the business community, there are a number of relatively low-cost
near-term actions that could help eliminate some obstacles to doing business. For example,
operating government-leased factory shells on a commercial basis would lead to more effective use
of this resource. Currently, there is a waiting list of potentially job creating businesses seeking these
facilities, while some existing tenants have become dormant and fallen into arrears on their rent.
Other suggestions include exploring options for private industrial parks; providing internationally
accepted standards certification services for both agricultural and manufacturing products;
encouraging wage contracts (such as, piece-rate wages) that enhance competitiveness; and
supporting development of market-demanded skills, including through extension services. Following
up on pilot projects under the NSDP—notably, extension services and standards certification for
commercial fruit orchards—could lead to rapid private sector development in these areas.
Diversifying exports and targeting the sub-region may also be necessary, especially in light of recent
trade developments that will likely cut into Lesotho’s current favored position.13 To support longerterm growth and inclusiveness, step up implementation of the NSDP, particularly by strengthening
planning and execution of government’s capital budget, not only for much needed infrastructure,
11

With financing from the European Union (EU), the Fund will provide a resident advisor to the AcG’s office. The EU is
also providing four more long-term experts to support PFM reform.

but also for pilot projects and follow-up support in priority sectors. In general, greater engagement
by government with the business community and development partners would help to identify
productive measures.
Authorities’ views
16.
While a number of initiatives are already underway, the authorities agreed that further
progress is needed to invigorate the private sector. The Lesotho National Development
Corporation (LNDC) is courting suppliers to South African industries to establish plants in Lesotho, in
order to diversify export markets more towards the sub-region and to build upon Lesotho’s natural
comparative advantages. They noted that a recent investment in Lesotho by a supplier to South
Africa’s auto industry is encouraging. The LNDC also just completed construction of several more
factory shells and saw scope for managing existing shells more effectively. Government officials
emphasized that in addition to strengthening planning and execution of the capital budget, curbing
recurrent spending could provide fiscal space to increase spending on infrastructure. They also plan
to hold a long-delayed “Jobs Summit” to focus attention on employment issues and relevant policy
actions. To help spur entrepreneurship, they have begun to identify public services that could be
outsourced to the private sector at a savings to the budget. Transparency and competitive bidding
procedures would be critical to the success of this initiative. As noted in the 2015/16 budget speech,
the authorities also aim to explore opportunities for privatization and divesture of government’s
equity positions.

C. Financial Sector Stability and Development to support Growth
17.
Indicators suggest that Lesotho’s banking system overall is adequately capitalized,
liquid, and profitable (Table 8), although one bank continues to face difficulties. Three of the
sector’s four banks are subsidiaries of large South African banks. They account for over 90 percent of
total assets and deposits and have been highly profitable. The fourth bank, the government-owned
Lesotho Post Bank (LPB), which was established to primarily serve rural areas and the unbanked, has
typically incurred losses. For the system as a whole, growth in credit to the private sector has slowed
considerably following a surge in 2012.14 Although nonperforming loans (NPLs) increased after the
surge, they remained relatively low as a share of total loans and have largely been provisioned for.
The nonbank financial sector is a mixed picture, with some pension funds and insurance companies
holding substantial assets and generating profits, while other smaller scale institutions have
struggled. Some aspects of the insurance sector—notably brokerage services—have eluded
regulatory oversight, which is a potential source of risk. In addition, maintaining the CBL’s
supervisory capacity of banks and nonbanks has been a challenge, particularly with staff turnover.
18.
Looking ahead, there could be risks to the banking system stemming from fiscal
adjustment. That is, although an empirical analysis of macro-financial linkages suggest only a small
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

correlation between economic growth and credit to the private sector,15 two important areas for
commercial bank lending are personal loans and construction. With government being a major
employer and source of construction contracts—especially for projects financed by development
partners—the anticipated cutbacks in government spending during the fiscal adjustment could
weigh heavily on banks’ loan portfolios. Beyond highlighting potential risks to the banking system,
policy discussions focused on steps to address constraints on access to credit.
19.
The CBL’s has continued to make progress on implementing the FSDS, while building
capacity for supervision and financial stability reporting has been noteworthy. Ongoing efforts
to broaden the use of the new credit reference bureau, establish a collateral registry, and solidify the
role of commercial courts to settle credit matters should help to reduce the risk premium in lending
rates and improve access to credit for creditworthy borrowers. In addition, given the high profits of
the foreign-owned banks, exploring ways to generate greater competition—such as inviting other
banks to enter the market—to lower lending rates may be warranted. Building supervisory capacity
for both banks and nonbanks, particularly with the implementation of Basle II principles, as well as
implementation of new regulations for the insurance sector, would help to reduce risks to the
financial system.16 In addition, the CBL’s continued active engagement with South African banking
supervisors, who oversee the parent banks of subsidiaries in Lesotho, is critical, given the extensive
cross-border networks of these banks. With a view toward shoring up the LPB, a sizeable component
of the loan portfolio that is driven by government policy initiatives, which should be transparent and
explicitly reflected in the government budget. Also, alternative options for management and
operations of the LPB should be explored.
Authorities’ views
20.
The CBL has been proactive on both financial sector supervision and development, and
remains dedicated to the implementation of the FSDS. Further technical assistance for capacity
building in both supervision and financial stability reporting would be welcomed. On the financial
soundness of the LPB, the bank’s income statement has begun to improve—recently recording its
first profit. It was emphasized by banking supervision that the government, as owner of the LPB,
would need to take the lead role in operational and managerial reforms. Moreover, while the
banking system is generally sound, banking supervision would remain vigilant to monitor
macrofinancial risks arising from a major fiscal adjustment—such as a possible deterioration of
quality on loans to government contractors.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

D. Other Surveillance Issues
21.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy. The loti’s parity with the rand under the CMA has
served Lesotho well by solidifying expectations of continued macroeconomic stability, even during
periods of fiscal difficulties, such as periodic downturns in SACU revenues. The CMA has also
facilitated trade and financial integration with South Africa. Fund staff has assessed that the loti
exchange rate remains aligned with economic fundamentals, even though some empirical analyses
points to a modest undervaluation, especially given the challenges facing Lesotho’s international
competitiveness (see Annex 3).17 Moreover, in view of the looming drop in foreign exchange receipts
from the sharp reduction in SACU revenues, there is an urgent need to implement the appropriate
fiscal measures to ensure that international reserves continue to fully meet commitments under the
CMA with adequate buffers.18 An analysis of reserve adequacy supports the authorities’ existing
medium-term target of 5 months of import cover (see Annex 2). While monetary policy is largely
subsumed by this strong fixed exchange regime, the authorities’ intention to develop an effective
policy interest rate could be useful in the event temporary pressures on the loti-rand parity arise.
22.
Debt Sustainability. Lesotho remains at moderate risk of debt distress (see Annex 1). The
principal source of pressure on debt sustainability arises from the authorities’ intentions to use debt
financing for a major infrastructure project—the power component of LHWP-II—over the next
decade. A thorough feasibility study is expected to be completed in the coming year, and will be
instrumental in determining the way forward, both on the financing and scope of the project. Given
the tendencies around the world for such projects to incur delays and cost overruns, a conservative
approach to such a decision would be critical to maintain debt sustainability. Moreover, although
the recent depreciation of the South African rand does not fundamentally alter the risk assessment,
it does increase Lesotho’s external debt vulnerabilities and the need to remain vigilant about debt
management, such as limiting external borrowing mostly to concessional loans.
23.
Other Structural Reforms. Fiscal decentralization. To address issues of poor delivery of
public services, the authorities are keen to pursue fiscal decentralization. While decentralization has
merit and is encouraged by development partners, it would both require vast improvement in
management of the public service and public financial management, before it could be productively
implemented. Rules-based approach to fiscal policy. Following up on discussions from the previous
Article IV consultation, the authorities expressed interest in a rules-based approach to fiscal policy
with a view toward achieving greater stability in government spending despite highly volatile
revenues (from SACU and mining). While an expenditure-type rule would help to achieve more
stable spending, there was a consensus that a fiscal balance-type component would be needed to

17

With the vast majority of Lesotho’s imports coming from South Africa, the recent volatility in the rand has had only
limited impact on Lesotho’s balance of payments. The main effects are on the cost of fuel imports, which has been
dampened by low international oil prices. On the export side, the weakening of the rand should help
competitiveness.
18

The CMA imposes a floor on international reserves equivalent to 100 percent of base money.

15

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

ensure consistency with maintaining adequate international reserves.19 Progress on PFM reform,
particularly in the area of medium-term planning and budgeting, would be an essential precondition
to successfully implement such a fiscal rule. Moreover, with SACU revenues entering a trough, the
timing for introducing an expenditure-type fiscal rule would need to be pushed back considerably.
24.
Lesotho maintains one exchange restriction subject to Fund approval. The restriction
arises from single discretionary allowances of Maloti 1 million per individual per calendar year, for
residents over 18, and of Maloti 200,000 on the same basis for residents under 18. The availability of
foreign exchange beyond these limits is subject to a discretionary approval on a case by case
basis. This gives rise to an exchange restriction inconsistent with Lesotho’s obligations under
Article VIII, Section 2(a) of the Articles of Agreement.
25.
Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Financing for Terrorism (AML-CFT). The
Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group recently noted the slow progress in
addressing deficiencies in Lesotho’s AML/CFT legal framework. The authorities are taking steps to
revise the legal framework and to better understand ML/TF risks. They are encouraged to expedite
the amendments to the Money Laundering and Proceeds to Crime Act in line with international
standards, and to proceed with the assessment of national ML/TF risks.
26.
Technical Assistance (TA). Lesotho’s use of Fund provided TA has expanded significantly in
recent years. In line with Lesotho’s macroeconomic policy agenda going forward, TA is being
directed toward PFM reform (cash management and medium-term fiscal frameworks), tax policy,
revenue administration, bank and nonbank supervision and regulations, financial stability reporting,
and economic statistics. This TA has been well-received; however, in some cases delays in the
government’s recruiting qualified staff have hindered the desired capacity building component.
27.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, data shortcomings in
national accounts and external sector statistics handicap economic policy making. Progress toward
producing quality quarterly national accounts statistics on a timely basis is a top priority.20

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Lesotho achieved solid economic growth for several years with only moderate
inflation. In recent years, the authorities were able to rebuild fiscal buffers and international
reserves, largely due to a temporary rebound in SACU revenues. However, there has been little
progress in the fight against poverty and unemployment, despite considerable spending on social
sectors and transfers.

19

The authorities expressed interest in a rule to limit recurrent expenditures in favor of capital spending, but staff
cautioned them about difficulties with rules relying on expenditure classifications.
20

An ongoing TA program supported by AFRITAC South aims to address this issue.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

29.
Lesotho faces a challenging economic outlook. The imminent sharp drop in SACU
revenues could threaten macroeconomic stability, unless a major fiscal adjustment is implemented.
While existing buffers provide a cushion to allow an orderly adjustment over the next 2-3 years, it is
critical that the authorities take a substantial first step in the upcoming fiscal year to ensure
credibility. Containing recurrent expenditures—most importantly, the extraordinarily large
government wage bill—should be central to the adjustment effort. In addition, social protection can
be better targeted toward the most vulnerable. The measures that the authorities intend to include
in the 2016/17 budget would indeed make a significant contribution toward fiscal adjustment.
30.
Reforms to strengthen public service administration and public financial management
are urgently needed, not only for a successful fiscal adjustment, but to also improve the delivery of
government services. A lack of basic controls—such as the inability to fully reconcile government
bank accounts on a regular basis—contributes to severe government inefficiencies. Staff urges the
authorities to make good use of extensive technical assistance currently available to build capacity in
critical management areas.
31.
To achieve greater inclusiveness, the private sector needs to step up job creation.
Implementation of the National Strategic Development Plan, which provides a viable approach for
transitioning from government dependence to private sector led growth over the longer term—
particularly in sectors with potential for high employment—needs to be restarted. In the near term,
to quickly stimulate job growth, measures could be taken to eliminate unnecessary obstacles and
bottlenecks to doing business. Continued implementation of the Financial Sector Development
Strategy would improve access to credit and financial services.
32.
To ensure financial stability, building capacity for bank and nonbank supervision and
coordinating on cross-border supervision need to be continued. While indicators point to a
generally sound financial system, the authorities need to remain vigilant regarding weak individual
institutions and financial linkages to sectors that would be affected by fiscal adjustment.
33.
The loti’s parity with the South African rand has served Lesotho well by supporting
macroeconomic stability and integrating the economy with the region. It is critical that an
adequate level of international reserves is maintained to ensure this exchange rate regime. Staff
does not recommend approval of the exchange restriction under Article VIII, section 2(a) arising
from the discretionary allowances, given that this measure was not imposed for balance of
payments reasons.
34.
Looking ahead, a rules-based approach to fiscal policy could strengthen fiscal
discipline and better manage volatile revenues. Building up the institutional PFM framework,
including robust medium-term planning and budgeting, is a necessary first step toward this goal.
37.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Lesotho take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and
30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views at the end of the Article IV
consultation mission.

Annex I. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Lesotho remains at moderate risk of external debt distress. Under the baseline scenario, all indicators
are well below their corresponding thresholds throughout the projection period, with the one exception
of the present value of external debt-to-GDP ratio, which comes close to its threshold of 40 percent of
GDP in 2025, mainly reflecting nonconcessional debt financing for a proposed large hydropower plant
under the second phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LWHP-II). However, Lesotho’s debt
sustainability is sensitive to the scale and quality of this major project. Negative shocks to exports and
the possibility of a large exchange rate depreciation also present risks to debt sustainability.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
Lesotho’s public debt sustainability analysis is based on the following assumptions:
Macroeconomic assumptions. The baseline scenario builds upon the medium-term
macroeconomic projections agreed upon with the authorities during the 2015 Article IV consultation
mission. Reflecting the current weakness in the manufacturing and construction sectors, along with
the effects of the anticipated fiscal adjustment, real GDP growth is projected to drop to
2½-3 percent a year in 2015/16 and 2016/17. Growth is expected to rebound in following years,
driven by the ramping up of production at a new diamond mine (Liqhobong) and the
commencement of construction activities related to the water transfer component of LHWP-II. Over
the long term, real GDP growth is projected to average about 3½ percent a year, which is relatively
conservative compared with average growth of 4½ percent a year used in the previous DSA Update.
The downward revision of the long-term growth rate reflects a more sluggish outlook for South
Africa, Lesotho’s key economic partner, and the assumption of a permanently lower level of SACU
revenues, which would undercut public investment program.
Annual CPI inflation is expected to increase from 2.6 percent in 2014/15 to around 5 percent in the
medium term. In addition, the baseline scenario assumes continued efforts to strengthen public
sector efficiency, and sizeable fiscal adjustments in light of falling SACU revenue. Exports are
expected to be mainly driven by diamonds while imports are subject to project related activities.
Fiscal assumptions. The fiscal year 2014/15 ended with a surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP. However
the expected decline in SACU revenue poses a big challenge and would require greater commitment
and efforts to maintain fiscal stability and sustainability going forward. The fiscal balance is expected
to fall into a deficit of just over 3 percent of GDP in 2015/16 and 7½ percent of GDP in 2016/17
(assuming fiscal measures are taken). Beyond that an effective implementation of proposed reforms
and fiscal measures should ensure a broadly balanced budget.


Tax performance, especially for income taxes, is expected to increase only marginally as ongoing
administrative measures continue to be implemented may result in better tax compliance.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO



Non-tax revenue, mainly from mining sector is expected to increase due to increased production
at Letseng and Liqhobong diamond mines and adoption of new Mining Policy.



SACU revenue is expected to fall, to about 25½ percent of GDP in 2015/16 and 15½ percent of
GDP in 2016/17, from about 29 percent in 2014/15. Given the prolonged slowdown in South
Africa, much of the fall in SACU revenue is projected to be permanent, recovering only
marginally in 2017/18 to little above 18 percent of GDP. It is expected to remain at that level
over the medium term.



Additional fiscal measures of 7 percent of GDP, cumulative, over the next three years are
assumed. The bulk of the adjustments would come from expenditure side, requiring both
expenditure compression and streamlining.



Financing needs are expected to rise to about 2½ percent of GDP over the medium term and
are expected to be met by a mix of domestic debt issuance and drawdown of government
deposits.



Government is expected to raise new domestic debt of about 4½ percent of GDP over the next
three years in order to support a gradual fiscal adjustment.

Assumptions regarding Lesotho Highland Project Phase-II. The baseline assumptions regarding
the hydropower component of LHWP-II remain broadly the same as those in the previous DSA
Update, however, the timing has been push back to 2021–25. The project is assumed to cost about
USD500 million with 80 percent financing from commercial sources. However, these assumptions
are tentative as the project’s feasibility study is still underway. Moreover, the assumptions on the
scale, financing, and costs of the project have a significant impact on debt sustainability. A cost
overrun and any deterioration in financing conditions could lead to external debt indicators
breaching relevant threshold and endanger risk rating.
Interests Rate. A discount rate of 5 percent is used for present value. 1

Box 1. Analysis of Hydropower Component of LHWP-II1
Staff discussed with the authorities the macroeconomic effects of investing in the electricity
sector, using a variant of the open-economy Debt, Investment, and Growth (DIG) model
developed by Buffie, et al (2012). The base model—a full-fledged dynamic macroeconomic
model that allows for investment in infrastructure and government financing through
concessional, commercial, or domestic debt, and/or fiscal adjustment—was tailored to Lesotho. In
particular, it incorporates investments in the electricity sector—investing in a pump storage
hydroelectric power plant within the second phase of LHWP—which sells electricity to both
foreign and domestic customers. In the model, increases in domestic energy supply are growthenhancing while receipts from selling electricity abroad can ease the fiscal burden (tax increases),
which is often associated with big investment project. Still, in the transition, debt as well as taxes
can rise substantially to pay for this investment.
The model and the investment program were calibrated to capture key characteristics of
Lesotho. The calibration matches Lesotho’s data for initial conditions for the fiscal year 2020/21,
when the project is set to start. It also captures the project’s main challenges: (i) the costs for the
project implementation; and (ii) whether South Africa will purchase enough electricity to make the
plant run at a high capacity. Usually costs for similar projects are often underestimated—e.g., the
Ingula pump storage scheme in South Africa is currently experiencing costs which are almost
three times the feasibility study estimate. To reflect these costs differences, two cost scenarios
were considered: a low-cost scenario where costs for the government budget amount to around
one billion USD and a high -cost scenario which corresponds to actual costs being 2.5 times
higher.2
The analysis revealed that the project can have substantial macroeconomic benefits in
Lesotho, as long as low costs and a high electricity demand by South Africa are maintained.
In the low-cost scenario, real GDP increases by 2.5 percent, while consumption increases by 5
percent in the long run. The gain in real GDP is supported by lower domestic electricity prices,
which boost domestic production. Taxes increase by a moderate amount in the transition, which
explains the small dip in consumption, during construction years (see Figure below). Public debt
remains sustainable by increasing solely by 5 percentage points of GDP. In contrast, with higher
costs, private consumption is significantly crowded out and stays below its pre-project level for
almost two decades, since taxes have to increase by 5 percentage points and remain high
throughout the simulation period. And although growth picks up more quickly in the short run,
total public debt reaches almost 90 percent of GDP, raising concerns of debt distress and
questioning the sustainability of growth prospects. Key in the analysis is the assumption of foreign
demand by South Africa. If foreign customers do not agree to purchase enough electricity to keep
production high, the results will deteriorate for both cost scenarios.

project assumptions).

Box 1. Analysis of Hydropower Component of LHWP-II (concluded)

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. Baseline
All external debt sustainability indicators remain below their corresponding thresholds in the
baseline scenario (Table 1a). For example, the present value (PV) of external debt to GDP ratio is
expected to remain about 25 percent in medium term, after which time it is expected to rise to
37½ percent in 2025, before subsiding to 23½ percent by 2035. The temporary rise in the external
debt trajectory is driven by financing for the construction of the hydropower plant under LHWP-II.
Moreover, in the long run a prudent fiscal policy should ensure a stable debt outlook.
These results are sensitive to the assumptions mentioned before and in particular concern
about the amount and concessionality of LHWP-II financing, the future of SACU revenues,
and the overall fiscal management. The temporary increase in PV of external debt to GDP ratio is
driven entirely by higher nonconcessional borrowing for the LHWP-II. The increased borrowing
during the construction of the power plant does make Lesotho temporarily more vulnerable to
external shocks. The authorities are currently undertaking a feasibility study, results of which would
provide a better idea about the cost of the project and financing options. While the baseline
assumes that the government revenue would decline from about 60 percent of GDP in 2014/15 to
about 52 percent of GDP in 2018 and onwards, largely due to a decline in SACU revenue, a more

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

abrupt and permanent decline of these revenues—as discussed in the risk assessment matrix
(Table 7) in the staff report for Lesotho’s Article IV consultation—would require major fiscal
adjustments over the next three years without risking macroeconomic stability.
Under the probability approach2 (Figure 3), there exists a breach of the threshold for debt-to-GDP
ratio in the baseline scenario. However, the breach is short-lived and not excessive. Again, this
breach is mainly driven by the LHWP-II. This approach re-emphasizes the importance of ensuring
that authorities should only undertake the project if it is financially and economically viable and
implemented effectively with minimal cost overruns and extended delays. Taking this into
consideration, staff remains of the view that Lesotho is still under the moderate risk of debt distress.

B. Sensitivity Analysis
Stress tests show that Lesotho’s external debt vulnerabilities would increase significantly, in
particular in the event of a major exchange rate depreciation, or if the export growth turned
out to be lower than the historical average, (Table 1b). In addition, a 200 basis point increase in
interest rates for new public sector loans in 2015–34 would increase the PV of external debt-to-GDP
ratio to 47 percent in 2025. Similarly, in the event of a one-time 30 percent depreciation of the
nominal exchange rate in 2015, the PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 50 percent
by 2024/25, gradually falling to below the threshold by 2030 and staying under it thereafter. In a
scenario where export value grows at one standard deviation lower than the historical average, the
PV of external debt-to-export ratio would rise to 47 percent by 2024. In a scenario in which the key
variables are set at their average of the past 10 years, Lesotho’s external debt ratios actually fall
relative to the baseline, reflecting an average fiscal surplus over the past years thanks to the large
SACU revenue, a decent GDP growth and inflation averaging about 5 percent. However, given the
structural break, the historical scenario could be considered less relevant for the analysis.

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
External debt accounts for more than 95 percent of Lesotho’s public debt3, public debt
indicators largely mirror those of external debt. However a small increase in domestic debt
(about 4 percent of GDP) is projected to facilitate gradual fiscal adjustments in coming years and
expected to remain about 5 percent of GDP throughout the projected period.

2

The probability approach methodology focuses on the evolution of the probability of debt distress over time, rather
than on the evolution of debt burden indicators. This approach provides complementary, country specific
information to help decide cases where a country’s risk rating is on the border between two categories – in this case,
a ±5 percent range is nearly breached from below for the present value of debt to GDP ratio in the baseline scenario
and for the debt service to exports ratio under extreme shock.
3

Public debt includes central government debt and debt guarantees, excluding potential contingent liabilities from
state-owned entities.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

33

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

The PV of public sector debt stood at below 30 percent in 2014/15 (Table 2a). The standard
sensitivity tests for public debt distress point to higher degree of vulnerability of public debt to
permanently higher deficit i.e. about 3 percent of GDP projected for 2015 (Table 2b). In addition,
lower long-run GDP growth can also shift the debt trajectory higher but would still remain below the
critical threshold of 60 percent of GDP.
To assess the implications of the risk of incomplete
or delayed fiscal measures, an alternative scenario
was undertaken (for details see Box 2 of the staff
report). Given the higher fiscal primary deficits of
about 6 percent of GDP per year and lower GDP
growth, public debt vulnerability increases significantly
in the medium term as the present value of debt-toGDP ratio breaches the threshold of 56 percent in 2020
and continues to rise sharply afterwards. This again
underscores the need for early and decisive actions on
additional fiscal measures in order to avoid increasing
the vulnerability of public debt.

CONCLUSION
Lesotho remains at moderate risk of external debt distress. All external debt and debt service
indicators for the baseline remain below their respective thresholds. However, a large exchange rate
depreciation or a decline in exports revenue pose major risk to Lesotho’s debt sustainability. In
addition, there is little scope for additional borrowing (beyond the baseline assumption) for
financing the hydropower component of Lesotho High Lands Water Project-Phase II and findings of
feasibility study would be important in this regard. The authorities are encouraged to seek bilateral
and multilateral concessional sources of financing in order to minimize reliance on commercial
borrowing.
The authorities broadly agreed with the assessment of moderate risk of external debt distress.
They appreciated that the PV of external debt ratio rises owing to the construction of LHWP-II and
agreed that care would be needed to ensure that the financing arrangements do not increase the
risk of external debt distress. As part of their medium term debt strategy, the authorities intend to
rely on concessional sources of external borrowing (with the exception of financing for LHWP-II).
With the view to developing domestic debt market, they expect to expand issuance of government
domestic securities.
Next DSA could usefully provide a more in-depth analysis of the extent of public debt vulnerabilities,
including potential contingent liabilities, currency composition, and more updated data on LHWP-II.
For example, in view of the recent developments with South Africa Rand, a continued exchange rate
depreciation would increase debt service pressures for Lesotho.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate
changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level
after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Annex II. Reserve Adequacy
The optimal level of reserves –which constituting a lower bound for precautionary motives that can be
rationalized in terms of self-insurance against adverse potential external shocks faced by Lesotho’s
economy— is estimated to be around 5 months of next year’s imports. This estimate is slightly higher than
that reflected in the staff report for the 2014 Article IV Consultation because of a relatively higher fiscal
deficit over the medium term.

Lesotho’s foreign reserves remain significantly above the minimum threshold of the traditional
metrics (3 months of import, 100 percent of short-term debt, and 20 percent of broad money). As of
end June 2015, the stock of reserves stood at US$1021 which represents almost 6.5 months of next
year’s imports, 1.2 times broad money, 2.5 times M1, and [24.7] times short-term debt.
Using the cost-benefit model proposed by Dabla-Norris et al. (2011), and assuming that the
opportunity costs of reserve holdings is 4 percent, under the weak fiscal position scenario, a reserves
level covering 4.5 months of imports is considered adequate as a precautionary motive against
potential external shocks. As the fiscal position improves, a projected level of reserves covering
3.9 months of imports would be appropriate. Given these results, the authorities’ existing mediumterm target to maintain reserve coverage of at least 5 months of imports appears to be somewhat
conservative, but appropriate.

Annex III. External Sector Assessment
The estimates based on two EBA-lite models, current account and IREER, show a mixed
picture, there is a big difference between the results suggested by the two models. Using
EBA-lite current account framework indicates an undervaluation of about 8 percent with a higher CA
deficit norm at about 9 percent of GDP, compared to the projected deficit of about 6½ percent in
2015/16. The estimate based on IREER framework indicates an undervaluation of 23 percent.

EBA-lite CA Approach: The current account norm from EBA –lite is based on a cross country panel
regression, cyclical factors and desirable medium term policy levels. The EBA-lite Current account
methodology has been developed as a successor to CGER framework, which was used for previous
year assessment, and takes into account a broader set of factors such as desirable level of policies,
cyclical factors, aid and remittances.
Using the parameters from EBA-lite CA framework, it suggests a gap of about 3 percent of GDP
between the model based CA norm and the staff projected current account deficit for 2015/16 and
with a REER elasticity to current account as -0.35 results in an undervaluation of about 8 percent.

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

The one-third of the gap (about 1% of GDP) is caused by policy gap, mainly fiscal deficit, reflecting
Lesotho’s relative position to the countries in the sample (Table 1).
EBA-lite I-REER Approach: The I-REER (index-REER) approach is based on empirical studies of
exchange rate that would be consistent with the economy’s productivity, external positions and
other factors. In the case of Lesotho, the REER estimates based on the I-REER framework are volatile
and biased upward as the big dip in REER in 2002 resulted in higher country fixed effects. To
normalize this effect, staff recalculated the country fixed effect using data from 2002. But there still
remain issues with the estimates based on the I-REER model.
The loti is pegged with South African Rand and a change in reserves does not accurately reflect
pressures on the peg but purely a reflection of volatility associated with fiscal outcomes4. However
the change in the reserves position has a sizeable impact on the fitted values from the model and is
a major factor behind the large volatility with a standard deviation of about 23 percent for the gap
between the actual and the fitted REER.
Staff views:
Given these difficulties in modeling the equilibrium REER for Lesotho using the IREER framework,
staff put higher weights on estimates based on CA framework for their assessment. However, the
estimates based on current account framework are also susceptible to uncertainties pertaining to
current account projections as the quality of the data for variables used in the model and volatility
associated with SACU transfers are major concerns. SACU revenue is an important source of external
and fiscal financing and therefore has a substantial influence on Lesotho’s economy.
Given these difficulties with EBA-lite models and the current state of the Lesotho’s economy, staff
believe that the Loti is broadly in line with the current fundamentals and an improvement in
structural factors such as improving the business environment and the overall competitiveness of
the economy) should help Lesotho further strengthen its external position.
Non-Price Competitiveness Indicators: The non-price competitiveness indicators produced by the
World Bank and the World Economic Forum indicate Lesotho’s lack of competitiveness and an
unfavorable business climate for the private sector. According to the World Bank’s Doing Business
indicators (2016), Lesotho rank significantly behind the SACU neighbors in the overall "Ease of Doing
Business”, and slipped further down by four places in 2015/16 at 114 in 2016 from 110 in 2015
(Figure 2).
The survey results indicate that Lesotho is doing badly in dealing with construction permits, getting
electricity and providing access to finance for private sector and ranked behind most of the
countries in the region in these areas (Figure 2).

International reserves are mostly government deposits and accumulated out of SACU transfers.

Percent of responses
Note: From the list of factors above, respondents were asked to select the five most problematic for doing business in theircountry and
to rank them between one (most problematic) and five. The bars in the figure show the responses weighted according to their rankings.
Sources: Doing Business Indicators, World Bank and Global Competitiveness Report, World Economic Forum.

Similarly, another indicator of competitiveness, the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness
Index ranked Lesotho six positions down at 113 in 2015/16 as compared to 2014/15. Out of
140 countries covered, Lesotho ranked dismally low in health and primary education and financial
market development standing at 130 and 127 respectively. Access to finance, corruption and Policy
instability are cited as most problematic factors for doing business (Figure 2). As per the survey

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

conducted by the World Economic Forum asking respondents to rank up to top five problems in the
economy, about one-third of them ranked access to finance as one of the major problem.
In the environment of weak global demand, particularly a prolonged slowdown in South Africa, and
increased competition from with-in the region, Lesotho faces a big task in achieving exports and
private sector led growth, as envisaged under the National Strategic Development Plan.
The authorities are aware of these challenges and have implemented several measures to improve
the business climate. Substantial progress has been made in reducing the obstacles to doing
business through several measures, including a one-stop facility for investors, measures to reduce
the cost and time required to open up a business; and the creation of a credit bureau and a
commercial court. However the overall progress has been slow and efforts to create a businessfriendly environment should be pushed aggressively to give confidence to the private sector.
Conclusion: Further strengthening external stability will require significant improvements in nonprice competitiveness indicators. Several indicators measuring the business environment (including
the World Bank’s Doing Business, the Global Competitiveness Index) rank Lesotho relatively poorly.
Difficulties in access to financing, corruption, inadequate infrastructure and lack of skilled labor force
are among the main factors contributing to this. Besides improving on these measures, adopting
policies to provide greater scope for the private sector will be important going forward. In this
context, consideration should be given to greater reliance on the private sector not only to generate
employment, but also to improve the country’s competitiveness.

Annex IV. Macro-Financial Risks and Conditions
This note discusses two methodologies to help assess macro-financial linkages and risks to
the banking system in Lesotho. First, we empirically examine the feedback between credit to
private sector and economic performance in Lesotho using quarterly data over the period
2002–2014. We use a standard reduced form Vector Auto Regressions (VARs) and rely on impulse
response functions (IRFs) to examine the interrelations among variables. Second, we apply the
Country Financial Stability Map methodology developed by the MCM department to Lesotho
banking system.
Overview of the Banking System
Lesotho’s banking system is comprised of four banks, three of which are subsidiaries of South

However, the financial sector is not immune to risks. Personal loans account for the largest share
of banks’ assets, and there is potential vulnerability from cross-border contagion from South Africa.
The financial system also suffered some negative repercussions of the financial crisis, despite its
relative isolation from the global capital markets, largely due to the crisis’ impact on the South
African economy. A significant drop of remittances from South Africa would also likely have negative
impact of the personal loans’ quality in Lesotho.
Macro-Financial Linkages
Macro shocks affect the financial sector through increased credit risk that could undermine
the solvency of banks. Since a growing economy increases business opportunities and capacity to
service debt, a positive shock to the economy is expected to be positively correlated with credit to
private sector growth. On the other hand, a negative shock to the economy can lead to increased
non-performing loans (NPLs) which in turn would erode banks’ earnings. Anecdotally, one major
bank, reported that a slowdown in smaller-scale construction contracts, notably for building health
clinics and schools that were financed by assistance from development partners, has greatly reduced

demand for credit by businesses. Shocks to the banking sector may also feedback to the macroeconomy through consumption and investment.
To analyze the correlations between credit to private sector and economic growth, we use the
following reduced from VAR:
=α+

+…

+

Where yt is a set of endogenous variables with p lags. Due to lack of data, we considered the
following variables: Credit to private sector, GDP, inflation rates, exchange rates, and prime lending
rates over the period 2002-2014. To inform model specification, we conduct the Augmented DickeyFuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) unit root tests to test for stationarity of the variables. The results
of these tests show all our variables are integrated of order one. Also, the results for cointegration
tests implying that there is at least one cointegration equation at the 5.0 percent confidence level in
each model.
All impulse-responses in our VAR analysis come from a typical estimation where we chose the lag
order of two.1 The IRFs presented in Figure 1 show that credit to private sector both affects on and
responses to GDP. A positive shock to GDP leads to an increase in private sector credit, and vise
versa. When GDP increases by one standard deviation, credit to private sector increase by
0.01 percentage point during the first quarter. By the fourth quarter, GDP is 0.1 percentage point
higher than before the shock to private sector credit.

Financial Stability Map
In this section, we use the Country Financial Stability Map methodology developed by the Monetary
and Capital Markets (MCM) department to Lesotho banking system. It describes the development of
macro-financial risks and conditions, with four risk indices (macroeconomic risks; inward spillover
risks; credit risks; and market and liquidity risks) and two macro-financial condition indices (risk
appetite; and monetary and financial conditions). It also compares changes in financial stability for
Lesotho versus other SACU members.
The Lesotho financial stability risks moderately rise and rotate. Market and liquidity risks,
macroeconomic risks, and credit risks have elevated in 2014 compared to 2010 while inward
spillover risks have improved. Monetary and financial conditions have become tighter, and risk
appetite has become higher.


Macroeconomic risks are
elevated as the economic
growth remains low. This is
mainly driven by deteriorated
fiscal and external positions,
and higher inflation.

5. Monetary and financial
conditions

Note: Away from center signifies higher risks, easier monetary and financial
conditions, or higher risk appetite.



Credit risks are higher compared to 2010, owing in part to the increase in NPLs, which has
led to low profitability and weakened bank balance sheets, as well as a higher public debt to
GDP ratio.



Monetary and financial conditions have tightened, mainly driven by tighter availability of
domestic bank credit.



Market and liquidity risks appear to have increased significantly, mainly driven by increased
loan to deposit ratio and higher gross foreign liability of banking sector to GDP.



Risk appetite slightly increased, mainly driven by higher volatility of exchange rate
movement and higher share of gross portfolio inflows to GDP.

Safeguards Assessment
An update safeguards assessment, completed in November 2012, confirmed that the CBL has
taken steps to strengthen safeguards since the 2010 assessment, but also that risks remain.
Deloitte (South Africa), appointed as the CBL's external auditor in 2010, has since completed the
audits of financial years 2010 to 2014 within the three-month statutory deadline and issued an
unqualified audit opinion following each audit. Since the 2012 assessment, aspects of the
monetary data reporting process have been strengthened with IMF technical assistance. However,
audit oversight and internal audit remain areas where improvements are needed to strengthen
overall governance and accountability.
Exchange arrangement:
Lesotho is a member of the Common Monetary Area (CMA) and the Lesotho loti is both de facto
and de jure pegged at par to the South African Rand, which is also legal tender in the country.
Lesotho has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Articles of
Agreement and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. Lesotho maintains one exchange restriction arising
from single discretionary allowances of M1 million per individual per calendar year, for residents
over 18, and of M200,000 on the same basis for residents under 18. The availability of foreign
exchange beyond these limits is subject to a discretionary approval on a case by case basis. As of
October 30, 2015, the maloti rate per U.S. dollar was M13.88.
Article IV consultation:
The 2014 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on June 4, 2014. Lesotho is
on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle.
Technical assistance
The Fund has been providing Lesotho with technical assistance and training to help authorities
strengthen their capacity to design and implement effective policies. Technical assistance covers
wide range of areas in macroeconomic, fiscal, and monetary. Specific technical assistance projects
since 2008 are the following:
Fiscal Affairs Department
Public financial management
Tax policy
Improving revenue administration fundamentals
Resources and non-mining taxation
Tax policy and mining fiscal regimes

Lesotho—Statistical Issues Appendix
As of end-October 2015
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance with some key data shortcomings in fiscal and external sector
statistics.
National Accounts: Bureau of Statistics (BOS) compiles and reports national accounts statistics on an annual basis. Statistical
methods used to derive GDP have improved and new sources of data were developed, although serious challenges remain.
National accounts were revised and rebased in 2008 and 2009. New sources of data, including VAT records, the 2008 labor
force survey, 2010–11 household budget survey, household consumption surveys, and ongoing economic census (business
survey) have improved the quality of the national accounts. Annual GDP estimates in current prices and volume terms from
the production, expenditure, and income sides are currently produced and published by the BLS. Other macroeconomic
indicators, such as high-frequency industrial production/trade indices, are used to monitor developments during the year.
The source data needs to be improved by developing high quality data on intermediate consumption for key economic
activities, intra-SACU exports and imports, and gross fixed capital formation in machinery and equipment, and formal and
informal construction activities. Private consumption and gross fixed capital formation are now estimated within the
framework of a supply and use table, although a discrepancy between supply and use leads to a discrepancy between GDP
by activity and expenditure. BOS, with the help of Fund’s TA, intends to begin compiling quarterly national account series.
Price Statistics: The official monthly consumer price index (CPI), a composite of urban and rural price data, is available on a
timely basis. The index has been re-referenced to March 2010=100, using 2002/03 Household Budget Survey. The work on
developing producer and export price indices is ongoing. In the meantime, the national accounts rely on South Africa’s
producer price index and import price indices, used as deflators for imports from SACU- and non-SACU countries,
respectively.
Government Finance Statistics (GFS): The compilation of GFS is consistent with GFSM 2001, although the quality, timelines,
and periodicity of data have shortcomings. GFS are not provided on a regular basis and the quality of data remains poor, as
indicated by significant discrepancies between transactions above and below the line. GFS are compiled from the Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), supplemented with data from the Lesotho Revenue Authority (LRA), other
government departments and units and the banking system. Teething problems experienced with phasing in the IFMIS and
in the absence of monthly reconciliation of all Treasury accounts, the coverage of revenue and expenditure data could be
incomplete The authorities have been working with international partners, including the EU, the World Bank, and FAD on
improving the functionality of the IFMIS and launching monthly reconciliation of all Treasury accounts. GFS is compiled for
central government and general government statistics are not available.
Monetary and Financial Statistics (MFS): The Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL) reports monetary data on a regular basis based
on Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), with monthly data disseminated through the IFS. Improved data sources helped
improve classification and sectorization of accounts. The institutional coverage of MFS needs to be expanded to include
other depository and other financial corporations.
Financial sector surveillance: The CBL has begun the process of compiling FSIs on a consistent basis and started by
recreating consistent FSIs since 2006. FSIs on depository corporations are reported on a quarterly basis with a lag. However,
FSIs on non-financial corporations, households, and real estate markets are not available. A recent mission visited Maseru
during April 7–April 11, 2014 to assist CBL staff in the compilation of FSIs according to the FSIs Compilation Guide and work
with CBL staff to disseminate the FSI data and metadata on the IMF’s FSI website.
External Sector statistics: Lesotho benefited from technical assistance provided by STA on the compilation of external
sector statistics. Until recently, the CBL compiled and disseminated detailed quarterly balance of payments data in
accordance with BPM5. The April 2014 technical assistance mission assisted the CBL in converting the quarterly balance of
payments and international investment position (IIP) to the BPM6 framework, which eliminated a number of errors and
inconsistencies in data. From the subsequent release, data will be published under BPM6 format. External debt database
includes outstanding and contracted loans, their currency composition, debt service and amortization, as well as scheduled
future disbursements and debt servicing. The centralized database for external grants has not been regularly updated.
Data Standards and Quality
Lesotho is a GDDS participant. GDDS metadata have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board since
August 2003. Currently, Lesotho participates as a pilot country in enhanced GDDS (e-GDDS).
