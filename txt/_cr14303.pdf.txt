STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
September 5, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context: Ethiopia’s investment-led development strategy has delivered robust growth
and progress toward Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Restrained fiscal and
monetary policies have helped maintain macroeconomic stability, although the financing
mode of the continuing large-scale investment through public enterprises could risk
undermining macroeconomic stability. A cautious policy stance will be critical in
preserving the recent gains.
Focus of the consultation: The discussions centered on policies to sustain strong
economic growth and promote structural transformation. Issues covered included: (i) the
policy mix to preserve macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability; (ii) the public
sector investment program and its financing; and (iii) financial deepening, export
competitiveness and the business climate.
Outlook and Risks: Growth is expected to remain strong, driven mainly by agriculture
and services. Inflation should continue to remain in single digits, in line with a tight
monetary policy. Key downside risks include insufficient financing for infrastructure
investment in the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP), lower prices of main export
commodities, and weather-related shocks, particularly a drought.
Policy mix: Staff recommendations focused on sustaining a cautious policy stance,
prioritization of public investments and closer monitoring of state-owned enterprises to
ensure prudent borrowing in the context of a medium-term debt management strategy,
enhancing export competitiveness, greater resource mobilization and development of
the financial sector, and a more prominent role for the private sector. Structural
improvements in the functioning of the money and foreign exchange market and
building foreign reserves to at least three months of imports were suggested to enhance
resiliency. The need for greater interest rate and exchange rate flexibility and improved
competitiveness of the traded goods sector, including through exchange rate
adjustment, was underscored.

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

BACKGROUND
1.
Ethiopia’s development strategy is geared toward economic and social development
(Box 1). Pro-poor economic growth over the last decade has led to a considerable increase in per
capita GDP and an impressive drop in the national poverty rate (Figures 1 and 2).1 Significant
progress has been made in achieving the MDGs, including: increased immunization and reduced
child mortality; higher enrollment rates in primary schools; and better water sources and sanitation
facilities (Table 7). Despite the progress, however, the poorest of the poor are yet to benefit to the
same extent.

Box 1. Ethiopia: The Growth and Transformation Plan 2010/11–2014/15
Ethiopia’s development strategy is implemented through a succession of five-year national plans. The current
plan—The Growth and Transformation Plan” (GTP)—spans 2010/11–2014/15 and is aimed at sustaining rapid,
broad and equitable economic growth, and achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG). The longer-term
objective is to eradicate poverty, bring about structural transformation of the economy and reach a
middle-income status by 2020–25.
The GTP projects an average growth rate of 11.2 percent over the 5 year plan period in the base case. The plan
seeks to ensure sustainability of growth by pursuing its objectives within a stable macroeconomic framework.
Among its strategic pillars are: sustaining rapid and equitable economic growth; maintaining agriculture as a major
source of economic growth; creating conditions for industry to play a key role in the economy; enhancing
expansion and quality of infrastructure and social development; building capacity and deepening good
governance; and promoting gender and youth empowerment and equity.
The structural transformation of the country is pursued through scaled-up public investments, such as in roads,
railroads, hydro-electric generation plants, sugar factories, housing, and other projects. The strategy also assumes
maintaining high share of fiscal spending to support human capital development, including through education,
and technical and vocational trainings.1
1 The macroeconomic objectives and the government development strategy for 2010/11 and 2014/15 envisaged in the Growth and Transformation
Plan are discussed in: The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia: 2013 Article IV Consultation, Country Report No 13/308, IMF, October, 2013

Developments in indicators of living standards and welfare are promising. The Human
Development Index shows Ethiopia performing better than many low-income countries.2 Income
distribution, as indicated by the Gini coefficient (.336), is relatively less skewed than other
low—income countries. Ethiopia also scores better than the median African country on governance
attributes—especially social welfare, education and health (Figure 3).
3.
Sustained and robust growth has helped to alleviate unemployment in urban areas.
Overall unemployment in urban areas declined to 16.5 percent in 2013 from 20.4 percent in 2009
(Figure 4). Both female and male unemployment has fallen and the gap between the two groups has
narrowed. Still, the unemployment remains high, especially among young females.
4.
The recommendations of the 2013 Article IV consultation have only been partially
implemented. Tight monetary policy has kept inflation in the single digits and reduced negative
real interest rates. There has been little progress in improving liquidity management and the
functioning of the money and foreign exchange markets. Some efforts are being undertaken toward
enhancing the business environment, especially access to credit for the private sector, but the main
emphasis continues to be on physical infrastructure, which is believed to crowd-in the private sector
in the long-run.

The Human Development Index is a composite index of life expectancy, education and income, and it is used to
rank countries in terms of human development; the index is published by the United Nations. The Mo Ibrahim Index
provides assessment of governance in African countries; compiled annually in partnership with experts from African
institutions.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Developments
5.
The economy continues to grow fast in 2013/14 on the heels of very strong real GDP
growth in 2012/13. Based on the preliminary information on crop and cereal production and
industrial production spurred by large-scale public and foreign direct investments, staff projects the
economic growth in the 8.0–8.5 percent range in 2013/14 and 2014/15. Staff projections incorporate
a downward adjustment from official figures to take into account the uncertainty around the
underlying growth rate due to weaknesses in the national account statistics. The authorities’
projections are more optimistic (in the 11.0–11.4 percent range).
6.
Fiscal policy at the general government level remains cautious. The general government
budget execution in 2013/14 reflects conservative spending. Recurrent spending is estimated to
remain at 7.4 percent of GDP, and the capital spending-to-GDP ratio will only increase by about
0.3 percentage points to 11.0 percent of GDP. Although tax revenue-to-GDP is estimated to improve
in 2013/14, the overall revenue-to-GDP ratio is estimated to fall from about 14.6 in 2012/13 to
about 14.1 in 2013/14, mainly on account of nontax revenue, as state-owned enterprises were
allowed to retain earnings for reinvestment instead of paying dividends to the government. The staff
estimates the general government budget deficit, including grants, to be 2.7 percent of GDP in
2013/14, compared to 2.0 percent of GDP a year ago.
7.
Public enterprises continue to provide an expansionary impulse, absorbing much of
available credit and foreign exchange. They borrowed heavily from the banking system and
externally to finance their investments. Banking system credit flow to public enterprises in the first
ten months of 2013/14 was some 4 percent of GDP, not taking into account non-bank financing of
6

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

the Grand Renaissance Dam. Based on the first ten months of the current fiscal year, external
borrowing by these enterprises is likely to reach 3.3 percent of GDP for the year. Consequently, the
financing of the overall public sector is likely to have been on the order of 10 percent of GDP. Public
and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt is estimated to increase to about 23 percent of GDP in
2013/14 from 20.5 percent of GDP in 2012/13.
8.
Tight monetary policy has supported achieving the NBE’s inflation objective in
2013/14. Inflation remained in the single digits throughout the year and was 8.5 percent in
June 2014, with food prices rising by 6.2 percent and non-food inflation stubbornly in the
double-digits.3 Base money, the nominal anchor of the monetary policy, increased by 17.5 percent in
April 2014, driven mainly by claims on government (by 19.6 percent) and to lower degree by claims
on non-government (by 11.2 percent). Other items net (OIN) contracted significantly, reflecting the
redemption of the National Bank of Ethiopia’s (NBE’s) certificates of deposit (CDs) issued to private
banks in 2013 to offset the potential liquidity injection from a reduction in the reserve
requirements.4
9.
The developments in the external sector present a mixed picture, with a substantial
deterioration in the trade balance offset by net inflows on services and transfers. The
weakening of trade balance reflects a sharp decline in the price and volume of Ethiopia’s main
commodity goods (coffee and gold) due to subdued external demand conditions. This was offset,
however, by solid volume growth in other exports such as oilseeds, pulses, leather products, live
animals, and flowers. Demand for imports remained strong, driven by the investment-led economic
growth. Imports of goods are estimated to increase by 12.7 percent in 2013/14, led by fertilizers,
petroleum products, and capital goods.
10.
Expanding services exports partly made up for the large trade deficit. Transportation
and travel service exports performed well in 2013/14, boosted by the aggressive expansion of
Ethiopian Airlines and growing tourism. Private and official transfers also increased in FY2013/14,
reflecting continuing strong growth in remittances. The current account deficit, nonetheless, is
estimated to have widened from US$2.8 billion (6.0 percent of GDP) in 2012/13 to US$3.5 billion in
2013/14 (7.1 percent of GDP). It was financed largely by concessional and non-concessional inflows
as well as by foreign direct investment (FDI). Substantial inflows on the capital account also
facilitated a modest build up in the NBE’s reserves.

3

Non-food inflation has been driven mostly by higher cost of housing, water, electricity and gas.

4

In March 2013, after lowering reserve requirements on deposits from 10 to 5 percent, the NBE issued CDs to
sterilize liquidity. Holdings of CDs were recorded under OIN, and all the commercial banks were obligated to allocate
the difference stemming from the lowering of reserve requirements in the NBE’s instrument. The CDs held by private
commercial banks with 1 year maturity were redeemed in March and April 2014, returning liquidity to the system.

11.
Despite import-related demand for foreign exchange, the exchange rate adjusted only
gradually, in line with the NBE’s managed float policy. While the premium in the parallel market
remained modest (4.6 percent in May), the gradual nominal depreciation was likely insufficient to
address excess demand for foreign exchange, and prevent an appreciation of the real effective
exchange rate and loss of competitiveness.

B. Medium Term Outlook and Risks
12.
Outlook. Overall economic growth is projected to remain strong (in the upper single digits)
in the coming years, but may fall short of the government’s ambitious targets. Constraints on
domestic and external financing for large-scale public investment; an uncertain external
environment with anemic recovery of Ethiopia’s main trading partners; and a lack of supportive
policies for private sector development are among the downside risks to the outlook. Inflation is
projected to remain in the single digits, but given the stickiness in non-food prices it is expected to
remain in upper range of the NBE’s objective. The current account deficit as a percentage of GDP is
expected to improve, conditional on the government’s efforts toward diversification of the export
base and boosting productivity of export-oriented industries bearing fruit.
13.
Risks. Despite a generally positive outlook, Ethiopia is subject to risks. These include:
(i) constraints on the financing of a large public sector investment program; (ii) sustained decline in
commodities prices and the re-emergence of foreign exchange shortages; (iii) slower recovery in
advanced economies and growth slowdown in the major emerging market countries; and
(iv) weather-related shocks, particularly a drought in the Horn of Africa (Table 1).

Policy Response

External Risks
Advanced economies:

High

The impact of such a shock
would include less demand for
commodities; as a result
commodity prices would decline
and reduce export earnings.

Restrain fiscal policy, while
shielding low-income and
vulnerable households.

Emerging markets (EMs):
Maturing of the cycle, and
incomplete structural reforms
leading to prolonged slower
growth.

High

A prolonged slower growth in
EMs would lead to commodity
price decline with a negative
impact on Ethiopian exports. It
would result in severe shortfalls
of financing (especially from
China), and a decline in
remittances and FDIs. The
financing of the GTP would be
jeopardized with significantly
slower growth.

Restrain fiscal policy while
shielding low-income and
vulnerable households, in
particular appropriate scaling
down public enterprises
borrowings and public
investment.

Growth slowdown in China:
Continued buildup and
eventual unwinding of excess
capacity, subsequently
resulting in a sharp growth
slowdown and large financial
and fiscal losses
(medium-term).

Medium

FDI from China, which has been
rising rapidly across sectors,
could decrease, slowing
development of newly emerging
export sectors, like textile and
leather manufacturing. Major
infrastructure investments,
particularly in power, telecom,
rails and roads, may not be fully
financed, delaying the
implementation of the GTP and
slowing down the growth.

Prioritize and pace the largescale investment.

Sustained decline in
commodity prices triggered by
deceleration of global demand
and leading to prolonged
foreign exchange shortages.

Medium

It would lead to export revenue
shortfall, which in turn would
negatively affect the import of
goods, e.g., fertilizers, petroleum
products and capital goods. The
latter, required for continuing
investment-led development
strategy may negatively impact
sustaining high and long-term
economic growth. Rapid
devaluation, leading to higher
inflation and larger fiscal deficit.

Undertake the structural
reforms aimed at:
(i) improvements in
productivity of exportoriented industries,
(ii) diversification of export
base, (iii) reforming
functioning of foreign
exchange market and buildup
of foreign reserves to
3 months of import cover, and
(iv) removing binding
constraints on business
operations.

Lingering recovery process,
with lower-than-anticipated
potential growth and
persistently low inflation due to
a failure to fully address
legacies of the financial crisis,
leading to global stagnation.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of Fund staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment
of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views
on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually
exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
Ethiopia has achieved considerable success in implementing its development strategy,
but sustaining it is increasingly challenging. Recent macroeconomic stability, with robust
economic growth and single digit inflation, is not fully entrenched in the presence of negative real
interest rates, an overvalued exchange rate, and low reserve coverage. Growth has also fluctuated in
the context of global and domestic shocks and the country remains vulnerable to terms of trade
shocks. Export diversification and competitiveness lag behind those of other African countries.
15.
Achieving high growth rates set out in the GTP requires continued investments and
resource mobilization. The GTP envisages a significant part of investment to be undertaken by
public enterprises with average annual borrowing over the five year period of some 15 percent of
GDP, of which some two-thirds is to be borrowed externally. With binding external financing
constraints, critical investments need to be financed increasingly from domestic sources, implying a
need to mobilize substantial domestic savings.
16.
The current level of domestic savings is insufficient to finance the high public
investment. The relatively low GDP per capita means that the scope for substantial mobilization of
domestic savings in the short run is limited. At the same time, the government’s policy of keeping
the real interest rates negative is not conducive to saving and distorts financial intermediation.
Experience in the first three years of the GTP suggests that large scale public investment financed
domestically squeezes the availability of credit for the rest of the economy. Thus, an adjustment in
policies to establish better balance between the public and private sectors is warranted. There is also

a risk that the investment levels envisaged under the development strategy may run up against the
absorptive capacity of the economy.
Box 2. Ethiopia: The Macroeconomic Implications of Scaling up Infrastructure and Energy
Investments1
Staff discussed with the authorities the macroeconomic effects of scaling up public investment using
a variant of the open-economy Debt, Investment, and Growth (DIG) model developed by Buffie et al
(2012). The benchmark DIG model features domestic production of traded and non-traded goods, public
investment in infrastructure, alternative financing mechanisms (external concessional, external commercial,
and domestic), and fiscal rules that target debt sustainability. The customized model for Ethiopia also
incorporates: (i) a state-owned energy sector that exports electricity to neighboring countries and sells to
firms and households at controlled, low prices; (ii) a state-owned banking sector that fixes interest rates and
lends a large fraction of deposits to the public sector.
The model and the investment program were calibrated to capture the key characteristics of
Ethiopia’s GTP. The calibration assumes high rates of return to infrastructure (20 percent) and energy
(30 percent) as well as large efficiency gains from construction of the Renaissance Dam.2 Consistent with the
big-push investment program envisioned by the GTP, the simulations postulate very rapid increases in
energy investment and more gradual increases in other infrastructure investment. The stock of infrastructure
capital doubles in the long run, while the path for energy investment and the efficiency gains from the
Renaissance Dam increase total energy supply four-fold (300 percent) at the 10-year horizon. The gap
between investment outlays and concessional loans was covered by a combination of fiscal adjustment and
either additional borrowing from the domestic banking system or additional external commercial borrowing.
The simulations reveal that, despite positive long-run growth effects, transition challenges and tradeoffs accompany the different financing strategies. Reliance on domestic bank borrowing requires
substantial fiscal adjustment to prevent macroeconomic instability—transfers need to decrease by more
than 5 percent of GDP within two years (blue line Figure 6). The surge in public investment also crowds out
private investment and triggers a sharp increase in inflation in the short run. By contrast, external
commercial borrowing relaxes the national budget constraint. The extra resources allow public investment to
increase without cuts in recurrent expenditure, temporary crowding-out of private investment, and a sharp
increase in inflation (red lines with dots). These gains have to be balanced against the risks associated with
significant increases in the ratios of non-concessional debt and total external debt to GDP. The tradeoffs in
other scenarios involving gradual increases in energy prices and slower scaling up of public investment were
also analyzed.

Prepared by Felipe Zana from the IMF’s Research Department based on a general equilibrium model to analyze the
growth effects and tradeoffs in financing the scaling up of various public investments, as discussed in the accompanying
Selected Issues paper.

2

The macroeconomic effects of the large-scale public investments, including on growth, depend on the structural
conditions of the economy. The baseline calibration of key parameters, such as the rates of return on infrastructure and
energy, and the efficiency of public investment are favorable and yield positive medium-to long-run macroeconomic
effects. Under less favorable calibration, reflecting weaker structural conditions, the positive effects could be significantly
diminished.

Staff’s baseline projections assume the continuation of current policies (Table 2).These
include constraints on private banking operations, directed lending with artificially low real interest
rates, and allocation of foreign exchange to government’s priority sectors. Without policy
adjustment, sustained high growth sought by the authorities over the long-term may not be
achievable. Scaled-up public investment financed by domestic borrowing risks generating
inflationary and further crowding out the private sector. In absence of policy correction, the staff
estimates growth tapering in the medium-term to the 7.5–8.5 percent range, below that targeted by
the authorities.
18.
Policy discussions focused on sustaining high economic growth while preserving
macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. Key recommendations include (i) rationalizing
and prioritizing public sector investment, especially for state-owned enterprises; (ii) real and external
sector reforms to support structural transformation; (iii) strengthening financial sector policies to
promote inclusiveness and market development, bringing real interest rates to positive levels, and
ensuring more flexible exchange rates and higher exchange reserves; and (iv) improving the
business environment and expanding the private sector’s role in the economy. The implementation
of these recommendations would facilitate financial development that should enable less
distortionary financing of the GTP that is consistent with debt sustainability.

14

19.
Staff’s alternative scenario, which assumes implementation of the corrective policies
mentioned above, yields stronger growth, while safeguarding macroeconomic stability and
reducing vulnerabilities (Table 6). Under this scenario, the growth rate is projected to rise to
10.5 percent by 2018/19, inflation is targeted to decline to 6 percent by 2015/16, and current
account deficit is estimated to narrow to 2.2 percent of GDP. Positive real interest rates will help to
mobilize deposits, more flexible and better adjusted exchange rate will improve the competitiveness
of exports, and private sector’s access to credit from the banking system will increase.

A. Fiscal Policy and Public Sector Enterprises
20.
The fiscal stance embodied in 2014/15 general government budget is appropriately
restrained (Tables 3a and 3b). Owing to government’s revenue mobilization efforts, the
revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase from about 14.1 percent in 2013/14 to 14.5 percent in
2014/15. Reflecting the ongoing efforts to improve tax revenue collection, the tax-to-GDP ratio is
projected to rise from 13.0 percent 2013/14 to 13.3 percent in 2014/15 but nontax revenue will
remain broadly the same on account of the continuation dividends retaining policy for state-owned
enterprises. The 2014/15 budget targets the general government deficit at 3 percent of GDP, to be
financed in part by the NBE. Staff reiterated, as in the 2013 Article IV consultation, the importance of
refraining or strictly limiting recourse to deficit financing by NBE.
21.
Revenue mobilization remains a challenge and compares unfavorably with regional
peers, reflecting the limited private sector tax base. Tax-to-GDP ratio in Ethiopia was
12.5 percent in 2013 compared to about 23 percent in Kenya, 19 percent in Mauritius, and
17 percent in Tanzania. Tax revenue could be boosted by broadening the tax base (especially by
promoting private sector activity), strengthening customs and tax administration. The expansion of
cash registry machine should continue and be strengthened with unannounced site visits by
inspectors to minimize fraudulent or tax avoidance behaviors by tax payers. The cash registry
machines also need to be introduced in the remaining three regions and tax payer education
enhanced.
22.
Progress has been made on the Ethiopian Revenues and Custom Authority’s (ERCA)
reform agenda and further progress on implementation is needed. Taxpayer compliance and
ERCA’s record on the achievement of revenue targets in the context of already low tax
revenue-to-GDP ratio are weak. The authorities should intensify efforts to develop and implement a
national Compliance Management and Enforcement Strategy and an Enterprise Risk Management
Strategy. Priority areas where ERCA’s management needs to focus include: (i) compliance,
particularly with respect to registration, arrears collection, underreporting, and VAT refund; (ii) staff
retention as ERCA is experiencing high attrition rates of well trained staff; and (iii) ethics and
integrity.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

23.
Staff encouraged the authorities to consider the revenue potential of reducing tax
expenditure and tax incentives and improved tax collection.5 In particular, full implementation of
the ERCA’s reform agenda with a view to realizing tax revenues at levels close to regional
comparators should be considered. Staff alternative scenario, assuming the implementation of the
IMF FAD recommendations, indicate a possible annual tax revenue gain of up to 3 percentage
points of GDP over the next five years.
24.
Spending continues to have a strong pro-poor focus and the 2014/15 budget is in line
with this policy. The ratio of poverty-reducing expenditure to GDP is being kept steady despite
resource constraints, while defense spending is declining as a ratio of GDP. Poverty-related
expenditures (including those financed by external project loans) amounted to more than
12 percent of GDP in 2012/13. This is estimated to be the same in 2013/14 as well as in the 2014/15
budget.
25.
The expansionary impulse from public enterprises is contributing to a build-up of
domestic and external imbalances. Staff stressed the need for establishing the consolidated fiscal
position, which includes public enterprises, as an overall fiscal anchor in the long-run in order to
comprehensively assess the macroeconomic impact of the activities of public enterprises and
sustainability of their financing. Staff made the case for reducing domestic public sector borrowing
by either prioritizing and gradually phasing in certain investment projects or attracting more
external financing at appropriate terms (including concessional loans and foreign direct investment).
26.
Public enterprises and banks continue to be a source of significant build-up of
contingent liabilities for the government. Lack of detailed information on their financial situation,
including revenue stream, structure of expenditures, financing, and debt make it difficult to
comprehensively assess the overall public sector finances. Staff advised the authorities to establish a
high-level mechanism to start gathering data on the consolidated public sector, including public
enterprises. It stressed the importance of timely financial statements of all major public enterprises
for establishing the overall fiscal anchor. In this regard, it would be desirable to establish a specific
timeline for the disclosure of audited financial statements of public enterprises.
27.
Public financial management (PFM) reforms are progressing and yielding
improvements in the budgetary processes. Program-based budgeting is in the third year of full
implementation at the federal government level. For regional governments, the roll out is planned
and the road map has been prepared. Cash management reform, with the aim of reducing idle cash
in the various government accounts and improving the quality of fiscal reporting, is progressing
well. Staff stressed the need to maintain the momentum in these areas.

5

Since 2012 FAD has undertaken a series of TA missions that have made specific recommendations for rationalizing
tax incentives and tax expenditures.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

Authorities’ views
28.
The authorities broadly concur with staff assessment of the fiscal sector at the general
government level, in particular as regards revenue mobilization. They expect the planned
administrative measures to deliver substantial revenue increases but stress the need for continued
technical assistance from the Fund and other developments partners to support their efforts.
However, they disagree on the importance of an overall consolidated fiscal anchor including public
enterprises and questioned the meaningfulness of overall debt sustainability of the consolidated
public sector. In their view, debts of public enterprises without explicit guarantees do not represent
contingent liabilities of the government. At the same time, they agreed on the need to monitor the
financial situation of public enterprises and indicated their intention for establishing an agency for
doing so.

B. Public Sector Debt
29.
Accumulation of external debt accelerated in 2012/13 and 2013/14. The stock of
outstanding public sector external debt reached US$12.2 billion in the first half of FY2013/14 and
was US$ 11.2 billion at the end of FY2012/13, reflecting mainly additional concessional multilateral
loans. Of the additional loans disbursed in FY2012/13 and first half of FY2013/14
(about US$2.4 billion, including Ethiopian Airlines), one third was for transport and communication
sector, 18 percent for electricity related projects and 12 percent for highways. Debt service
payments have increased in recent years, but favorable terms have kept the debt burden at low
levels.
30.
Domestic debt has grown with the financing needs of the general government. Total
domestic debt was about 16.9 percent of GDP at the end of FY2012/13, 60 percent of which was
accounted for by direct advances from NBE, 28 percent by treasury bills, and 13 percent by
government bonds held mostly by NBE and Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE).
31.
The risk of external and public debt distress remains low, but is on the cusp of
transition to moderate. External debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase further in the
medium-term and return to low levels in the long-run. Large disbursements associated with the
implementation of investments projects under the GTP are projected during the next 6 to 7 fiscal
years, with non-concessional disbursements increasing from around US$1 billion in FY2014/15 to
US$ 2.5 billion in FY2016/17, and remaining above US$1 billion until FY2018/19.
32.
The authorities need to monitor closely the debt levels and the terms and conditions
of the new loans. Debt indicators and sensitivity analysis suggest that Ethiopia is on the border line
of low and moderate risk of debt distress. Potential changes in the risk assessment from low to
moderate can be triggered by a terms-of-trade shock, and higher than projected external debt.
Thus, prudent borrowing levels in the context of a medium-term debt management strategy
remains key to sustaining low risk of debt distress.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

Authorities’ views
33.
Authorities do not concur with the staff’s assessment of the public debt. They maintain
that Ethiopian-Telecom liabilities, like those of Ethiopian Airlines, are not guaranteed by the
government and hence should not be added to government debt. They explain that both these
entities operate as commercial enterprises. Ethiopian Airlines discloses audited annual financial
statements and Ethiopian-Telecom is in the process of doing so.

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
34.
Monetary policy stance has been consistent with keeping inflation in single digits. Base
money growth in 2013/14 was in line with the NBE’s inflation objective, helped by limited recourse
to the NBE for financing the budget. Staff stressed that, with inflation hovering toward the upper
end of the authorities’ target and the persistently high non-food inflation exacerbating the
vulnerability to food price shocks as well as the potential expansionary effect of private banks’
redemption of CDs issued to them by NBE last year to offset the reduction in reserve requirements,
monetary policy stance would need to be cautious and consistent with further consolidating the
gains on inflation and supporting high economic growth. The authorities indicated that monetary
policy will remain anchored on base money and in line with nominal GDP growth at 18 percent in
2014/15.
35.
Staff argued that conditions were ripe for developing market-based instruments of
indirect monetary control. A key requirement for the effective use of such instruments of liquidity
control would be nominal interest rate flexibility. Since the prevailing interest rates on treasury bills
are unlikely to be attractive, there is a need to gradually raise interest rates to activate the treasury
bills market. This should reduce the reliance on direct measures for liquidity management, improve
the monetary transmission mechanism, and establish a benchmark yield-curve, allowing for the
pricing of other financial instruments. It will also help to create pre-conditions for the use of treasury
bills as collateral for interbank transactions and improve functioning of liquidity facilities at the NBE
that are important for better liquidity management at commercial banks.
36.
The NBE bill purchase requirement continues to severely constrain private commercial
bank operations. The measure, introduced in 2011, requires commercial banks to purchase NBE
bills equivalent to 27 percent of the new loan disbursements. It was intended to fund the
Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE) to provide project financing in priority areas at preferential
interest rates, but it has only been partially effective in this regard given that a significant proportion
of such funding has been invested by DBE in treasury bills.6 In the presence of the reserve
requirement, the liquidity requirement, and an additional requirement for banks to hold 40 percent
of their loans in short-term credits, this measure remains a major distortion in financial
intermediation and should be phased out.

6

Owing to long lead time for project appraisal and approval at DBE and prudential limits on single borrowers.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

37.
Consistency between monetary and exchange rate policies is important to ensure
orderly conditions in credit and foreign exchange markets. This requires regular presence of the
NBE to achieve its exchange rate objective, but the NBE’s limited liquidity instruments and reserve
cushion make this difficult.7 Insufficient adjustment in the pricing of credit and foreign exchange
means that excess credit or foreign exchange demand is not adequately addressed. Staff stressed
that better market functioning and price setting mechanisms for the exchange rate, along with
greater interest rate and exchange rate flexibility are needed, not only to clear the foreign exchange
market, but also to promote the competitiveness of the traded goods sector. The NBE’s objective to
increase its foreign exchange reserve by US$300 million to US$3.0 billion (about 1.9 months of
imports) by the end of 2014/15 and further to the equivalent of 3 months of imports over the
medium run is a step in right direction that could be facilitated by improvement in the functioning
of the foreign exchange market.
Authorities’ views
38.
The authorities agreed with the staff on the importance of a cautious monetary stance
and the need to develop monetary policy instruments and the money market. They stressed
their commitment to the base money target, consistent with broader macroeconomic objectives and
other monetary targets. They indicated that the flexible pricing of government securities would be
dependent on sustaining low inflation, and mentioned their plans to establish a designated unit
within the NBE to coordinate efforts on establishing an active secondary market for government
securities. They disagreed with the staff that the 27 percent of NBE bills purchase requirement was a
distortion and explained that it was intended to mobilize excess liquidity in private banks to finance
industrial projects. They considered the measure successful and only constrained by prudential
limits, and reiterated that it will remain in place in the foreseeable future. The authorities also
explained that DBE is working toward reducing time needed for project assessment and approval,
which was another reason for its purchases of T-bills as part of its liquidity management.

D. Financial Sector Development
39.
Financial sector depth and diversification is gradually increasing even though
development efforts in this area lag behind those in the real and social sectors. The financial
system remains bank-centric and dominated by one state-owned bank, the CBE. Although the
number of privately-owned institutions and their share of total assets are gradually increasing, the
banking sector remains highly concentrated and segmented, and the CBE’s dominant position
creates an uneven playing field in the industry.8

7

The objectives of monetary policy include maintaining price and exchange rate stability and supporting economic
growth. In the context of exchange rate, the NBE conducts regular interventions to reduce exchange rate volatility
and ensure stable path of exchange rate depreciation.
8

The assets of three largest commercial banks account for 78.9 percent, significantly above the average for SSA and
LICs.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

40.
The banking system is expanding and the structure of its liabilities and assets is
evolving. Growth in deposits has been robust, as commercial banks have branched out in previously
unbanked areas. The share of savings and time deposits in total deposits has risen and competition
for time deposits has pushed up interest rates on them. In 2013/14 some 80 percent of bank of
financing was channeled to infrastructure investments, industry, international trade, and housing
and construction. In recent years, industry, housing and construction, in particular, have increased
their share in total credit.
41.
Banks are tapping to new areas of electronic and mobile banking to increase
profitability and maintain the market share. The initial focus of this expansion is on further
deposit mobilization as opposed to money transfer and other transactions. The microfinance sector
appears to be growing rapidly, and staff stressed that its development remains a critical for
providing credit to rural and low-income population as well as to small and medium enterprises.
Ethiopia lags significantly behind the other SSA countries in all measures of financial access,
including number of branches, ATMs, depositors and creditors (Figure 7). Staff encouraged the
authorities to further incubate technology based extension of financial services to promote financial
inclusion. In addition, Ethiopia significantly upgraded its anti-money laundering and combating the
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime, and is no longer blacklisted by the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF). However, it remains under monitoring until completion of the action plan agreed with
the FATF, and further implementation of the AML/CFT framework, in line with the findings from the
ongoing World Bank’s assessment, would assist sustainable financial development.
42.
The financial soundness indicators (FSIs) do not indicate immediate risks to the health
of the banking sector. Although FSIs based on aggregated information can mask potential
vulnerabilities in individual banks, on average the banks appear to be well-capitalized and profitable.
The system-wide capital adequacy ratio stood at a comfortable 17.5 percent at the end of
March 2014, as opposed to the 8 percent minimum required. Return on assets and return on equity
showed comfortable performance, at 3.1 percent and 44.6 percent, respectively. Asset quality has
also improved over time, with nonperforming loans at less than 3 percent of banks’ total loan
portfolio at the end of March 2014. On the other hand, banks’ operating costs appear to have
increased and their liquidity buffers have shrunk. At the end of March 2014, the system-wide
liquidity ratio was only slightly above the 15 percent minimum requirement.
43.
Notwithstanding the satisfactory FSIs, the systemic importance of the CBE is growing
with its role in mobilizing the resources and financing the public sector investment program.
Concentration of the CBE’s large exposures to single entities warrants careful supervision and
oversight by the NBE, with rigorous application of regulations limiting loans to related parties and a
single borrower. Appropriate oversight and monitoring of the DBE’s exposures and asset quality is
also important in order to address any emerging problems.

Authorities’ views
44.
The authorities expressed their confidence that banks remain in good health and are
well-capitalized. The NBE is vigilant in taking actions to mitigate any risks that would emerge. It has
adopted risk-based supervision and conducts regular on-site examinations, as well as off-site
analysis of credit and liquidity risks. Implementation of the World Bank’s financial sector capacity
building recommendations is in progress. Similarly, they recognized the importance of further
capacity building in the area of financial stability reporting and are eager to develop a framework for
crisis preparedness and management. They pointed to their efforts towards further savings

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

mobilization through various saving schemes and indicated that they were considering measures to
promote consolidation of private banks and scale of operations that could meet the borrowing
needs of businesses. Regarding AML/CFT, they indicated that they have strengthened their Financial
Intelligence Unit and issued relevant directives. The authorities are currently undergoing an
assessment conducted by the World Bank against the 2012 revised FATF Standard.9

E. External Sector
45.
Staff estimates the real effective exchange rate to be overvalued by 10–13 percent. The
assessment is based on analyses of the macroeconomic balance, the equilibrium REER, and external
sustainability (Annex I). The current account deficit in 2013/14 is estimated at some 7.1 percent of
GDP and is expected to shrink to 5.0 percent of GDP in the next five years. At the same time, imports
are forecast to remain high over the medium-term, mostly on account of petroleum products and
construction equipment. This indicates that a depreciation of around 10 percent in the REER would
be needed to close the projected current account gap.
46.
Foreign exchange reserves cushion is thin and given the weak export performance
building it up remains a challenge. Reserves are estimated to reach US$2.8 billion by the end of
2013/14, covering only about 1.9 months of prospective imports, and have fluctuated around that
level for most of FY2013/14. Given the relatively high level of imports expected in the coming years,
further accumulation of reserves would be needed to improve the import coverage and build a
buffer to respond to terms of trade shocks. Staff supported the NBE’s objective of increasing foreign
exchange reserves by US$300 million by the end of 2014/15 and further to the equivalent of
3 months of imports over the medium term. The economy is dependent on agricultural commodity
exports and imported fuel and capital goods and remains vulnerable to potential terms-of-trade
shocks. Higher accumulation of international reserves in the coming years is therefore desirable to
cope with shocks (Annex II).
Authorities’ views
47.
Authorities acknowledge that a competitive exchange rate is important but consider
too rapid an adjustment to be counter-productive due to feedback effects on inflation. They
preferred to effect the real effective exchange rate adjustment through a combination of gradual
nominal exchange rate depreciation, further reduction in inflation and improved productivity of
exports. They also indicated their commitment to addressing the chronically low level of
international reserves. Efforts to promote non-traditional exports and exports of services along with
those to attract fresh financing from abroad were expected to help in this regard.

9

The assessment is scheduled for discussion at the April 2015 Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering
Group (ESAAMLG) Plenary, the FATF-style regional body of which Ethiopia is a member.

PROMOTING COMPETITIVENESS AND SUSTAINING
LONG-TERM GROWTH
48.
Despite substantial investment in key industries, structural transformation of
Ethiopian economy remains a distant goal. Pronounced sectoral reallocation from agriculture to
manufacturing with greater share of employment in industry has typically characterized countries
transitioning from low- to middle-income. Ethiopia’s GTP envisions an increase in the share of the
industrial sector from 12.9 to 18.8 percent of GDP, implying an average annual growth rate of the
industrial sector of some 20 percent. The actual realization thus far has fallen short of this. While the
composition of output and employment is shifting away from agriculture, in Ethiopia’s case, this is
largely toward services, especially with respect to employment (Figure 8). More dynamic structural
transformation remains key to achieving the ambitious growth and employment objectives of the
GTP and beyond.
49.
Ethiopia’s global competitiveness suffers from weak export productivity. A key factor is
trade costs where Ethiopia lags substantially behind its peers. Based on the World Bank’s Logistics
Performance Index—which measures the efficacy of a country's logistics based on efficiency of
customs clearance process, quality of trade and transport-related infrastructure, ease of arranging
competitive shipments in terms of price, quality of logistics services, ability to track and trace
consignments, and frequency with which shipments reach the consignee within the scheduled
time—, Ethiopia ranks at the lower end of the surveyed countries in all the six key dimensions of
logistics covered by the index.
50.
The shift towards manufacturing and export oriented activities is proceeding slowly.
Factors hampering progress include, limited capacity and inadequate leveraging of the private
sector, weak business climate, including higher trade barriers, insufficient incentives for, and
sensitivity of, domestic savings—characterized by negative real rates of interest, limited range of
financial instruments, and an underdeveloped financial system.
51.
Adapting policies to provide greater scope for the private sector will be important
going forward. In the context of the next five year plan (GTP II), consideration should be given to
greater reliance on the private sector not only to contribute to the investment effort, but also to
improve the country’s competitiveness. Industrial sector development is crucial for the transition
from low- to middle-income economy. Structural change, shifting resources—especially labor—
away from agriculture to industry and services would need to capitalize on the private sector’s
power to perceive opportunity, startup business, and create new products (Box 2).

Box 3. Ethiopia: Export Competitiveness and Diversification
Ethiopia has experienced significant structural changes in
the external sector in the last decade. Exports have
increased six-fold since 2000 and new markets have
opened for Ethiopian products. Exports are now reaching a
larger number of destinations (including China).
Based on UN Comtrade SITC classification, at the most
aggregated level, Ethiopian exports continue to be
dominated by basic commodities, but share of coffee in
total exports has shrunk from 53 to 31 percent during
2000–12, even as value increased 250 percent in dollar
terms. Exports showing remarkable performance in recent
years are sesame and oil seeds, flowers, leather, gold and
aircraft equipment.
Non-coffee goods exports are only about 5.5 percent of
GDP in 2013 and hence still low in terms of contribution to
economic growth.

52.
Harnessing entrepreneurship can be helpful in transitioning from a factor-driven
toward an innovation-driven economy.10 On the 2014 Global Entrepreneurship and Development
Index, which captures the contextual features of entrepreneurship across individual and institutional
variables, Ethiopia ranks 111 out of 121 countries. The very low score reflects major obstacles to
entrepreneurship in the country.
53.
Efforts to create a business-friendly environment should be pushed aggressively to
give confidence to the private sector. Although Ethiopia ranks better in the quality of legal system
and property rights than the median SSA countries, the regulation and administrative requirements
are major hurdles for businesses. In 2013/14 cost of starting business in Ethiopia was twice higher
than in SSA frontier markets and about 30 percent higher than in median SSA (Figure 9).11 Reducing
regulatory and administrative burdens, which hamper entry and exit of firms, while promoting
entrepreneurship, level playing field, vigorous competition and adequate protection of investors, are
crucial.

Doing Business Indicators should be interpreted with caution due to a limited number of respondents, limited
geographical coverage, and standardized assumptions on business constraints and information availability.

54.
Opening up some key sectors to the private sector and FDI can be beneficial. While the
government can retain control in some strategic sectors—such as power generation and defense
industry—opening up others would broaden business opportunities for private sector as well as
improve efficiency in the liberalized sectors. For example, opening up the telecommunication sector,
the transport and trade logistics, as well as the sugar industry to private investors (including foreign
investors) can help to develop these sectors and improve their efficiency and quality of services and
products. The banking sector should also be open to foreign investors to enhance competition,
lower market concentration, and accelerate the process of adopting new technologies in delivering
financial services.

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

Authorities’ views
55.
The authorities acknowledged the structural problems affecting competitiveness and
highlighted the focus on infrastructure, which they expected would boost competitiveness of
the traded goods sector. Prospects for exports are being enhanced by efforts to attract FDI and
private investors’ participation in export oriented economic activities. Efforts to promote
non-traditional exports have also produced some results, with coffee representing a shrinking share
of total exports and exports of services growing fast as a result of the expansion of Ethiopian Airlines
operations. They also agreed with the staff’s view on the role of the private sector and indicated that
they are already undertaking some of the actions that staff is recommending, with the exception of
opening up of strategic sectors to the private sector.

OTHER ISSUES
56.
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. However, reflecting capacity constraints
available statistics are subject to significant weaknesses and delays. National account statistics need
improvement, especially on the expenditure side, notwithstanding the authorities’ efforts to
strengthen their compilation. As a result, official figures on economic growth, saving and investment
are subject to a wide range of uncertainty. Staff stressed the need to improve national accounts
compilation and urged the authorities to continue to avail themselves of technical assistance and
implement its recommendations. The authorities also do not provide detailed information on the
financial sector, including commercial banks’ income statements, distribution of non-performing
loans across banks, and maturity structure of credit and net open positions of banks, to the Fund.
Comprehensive data on the financial positions of public enterprises are lacking and hamper the
proper assessment of their borrowing and capacity to repay. Compilation of export and import of
services in the balance of payments based on the new methodology suffers from shortage of staff
and a low response rate from information providers. Reporting of high frequency data to the Fund
on a regular basis are also subject to significant delays.
57.
Ethiopia has yet to move to Article VIII status and maintains exchange restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions that are not consistent with
Article VIII.12 At present, there are four restrictions on the payments and transfers for current
international transactions, which relate to: (i) the tax certification requirement for repatriation of
dividend and other investment income; (ii) restrictions on repayment of legal external loans and
supplies and foreign partner credits; (iii) rules for issuance of import permits by commercial banks;
and (iv) the requirement to provide a clearance certificate from NBE to obtain import permits.
58.
WTO accession negotiations are continuing. Since the submission of the Memorandum of
Foreign Trade Regime in 2006, three rounds of Working Party meetings have taken place. A number
of documents were prepared for submission to the Secretariat for the fourth Working party meeting,
12

See 2014 Article IV consultation Informational Annex.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

including revised legislative action plan, revised “goods” offer, and information on import licensing.
Outstanding issues relate to domestic market access, state trading regime, and customs valuation
practices. The authorities intended to join the WTO before end-2014/15, but the timetable may be
postponed.
Authorities’ views
59.
The authorities stressed that they are continuing their efforts to enhance their
statistical capacities. They were seeking to improve national account and other statistics with
technical assistance from East AFRITAC and looked forward to continued technical assistance in this
area. They cited confidentiality reasons for not sharing bank-by-bank information with the mission.

STAFF APPRAISAL
60.
Ethiopia’s developmental strategy continues to yield positive results. The authorities
should be commended for delivering robust economic growth, generating employment, and
improving social indicators. These outcomes have been realized in the context of broad
macroeconomic stability, with inflation in single digits and restrained monetary policy and fiscal
policy at the general government level, although public enterprises continue to provide
expansionary impulse.
61.
A key role has been played by proactive public policy that is focused on the real sector
and implemented through public enterprises but this entails risks. Although the budgetary
stance at the general government level has been cautious, staff urges the authorities to curtail
domestic borrowing by public enterprises and carefully monitor the operations of the overall public
sector in order to establish a robust fiscal anchor. In particular, there is a need to closely track the
financial position of public enterprises, prioritize and gradually phase-in their investments, carefully
assess their macroeconomic impact, including crowding-out of private sector investment, and limit
the potential for creating contingent liabilities. Staff supports the authorities’ intention to establish a
high level mechanism to comprehensively oversee public enterprises. Staff also urges the authorities
to maintain prudent overall borrowing levels in the context of a medium-term debt management
strategy.
62.
Maintaining inflation in single digits should remain the main focus of NBE. This calls for
continued restrained monetary stance, since inflation remains in the upper end of the authorities’
target with non-food prices stubbornly in double digits. Monetary policy will need to remain vigilant
against the impact of volatile food and energy prices, and domestic demand pressures, including the
risk of increased inflationary pressures from the large domestically financed investment projects. It
would also need to be supported by appropriately restrained recourse to NBE for financing the
budget.

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

63.
Staff considers the time to be appropriate for greater flexibility in nominal interest
rates and measures for money market development. The NBE should focus on using indirect
instruments of monetary policy for achieving monetary targets. Flexibility of nominal interest rates is
precondition for making T-bills an effective instrument for liquidity management and reviving
government securities market. This should also have a positive impact on mobilization of domestic
saving for financing large-scale investment program.
64.
Phasing out the requirement for commercial banks to hold NBE bills would help
improve the uneven playing field between public and private banks. This remains a distorting
measure that adversely impacts the cost and quantity of private sector credit provided by
commercial banks, notwithstanding their current high profitability. The requirement is intended to
fund DBE lending to the private sector, which should be accomplished through more direct funding
to DBE.
65.
Staff’s analysis indicates that the real effective exchange rate is overvalued and an
important factor in the recent weak export performance. Allowing more market-based
movement of exchange rate with a view toward restoring competitiveness and further narrowing
spread between the parallel and official foreign exchange markets is needed and would contribute
to a stronger balance of payments. Staff supports the authorities’ objective of accumulating foreign
exchange reserves to three months of imports and would recommend a less drawn out timeframe
for doing so in order to build resiliency to shocks.
66.
In light of the large financing need in the GTP, staff urges the authorities to shift the
balance toward the private sector as an engine of growth. Development of a strong and vibrant
private sector is essential to sustain growth over the long-run and requires fostering competition in
areas where public enterprises enjoy monopolies, gradually withdrawing from areas, where they
crowd-out the private sector, and fully corporatizing and orienting outward through foreign
partnerships those that remain. Foreign direct investment should also be further encouraged by
reducing bureaucratic red tape and improving the overall business climate, including ease of access
to credit and foreign exchange for the private sector. A reorientation along these lines is critical for
achieving the higher growth projections set out in the staff’s alternative scenario.
67.
Staff underscores the need for continued improvements in data quality. There are
significant weaknesses in national accounts statistics and information gaps on the financial sector.
Availability of timely and comprehensive information on financial performance and borrowing
requirements of public enterprises is important for a proper assessment of public sector finances.
68.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Ethiopia be held on the
12-month consultation cycle. This is in accordance with the decision on consultation cycles,
Decision No. 14747-(10/96) (9/28/2010).

Annex I. Exchange Rate Assessment
1.

The assessment of the exchange rate for the fiscal year 2013/14 is based on the IMF’s

Consultative Group on Exchange Rate (CGER) methodology which indicates an overvaluation
of the real effective exchange rate in the range of 10 to 13 percent. The misalignment has been
reduced slightly since the 2013 Article IV consultation. The standard CGER methods applied are
(i) the macroeconomic balance approach, (ii) the equilibrium real effective exchange rate (REER)
approach, and (iii) the external sustainability approach.
2.

The macroeconomic balance approach estimates an overvaluation of 9.7 percent.

According to this methodology, a REER depreciation of that magnitude would align the current
account with its equilibrium level. The current account deficit is expected to be large but declining
over the medium term--estimated at 7.1 percent of GDP in 2013/14 and shrinking to 5.0 percent of
GDP over the next five years. The norm current account balance is also negative (5.8 percent of
GDP), partly supported by the large inflow of remittances and international development aid that is
expected to continue in the medium term. As in the previous Article IV consultation, large level of
imports is forecasted over the medium term, mostly petroleum products and heavy construction
equipment. A depreciation of around 10 percent in the REER would be necessary to close the
current account gap.
3.

The equilibrium real effective exchange rate approach shows an overvaluation around

9 percent. This result reflects unfavorable and highly volatile terms of trade and is predicated on a
sustained level of remittances from the diaspora, and government expenditure partially financed by
large external transfers.
4.

The external sustainability approach suggests an overvaluation of the REER of

12.7 percent. This methodology calculates the current account balance that stabilizes the net
foreign asset (NFA) position at a sustainable level. Nominal GDP growth is estimated at 17.9 percent
on average from FY2013/14 to FY2018/19, and the underling current account deficit of 4.4 would
result in a long-run NFA position of -45 percent of GDP. To sustain the NFA position at -24.5 percent
(average of last five years), the current account deficit should be 3 percent of GDP which would
require a depreciation of 12.7 percent in the REER.

Annex II. Reserve Adequacy Assessment
1.

Despite high and sustained economic growth achieved in recent years, the income

level is still low and the economy is dependent on agricultural commodity exports and
imported fuel and capital goods. The economy remains vulnerable to potential terms-of-trade
shocks and has a limited capacity to absorb them, given the chronically low reserve coverage. Some
export diversification and the expansion in the international transportation sector offer some
potential for higher accumulation of international reserves in the coming years.
2.

In addition, Ethiopia receives a large volume of private transfers from Ethiopians living

abroad. Remittances averaged about US$3.7 billion in the last three fiscal years, higher than the
value of total exports of goods during the same period. The large trade deficit is also partially offset
with official transfers that reached US$1.3 billion in 2013/14.
3.

Accumulation of reserves has proved to be difficult. Despite the recent recovery in

reserves that reached US$2.7 billion at end-February 2013, reserves have fluctuated around
US$2.8 billion for most of FY2013/14 and were at that level by end-April 2014.
4.

The reserve coverage in months of imports has reached uncomfortably low levels. At

end-April 2014 reserves covered only about 1.9 months of prospective imports. Given the relatively
high level of imports expected in the coming years, further accumulation of reserves is needed to
improve the coverage and have a buffer against possible deterioration of the terms of trade. The
export diversification strategy would also be important in addressing the recent decline in reserves.
5.

Reserves in percent of broad money have fallen just below the 20 percent threshold.

Although there are no large portfolio capital flows to and from Ethiopia, in the context of a
managed exchange rate, the reserves level seems inadequate. The recent declining trend in the
reserve to broad money ratio raises concern, although prudent monetary policy has helped to
contain the decline in the ratio. The declining trend has been persistent in the last two years.
6.

Reserve adequacy assessment based on a cost-benefit analysis shows that for a

country with a fixed exchange rate regime with assumed cost of holding foreign reserves is at
5 percent, the optimal reserve coverage would be the equivalent of 6.8 months of imports.1
The model evaluates various shocks in external demand, terms of trade, FDI, and aid flows for

different cost levels of holding reserves. Remittances are not explicitly included in the calculation of
the cost-benefit analysis. Given the substantial and sustained inflow of foreign exchange to
Ethiopian households in the form of remittances would suggest lower optimal reserve coverage for
a given cost of holding those reserves.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS
Approved By
Michael Atingi-Ego and
Masato Miyazaki (IMF)
and John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the International Monetary Fund and the
International Development Association.

Based on the new Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Analysis (LIC DSA) framework,
the updated DSA found that Ethiopia’s risk of external debt distress remains low, but
exposure to adverse shocks to exports shifts the risk to the borderline. The DSA indicates
that Ethiopia’s overall public sector debt dynamics is sustainable under the baseline
scenario, but vulnerable under several alternative scenarios. Public sector debt ratios are
projected to decline in the medium and long-term. The baseline scenario with a medium
and long-term favorable trend in the main indicators, places the debt-to-exports ratio
close to the threshold for a short period, with shocks to exports and borrowing conditions
temporarily breaching the PV of debt-to-exports threshold. This underscores the need for
the government to develop a strategy to contain the primary deficit as assumed in the
baseline. A rapid increase in domestic public debt and non-concessional external
borrowing could affect the risk assessment of Ethiopia. Maintaining the growth of exports
through diversification of the export sector, developing a medium-term debt strategy for
the public sector, and prudent non-concessional borrowing from external sources, remain
crucial to maintaining a low risk of external debt distress.

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

BACKGROUND AND KEY FINDINGS
1.
The last Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), prepared in August 2013, concluded that
Ethiopia was at a low risk of external debt distress. Past reports explained that Ethiopia reached the
completion point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in 2004 and benefited from
debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in 2006.1 In 2011/12,2 public and publicly
guaranteed (PPG) external debt declined to 18.4 percent of GDP, more than 5 percentage points relative to
the previous year.3 High GDP growth and negative domestic real interest rates on public debt contributed
to the decline.
2.
Previous DSA findings have been robust to the inclusion of remittances and higher
non-concessional loans. Last year’s external DSA did not result in any breach of indicative thresholds with
or without remittances and debt-to-exports ratios were better in the baseline with those private transfers.
The assessment was thus made not taking into account remittances, as recommended in the LIC DSA
framework, and there was evidence of low risk of external debt distress. An alternative scenario and a
general equilibrium model stretching the non-concessional borrowing for public investment on
infrastructure confirmed the capacity of the country to absorb those resources.4 Nonetheless, as Ethiopia
reaches new debt levels, the assessment of the external DSA calls for the use of additional tools (as
provided under the new Debt Sustainability Framework).
3.
Ethiopia remains at low risk of external debt distress in 2014, but debt levels now warrant
extended analysis of the incremental risk of higher debt and vulnerability of exports to terms of
trade shocks and terms of loan. The present value (PV) of PPG external debt is expected to continue to
increase from 14.1 percent of GDP in 2012/13 to 15.4 percent of GDP in 2013/14 under baseline scenario.
The ratio of PV of PPG external debt to exports would rise from 110.6 percent to 115.0 percent in the same
period, as a result of the additional buildup of external debt and low level of exports. The inclusion of
remittances significantly lowers the baseline average of the debt-to-exports ratios in the projection period
(2013/14–2033/34), but the results excluding and including workers’ remittances are broadly the same.5
1

While Ethiopia has received debt relief from most of its creditors, it has not been able to reach agreement with
bilateral official creditors from Bulgaria, Libya, and FR Yugoslavia and commercial creditors from Italy, former
Czechoslovakia, India and FR Yugoslavia whose outstanding loans (US$382.9 million) accounted for 4.5 percent of the
debt stock in 2012/13. HIPC terms are assumed for these loans. Negotiations with Russia on outstanding loans
(US$161.6 million) have not completed. Thus, the debt service on these loans is assumed HIPC comparable
treatment.
2

The Ethiopian fiscal year runs from July 8 to July 7.

3

PPG debt includes not only federal and regional governments’ debt, but also encompasses all major state-owned
enterprises, except Ethiopian Airlines (EAL). EAL debt is excluded from PPG debt, because, although owned by the
government, it is run on commercial terms. EAL enjoys managerial independence, borrows without any government
guarantees, publishes annual audited reports and has a sizeable profit margin.

(2014) and Box 1 in the main report.

5

Based on the 2013 Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) score (3.4), Ethiopia is classified as a medium
performer. The thresholds for the debt burden for medium performers are 150, 40, and 250 for the PV of debt to

There is a short-lived breach of the PV of debt-to-exports ratio under the exports and borrowing
conditions shocks, that makes Ethiopia a borderline case under the new DSF and requires the use of
additional country specific information to perform the DSA.

that include workers’ remittances, the corresponding threshold for PV of debt to exports and remittances is
120 percent, and is 16 percent for debt service to exports and remittances; the PV of debt to GDP and remittances is

4.
The current DSA assumes a decline in the share of concessional loans and higher
nonconcessional external loan disbursements between 2014/15 and 2019/20. Compared to the
previous DSA, a greater increase in projected commercial loan disbursements for financing large
investments by state-owned enterprises in the next five years is the main contributor to the buildup of new
debt in the medium term. New commercial loans will result in subsequent increases in the various debt
ratios and an increase in the grant element on new borrowing throughout the projection period. This DSA
assumes disbursements of about US$1.7 billion in nonconcessional loans a year in the next five years, with
Ethiotel (the telecommunications company) taking US$1.6 billion over three years. The DSA assumes that
nonconcessional loan disbursements will remain at around US$745 million on average over the projection
period (FY2018/19−FY2033/34). Over the time horizon of the DSA, 58 percent of new external loans are
assumed to be concessional on average. Average maturity on all new external loans is assumed to be
26 years while new non-concessional loans are assumed to carry a maturity of 13−16 years. Average
interest rates on new external loans are assumed at 2.2 percent over the horizon, and interest rates on new
non-concessional loans are assumed to be in the 3−5 percent range.
5.
In April 2013, IDA authorized a US$1 billion ceiling for FY12/13 and, in principle, FY13/14
and FY14/15 for Ethiopia. In June 2014, IDA concluded that Ethiopia had exceeded this limit by
committing non concessional contracts totaling US$5.8 billion in FY12/13 and an estimated US$2.7 billion
in FY13/14. In response, IDA converted the grant portion of the FY14/15 volume into regular credits and
reduced Ethiopia's allocation for FY14/15 by 5 percent. Financing needs covered with non-concessional
borrowing have been revised upwards from the previous DSA in view of the large cost of big projects in
telecommunications, railways, roads, airport and sugar. Those projects have been identified as crucial for
the success of the authorities’ Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP). Frontloaded disbursements are
associated with realistic pace of execution and the immediate needs for investment and related acquisitions
in those sectors.
6.
Commercial loans to finance large public investment projects by state-owned enterprises
could increase the risk to Ethiopia’s public debt sustainability. The state-owned power company, the
Ethiopia Electricity Power Company, now divided into two entities for generation and distribution, is
undertaking several large investment projects. Most rely on external assistance and loans (including both
concessional and non-concessional), while the Renaissance Dam project, estimated by the authorities to
cost 8.5 percent of 2013/14 GDP, is intended to be financed entirely domestically (except for the external
non-concessional financing of the transmission line). The Ethiopian Railway Corporation signed contracts
with Chinese and Turkish companies for projects whose total size is more than US$3.9 billion, or 7.8 percent
of 2013/14 GDP. The telecommunication company signed two agreements with Chinese providers for
US$1.6 billion suppliers’ loans. As advised in previous DSAs, it would be prudent for the authorities to
systematically update a medium-term debt management strategy (that includes SOEs) and to start
monitoring the overall debt (external and domestic) of the consolidated public sector.
7.
Authorities requested again the exclusion of the commercial external loans in the
telecommunication sector from the DSA. While they agreed with the findings of the DSA, they
specifically requested the exclusion of the commercial loans that Ethiotel has signed with Chinese
equipment suppliers for a total of US$1.6 billion. The conditions of those loans are non-concessional and

4

the authorities explained that there is no government guarantee. The delivery of some of the equipment
has been delayed and the authorities argued that capacity to absorb the resources and to put in place the
equipment has been slow in the past. Contrary to the assumed parsimony in the previous DSA, staff found
evidence for a frontloading of the disbursements, given the high relevance of the associated projects to
achieve the goals under the GTP, and the fact that some projects have already been started. The authorities
have also indicated that they intend to establish an agency to monitor and oversee the financial positions
of all public enterprises and their overall impact on public sector finances.

MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
8.
The medium-term macroeconomic outlook incorporates an upward revision to output
growth compared to the assumptions of the 2013 DSA (Box 1). Real GDP growth is forecasted at
8.2 percent in 2013/14 and 8.5 percent in the following two years, reflecting strong economic activity,
mainly led by public infrastructure investment and favorable agricultural production. The projected longrun GDP growth rate is maintained at 6.5 percent.
9.
Export growth is projected to recover from its weak performance in FY2012/13, while
imports continue at a fast pace led by capital goods, fuel and other inputs. In the medium- to longrun, export growth would be supported by diversification of the export sector as Ethiopia explores new
markets, consolidates the existing ones, and develops new export industries and markets new products,
spurred by greater inflows of foreign direct investment, and domestic investments to boost service exports
including electricity and international travel. Overall, exports of goods and services are projected to grow at
15 percent each year from 2014/15 to 2019/20.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
10.
Under the baseline scenario (not including remittances), the PPG external debt indicators
will rise in the next several years, but will remain under the relevant indicative thresholds (Figure 1).
The PV of PPG external debt in percent of GDP would slightly increase in 2013/14 to 15.4 percent and is
projected to reach 22.0 percent by 2016/17, reflecting the assumed steady increase in new loan
disbursements, and subsequently would decline below 10 percent in the long run. The PV of debt in
percent of exports reached 115.0 percent in 2013/14; and despite the expected recovery in exports, it is
projected to continue increasing, peaking at 141.9 percent in 2015/16. The debt service-to-exports ratio
remains well below the relevant threshold although it keeps rising to a peak of 9.0 percent in 2014/15,
reflecting servicing of non-concessional loans by public enterprises.
11.
Under the historical scenario, the debt stock indicators would be lower than under the
baseline scenario. The scenario reflects significantly higher nominal GDP and export growth (than in the
baseline), which helps to lower the debt ratios. It also reflects larger net debt creating flows (than in the
baseline) that increases the debt ratios. The dynamic path under the historical scenario is determined by
these two offsetting forces.

Box 1. Ethiopia: Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario
Based on a partial financing of the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP), real GDP growth is projected at
8.2 percent in 2013/14, 8.5 percent in the following two years, and to slightly tamp down to 8.0 percent until
2018/19 and to remain at 6.5 percent in the outer years.1 This assessment contrasts with the government’s
growth projections in the GTP, and reflects remaining rigidities and constrains, given the limited space for
private sector credit. CPI Inflation is projected to reach 8.5 percent by the end of 2013/14 and to stay at
9 percent in the long run. The primary balance of the public sector is projected to remain around
-2.2 percent of GDP in average for the next five years, reflecting a substantial effort on tax collection and
current expenditure.
The external current account deficit (before official transfers) is estimated at 9.8 percent in 2013/14. A further
deterioration to 10.9 percent for next year will follow a slight improvement over the long-run to 6.8 percent
in 2033/34.
Exports of goods and services are projected to grow by 12.5 percent in 2013/14, after a decline of
0.7 percent in 2012/13, and with an average growth of about 13.2 percent in the long run. A prolonged
decline in commodity prices, especially in gold and coffee, largely offset gains in export volumes and other
agricultural exports. Investments in targeted sectors that receive government support are expected to
contribute to export growth, with export volume growth of about 14.7 percent for 2013/14 and about
13 percent in the next four years to just below 8 percent over the remaining DSA horizon. Imports of goods
and services are projected to increase slightly above GDP as demand for imported capital goods is expected
to grow fast during the GTP implementation. In the long run, imports are expected to grow in line with
domestic output.
Workers’ remittances have played a key role in supporting the balance of payments and in 2013/14 are
expected to reach 8 percent of GDP. High growth, economic stability and the return of growth in developed
countries is expected to maintain remittances at around 7 percent of GDP in the next five years and
4 percent in the long run.
Foreign direct investment (FDI) is projected increase from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2013/14 to 3.3 percent the
following year and 3 to 5 percent in average in the medium and long term, on account of policies to
promote greater foreign investment.
________________________________

Domestic financing and prospective external inflows amount roughly to two third of full financing of the
GTP.

12.
The terms-of-trade shock is the most extreme potential risk for the sustainability of the
external debt, breaching the threshold of PV of debt-to-exports ratio from 2015/16 to 2017/18
(without remittances). This makes the DSA for Ethiopia a borderline case. A potential deterioration in the
terms-of-trade and a drastic change in the borrowing conditions could force a temporary breach of the PV
of debt-to-exports ratio. The short-lived breach of just one indicator and the declining long-term trends
indicate that Ethiopia is a special case that conforms to the borderline situation described in the most
recent revision of the DSF. With other indicators well below the thresholds even for the most extreme
shocks, the new DSA template provides for a further evaluation based in the probabilistic approach that
takes into consideration historical growth performance. This complementary approach assesses the
evolution of the probability of debt distress over time. In the case of Ethiopia, with high and sustained

6

THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

economic growth, the additional evaluation indicates that the country’s probability of debt distress is low
even for the most extreme shocks (Figure 2).

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
13.
Under the baseline scenario and similar to the findings in the 2013 DSA, the total public
sector debt-to-GDP ratio would rise in the near term, but would start to decline in the medium- to
long-term. This reflects large domestic borrowing and continued accumulation of external PPG debt by
public enterprises to implement infrastructure investment projects contemplated in the GTP. It is expected
that after an initial period of high spending, total public sector expenditure would revert to a lower level in
the long run. Under the new DSF that imposes a threshold for the PV of Debt-to-GDP ratio, only the
scenario that fixes the primary balance at a level in recent fiscal performance shows the ratio crossing the
threshold with a growing trend. This is explained largely by the fact that Ethiopia has reported a higher
primary deficit than in previous year, associated with the recent large investments that are part of the GTP.
This is unlikely to remain unchanged in the next 20 years.
14.
Debt stock related indicators are relatively flat and most extreme shocks do not alter
significantly the results. All debt indicators show a mild increase in the medium-term, to return to levels
similar to the 2013/14 ones. This result is predicated on the continuation of robust GDP growth, moderate
public sector primary deficits, and most crucially - the authorities’ policy of keeping domestic interest rates
low. Real interest rates are assumed to remain in mildly negative territory with inflation expected to stay at
9 percent in the long run.
15.
Public sector debt would grow in the long-run as a result of a permanent negative shock on
GDP growth, but debt service-to-revenue could absorb this shock (Figure 3). The scenario with
unchanged primary balance from 2013/14 shows particularly sharp deterioration because of the unusually
large primary deficit in that particular year reflecting the high level of investment activity. The other two
alternative scenarios (real GDP growth and primary balance at the historic average) permanently lower GDP
growth and show trajectories with no important changes in the debt ratios during the DSA horizon.
16.
The baseline scenario understates the public debt burden for the economy, because it
reflects actual costs of borrowing by the public sectors, which remain significantly lower than
inflation. Like in the previous DSA, with inflation projected to remain at a single-digit level, under current
policy, interest rates on public enterprise domestic borrowing would not be at positive levels in real terms.
Ethiopia’s relatively benign public sector debt outlook hinges strongly on the continuation of the current
interest rate policy. If the actual cost of borrowing were to rise above inflation, the debt indicators would
worsen or fiscal adjustment would be required to maintain sustainability.
17.
This assessment with a low risk of debt distress assumes disbursements of external
borrowing lower than required for the GTP. The ongoing large public investment projects rely heavily
on domestic financing and would lead to a large accumulation of public debt. Without an appropriate
pacing of the public investment projects in the GTP, financing for the private sector could be squeezed.
Monitoring the operations of the consolidated public sector, including contingent liabilities arising from
financial transactions among public entities, is thus important.

CONCLUSION
18.
The risk rating of Ethiopia’s external and public debt distress remains low, but is on the cusp.
Potential changes in the risk assessment can be triggered by a terms-of-trade shock or incurring higher
than forecasted external debt as well as contracting debt on less favorable terms. The external debt ratios
have been on a growing trend in recent years, and this trend is projected to continue over the mediumterm. The results point to Ethiopia as a borderline case, with debt indicators and sensitivity analysis
suggesting that the risk of debt distress may change from low to moderate. The exposure to a terms-oftrade shock is reflected in a short lived breach in the PV of debt-to-exports ratio under the most extreme
shock. A milder terms-of-loans shock also breached this threshold for a short period.
19.
The Ethiopian authorities need to monitor closely the debt levels and the terms of the new
loans, especially on commercial terms. The additional external debt intended to finance large projects on
state own enterprises should be supported by higher exports. In this sense, ensuring the successful
transition to a more competitive and diverse economy with a clear outward orientation is key to preserving
the low risk of debt distress. The financing plan underlying the remaining GTP I and what is envisioned in
the next GTP, should take into account these results. In addition to export diversification and improvements
to competitiveness, particular emphasis should be placed on adequate concessionality of new external
loans.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguard Assessment

The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) was subject to an update safeguards assessment with respect to
the ESF arrangement approved on August 26, 20091. The update assessment found improved
financial reporting and internal audit practices. Notwithstanding these developments, the
assessment noted significant weakness and recommendations focused on strengthening oversight
of risks and controls, improving accounting records and external audit process, and legal
amendments to address safeguards weakness in the Law. As of now, limited progress has been
reported on the outstanding safeguards recommendations, particularly legal amendments to
strengthen NBE's autonomy. The assessment also noted that a full set of the audited financial
statements should be available to the public. However, the NBE does not publish the financial
statements on its website, and staff has not yet received audited financial statements for 2012 and
2013, and the management letters issued by the NBE’s external auditor. Delivery of this monitoring
information by the NBE is required under the safeguards policy. The mission touched upon the
outstanding issues and reminded the authorities about key documentation, including the audited
financial statements from the NBE, obliged under the safeguards policy.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
The de-facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The authorities
describe their exchange rate regime as a managed float with no predetermined path for the
1

from September 2001.

exchange rate. The pace of the depreciation of the nominal exchange rate, however, has been
stable. The NBE continue to supply foreign exchange to the interbank market based on plans
prepared at the beginning of each fiscal year, which take into account estimates of supply and
demand. The transaction-weighted average interbank market exchange rate as of July 25, 2014,
was Br 19.6649 = US$1.
Ethiopia maintains four restrictions on the payments and transfers for current international
transactions, which relate to: (i) the tax certification requirement for repatriation of dividend and
other investment income; (ii) restrictions on repayment of legal external loans and supplies and
foreign partner credits; (iii) rules for issuance of import permits by commercial banks; and (iv) the
requirement to provide a clearance certificate from NBE to obtain import permits. These restrictions
are inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2(a), of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and remain
unapproved.
Article IV Consultation
Ethiopia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle, in accordance with the Decision on Article
IV Consultation Cycles (Decision No. 14747-(10/96), 9/28/2010). The last consultation was concluded
on September 18, 2013.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. However, in 2013/14 data reported to the Fund were
subject to delays and there are data weaknesses and gaps reflecting capacity constraints which the
authorities are seeking to address through technical assistance.
National Accounts: Although the authorities are continuing efforts to strengthen the national accounts
methodology, deficiencies in the source data and compilation practices affect the accuracy and reliability of
the GDP statistics. The reliance on various estimates and surveys remains significant and the weaknesses are
particularly evident in respect to the estimation of private consumption, savings, investment and fixed
capital formation. The statistical discrepancies between the expenditure categories and output remain large.
Information provided to the Fund is subject to frequent revisions and discrepancies. Staff has stressed the
need to further improve national accounts statistics and offered technical assistance.
Government finance statistics: Despite recent improvements, government fiscal statistics continue to be
affected by shortcomings. Data on the consolidated fiscal operations of government (including public
enterprises) are lacking and hinder proper assessment of the overall public sector’s borrowing needs and its
capacity to repay.
Monetary statistics: Monetary survey for commercial bank is subject to substantial revisions. Timely data
collection and reporting continue to be crucial for policy making purposes and the authorities should
strengthen efforts to reduce revisions.
Financial statistics: Information gaps about the financial sector have implications for conducting an indepth assessment of the financial sector health. The mission has not received commercial banks’ income
statements, information on distribution of non-performing loans, maturity of credit, net open position, and
bank-by-bank financial soundness indicators.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments data require improvements in coverage, valuation, timing, and
classification of current account transactions. Financial and capital account transactions are also
incompletely covered; data on FDI could to be better reconciled with alternative sources. The compilation of
services, based on the new methodology was not implemented, due to a shortage of staff and a low
response rate from information providers.

II.

Data Standards and Quality

Ethiopia participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and metadata were partially updated
in early 2008. Ethiopia participates in the GDDS project for capacity building in statistics in Anglophone
Africa (2006–09) including socio-demographic, macro-economic and financial statistics. No Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes has been completed.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the Federal Democratic
Republic of Ethiopia
On September 24, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Ethiopia.1
Ethiopia’s recent macroeconomic performance continues to be strong, with robust economic
growth supported by higher agricultural production, and large public sector and foreign direct
investments. Inflation remains contained in single digits and the fiscal stance at the general
government level is cautious, although public enterprises continue to provide an expansionary
impulse.
The general government budget execution in 2013/14 reflects conservative spending. Recurrent
spending is estimated to remain at 7.4 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the capital
spending-to-GDP ratio will only increase by about 0.3 percentage points to 11.0 percent of GDP.
The overall revenue-to-GDP ratio is estimated to fall from about 14.6 in 2012/13 to about 14.1 in
2013/14, mainly on account of decline in nontax revenue which more than offset the tax revenue
improvement. The general government budget deficit, including grants, is estimated to be
2.7 percent of GDP in 2013/14, compared to 2.0 percent of GDP a year ago.
Public enterprises continue to borrow heavily from the banking system and externally to finance
their investments. The financing of the overall public sector is likely to have been on the order of
10 percent of GDP in 2013/14. Public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt is estimated
to have increased to about 23 percent of GDP from 20.5 percent of GDP in 2012/13.
Tight monetary policy has supported achieving the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE)’s inflation
objective in 2013/14. Inflation remained in the single digits throughout the year and was
8.5 percent in June 2014, with food prices rising by 6.2 percent and non-food inflation in the
double-digits. Base money, the nominal anchor of monetary policy, increased by 17.5 percent in
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
April 2014, driven mainly by claims on government (by 19.6 percent) and to a lower degree by
claims on non-government (by 11.2 percent).
Developments in the external sector have been mixed, with the deterioration in the trade balance
offset by net inflows on services and transfers. The current account deficit is estimated to have
widened from US$2.8 billion (6.0 percent of GDP) in 2012/13 to US$3.5 billion in 2013/14
(7.1 percent of GDP). It was financed largely by concessional and non-concessional inflows as
well as by foreign direct investment (FDI). Substantial inflows on the capital account also
facilitated a modest build up in the NBE’s reserves. The exchange rate adjusted only gradually,
in line with the NBE’s managed float policy. While the premium in the parallel market remained
modest, the gradual nominal depreciation was insufficient to prevent an appreciation of the real
effective exchange rate.
The economic outlook remains encouraging. The 2014/15 budget plan targets the general
government deficit at 3 percent of GDP and maintains a strong pro-poor focus. Monetary policy,
anchored on base money, is geared toward maintaining inflation in single digits. The public debt
to GDP ratio is expected to rise, reflecting large disbursements associated with implementation
of investment projects under the Growth and Transformation Plan.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for delivering robust and broad-based economic
growth, maintaining inflation in single digits, expanding employment and improving social
indicators, and welcomed the considerable progress toward the Millennium Development Goals.
Looking ahead, Directors observed that the sustainability of the current public sector-led growth
strategy was threatened by several downside risks–including, external financing of the public
investment program, declining prices for export commodities, and weather-related shocks.
Mitigating these risks will necessitate greater policy coherence and appropriate structural
reforms going forward, to help shift the balance toward private sector-led, sustainable growth.
Directors underscored the need for continued fiscal prudence in order to achieve the goals of the
Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP), while reducing crowding out of the private sector. They
called for stepped-up efforts to increase domestic revenue—by broadening the tax base,
improving customs and tax administration, and removing tax exemptions. On the expenditure
side, Directors welcomed the planned implementation of a new high-level oversight mechanism
designed to carefully monitor the operations and financial position of public enterprises and any
contingent liabilities. They recommended the adoption of a consolidated fiscal position as a more
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

robust fiscal anchor, and advised that borrowing be done within the context of a comprehensive
debt strategy.
Directors concurred that monetary restraint is required in the wake of food and energy price
shocks and domestic demand pressures stemming from large public investments. Eliminating
recourse to National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) budgetary financing would also help curb
inflationary pressures. Directors also recommended strengthening liquidity management and
monetary transmission through enhanced interest rate flexibility and the adoption of a broader set
of monetary policy instruments. They noted that a broadened set of monetary instruments would
also facilitate further money market development.
Directors called for a strengthening of financial supervisory and regulatory frameworks, to
promote inclusion and encourage greater competition. They recommended enhancing private
sector credit access by eliminating the requirement that commercial banks hold NBE bills.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve export competitiveness by reducing
overvaluation of the real effective exchange rate through enhanced exchange rate flexibility. A
more market-based exchange rate would also facilitate the accumulation of foreign exchange
reserves, as a buffer against external shocks.
Directors supported structural reforms designed to create a more enabling environment for
private sector investment. In this regard, they recommended developing a proper legal
framework for public-private partnerships; simplifying requirements for opening a business;
strengthening investor protections; and improving trade logistics.
Directors underscored the need for continued improvement in data quality, including national
accounts and financial sector statistics. They welcomed Ethiopia’s removal from the FATF
blacklist, and looked forward to the completion of the agreed action plan.

STATEMENT BY MR. SAHO, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR
THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA
SEPTEMBER 24, 2014
My Ethiopian authorities are thankful to staff for their constructive dialogue during the
Article IV mission. The process has provided an opportunity for an exchange of views on a
broad range of topics that will contribute to a refinement of the authorities’ macroeconomic
objectives set out in the five year Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) that is being
implemented.
Ethiopia is pursuing a path of reforms that, together with the successful implementation of
the GTP, are expected to further accelerate growth by increasing productivity and
competitiveness, as well as reduce poverty and foster economic diversification. Overhauling
the economy will require radically altering the agricultural sector and boosting industry
through expanded investment in the sector. The authorities also attribute a high priority to
enhancing debt management capacity and strengthening tax administration, areas in which
the Fund’s technical assistance has been instrumental.
I. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
The Ethiopian economy has experienced strong economic growth in recent years with real
GDP growth at or near double digit levels since 2003/04. This growth momentum has been
inclusive and job-creating. Despite a difficult external environment, growth for 2013/2014 is
estimated at 11 percent which puts the country among the fast-growing non-mineral
economies in Africa. This growth continued to be broad-based, with all sectors contributing,
with the agriculture sector at the forefront. The tight monetary policy stance, aided by
slowdown in food prices, also saw consumer price inflation at 7.2 percent year-on-year in
August 2014. While the current account deficit widened slightly compared to 2012/13 aided
by deterioration in the trade balance, the deficit was financed largely by FDI and loans.
The strong growth owes much to the systematic utilization of the limited resources in the
growth-enhancing infrastructure sector and the development of pro-poor sectors of the
economy such as agriculture, which is the source of livelihood for 84 percent of the
population. Current development strategies and policies are geared towards the priority
agenda of reducing multidimensional poverty in the country as this is expected to have
spillover effects on the overall development of the country. Under this agenda, the
government has employed several socio-economic policy instruments, including the
agriculture-led development strategy to tackle the productivity challenge in the agricultural
sector.
For 2014/15 and beyond, GDP growth is expected to sustain the momentum. As the
infrastructural transformation takes place, synergies are being created between the sectors
and the rest of the economy. Government’s integrated investment in infrastructure is intended
to enhance infrastructure development and reduce the current unemployment challenge in the

2
urban areas. The authorities consider Micro and Small Scale Enterprises (MSEs)
development as critical to directly address youth and women unemployment in urban areas.
They consider market interlinkages between the MSEs and the mega-infrastructure
construction projects equally important to reduce the urban poverty rate and the
unemployment levels.
II. FISCAL POLICY
The authorities are aware of the need to pursue fiscal prudence. To this end fiscal policy is
geared towards better coordination with monetary policy to combat inflation, while
maintaining the momentum of spending on physical and social infrastructure. Fiscal policy
also has focused on strengthening domestic-resource mobilization (particularly tax
collection) and reducing recourse to central bank lending while, at the same time, increasing
pro-poor spending including investment in physical infrastructure. The recently approved
budget allocates more than 65 percent of spending to sectors contributing to speeding up the
ongoing social and economic development. Domestic revenue collection has been improving
in the past several years owing to vigorous tax reform measures, improved tax
administration, with the help of technical assistance provided by the IMF, and
trade-facilitation efforts.
Going forward, raising fiscal revenues remains an important component of the development
strategy focused on public investment. In line with Fund technical assistance
recommendations, the authorities expect to broaden the tax base, enhance tax collection, and
strengthen institutional and administrative capacities.
Given the overall resource limitations, my authorities intend to facilitate greater participation
of the private sector and mobilize a modest level of non-concessional financing while
remaining vigilant of the contingent liabilities and debt sustainability implications and
strengthening their debt management strategy.
III. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
The joint debt sustainability analysis undertaken by the Fund and World Bank staffs
reaffirms Ethiopia’s public and publicly guaranteed debt to be sustainable and that the level
of debt distress will not worsen. My authorities also recognize the important role played by
the public enterprises, particularly in the improvement of infrastructure critical to
socioeconomic development. The completion of the projects under the GTP will lay the
ground for higher future growth and enhance the country’s capacity to pay its debt.
While maintaining Ethiopia’s commitment to sound public finances, the authorities’ large
investment in infrastructure and social projects has resulted in a rapid increase in public
external debt. However, interest rates are on average low and the amortization and grace
periods are very long. As a result, external public debt does not breach any indicative
threshold under the DSA baseline.

3
IV. MONETARY POLICY AND THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
Monetary policy was successful in keeping inflation to single digits and supporting the
exchange rate. The NBE will continue to gear monetary policy to contain inflationary
pressures without jeopardizing the growth momentum. They also plan to augment foreign
exchange reserves by US$300 million by the end of 2014/15.
Although the government’s monetary policy allows for flexibility in interest-rate
determination, subject to the regulation of a minimum deposit rate of 5 percent, there is, in
practice, rigidity in interest rates, which has lead to negative real interest rates limiting the
effectiveness of monetary policy in demand management. The authorities are committed to
maintain macroeconomic stability and bring inflation down further through tight monetary
policy to ensure that the real interest rate is close to positive territory.
Ethiopia’s banking sector remains well capitalized and liquid. Nevertheless, the NBE has
adopted risk-based supervision and regular on-site examination to mitigate any emerging
risks. Future priorities of the NBE include refining its operational framework so as to raise
the efficiency of the transmission mechanism and promote the development of the interbank
market as well as build capacity in crisis preparedness and response. The policy, regulatory
and institutional frameworks for microfinance institutions are also well established.
With regard to the NBE bill directive introduced in 2011 requiring banks to allocate
27 percent of total loans disbursed during the month for the purchase of NBE bills was as a
result of the very low private banks loan disbursement to long term projects. My authorities
consider the arrangement to be instrumental in mobilizing excess bank liquidity for private
sector investment. While noting the concerns raised by staff, they will continue to monitor
the implementation of the policy with the view of ensuring that resources are allocated for
the intended purpose of financing priority sectors without jeopardizing the functioning of the
financial sector.
V. PRIVATE SECTOR
The authorities are committed to enhancing the participation of the private sector in growing
the economy. Cognizant of the role of the private sector as a key player in the development
process, the government continues to formulate policies to ensure that the private sector
emerges as a central player in the future development of the country. The currently high
infrastructure developments and service delivery improvement by the government is geared
towards opening opportunities and creating an enabling environment for the active
participation of the private sector. Through a public-private dialogue forum the authorities
have addressed some of the issues related to the business climate, including overhauling of
customs procedures, and improvements in the business licensing and registration process.
The government has also revised several times in the past the investment code to make it
more transparent, attractive and competitive.

VI. CONCLUSION
My authorities remain confident that by persevering with the current macroeconomic
framework and the continued implementation of the GTP, while addressing any potential
risks and challenges, they stand a good chance of mitigating the downside risks identified in
table 1 of the staff report. While they do not share some of the conclusions reached by staff
as expressed in the staff report under Authorities’ views, they nevertheless consider the
quality of staff policy advice as useful.
