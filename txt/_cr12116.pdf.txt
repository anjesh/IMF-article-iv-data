UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 27, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context. The UAE economy is gradually recovering from the 2009 crisis. The banking
sector was strengthened through significant capital injections, and some progress has
been made in restructuring the debt of government-related entities (GRE). The ailing
real estate sector is beginning to find bottom but, given the ongoing oversupply, an
early and broad-based recovery of the sector remains unlikely.
Outlook and risks. The recovery of the nonhydrocarbon economy, however, looks set
to continue this year, backed by strong trade, tourism, logistics, and manufacturing,
and helped by high oil prices. With limited near-term potential for further increases in
real oil production, overall GDP growth is expected to moderate to 2.3 percent.
Downside risks relate to a possible increase in regional geopolitical tensions, a
potential decline in oil prices, a renewed worsening of global financial conditions, or a
marked slowdown in Asia.
Macroeconomic policy mix. The UAE plans a gradual fiscal consolidation this year
which will help unwind the fiscal stimulus of recent years and lower the currently high
fiscal breakeven oil price without undermining the economic recovery. The planned
fiscal consolidation will also increase the room for maneuver in case the downside risks
materialize. Monetary policy will stay appropriately accommodative under the U.S.
dollar peg.
Government-related entities. The GREs continue to face financial challenges in light
of their high debt and rollover needs. Further deleveraging and strengthening of
impaired GRE balance sheets is needed. Improving GRE corporate governance and
increasing transparency about their financing strategies, financial conditions, and debt
profile would be important to strengthen market confidence. Channeling bank funding
to non-viable GREs should be avoided.
Financial stability. The banking system maintains significant buffers to withstand a
further deterioration in asset quality and external liquidity conditions. The central bank
should nonetheless continue to closely monitor banks’ liquidity and capital buffers as
individual banks could be affected if downside risks materialize.
Statistics. Effective policymaking is contingent on timely and accurate data, rendering
further improvements in the statistical framework important.

BACKGROUND

2.
The UAE has been reaping the
benefits of its early efforts to diversify the
economy. As the UAE developed into a major
services hub in the Middle East, its
dependency on oil exports declined markedly.
Based on its well-developed hospitality and
services sectors, tourism, transportation and

logistics have been major drivers of the post2009 recovery. The UAE has also been
benefiting from high oil prices and strong
growth in Asia. As a result of its perceived safe
haven status and developed services sector,
the country benefited from an increase in
demand for property by expatriates and a
surge in tourism in the wake of the turmoil in
the MENA region that began last year.

1.
Following the 2009 crisis, the
economy has been slowly recovering and
repairing its balance sheets. The Dubai
World debt restructuring was completed, but
several other troubled government-related
entities (GRE) are still in the process of
restructuring. The authorities strengthened the
banking sector through liquidity support,
recapitalization, and deposit guarantees, and
the emirate of Abu Dhabi provided financial
support to the emirate of Dubai. The Dubai
Financial Support Fund (DFSF) was called to
support troubled entities in the emirate and
has now almost exhausted its funding of
$20 billion.1

The economic recovery continued1

2.7 percent, backed by strong trade, logistics
and a surging tourism sector, despite the
continued weakness of the construction and
real estate sectors in the aftermath of the 2009
crisis. Backed by high oil prices and buoyant
nonhydrocarbon exports, the external current
account surplus increased markedly, to around
9 percent of GDP. Inflation remained subdued
at an average of 0.9 percent in 2011, mainly
due to a continuing decline in housing rents
and limited pass-through of international food
prices.

increased its current and development
expenditures, and extended substantial
financial support to Aldar, its flagship real
estate developer.2 Following a contraction in
2010, Dubai’s deficit increased slightly in 2011,
mostly on account of further spending from
the DFSF. Nonetheless, high oil prices led to an
improvement in the consolidated overall
balance from a deficit of 2.1 percent of GDP in
2010 to an estimated surplus of 2.9 percent of
GDP in 2011.

4.
The large property overhang
continues to be a drag on the economy.
Since mid-2008, real estate prices have fallen
by more than 60 percent in Dubai, and to a
lesser extent in Abu Dhabi. The large supply
overhang and the completion of additional
projects in the coming years render an early
and broad-based recovery of the sector
unlikely (Box 1).

Supported by accommodative
monetary policy, banks remained amply
liquid but private sector credit growth did
not pick up. In light of low U.S. interest rates,
monetary policy stayed accommodative under
the fixed exchange rate regime. Lending to the
private sector has nonetheless remained
sluggish and lagged behind the recovery in
credit growth in neighboring GCC countries, as
excess capacity in the real estate sector and
the debt overhang still limit lending
opportunities. Despite a continued rise in
nonperforming loans (second highest level
among GCC countries), the banking sector has
remained well-capitalized and profitable, as
the net interest margin has remained
comfortable. In October 2011, the authorities
quickly resolved Dubai Bank through a takeover by Emirates NBD bank.3

The recovery was supported by an
expansionary fiscal policy. The consolidated

guarantee—with a fair value of Dh768 million—for any
losses relating to existing assets for seven years.

Box 1. Real Estate Market Developments
Following the large decline in real estate prices
since 2008, some segments of the real estate
market have begun showing signs of
stabilization. By the end of 2011, in Dubai the
hotel and retail segments and some parts of the
residential market started to pick up, whereas
office rents have continued to decline. In Abu
Dhabi, where the initial real estate drop was less
pronounced, both commercial and residential
rents have continued to decline.
The ongoing large oversupply and upcoming
project completions continue to weigh on the
sector.

In Dubai, the office vacancy rate (30 percent
at end-2011) is expected to increase further
as large additional supply will come on stream
this year. Retail and hotel vacancy rates
(20 and 25 percent at end-2011, respectively)
could stabilize as fewer new projects are in
the pipeline and demand continues to be
substantial.

2

In Abu Dhabi, the real estate supply and
demand gap continues to widen. The office
market vacancy rate (23 percent at end 2011)
is expected to grow in light of the expected
large new supply. Many projects in the
residential market are also expected to come
on stream. In the hotel segment, vacancies
remain high at 35 percent.

The authorities have taken steps to help the
real estate sector. In Dubai, 220 projects in early
stages have been canceled, and the Dubai Land
Department has introduced initiatives to support
projects that are close to completion, by certifying
viable projects to facilitate financing. The Abu
Dhabi government has reviewed the project
pipeline of Abu Dhabi GREs, which are now
proceeding at a reduced pace. In addition, Aldar,

6

one of the largest developers, has received
support from the Abu Dhabi government and has
progressed with its restructuring plans to adjust
to market conditions. On the federal level, legal
amendments are under discussion that would
relax foreign ownership restrictions, which could
help boost demand.

7.
Spillovers from deleveraging in
Europe have so far been managable.
European banks, traditionally major providers
of funding for GCC borrowers, have started to
retrench from non-core markets, including the
UAE, in an effort to deleverage. While
conditions for external borrowing have
deteriorated, there are signs that Asian and
local GCC banks have increasingly stepped in
to provide funding.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
The recovery in nonhydrocarbon
growth looks set to continue in 2012. Despite
the continued domestic deleveraging and the
ongoing oversupply in the real estate market,
real nonhydrocarbon GDP growth is projected to
further strengthen to 3.5 percent, supported by
strong trade, tourism, logistics, and
manufacturing. With limited potential for further
increases in oil production in light of production
levels already close to capacity, overall GDP
growth is expected to moderate to 2.3 percent.
Inflation is likely to remain subdued at around
1½ percent. Supported by high oil prices, the
external current account surplus is projected to
further increase to 10.3 percent of GDP.

9.
Downside risks to this outlook reflect
the UAE’s reliance on hydrocarbon exports
and its close links with international markets:


A more pronounced impact of the
international sanctions on Iran could affect
the UAE through a reduction in bilateral
trade, real estate demand, tourism, and
financial services to Iran-based customers
(Box 2).



A renewed worsening of global financial
conditions could make it more difficult to
roll over GREs’ debt and banks’ wholesale
funding.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES



A decline in oil prices in light of weak
growth prospects in the advanced
economies would affect export earnings,
fiscal revenues, and ultimately
nonhydrocarbon GDP growth, with an
adverse impact on asset prices (Figure 1).4



A marked economic slowdown in
emerging Asia would affect trade, tourism,
and external financing conditions.

10.
A slowdown of the UAE economy
would also exert spillovers on other countries.
Given the UAE’s large foreign labor force,
remittances to countries in South Asia and the
Mashreq could be significantly affected (Box 3).

11.
There are also a number of mitigating
factors and upside risks to the outlook.
Central bank and sovereign wealth fund foreign
assets provide a comfortable buffer to the
economy. Higher oil prices in the context of
heightened regional geopolitical tensions would
further support fiscal revenues and the external
current account, as long as oil exports are not
disrupted. Heightened regional tensions, while
potentially affecting confidence, could also lead
to renewed safe-haven capital inflows and
increased real estate demand.

Box 2. The Economic Impact of Sanctions on Iran
Trade data available through Q3, 2011, suggest
that international sanctions on Iran since June
2010 have so far not led to a lasting reduction in
Dubai’s bilateral trade with Iran.1 Both exports to
Iran and their share in Dubai’s total exports increased
in 2011, reflecting an increased importance of reexports, which account for more than 90 percent of
bilateral trade with Iran.
The trade impact on UAE growth of the more
recent tightening of sanctions by the US and EU
on Iran is expected to be moderate. Trade could be
affected by reduced demand from Iran due to
economic hardship, and by complications with trade
finance and payments. As an illustrative scenario, a
30 percent reduction of exports to Iran would impact
the UAE’s GDP growth by 0.3 percentage point.2
____________________

Recent data for the UAE as a whole are not available.
2
Calculations assume that the local value-added content of
re-exports to Iran is 25 percent.
1

In addition to being an important trade partner,
Iran has been a significant source of demand for
real estate, tourism and financial services. The
impact of sanctions on the real estate market is
ambiguous, influenced on the one hand by capital flight
from Iran, and on the other hand by the difficulty for
Iranians to carry out large financial transactions in the
UAE. Tourism is likely to be negatively affected as are
financial services, including trade finance. However, the
latter is unlikely to significantly affect the profitability of
the UAE banking system.

Box 3. Outward Remittances
Outward remittances from the UAE are
substantial, reflecting the large foreign
workforce. Foreigners comprise more than
70 percent of UAE’s population and 96 percent of
the workforce. While the largest foreign
communities in the UAE are from South Asia, there
is also a substantial presence from the MENA
region. Most foreign workers maintain close ties to
their home countries and send remittances, which
are estimated at $11 billion (2011).

in the hydrocarbon
prices

Staff assessment: Low
The UAE remains heavily
dependent on crude oil. A
global recession followed by
several years of slow growth
would depress demand for
energy and could lead to a
sharp fall in oil and gas prices.
By contrast, a further increase in
geopolitical tensions could raise
oil prices.

Staff assessment: High
Would reduce export earnings and fiscal
revenues. While the UAE maintains
significant buffers in the form of
international reserves and sovereign wealth
fund assets, a prolonged fall in oil prices
would ultimately imply reduced fiscal
spending and nonhydrocarbon GDP growth,
and an adverse impact on asset prices. This
would also further expose vulnerabilities in
GREs and private companies affected by the
ailing real estate sector.

A marked
economic
slowdown in
emerging Asia

Staff assessment: Low
While a gradual reduction in
emerging Asia GDP growth
rates appears likely this year,
there are currently few
indications that would suggest a
pronounced economic
slowdown.

Staff assessment: Medium to High
Would affect trade, tourism, and external
financing conditions. Robust external
demand from Asia has helped limit the
impact on the UAE of the weakness of
European economies and of the international
sanctions on Iran. Moreover, increasing
capital flows from Asia have dampened the
effect of the European financial sector
deleveraging on the UAE foreign funding
situation.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability and Supporting the Economy
12.
Following last year’s fiscal expansion,
the UAE plans to start consolidating its fiscal
accounts in 2012. The federal and emirate
budgets imply a modest consolidation of the
fiscal stance by 0.5 percent of nonhydrocarbon
GDP. 5 A substantial salary increase for federal
employees and a large increase in Abu Dhabi’s
planned development expenditures are more
than offset by reductions in other expenditures
(among others the assumption of no further
bailouts) and increases in non-tax revenues.6
13.
Staff concurred with the pace of the
planned fiscal correction. Staff’s fiscal
sustainability analysis based on the permanent
income hypothesis suggests that the UAE’s
fiscal stance has been too loose to ensure
intergenerational equity.7 This is in line with the
findings of the external sustainability analysis
(Appendix I). Moreover, the fiscal break-even oil
price (the theoretical oil price at which fiscal
accounts would be in balance) has increased
markedly in recent years, from $23 in 2008 to
$92 in 2011, the second highest in the GCC,
5

The fiscal stance is defined as the consolidated nonhydrocarbon primary balance for the federal, Abu
Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah budgets including loans and
equity but excluding (i) the operations of Dubai
Financial Support Fund, (ii) Abu Dhabi government’s
support for the real estate company Aldar in 2011, and
(iii) the investment income from the sovereign wealth
funds. Abu Dhabi’s 2012 budget is not yet available;
numbers are staff estimates.
6

Effective January 2012, federal salaries were raised
between 35 and 100 percent depending on grade and
sector, adding Dh3.4 billion to the federal wage bill.

The equilibrium non-hydrocarbon primary deficit is
calculated assuming constant real per capita
government spending consistent with a constant per
capita annuity after depletion of hydrocarbon resources.

exposing the UAE to the risk of falling oil prices.
Prudent fiscal plans are also appropriate as they
increase the scope for fiscal expansion in case
downside risks to the economy materialize,
including the risk that further funds may be
needed to support ailing GREs. At the same
time, the gradual pace of fiscal consolidation
implies that the fiscal stance is unlikely to
undermine the economic recovery.

Staff advised to be vigilant regarding
the expenditure composition. The generous
federal salary increase will add to expenditure
rigidities while further raising reservation wages
for nationals seeking private sector
employment. Abu Dhabi’s recently approved
capital spending plan on education, healthcare,
industry, tourism, infrastructure, and renewable
energy projects will be an important
contribution to supporting growth, but the
magnitude of the increase in development
spending suggests a need for careful project
evaluation to ensure that spending is
productive.

15.
Both Abu Dhabi and Dubai intend to
improve their fiscal positions in the medium
term. Abu Dhabi plans a continued fiscal
consolidation through 2017. Dubai intends
to bring its fiscal accounts close to balance by
2014, as major infrastructure projects will
havebeen completed. Staff welcomed these
plans, as continued fiscal consolidation will

improve the UAE’s fiscal sustainability and will
increase the available policy space in case
downside risks, such as a sustained decline in oil
prices, materialize. Moreover, debt sustainability
analysis for Dubai indicates that the planned
fiscal consolidation is key to reducing the
emirate’s fiscal vulnerability (Box 4).

Box 4. Dubai’s Debt Sustainability
With better growth prospects and plans to
consolidate public finances, Dubai’s
government debt sustainability has
improved. Dubai’s government debt spiked in
2009 as a result of the crisis as the emirate
provided support to its troubled GREs. The
baseline scenario reflects a projected steady
recovery of growth in the medium term and a
gradual consolidation of Dubai government’s
fiscal accounts aiming to bring the fiscal
accounts close to balance by 2014 in line with
Dubai’s plans. Under this scenario, the debt-toGDP ratio is on a gradual declining path.
Fiscal consolidation is key to reducing fiscal
vulnerability, especially as GREs continue to
pose fiscal risk to the sovereign. An alternative
scenario assuming a constant primary balance at
2011 levels (1.6 percent of GDP) and
augmenting government debt by 20 percent of
GRE debt would raise the debt-to-GDP ratio by
about 26 percentage points by 2017 compared
to the baseline.

Moreover, Dubai’s debt could become
unsustainable if the economy is hit by severe
shocks. A decline in GDP growth to 1.3 percent (that
is, by ½ standard deviation from the baseline), would
add 9 percentage points to the debt-to-GDP ratio by
2017. A deterioration of the external environment
would have an even more pronounced impact: a
global downturn scenario in which growth, the real
interest rate and the primary balance deteriorate
significantly in 2012–14 and stay below baseline in
2015–17, would result in an increase in the debt-toGDP ratio to 62 percent by 2017.

The authorities noted that several
initiatives are under consideration to
diversify revenue sources and to improve
budgetary practices. The federal government
is planning an overhaul of multiple fees
collected by federal ministries. Technical
preparations are under way for the eventual
introduction of a value added tax, which is
under discussion at the GCC level. The
authorities are also conducting an economic
impact study for the possible introduction of a
corporate income tax. Passage of the draft
organic budget law would help improve
federal budgetary practices, as it mandates the
preparation of a medium-term expenditure
framework and requires the use of a treasury
single account.
17.
Low global interest rates ensure
appropriately accommodative monetary
conditions under the U.S. dollar peg while
inflation remains subdued. Low interest rates

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

facilitate the economic recovery and the
continued repair of balance sheets. At the
same time, in light of continued slack in the
economy and a high degree of flexibility and
openness of the economy, there are few nearterm inflationary risks.
18.
There is little evidence for exchange
rate misalignment. Different methodologies
yield mixed results for the exchange rate
assessment (Appendix I). The macroeconomic
balance approach shows little evidence for
misalignment, whereas the equilibrium
exchange rate approach points to moderate
undervaluation. By contrast, the external
sustainability approach indicates moderate
overvaluation, underscoring the desirability of
medium-term fiscal consolidation to support
intergenerational equity, in line with the fiscal
sustainability analysis above.

B. Managing Risks Stemming from GREs
19.
Despite recent progress in debt
restructuring, GREs are still facing financial
challenges. While the debt of some GREs has
been restructured (including Dubai World), the
process has been more protracted in other
cases, such as Dubai Holding.8 The estimated
total GRE debt declined to 51 percent of 2011
GDP as of March 2012, from 61 percent of
2010 GDP, though Abu Dhabi’s GRE debt still
rose in nominal value (Appendix II). Rollover
risks are still considerable, with $30 billion
falling due in 2012. Moreover, significant
amounts of debt will mature in 2014–15.
8

Dubai International Capital recently reached
agreement for a restructuring of $2.5 billion in
liabilities. Other restructurings under the Dubai
Holding remain under discussion.

20.
The Abu Dhabi and Dubai
authorities noted that lessons have been
learned from the crisis and that GREs have
become more proactive in managing debt
rollovers. Staff welcomed this more proactive
approach, and noted that the combination of
large refinancing needs and reliance on

against the backdrop of the current uncertain
global financial environment and the

yet test the market’s appetite for GRE debt.

identifying and monitoring GRE liabilities,
and new borrowing by GREs is subject to
approval, contingent liabilities continue to
be undisclosed.


Better availability of information on
GRE debt. Disseminating information on
GRE debt has improved, particularly by
Abu Dhabi’s debt management office.
However, the availability of information on
financial conditions, debt stock and the
maturity profile of Dubai GREs needs
further improvement. Passage of the draft
Public Debt Law would help to further
strengthen the monitoring of GRE debt.
Moreover, increased communication about
the GREs’ financing strategies would be
important to strengthen market
confidence.



Improved GRE corporate governance
and transparency would also be essential,
including by delineating clearly their
commercial and noncommercial
operations, and standardizing their
accounting, auditing, and financial
reporting practices.

21.
Staff stressed the desirability of a
comprehensive strategy aimed at bolstering
market confidence in GREs, and transparent
reporting of GRE-related fiscal risks. Such a
strategy should include:


Stronger GRE balance sheets. Further
deleveraging and strengthening of
impaired GREs’ balance sheets is required,
including, where needed, through debt
restructuring and asset sales.



Proper fiscal risk management and
reporting framework. While both Abu
Dhabi and Dubai have made progress in

The authorities noted that data
availability and risk management regarding
GREs are gradually improving. In particular,
Abu Dhabi has made public the list of
companies explicitly supported by the
government. The Dubai government, in turn,
emphasized that Dubai GREs are not backed
by a sovereign guarantee, and that the
Department of Finance and Supreme Fiscal
Committee now play a major role in GREs debt
monitoring and approval of new borrowing.

C. Financial Sector Soundness and Financial Spillovers
23.
The banking system maintains
significant buffers to withstand a further
deterioration in asset quality, though
individual banks could be affected. The NPL
ratio of national banks has sharply increased
from their 2008 pre-crisis levels to 6.2 percent
in 2011. The NPL ratio in Dubai banks is higher
at 10.6 percent. This ratio could further increase
by about 5 percentage points this year as a
result of the ongoing restructuring of Dubai
Holding, the potential restructuring of other
maturing GRE debt, repeated rescheduling of
loans, and continued stress of real estate
companies. Staff’s stress tests show that the
domestic banking system could absorb a
significant increase in nonperforming loans.9
Nevertheless, for some banks with high loan
concentration in the real estate sector, Tier 1
capital would fall below the regulatory
minimum in a severe stress scenario. The
authorities agreed with this assessment and will
continue to closely monitor banks’
capitalization.

The Central Bank of the UAE (CBU)
will continue to closely monitor the liquidity
of individual banks and encourage them to
proactively manage liquidity risks. The
funding structure of the banking system has
substantially improved since the 2009 crisis.
Nonetheless, since last summer, banks have
increased their liabilities to foreign banks
somewhat. Although the banking system
remains comfortably liquid, staff’s stress tests
indicate that a foreign funding shock may
generate some tightening of foreign currency
liquidity, which would need to be managed, in
particular, at the individual bank level. The
central bank noted that it is closely monitoring
the liquidity of banks.

25.
Looking ahead, liquidity
management will be strengthened by a new
liquidity facility and the development of
domestic capital markets. In June 2011, the
CBU launched a repurchase facility for Islamic
certificates of deposits (CD) in an effort to
provide new liquidity tools for Islamic banks.
The CBU mainly relies on CDs to manage
banking system liquidity and has started work
towards creating a marginal lending facility as a
means of providing standing liquidity when
needed. This facility, together with the
development of domestic money and bond
markets, will be key in preparing for the
implementation of the Basel 3 liquidity norms
(planned to be phased in between 2015 and
2018), both in terms of eligible liquid assets and
stable sources of funding. Passage of the draft
Public Debt Law would help accelerate the
preparations.
26.
Shielding the banking system from
further GRE risks is key. In 2011, the net
exposure of the banking system to government
and public institutions increased by 3.5 percent
of GDP (2.6 percent of banking system assets).
Staff pointed out that some of these exposures
are not consistently classified across banks’
balance sheets and government fiscal accounts,
leading to some non-transparency in bank
regulatory compliance. The authorities agreed
that there is a risk that GREs will increasingly
turn to domestic banks for their funding needs
in case they face difficulties in external
financing, and agreed with staff that it will be
important to avoid channeling bank funding to
non-viable GREs. Effective implementation of
the recently introduced aggregate limits on
bank lending to GREs will help contain banks’

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

risks from GREs.10 In addition, there was
agreement that imposing higher capital
charges and introducing forward provisioning
on exposures to risky GREs would further
mitigate risks to the banking system.

Staff stressed that the CBU should
build on recent progress in further
strengthening bank regulation. Staff
welcomed the CBU’s efforts to further increase
general and specific provisioning requirements
and to restrict dividend distribution in some
cases. Staff stressed the importance of
implementing regulations under consideration
on liquidity and real estate lending. This will
pave the way for a formal macroprudential
framework, which, with the appropriate legal
underpinning, will help calibrate regulation
from a systemic perspective. In this context,
tailoring the CBU’s early warning system to
system-wide risks (including related to GREs
and real estate) would help the central bank
identify risks at an early stage and enable
appropriate action.

10

In April 2012, the central bank set new limits of
100 percent of the capital base for all lending by a bank to
UAE emirate governments and their non-commercial
entities, and 25 percent to individual borrowers. It also
introduced an aggregate limit of 100 percent of capital of
banks for lending to commercial entities of the federal
government and local governments, and a cap of
15 percent for funded exposure to individual borrowers.

28.
Effective bank governance is
fundamental to support financial sector
soundness. There was agreement that, in light
of the government’s control of banks and the
banks’ high exposure to GREs, a clear

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

governance framework is needed to safeguard
the banks’ financial integrity. Staff suggested
that the CBU undertake a bank governance
diagnostic in the context of the forthcoming
Financial Sector Assessment Program.

D. Other Issues
Fiscal Policy Coordination

Statistics

29.
Effective intergovernmental
coordination of fiscal policy will buttress
effective demand management and fiscal
sustainability. Given the federal structure,
information sharing between the federal and
emirate governments and the CBU is a key
precondition for effective fiscal policy. Staff
welcomes progress made in information
sharing, facilitated by the Fiscal Coordination
Council (FCC), and encouraged the authorities
to include information sharing on GRE financial
operations.

31.
The authorities recognized the need
to further strengthen statistics. They have
already made good progress in establishing
databases and improving the quality of
economic statistics. The establishment of the
National Bureau of Statistics and Debt
Management Offices were important steps to
that end. Nevertheless, the authorities
recognized that more progress is needed
towards improving methodologies and timely
compilation and dissemination of key statistics,
including on balance of payments, national
accounts, fiscal accounts and labor market
statistics. Moreover, further progress is needed
in the coordination among federal and
emirate-level statistical agencies. The
authorities requested follow-up technical
assistance on national accounts statistics and
the balance of payments. They also intend to
upgrade the labor market statistics.

30.
The authorities plan to extend the
FCC’s work to the effective coordination of
fiscal policy plans. This would include the
joint determination of aggregate revenue,
expenditure, and financing plans in light of
macroeconomic and other policy
considerations, and the breakdown of these
goals into plans for the federal and emirate
level authorities. The authorities asked for
Fund technical assistance in this area.

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
The continued economic recovery is
encouraging. Growth has been supported by
high oil prices and strong demand from the
UAE’s trading partners, notwithstanding the
continued weakness of the domestic

construction and real estate sectors. The still
uncertain global environment and regional
geopolitical tensions could pose risks to the
favorable outlook, but the sizeable buffers of
the sovereign wealth funds and the central

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

bank strengthen the economy’s resilience to
external shocks.
33.
Fiscal policy is appropriately aimed
at gradual consolidation. The authorities’
fiscal plans adequately imply a gradual
unwinding of the past fiscal stimulus in
response to the 2009 crisis. The consolidation
is welcome as the expansionary stance led to
a significant increase in the breakeven oil
price and is no longer needed, and fiscal
policy should now focus on fiscal
sustainability. Prudent fiscal policy also
increases the room for maneuver in case
downside risks to the economy materialize. At
the same time, the gradual pace of
consolidation would not undermine the
economic recovery. Dubai’s plans for fiscal
consolidation are especially welcome as they
help improve the emirate’s debt sustainability
in the face of contingent liabilities related to
GREs and the still weak real estate market.
34.
Care should be taken in managing
the expenditure composition. The generous
federal salary increase adds to expenditure
rigidities, while the planned increase in Abu
Dhabi’s development expenditures suggests a
need for careful project evaluation.
35.
The policy mix will be balanced by
an accommodative monetary stance under
the peg to the U.S. dollar. Continued low
U.S. interest rates will imply appropriately
accommodative monetary conditions in the
near term accompanying the fiscal tightening
in the face of the still fragile economic
recovery. The exchange rate has remained
broadly aligned with fundamentals, and the
exchange rate peg continues to serve as an
effective nominal anchor for the economy.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

36.
Mitigating the continued risks
posed by GREs should remain a priority.
Total GRE debt as percent of GDP declined
last year and the GREs are now more
proactive in managing debt rollovers.
Nonetheless, they are still faced with high
refinancing needs and reliance on foreign
funding. Further deleveraging and
strengthening of impaired GRE balance sheets
is needed, together with increased
transparency and communications about their
financial strategies. Improvements in
corporate governance would also be essential.
37.
The CBU should continue to closely
monitor banks’ liquidity and capital
buffers. While the aggregate banking system
maintains significant buffers, individual banks
could be affected if downside risks
materialize. The CBU should continue to
encourage banks to proactively manage their
liquidity and capital positions in light of these
potential risks.
38.
The banking system should be
shielded from taking further GRE risks.
With reduced availability of foreign funding,
GRE exposures are increasingly transferred to
the domestic banking system. In this
environment, it is important to avoid
channeling bank funding to non-viable GREs.
The recently introduced aggregate limits on
lending to GREs will help contain this risk.
Imposing higher capital charges and
introducing forward provisioning on
exposures to risky GREs would further
alleviate risks to the banking system.
Classification of GRE and sovereign exposures
across banks’ balance sheets and government
fiscal accounts should be consistent to ensure
proper accounting of fiscal and banking
system risks.

39.
Developing the domestic fixed
income market would support banks’
liquidity management. Passage of the Public
Debt Law would help accelerate the process
of preparing banks for the Basel 3 liquidity
framework without constraining credit growth.
In addition, well-developed domestic debt
markets would also aid the diversification of
funding sources for corporates.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

41.
Efforts to further improve the
statistical capacity are welcome. Priority
areas are the balance of payments, national
accounts, fiscal accounts and labor market
statistics.
42.
It is recommended that the next
Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

40.
The recent progress in fiscal
coordination among federal and emiratelevel entities is encouraging. Building on
achievements in information-sharing, the next
step will be to extend the FCC’s work to the
effective coordination of fiscal policy plans
and to include information on GREs.

Appendix I. Exchange Rate Assessment
1.
The real exchange rate has continued
depreciating. Following a period of
appreciation between 2005 and 2008 in light
of inflation developments, the real effective
exchange rate (REER) has been depreciating
since 2009. It depreciated by a further
4 percent in 2011.

The macroeconomic balance approach
indicates little evidence of exchange
rate misalignment. This approach (MB)
employs a generalized method of
moments (GMM) estimation in a dynamic
panel setting, and explicitly adds
underground hydrocarbon wealth and
estimates of accumulated foreign assets.2 It
yields a current account norm surplus of
10.7 percent of GDP in 2017 (average of
four specifications ranging from 1.8 to
18.7 percent of GDP), compared to a
projected current account position of
9.1 percent, yielding little evidence of
exchange rate misalignment.

The standard methodologies for
exchange rate assessment yield mixed
results, suggesting that there is no strong
evidence for exchange rate misalignment.


The equilibrium exchange rate approach
indicates undervaluation. This approach
estimates a cointegration relationship
between the REER and the real oil price. As
of end-2011, the REER was about
10 percent undervalued.1

3.
The external sustainability approach
indicates an overvaluation of the dirham.
Based on the permanent income hypothesis,
this approach estimates the current account
norm such that future oil and financial income
is sufficient to finance a steady stream of
imports, even after the depletion of
hydrocarbon resources, supporting
intergenerational equity. Choosing a constant
real per capita annuity as a benchmark
indicates an overvaluation which implies a
need to accumulate further savings of about
8 percent of GDP in 2017.

U.A.E. rapid economic development and
diversification, large borrowing during the
boom period led to a boom-bust cycle,
reinforced by heightened vulnerabilities to the
global financial crisis. The relatively large
importance of GREs in the UAE, and the lack of
timely and aggregate information about their
performance and financial situation, creates
potential risks.
2.
Following the crisis, some progress
was made in GRE debt restructuring. The
debt restructuring of Dubai World was
completed with the involvement of the
authorities, and more recently, Dubai
International Capital announced an agreement
to restructure about $2.5 billion of its debt.
However, restructuring of other GREs debt has
been progressing more slowly. In particular, a
restructuring of $10 billion of Dubai Group
debt (part of Dubai Holding) is under
discussion.
3.
GRE activities are increasingly
coordinated within emirates. The Dubai’s
Supreme Fiscal Council is now monitoring the
overall level of sovereign and GRE debt, which
should allow for better risk management. Abu
Dhabi’s debt management office is playing a
similar role.
4.
GRE indebtedness and rollover
needs remain large. Since 2010, GRE debt
(including government-guaranteed debt) has
remained broadly stable in nominal terms
($185 billion), but the ratio of GRE debt to GDP
has fallen significantly, to 51 percent. The
UAE’s GRE debt remains high in international

comparison. Dubai GRE debt moderately
decreased while Abu Dhabi’s GRE debt rose.
Rollover needs remain significant, with
$30 billion in GRE debt maturing this year, a
multiple of maturing government debt.
Significant amounts of debt will mature in
2014–15, partly as result of earlier debt
restructuring.

5.
Refinancing this large amount of
maturing debt remains a challenge. The
GREs’ high dependence on foreign funding
increases the vulnerability to rollover and
financing risk, especially in the current volatile
external financial environment. This
vulnerability is exacerbated by the
deleveraging of European banks, which have
been reducing their exposure to the region.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

Credit rating agencies have pointed out risks
related to two 2012 maturities: DIFC
Investments’ $1.25 billion sukuk maturing in
June, and Jebel Ali Free Zone’s (JAFZA)
$2 billion sukuk maturing in November.
JAFZA has announced preliminary plans for
managing this maturity.
6.
Improved economic prospects and a
more proactive approach to managing
rollovers mitigate the refinancing risks.
Nonhydrocarbon GDP growth is gradually
picking up, supporting asset prices and
improving GREs cash flows, and GREs are now
focusing less on expansion and borrowing
than on consolidation and deleveraging. A
number of GREs are planning to use cash from
asset sales and operational cash flow to repay
part of the maturing debt.1 In response to the
prospects that some European banks may not
renew their credit, GREs are actively looking for
alternative investors, particularly in Asia and
the Gulf region. At the same time, the
authorities noted that lenders are becoming
more diligent in evaluating borrowers’
repayment capacity.
7.
Financial market developments
appear to be supporting this view of a
cautious optimism. Following a moderate
increase in late 2011, sovereign and GRE CDS
spreads have been coming down in 2012.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 10, 2012)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but there are substantial shortcomings
on the accounts of government-related corporations. In particular, there is limited data on GRE debt
and contingent liabilities to the government. The federal and individual emirates’ agencies have
improved the availability and quality of the statistics, but more progress is needed. The adoption of
the Federal Statistics Law on May 18, 2009, and the establishment of an independent National
Bureau of Statistics (NBS) are important steps in establishing a statistical system at the federal level.
While the Law expressly requires all agencies and local statistical centers to provide data as required
by the NBS, its success will depend on implementing arrangements, staffing, funding and training.
National Accounts: The methodology broadly conforms to the 1968 SNA. GDP is compiled annually
with a lag of around 12 months. Some progress has been made in improving the source data but
further work is needed to improve updating procedures, and quarterly indicators are not available.
Price statistics: Following technical assistance from the IMF Statistics Department, the Ministry of
Economy started publishing a monthly CPI since January 2008. However, price indexes and GDP
deflators need further harmonization at the federal level.
Government finance statistics: In 2008, six of the seven emirates and the federal government have
received technical support in the compilation of fiscal data on a consolidated basis, using the GFSM
2001 format and 2008 as a base year. In 2011, GFSM 2001 was introduced by the federal and several
emirate governments, and the institutional arrangement to ensure adequate data provision was
established. This consolidation should complement initiatives to establish debt management units at
both the emirate and federal levels.
Monetary statistics: The central bank has recently shifted the responsibility for compiling and
disseminating monetary data to the Banking Supervision and Examination Department, in order to
improve the timeliness of data to monthly frequency with less than a month lag. Although some
monthly aggregates and FSIs are already published on a monthly basis, the Banking Supervision and
Examination Department has not been trained in MFSM 2000 and the published data do not follow
the recommended methodology.
Balance of Payments: The information needed to compile the balance of payments is insufficient,
especially for the financial account. Many components of the IIP also are missing or incomplete, as
the data on government foreign assets and private holdings of foreign assets and liabilities are not
published or lack appropriate surveys. The development of a comprehensive Balance of Payments
and IIP is however within the reach of the U.A.E. if the central bank, the NBS, and the Ministry of
Economy strengthen their capacity and receive appropriate support at the high level. The authorities
have indicated their interest in IMF technical assistance.
II. Data Standards and Quality

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation
with the United Arab Emirates
On May 14, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United Arab Emirates.1
Background
The recovery of the economy is continuing despite the uncertain global economic environment.
High oil prices and increased production, strong growth in Asia, and the UAE’s perceived safe
haven status in the context of the regional turmoil contributed to an estimated real GDP growth
of 4.9 percent in 2011. Despite the continued weakness of the construction and real estate
sectors in the wake of the 2009 crisis, real nonhydrocarbon growth picked up to an estimated
2.7 percent last year, supported by trade, logistics, and tourism. For 2012, oil production is
projected to be flat, whereas nonoil growth is expected to strengthen further to 3.5 percent.
Inflation remained low at 0.9 percent in 2011, mainly due to a continuing decline in housing
rents, and price pressures are expected to remain subdued this year.
The Dubai World debt restructuring was completed, but several other troubled governmentrelated entities (GRE) are still in the process of restructuring. GRE indebtedness, refinancing
needs and reliance on foreign funding remain high, with about $30 billion GRE debt maturing
this year and significant amount of debt falling due in 2014–15.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2
Despite the accommodative monetary stance under the peg to the U.S. dollar, lending to the
private sector has remained sluggish as excess capacity in the real estate sector and the debt
overhang still limit lending opportunities. The banking sector has remained well-capitalized and
profitable, despite a continued rise in nonperforming loans and higher provisioning.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the continued economic recovery and favorable near-term
outlook, but noted downside risks from the uncertain global environment and regional
geopolitical tensions. Going forward, Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their
efforts to sustain growth and diversify the economy, while maintaining macroeconomic and
financial stability.
Directors regarded the fiscal stance as appropriately focused on a gradual consolidation to
unwind the large fiscal stimulus undertaken in response to the 2009 crisis without undermining
the economic recovery. They particularly welcomed the consolidation plans in Dubai, which will
help improve the emirate’s debt sustainability in the face of contingent liabilities related to
government-related entities (GRE) and the still weak real estate market. Noting the recent
federal salary hike and the planned increases in development spending in Abu Dhabi, Directors
emphasized the importance of managing the composition of public expenditure carefully. They
commended the authorities’ efforts to strengthen coordination of fiscal policies between the
federal and emirate governments.
Directors agreed that a continued accommodative monetary stance under the peg to the
U.S. dollar would counteract fiscal tightening and support the economic recovery. They took
note of the staff assessment that the exchange rate has remained broadly aligned with
fundamentals, and agreed that the exchange rate peg continues to serve as an effective
nominal anchor for the economy.
Directors noted the progress made in restructuring and managing the debt of GREs, but
stressed the need for further efforts to mitigate the fiscal risks posed by these entities. They
cautioned that GREs are still faced with high refinancing needs and are reliant on foreign
funding. In this context, Directors encouraged further deleveraging and strengthening of
impaired GRE balance sheets, increased transparency, and improvements in corporate
governance at GREs.
Directors took note of the resilience of the banking sector grounded on ample liquidity and
capital buffers. They nonetheless encouraged the authorities to continue monitoring closely the
financial situation of individual banks and their ability to cope with adverse shocks. Directors
emphasized the importance of shielding the banking system from taking further GRE-related
risks, including by avoiding channeling bank funding to non-viable GREs. In this regard, they
welcomed the recent introduction of aggregate lending limits to GREs. Directors also suggested
further strengthening the governance framework for the financial sector. Looking forward, they
encouraged the development of domestic debt markets, which would among other things
support banks’ liquidity management in preparation for the introduction of the Basel III liquidity
framework.

3
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the statistical base, including the plans
for improving the national accounts, balance of payments, fiscal accounts, and labor market
statistics.

Statement by Mr. Shaalan, Executive Director for the United Arab Emirates
May 14, 2012

1.
On behalf of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) authorities, I thank staff for their
engagement and the constructive Article IV Consultation discussions. The authorities highly
value the views of the Fund on the UAE’s economic and financial policies.
Overview
2.
The UAE has weathered the global economic and financial crisis well, on account of
strong fundamentals as well as timely policy responses. The economy has benefited from an
increase in hydrocarbon prices and production. Moreover, the economic recovery in non-oil
sectors continues to gain momentum, especially in trade and tourism which offset the
slowdown in construction and real estate. The authorities remain committed to policies aimed
at sustaining growth and diversifying the economy, while maintaining macroeconomic and
financial stability.
Fiscal Consolidation
3.
Fiscal policy is shifting from an expansionary phase to a consolidation phase, which
will be implemented at a gradual pace in order not to undermine the economic recovery. This
consolidation will further widen the fiscal space to support the economy in the event that
downside risks––such as a decline in oil prices––were to materialize. The government of Abu
Dhabi will start implementing its fiscal consolidation plan as of this year, having already
completed a review of its development strategy. Plans are for Dubai to further cut public
spending and balance its fiscal accounts by 2014.
4.
The authorities remain committed to reducing the dependence of fiscal revenues on
the hydrocarbon sector. They are considering several initiatives in this regard, including the
introduction of a value-added tax in the context of a GCC-wide initiative and a corporate
income tax.
5.
Fiscal Policy Coordination - The authorities consider intergovernmental coordination
to be key for an effective fiscal policy. The Fiscal Coordination Council (FCC) has been
facilitating the exchange of information between the federal and emirate governments. The
authorities plan to further extend the FCC’s role to coordinating fiscal policy among the
different tiers of government and have requested Fund technical assistance in this regard.
6.
Government Related Entities - The government is addressing the pending
Government-Related Entities (GREs) issues. The Dubai World debt restructuring was
completed and several other troubled GREs are in the process of restructuring. GRE risk
management is being strengthened; data availability has improved with the Abu Dhabi
authorities publishing the list of companies supported by it; and the government of Dubai has
clarified that Dubai GREs are not backed by sovereign guarantees. The Department of
Finance and the Supreme Fiscal Committee are playing a major role in Dubai GRE debt
monitoring and in the approval of new borrowing.

2

Financial Sector Policies
7.
The financial sector remains resilient to domestic and external shocks, thanks to the
central bank’s strong regulation and macroprudential policies. The banking sector is highly
capitalized and profitable. However, credit growth to the private sector is still sluggish,
mainly due to the performance of the real estate sector.
8.
The Central Bank of the UAE has actively pursued policies aimed at preserving the
soundness of the financial sector. It has taken timely measures to support financial stability
by providing liquidity, guaranteeing deposits, and encouraging bank capitalization. It will
continue to closely monitor the capital adequacy and liquidity of banks, especially those that
were found to be most vulnerable under severe stress test scenarios. The central bank is
striving to develop domestic capital markets, and it has launched a repurchase facility for
Islamic certificates of deposit. Banking regulations have been strengthened by tightened
limits on large exposures, and by introducing caps on loans to local governments and their
related entities.
9.
Spillover effects - The authorities appreciate staff’s work on the global spillovers to
the UAE’s financial system. They share staff’s view that financial vulnerabilities have
decreased since the 2008 real estate problems. While stress tests show that the banking sector
has adequate liquidity to withstand substantial shocks and is moderately exposed to Europe,
staff points in their Selected Issues Paper to continued vulnerabilities to global financial
conditions in a few banks, especially those with high exposure to the real estate sector. In this
regard, it is worth mentioning that the central bank has been very active in this regard, and
will continue to remain vigilant and monitor cross border and domestic interbank exposures.
It stands ready to take additional remedial actions if needed to mitigate possible risks and
strengthen the stability of the system. The authorities look forward to the forthcoming
Financial Sector Stability Assessment which is expected to take place in the course of 2012.
Other Reforms
10.
The federal government will further improve the business environment in order to
keep attracting foreign investment. Tourism remains a priority as part of efforts to diversify
the economy. Labor policy will continue to focus on increasing the employment of Emiratis
in the private sector. Abu Dhabi’s capital spending plan on tourism, health, infrastructure,
and renewable energy projects will also help to support the economic recovery and create
jobs for UAE citizens.
11.
The authorities are committed to continue their progress in improving the quality and
coverage of economic statistics. They have established the National Bureau of Statistics and
Debt Management Offices, and will continue to improve the compilation and dissemination
of national, fiscal, and external accounts.
