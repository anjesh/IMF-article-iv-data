INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with the Republic of Korea
Approved by Daniel Citrin and Martin Fetherston
August 8, 2008

•

This report is based on discussions held in Seoul during June 12−24. The staff team
comprised Messrs. Schiff (Head), Khatri, Lueth, and Syed (all APD), Mr. Dodd (MCM),
and Ms. Karasulu (Resident Representative). Mr. Yoon (OED) also participated.

•

Counterparts. The mission met with Minister of Strategy and Finance Kang, Bank of
Korea (BOK) Governor Lee, Financial Services Commission Chairman Jun, Financial
Supervisory Service Governor Kim, Blue House Senior Secretaries B. Bahk and J. Bahk,
and other senior officials, academics, and private sector representatives.

•

Context of past surveillance. The Fund and the authorities have agreed on the broad
policy priorities in recent years. Directors have stressed the need to address long-term
challenges to Korea’s growth, notably by revitalizing the small-and medium-sized
enterprise sector, enhancing service sector productivity, developing the financial sector,
modernizing the labor market, and accommodating aging-related fiscal pressures.

•

Statistical base. Adequate to conduct effective surveillance, but fiscal reporting needs to
be improved. Korea subscribes to the SDDS.

•

Korea’s exchange rate is market determined. Korea has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. Korea maintains exchange restrictions for
security reasons, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolutions, which have been
notified to the Fund under the procedures set forth in Executive Board
Decision 144-(52/51).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Outlook
•

Korea’s business cycle is turning downward while inflation pressures have increased.
After reaching 5 percent in 2007, real GDP growth is expected to fall to around 4 percent
this year in line with the deteriorating external environment, before recovering to 4¼ percent
next year. Risks are mainly external and on the downside, but a volatile domestic political
environment also clouds the outlook. Inflation pressures have risen, largely due to higher
global commodity prices, but should ease as growth slows. Headline inflation hit 5½ percent
in June, and has exceeded the BOK’s target range for eight consecutive months.

•

The current account has fallen into deficit, reflecting a deterioration in Korea’s terms
of trade. Despite still solid export growth, higher commodity prices have led imports to rise
even more sharply, while the services account deficit remains sizable. A current account
deficit of around 1¼ percent of GDP is expected this year, declining to 1 percent in 2009.

•

Korea has not escaped the global financial turmoil unscathed. While the direct impact
has been small, indirect effects have been notable as stock prices have declined; volatility
has increased; spreads on external debt have widened; and the won has depreciated sharply.
Some financial sector vulnerabilities have emerged, notably liquidity risks for banks reliant
on wholesale funding, but should be manageable.

•

The exchange rate appears broadly appropriately valued. The won is largely market
determined and, despite the recent depreciation, there are no clear signs of misalignment.

Key Issues and Policy Discussions
•

Staff and the authorities agreed that monetary policy should, for now, remain focused
on inflation. An increase in policy rates would be appropriate at this time, with potential
scope for some accommodation in coming quarters should inflation moderate and growth
remain soft. Staff cautioned against seeking to influence the exchange rate level to combat
inflation, urging reliance instead on the BOK’s inflation targeting framework.

•

Financial risks are being addressed. Supervisors are focused on limiting liquidity risks,
but enhanced stress-testing and contingency planning would also help. Short-term external
debt has risen sharply in recent years and should be monitored, but risks remain moderate.
Overall bank loan quality is strong but an economic slowdown could reveal vulnerabilities,
particularly in SME lending. Increased financial sector competition, in light of the Capital
Market Consolidation Act taking effect in 2009, should contribute to growth but will require
enhanced financial oversight to meet new regulatory challenges.

•

Plans for addressing long-term challenges are broadly in line with past Fund advice.
The government aims to address structural challenges to growth through deregulation,
privatization, and tax cuts. However, it is important to ensure that lower tax rates and tax
incentives do not compromise longer-term fiscal sustainability, especially in light of Korea’s
aging population.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Difficult global conditions have made this a challenging year for Korea. First,
against the backdrop of a global slowdown, economic activity in Korea is moderating, while
surging global commodity prices and a weakening of the won are contributing to rising
domestic inflation. Second, while the Korean financial system remains in good health,
increased global volatility has raised near-term risks, and ongoing structural changes to the
financial sector present challenges as well as opportunities to incorporate lessons learned
from the global financial crisis. Korea also faces longer-term challenges to its impressive
record of economic growth, which the new government aims to address with a wide-ranging
set of reforms.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
2.
In line with a deteriorating external environment, the business cycle in Korea is
turning downward (Figure 1). Growth is expected to moderate to 4.1 percent this year,
having slowed to 0.8 percent (q/q, s.a.) in the first quarter of the year and a similar pace in
the second quarter, according to preliminary data (Table 1). Exports have remained strong,
but domestic demand has softened, with employment growth and investment weakening, and
consumer and business confidence declining sharply. The housing market remains subdued,
burdened by regulations imposed in the last two years and supply overhang. In the rest
of 2008, continued slow global growth is likely to constrain exports and investment while
high food and fuel prices limit consumption gains. The economy is expected to regain
momentum early next year, in line with Korea’s trading partners, with annual growth
reaching 4.3 percent.

won depreciation. Core inflation is
trending up, suggesting growing second-round effects, and inflation expectations are rising.
While wage pressures are not yet evident, major labor negotiations are due this summer.
However, under staff’s central scenario, a negative output gap and moderating food and fuel
price inflation should help bring headline inflation down starting the first quarter of next year,
returning to the target band in the last quarter.
4.
The current account, hit hard by the deterioration in Korea’s terms of trade,
has been in deficit for most of 2008, but shows signs of improvement. Export growth has
remained robust through the second quarter (23 percent y/y), as weaker exports to the United
States have been offset by growth in exports to China, the EU, Latin America and the Middle
East (Figure 2). However, higher commodity prices have led imports to rise even more
sharply (30 percent y/y). While the services deficit remains large, as Koreans continue to
travel abroad, including for education, both trade and service balances have improved in
recent months owing to a weaker won. A current account deficit of 1¼ percent of GDP is
expected this year, declining to 1 percent in 2009 (Table 2). On the capital account, net
equity and FDI outflows have more than offset bond and other inflows, mainly short-term
bank borrowing (Figure 3).

Korea’s economy has demonstrated resilience in the face of the global financial
turmoil, but has not escaped unscathed. The direct impact of the global credit crisis has
been small.1 Nevertheless, indirect effects have been significant and broadly in line with
regional developments: stock prices have declined; financial market volatility has increased;
spreads on external debt have widened; and the won has depreciated by around 7¾ percent
against the dollar and by around 13 percent in real effective terms so far this year (Figure 4).
Some financial sector risks have also emerged in the context of the global credit market
strains, as discussed below.
6.
Risks to the outlook are sizable for both growth and inflation. While the baseline
scenario is relatively benign, with only a modest slowdown and a gradual return of inflation
to its target range, there are more than the usual uncertainties surrounding these projections.
A sharper or more prolonged global slowdown or further volatility in global financial
conditions would have a significant impact on Korea’s growth. While Korea’s trade exposure
to the United States and Europe is modest by Asian standards, financial effects could be
larger, related to lower asset prices; increased volatility of capital flows and exchange rates;
dampened confidence; and tighter liquidity and credit conditions. Should commodity prices
rise further or wage pressures and other second-round effects become stronger, inflation
could remain high, worsening the growth-inflation tradeoff.2 On the upside, domestic demand
could prove more resilient than expected, in particular if the government’s pro-growth
policies are enacted.
7.
A fractious political environment exacerbates the uncertainty in the outlook.
Lee Myung-bak won the December 2007 presidential election, and his conservative Grand
National Party won a slim majority in parliamentary elections in April. However, large
public protests—sparked by health concerns surrounding the decision to restart U.S. beef
imports—have dogged the administration since early May, resulting in a plummeting of the
president’s approval ratings and a cabinet reshuffle. The administration’s ability to
implement its economic agenda, which aims to raise potential growth, may be restricted in
the immediate aftermath.

Holdings by Korean banks of subprime-related RMBS and CDOs is reported to be around $660 million, and
net exposure to structured investments around $2 billion (or 2 percent of banks’ equity). Reported exposure of
Korean banks and insurance companies to securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is also small, at
around $550 million.

A selected issues paper examines the macroeconomic impact of alternative shocks and outlines potential
monetary policy responses. The results suggest that a 50 percent increase in oil prices relative to the baseline
from the third quarter of this year would increase annual average inflation by around 0.2 percentage points in
2008 and 0.5 percentage points in 2009.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
Against the backdrop of the global financial turmoil and slowdown and higher
commodity prices, discussions focused on policies to address near-term vulnerabilities
facing Korea. Staff discussed with the authorities the macroeconomic policy mix needed to
respond to the slowdown and inflation pressures; discussed how best to address financial
sector risks, both in the near term and in the context of ongoing financial reforms; and
revisited selected structural issues, in the context of the new administration’s policy agenda.
A. Macroeconomic Policies: Getting the Balance Right
Macroeconomic policies should be focused on ensuring that inflation expectations remain
well anchored. A rise in policy interest rates would be appropriate at this time, with potential
scope for more accommodative policy later, should inflation moderate and the economy
remain soft. Korea’s flexible exchange rate regime has served the country well in the past
and continues to be appropriate, with any efforts to influence the value of the won for an
extended period of time likely to be costly and ineffective.
Background
9.
Monetary policy has been on hold for a year. Policy rates have been held steady at
5 percent since last August, and have turned mildly negative in real terms. Monetary
conditions have loosened significantly in recent months with the decline in real interest rates
and the real effective exchange rate, while money and credit growth are robust.

expected to slow below potential this year,
the projected 2008 deficit of 1¼ percent of GDP provides an expansionary fiscal impulse of
around 1½ percent of GDP. In particular, several measures have been announced after the
passage of the 2008 budget, including ½ percent of GDP in fuel tax and tariff cuts enacted
in April and an additional package of ½ percent of GDP in loosely targeted tax rebates and
subsidies to address higher fuel prices presented in June.4 5
11.
The exchange rate is largely market determined and, despite the recent sharp
depreciation, remains broadly in line with fundamentals. Various estimates suggest that
the exchange rate is close to its long-run equilibrium and competitiveness is solid, with
double-digit export growth for the past five years; increased diversification of exports
markets; and a steady share of world exports (Box 1). Intervention—which has historically
largely been limited to smoothing volatility—has reportedly been stepped up since June to
support the won, in the context of rising price pressures.6

3

Major steps taken include increasing incentives for credit card use, enabling improved detection of incomes of
the self-employed and SMEs, and increasing penalties for tax evasion.

4

While the 2008 budget targets a deficit of around 1 percent of GDP (excluding the social security fund), it is
predicated on very conservative revenue projections. Base-broadening measures and high corporate profitability
in 2007, as well as significantly higher-than-budgeted oil prices, are likely to result in a sizable
overperformance again this year. This should largely offset revenue losses from the measures announced since
the passage of the budget.

5

The latter package consists of tax rebates of up to W 240,000 (around $240) covering 78 percent of wage
earners and 87 percent of the self-employed, amounting to about 0.3 percent of GDP; an oil subsidy for bus
drivers, shippers, truckers, farmers and fishermen linked to diesel prices, amounting to around 0.1 percent of
GDP; and transfers of 0.1 percent of GDP to two state-owned utility companies to compensate for a freeze in
utility charges during the first half of the year. A similar package is being considered for next year.

6

The BOK does not provide intervention data, but reserves have declined by around $14½ billion so far this
year, with a $10½ billion fall in July.

13
Box 1. Assessing the Exchange Rate and External Stability
While the won has depreciated sharply this year, staff finds that its recent movements are broadly in line with fundamentals—
mainly the terms of trade—and the currency remains close to equilibrium. Relatedly, staff finds that the underlying current account
is close to equilibrium and risks to external stability are modest.
Regional REER

Over the medium term, Korea’s real effective exchange rate
(REER) has been in line with the region. From this perspective,
the recent fall in the won has reversed a three-year appreciation that
was exceptional by regional standards.

In addition, Korea’s REER is now in line with its 25-year
average. This need not be viewed as an equilibrium level but is a
reasonable proxy for a currency’s purchasing power-parity (PPP)
value, given estimates in the literature of the half-life of deviations
from PPP.

Exchange Rate Misalignment According to the CGER Exercise 1
(Percent)

According to the equilibrium REER approach, Korea’s
equilibrium exchange rate depreciated by 2 percent on account
of higher oil prices since February. With the actual REER
falling by 11 percent since then, this implies that the won is
now undervalued by 15 percent, compared to 6 percent in
February.

account in February, reflecting the deterioration in the oil
balance. With an underlying current account deficit of
1.1 percent of GDP, this implies that the won is now overvalued by 2 percent, compared to 4 percent in February.

•

According to the external sustainability approach, a current account deficit of 1.3 percent of GDP stabilizes Korea’s NFA
position. This implies zero misalignment.

The increasing size and the change in composition of Korea’s net international investment position (NIIP) add modestly to
external vulnerability, but the external position remains stable. The NIIP declined from a negative 13 percent of GDP in 2004
to a negative 24 percent in 2007 and the composition of liabilities shifted toward equity and short-term debt. However, the NIIP
remains modest by international standards and the deterioration owes much to Korea’s strong stock market performance in 2005
and bank borrowing that is backed by export proceeds from ship orders (Box 2).

Discussions
12.
Staff and the authorities agreed that with price pressures growing rapidly,
efforts should be focused on ensuring that inflation expectations remain well anchored.
In particular, with liquidity and credit growth robust and a still-positive output gap, the
mainly cost-push inflation could morph into a more pervasive inflation, raising sharply
inflation expectations. In staff’s view, an increase in policy rates would be appropriate at this
time. While acknowledging the authorities’ concerns about potential effects on household
balance sheets, staff argued that an entrenchment of rising inflation expectations could
require a more forceful—and more costly—tightening later and constrain economic growth.7
With headline inflation likely to remain above the target range for some time, staff also
stressed the importance of the BOK communicating clearly the consistency of price
developments with the inflation targeting framework, whose credibility is facing its strongest
test since its adoption. Looking ahead, staff saw potential scope for more accommodative
monetary policies in the coming quarters, should inflation begin to moderate and growth
remain soft. Should commodity prices rise further, policy options would become more
difficult, but staff stressed that remaining ahead of the curve on inflation should continue to
be a key objective. The authorities broadly agreed with this assessment, although not
necessarily with the need for a rate hike at this time. On the other hand, the BOK also saw
accommodation as less likely given their more optimistic growth outlook.
13.
While the authorities saw a role for the exchange rate in combating inflation,
staff argued that exchange rate flexibility, with intervention limited to smoothing,
remained appropriate. The authorities reiterated that they viewed recent interventions as
temporary and were not seeking to target a particular exchange rate level, but saw slowing
the depreciation of the won as part of their arsenal in combating price pressures. Staff argued
that intervention would be costly and unlikely to be effective in maintaining the exchange
rate above its equilibrium for an extended period. Moreover, to maximize the effectiveness of
the inflation targeting framework, efforts to combat inflation should be focused on the policy
interest rate.
14.
This year’s fiscal stance appears broadly appropriate, with only limited scope
for further stimulus. Staff argued that, in the context of a sharper or more prolonged
slowdown, automatic stabilizers should first be allowed to operate. With growth remaining
below potential, there could be room for further modest stimulus in the context of
the 2009 budget, in particular to protect the most vulnerable, should commodity prices rise
further. In this regard, staff stressed the need to ensure that any future transfers are
7

A selected issues paper examines the sensitivity of household balance sheets to various shocks. The results
suggest that a 300 bps increase in interest rates could increase households’ debt-at-risk by about 17 percentage
points (to 39 percent of total debt) and debt service-to-income ratios by 16 percentage points (to around
53 percent). These effects are 2–3 times larger than from a 100bps increase.

15
well-timed and better targeted than under this year’s package, and cautioned against further
cuts in fuel taxes or price controls, which would encourage oil consumption in a time of
scarcity and may provide benefits disproportionately to the well-off. The authorities agreed
in principle, but fell short of ruling out such measures if oil prices continued to rise. Given
Korea’s medium-term fiscal challenges, staff emphasized that any measures taken should be
easily reversible; the authorities concurred and indicated that packages announced since the
passage of the budget were explicitly temporary.
B. Addressing Financial Sector Risks: Preparing for Volatility
While the Korean financial system remains healthy, the global turmoil has exposed some
vulnerabilities. Korean banks, which are heavily reliant on wholesale funding, could face
liquidity risk should global credit conditions deteriorate further. Short-term external debt,
which has risen sharply, should also be monitored closely, although risks remain moderate.
While overall bank loan quality is strong, risks could emerge in the context of a slowdown,
particularly in SME lending. Moreover, household debt is high, and susceptible to interest
rate and income shocks.
Background
15.
The Korean financial sector remains generally healthy (Table 4). Banks are well
capitalized, with nonperforming loans below 1 percent and high levels of provisioning.
Moreover, direct exposures of Korean banks to the problem subprime assets have been
limited.

Nevertheless pockets of concern remain, in particular in the context of the
ongoing global financial crisis:
•

Elevated global credit strains have drawn attention to banks reliant on wholesale
financing as vulnerable to heightened liquidity risk. Korean banks have some of
the highest loan-to-deposit ratios in the region, reflecting an ongoing shift away from
bank deposits by households and an interest-income-focused business model of banks
(Figure 5). These factors have increased reliance on wholesale financing to fund

Given the important role of AMCs
in the money market (where they provide around 40 percent of funds), this could spill
over to broader liquidity conditions and affect confidence in the financial system.8

•

Short-term external debt, largely borrowing by foreign bank branches, has risen
sharply in the last two years. Such borrowing has been largely the counterpart to
hedging-related forward contracts and, more recently, to take advantage of arbitrage
opportunities in the sovereign bond market. In response, in the second half of 2007,
the authorities adopted several policies that effectively tightened foreign currency
funding, adding to concerns about dollar liquidity risks and contributing to the
persistent deviations from covered interest parity.9 While sudden reversals of these
flows could prove disruptive, their size and nature do not currently raise alarm bells,
and such borrowing has shown recent signs of slowing (Box 2).

Receipts from redemptions by AMC investors might be re-deposited with banks but there may be timing
issues which would add to liquidity risk for banks.

Beyond the extensive use of moral suasion, restrictions were imposed on foreign currency loans in August
2007; and the maximum tax deductible on interest paid on related-party loans for domestic branches of foreign
banks was reduced from six to three times capital (the “thin-cap” rule) in January, but reversed in July.

While banks’ overall asset quality is strong, an economic slowdown could reveal
new vulnerabilities. The sustained rapid growth of lending to SMEs, at nearly
20 percent (y/y), carries risks, in particular as their profits are low and there is little
evidence that increased borrowing has been translated into higher investment.
Another concern is a possible deterioration of asset quality related to exposures to the
slumping construction and real estate development sectors, especially for mutual
savings banks (MSBs) but, given the modest size of MSBs, these risks are not
systemic. In addition, the high level of household debt at nearly 70 percent of GDP—
most of which is variable rate—raises the sensitivity of balance sheets to credit and
income shocks, while the expiration of grace periods on newer amortizing loans could
pose a challenge over the next several years.10

The authorities agreed with staff on the nature of the liquidity risks faced by
Korean banks, and have strengthened their oversight of these in the wake of the global
financial turmoil. Financial regulators have strengthened monitoring of short-term liquid
asset ratios and have been tracking domestic banks’ external debt on a daily basis since last
August. Staff agreed that these measures are helpful, but stressed that recent international
experience points to the need for strengthening stress-testing—in particular to allow for the
possibility of large and multiple shocks and to account for the possible evaporation of
liquidity in some asset classes during crises—as well as closer integration of such tests with
banks’ contingency plans. Staff also suggested that the BOK and financial regulator should
ensure that their own stress tests adequately account for the possibility of multiple shocks,
contagion between financial institutions, and macroeconomic effects, and are linked to their

Box 2. External Debt Developments
Korea’s total external liabilities increased by $152 billion since end-2006 to $412 billion, or nearly 40 percent of
GDP, in the first quarter of 2008. More than 40 percent of the increase has been short-term borrowing, raising
concerns about the possibility of increased volatility or rapid

Around half of the increase in short-term borrowing
has been in the context of banks providing currency
hedging. Typically, exporters (particularly shipbuilders)
and domestic investors abroad sell expected dollar
receipts forward to domestic banks and foreign bank
branches (FBB) in Korea, which borrow dollars abroad to
match their currency exposure. The rapid increase in
hedging related debt flows has reflected a sharp rise in
ship orders and exporters’ hedging ratios and increased
outward investment (Figure 3).1 Such borrowing has been
particularly pronounced for FBBs: as a large portion of
their borrowing comes from their headquarters, rollover
risk would not be subject to the counterparty risk that has
hampered interbank markets globally. Nevertheless, close
monitoring and cooperation with parent supervisors would
need to continue.
Another 11 percent of the rise in external debt reflects
advance receipts for ship exports, which show up as
trade credits until delivery. As this debt is backed by
future exports, little risk would seem to be attached.

Around 25 percent of the overall increase in external debt relates to purchases of Korean sovereign bonds by
nonresidents. This is won denominated and driven by the possibility of arbitrage gains. While such flows could be
reversed, foreign holdings of Korean sovereign bonds remain quite modest, at less than 10 percent of the total.
Domestic banks have also increased their foreign currency external borrowing since 2006, although their reliance
on external funding remains limited.

Recent BOP data suggest that external debt has begun to moderate and this trend is expected to continue.
Reduced forward selling could be expected from a slowing in both the growth of ship orders and investment abroad by
Korean residents in the context of the global slowdown. Recent exchange rate developments may also reduce desired
hedging ratios, as much of the previous hedging was in the context of an appreciating trend for the won.

contingency planning. Finally, staff underlined the importance of reviewing communication
and cooperation between supervisors, the central bank and the government to ensure the
necessary procedures are in place to coordinate responses under stress scenarios. The
authorities were receptive to these suggestions and are in the process of developing an
official coordination forum to complement ongoing monthly inter-agency meetings.
18.
The authorities indicated that options for providing liquidity during extreme
financing stress were adequate. The authorities felt that there was sufficient scope for
providing liquidity support to banks if needed, given the large stock of eligible collateral in
the form of outstanding public bonds on bank balance sheets (around $73 billion or around
19 percent of total wholesale funding of commercial banks) and with the repo facility
established in March providing overnight liquidity to banks, with access confidential to
address potential stigma. In addition, the BOK has the ability to relax collateral requirements
at short notice, and under exceptional circumstances, open market operations could also be
used to provide liquidity to individual banks or financial companies. Providing liquidity to
nonbanks is less straightforward—it would likely require the BOK to do so indirectly via
banks—and more problematic as a policy.
19.
Staff argued that preparedness for increased volatility also calls for a push to
reform the money market. Korea’s money market is overly dependent on unsecured call
money, reflecting insufficient pricing of credit risk and the costs of administering repos. As
recent events in advanced economies have shown, having an effective repo market is
especially important under stress conditions. A strategy to deepen money markets in Korea
has been developed, and several key steps—including the abolishment of the withholding tax
on repos for domestic financial institutions—have been taken. Despite this progress,
however, there has not been a meaningful increase in secured lending to date. Staff
emphasized that a concerted effort was needed to complete the money market reform
agenda.11
20.
While the run-up in short-term external debt merits close monitoring, staff
stressed that policies aimed at restricting capital inflows should be avoided. The
authorities agreed, although they were understandably concerned about potential
vulnerabilities, and market views of such. Staff cautioned that measures aimed at limiting
external borrowing were unlikely to prove effective for long, and could be
counterproductive: such limits would tend to increase arbitrage opportunities encouraging
potentially more volatile or less transparent inflows, and could have an adverse impact on
investor confidence. Attempts to fine-tune capital flows by changing regulations, such as the
changes to the “thin cap” rule, are likely to have similar drawbacks. Staff felt that policies

11

Main remaining elements include the introduction of a master repo agreement to reduce transaction costs and
the adoption of a transaction-based fee structure to encourage repo agreements with longer-term maturities.

21
should instead continue to focus on strengthening the financial sector’s resilience to volatility
and shocks by deepening markets and enhancing financial oversight.
21.
Staff suggested that other still-modest risks to asset quality could be addressed
by continuing to strengthen risk management in financial institutions. Adoption by
banks of appropriate risk-assessment methods will be necessitated by the move from
rules-based to risk-based supervision under Basel II, to which Korea is in the process of
transitioning. The authorities agreed, and also noted that they were monitoring SME lending
and default rates daily, particularly in the construction and wholesale/retail sectors, and that
some measures had already been taken, such as ceilings on project finance lending by MSBs
imposed late last year. With household debt increasing faster than income in recent years, the
authorities were also carefully assessing any signs of a potential deterioration in debt
servicing capacity. The authorities also indicated that they were monitoring the ongoing
transition to amortizing loans closely, but thought that risks were small given that the
delinquency rate on mortgages is very low, at 0.37 percent, and had declined in the past year.
C. The Future of Korea’s Financial Sector: Fostering Growth and Innovation
Financial sector development has lagged overall economic development and deficiencies
have been recognized by the authorities, as demonstrated in the Capital Market
Consolidation Act (CMCA) that comes into effect in February 2009. Looking ahead,
structural changes to the financial sector will present both challenges and opportunities.
Background
22.
The Capital Markets Consolidation Act (CMCA) should bring important
benefits, but will also present new challenges for Korean banks and regulators. The
CMCA will remove restrictions that separate securities, futures, asset management, trust
services, and other financial services businesses, and introduce a negative list for new
financial products. The Act is also expected to lead to consolidation of the securities industry
and emergence of domestic investment banks. Increased competition should generate
efficiency gains, improve the allocation of capital, and raise the role of the financial sector in
generating long-term growth. However, it will also place a premium on enhancing financial
oversight and may increase wholesale funding dependence of banks, raising vulnerabilities
and necessitating a change in their business models. With financial sector reforms, the
government also plans to reduce the role of public banks and proposes to gradually raise the
equity limit on nonfinancial corporate ownership of financial institutions from the current
4 percent to 10 percent.12

A selected issues paper discusses financial sector challenges in the face of the CMCA.

22
23.
The establishment of the Korea Investment Corporation (KIC) was, in part,
aimed at developing an asset management industry, but it has so far played a small role
in this regard. However, the KIC has recently expanded its assets under management.13 KIC
is a member of the International Working Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds, and is
supportive of efforts to develop a voluntary code for such funds.
Discussions
24.
Staff stressed that financial oversight will need to evolve to address the changing
nature of the sector. Emphasis will need to be placed on adapting regulation to limit the
scope for regulatory arbitrage; development by regulators and supervisors of skills to deal
with more complex institutions and products; and ensuring that regulation does not stifle
financial development. In this process, it will be critical to ensure that enhanced regulatory
and supervision capacity precedes market growth and rapid innovation—indeed, a proper
regulatory framework should be conducive to market development—and that supervision
remains independent.14 In the context of ongoing global financial stresses, staff suggested that
the timing of the adoption of the CMCA also provides an important opportunity to reflect the
lessons from the current crisis (Box 3). The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment of the
risks associated with the introduction of the CMCA, stressing in particular the challenges
faced in building quickly supervisory skills to deal with the new environment.

closer to advanced country standards and to broaden the investor base for financial

Box 3. Key Lessons from the U.S. Financial Crisis1
The financial crisis that arose from subprime mortgage failures in the United States serves as a portent for
financial policy makers in Korea. The rapid spread of the crisis occurred despite a U.S. financial system
characterized by well capitalized banks and securities firms, highly liquid securities and derivatives markets, low
credit spreads and high degrees of funding liquidity. With Korea’s financial system expected to become more
dynamic and competitive in the coming years, lessons that can be drawn from the crisis include:
•

Financial innovation needs to be accompanied by commensurate improvements in sophistication and
oversight. Although Korea’s mortgage market is comprised of few mortgage backed securities, the market
for other asset backed securities (ABS) is sizable and there are strong prospects for innovations. In
anticipation of these developments, Korean policy makers need to bear in mind the risks from innovation.
Specifically, more complex financial instruments often rely on valuation models that are imperfect and
inadequately tested. That was the case with pricing of various tranches of credit risk in the U.S. mortgage
instruments. In addition, ABS and CDO instruments can contain a variety of assets and this raises the cost of
due diligence, necessitates higher disclosure requirements, and makes market surveillance more difficult.

•

Over-the-counter (OTC) financial markets, such as those for securities and derivatives, can freeze up
during times of crisis. In the United States, OTC markets for CDOs, credit derivatives, municipal bonds,
asset-backed commercial paper and student loan backed securities, suffered from market trading illiquidity
during various phases of the financial crisis. Korea’s financial system is also comprised of OTC markets for a
range of financial instruments, and policy makers will need to consider measures to make trading liquidity
more resilient to market turmoil. Toward this end, Brazilian authorities recently have proposed measures to
address this problem by requiring OTC dealers to post binding bid and ask quotes to the market.

•

Funding risk at banks is often highly correlated with that in other financial markets. The U.S. financial
crisis has highlighted the strong linkage between the funding risk of money center banks and rollover risk in
the broader financial system. In particular, problems in the asset-backed commercial paper and auction rate
securities markets led to banks absorbing huge sums of these assets on their balance sheets, leading to
demand for additional funding and capital. The global credit crunch hit Korean banks through their foreign
currency borrowing activities, and in November-December 2007 they reverted to using foreign exchange
swaps to obtain U.S. dollar credit. In the home market, Korean banks, with high loan-to-deposit ratios,
depend heavily on their ability to rollover CDs and intermediate term notes in a money market that is
comprised largely of asset management companies.

•

Over 80 percent of U.S. subprime mortgages were adjustable rate (ARMs), and an even
greater percentage of payment problems have come from ARMs. Korea similarly relies heavily on ARMs
although policy efforts are slowly increasing the use of fixed rate mortgages.

24
understandable, staff suggested that there may be less risky approaches, including issuing
equity more broadly and bringing in foreign and institutional investors, including a suitably
reformed pension fund.
26.
With a rapid rise in assets and plans for more active investment, reform of the
governance structure of the National Pension Fund (NPF) is increasingly important.
NPF assets will rise to about 50 percent of GDP by 2030 and there are plans to allocate a
larger share to equity and foreign assets. Staff welcomed the government’s plans to reform
the fund’s governance structure, with greater accountability and independence of the
governing board and increased reliance on private expert management. Staff urged that these
reforms be complemented by simple and transparent investment objectives, focused on
maximizing risk-adjusted returns. Staff also encouraged the authorities to consider moving
away from strict portfolio restrictions, to enable optimal diversification. These changes
would bring the governance structure of the NPF even closer to best international practice
while helping to raise investment returns and enhance its role as an institutional investor in
the Korean economy.
D. Revisiting Key Structural Challenges: Raising Potential Growth
The new government’s economic agenda targets potential growth of 7 percent over the
medium-term. Many policies—including plans to improve the investment climate through
labor reform and deregulation, and to privatize public enterprises—are in line with past
Fund advice. However, plans for reducing tax rates and increasing incentives should be in
the context of a broader tax reform plan that addresses long-run fiscal pressures.
Background
27.
In the absence of reforms, Korea’s potential growth is projected to decline
steadily over the long term, from around 4½ percent to 2½ percent by 2030 (Table 6).
However, implementing structural reforms, particularly to boost service sector productivity,
develop the financial sector and raise labor force participation, would boost long-run
potential growth.
28.
The new government aims to raise potential growth through a number of
pro-business reforms. A centerpiece of the strategy is promoting investment through:
regulatory reforms, starting with a comprehensive review of existing business regulations;
simplifying tax laws; lowering the corporate tax rate to 10−20 percent (from 13−25 percent)
and doubling the low-tax threshold; and easing geographic investment restrictions around the
Seoul metropolitan area. In addition, the government aims to enhance labor market flexibility
through stricter implementation of labor laws and the promotion of a performance (rather
than seniority)-based wage system.

25
Discussions
29.
Staff welcomed the government’s focus on raising potential growth. Staff
underlined the importance of addressing the lagging productivity in the services sector and in
SMEs, which will need to be key growth drivers in the future.

challenges, staff stressed that any tax rate
cuts should be part of comprehensive, and at least revenue-neutral, package, including a
reduction in tax incentives. While the authorities argued that a lower overall tax burden could
be offset over the medium term by efficiency gains and cutting waste on the spending side,
staff cautioned against relying exclusively on such a strategy given the modest size of
Korea’s government and the scale of expected aging-related fiscal pressures.15 More
generally, staff suggested that a concrete policy for dealing with the long-run fiscal pressures
associated with aging needs to be articulated, perhaps in the form of a regular Long Term
Fiscal Report.
`

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Korea’s economy is facing challenging global circumstances. While exports have
shown resilience, the global slowdown will likely limit further gains and constrain
investment during the rest of the year. High global food and fuel prices are expected to weigh
on consumption and are contributing to rapidly rising prices. As a result, growth is expected
to moderate to 4.1 percent this year, before picking up in 2009, while weaker domestic
demand and stabilizing commodity prices should help slow inflation early next year. This
outlook is subject to substantial uncertainty, with the possibility remaining of a deeper global
slowdown, further volatility in global financial conditions, or still higher oil prices.
32.
In this context, macroeconomic policies should focus for now on controlling
inflation. In particular, ensuring that inflation expectations remain well-anchored is critical
for sustained strong economic growth and may require an increase in policy rates. Should

Box 4. How Can Investment be Promoted in Korea?1
Like elsewhere in the region, Korea has witnessed a
sizeable decline in investment since the Asian crisis.
Comparing the period 2000−07 to 1990−97, aggregate
investment has declined by 7½ percentage points. These
broad trends have been mirrored in much of emerging
Asia.

Current investment levels in Korea are close to their
long-term average, but small firms have tended to lag
behind. While larger firms have tended to recover strongly
since the crisis, investment by smaller firms has lagged,
largely reflecting weaker fundamentals, notably lower
profitability and liquidity.

The determinants of investment in Korea have changed
over time. It is difficult to find any significant association
between investment and a range of fundamentals in the
pre-crisis period, which suggests that firms may have been
guilty of “irrational exuberance.” In the post-crisis period,
however, investment has been positively related to profit
expectations and the availability of financing and
negatively associated with short-term gearing ratios and
uncertainty. While corporate taxes tend to reduce
investment, the impact is small relative to other factors.
There is also evidence of heterogeneity, with small and
domestically-oriented firms more sensitive to profitability
and facing greater financing constraints, large firms more
affected by uncertainty, and sluggishness in service sector
investment mainly reflecting weaker fundamentals.

The results suggest that a return to pre-crisis highs is unlikely to be sustainable, and that a strategy for
promoting investment in Korea should focus on small firms. Measures most likely to be effective include:
developing capital markets to provide more market-based financing and venture capital; promoting restructuring by
SMEs, including by reducing credit guarantees; lowering uncertainty, including about policies related to the operating
environment faced by firms; and improving the business climate, notably through deregulation and labor market
flexibility. While reducing tax rates could also help, the impact is likely to be smaller, especially since effective tax
rates in Korea are not particularly high by OECD standards.

inflation begin to moderate and the economy remain soft in coming quarters, there may be
scope for more accommodative policies. There could be room for modest fiscal stimulus in
the 2009 budget, in particular to protect the most vulnerable should commodity prices rise
further, but measures taken should be targeted, well-timed, and reversible. Korea’s flexible
exchange rate regime, with intervention limited to smoothing excessive volatility, has served
the country well in the past and continues to be appropriate. In this context, utilizing
intervention as a tool to combat inflation should be avoided; the inflation targeting
framework remains the most appropriate policy tool to achieve this objective.
33.
While the Korean financial system remains sound, the ongoing global financial
turmoil has raised some concerns. International credit market stresses have underlined that
banks reliant on wholesale funding may be exposed to greater liquidity risk. Supervisors are
focused on limiting such risks, but international experience suggests that enhanced
stress-testing and contingency planning would also help. Short-term external debt has risen
sharply in recent years, as a counterpart to hedging activity, and more recently, with foreign
purchases of sovereign bonds. This debt should be closely monitored, but its sources and uses
are very different from those a decade ago, and risks remain moderate. Overall bank loan
quality is strong but an economic slowdown could reveal some vulnerabilities, particularly in
SME lending, which merits continued close attention. These risks point to the importance of
banks continuing to strengthen risk management, including under their transition to Basel II.
34.
Looking ahead, structural changes to the financial sector will present both
challenges and opportunities. Increased financial sector competition, in light of the CMCA
taking effect in 2009, should contribute to growth, but will require financial regulators to
meet new challenges, including risks from more complex institutions and products. It will be
critical to ensure that enhanced regulatory and supervision capacity precedes market growth
and rapid innovation, and that financial supervision remains independent. The government’s
push to privatize remaining public sector banks is welcome but plans to ease restrictions on
nonfinancial corporate ownership of banks should proceed in step with further improvements
in corporate governance.
35.
The government aims to address structural challenges to Korea’s impressive
growth record, including through deregulation, privatization, and tax cuts. While these
plans are mostly welcome, proposals for reducing any tax rates should be in the context of a
broader plan to concretely address long-run fiscal pressures, notably those associated with
Korea’s rapidly aging population.
36.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Korea’s exchange rate system is classified as “independently floating.” Previously, the exchange
rate against the U.S. dollar was allowed to float only within specified margins around the previous
day’s weighted average exchange rate in the interbank market. The margins were widened five
times between March 1990 and November 1997 (most recently to +/-10 percent), and on
December 16, 1997 were eliminated altogether. On August 7, 2008, the exchange rate was
W 1016.5=US$1. Korea maintains exchange restrictions for security reasons, in accordance with
UN Security Council Resolutions, which have been notified to the Fund under the procedures set
forth in Executive Board Decision 144-(52/51).
VIII.

Last Article IV Consultation:

Korea is on a 12-month consultation cycle. Staff discussions for the 2007 Article IV consultation
were conducted on a mission to Seoul during May 31-June 13, 2007. The Article IV consultation
was concluded by the Executive Board on September 12, 2007. In addition, a staff visit took place
during November 1–8, 2007.

IX.

FSAP and ROSC Participation:

MCM: The final FSAP mission was conducted during October 2002. The mission completed the
FSAP by assessing the short-term vulnerability of the financial sector to macroeconomic and
sectoral shocks and analyzing overall financial sector soundness and developmental challenges,
including issues arising from the draft standards assessments. A follow-up technical assistance
mission on the supervision of derivatives markets was held in Seoul during January 9–20, 2003. The
Financial System Stability Assessment report has been published (country report No. 03/81) and is
available on the web through the following link: http://www.imf.org/external/np/fsap/fsap.asp.
FAD: Discussions on fiscal transparency were held in Seoul during June 2000, and a report was
drafted and finalized in November 2000, with input from APD staff. The report has been published
and is available on the web through the following link:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/rosc/kor/fiscal.htm.
STA: Discussions on Korea’s data dissemination practices against the IMF’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) were held in Seoul during April 2001, and a report was drafted and
finalized on November 28, 2001. The report has been published and is available on the web through
the link: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2003/cr03127.pdf.
X.

Technical Assistance:

FAD: A technical assistance mission visited Seoul during January 8–19, 2001 to evaluate current
practices in budgeting and public expenditure management and to provide advice on setting up a
medium-term fiscal framework. A mission visited Seoul during August 31–September 16, 2005 to
provide technical assistance on the reform of tax policy and administration.
MCM: Technical assistance missions visited Seoul to provide advice on macroprudential and
derivatives supervision during October 27-November 7, 2005, on the reform and development of
the foreign exchange market during March 30-April 13, 2006, on strengthening the debt
management function and further development of the government securities market during
September 20-October 2, 2006, and on measures to deepen the money market during
December 4-14, 2007.
STA: Technical assistance missions visited Seoul during March 29–April 12, 2000 to provide
advice on balance of payments and external debt statistics, with a view toward improving the
recording of financial derivatives and developing an international investment position statement,
and during November 28-December 11, 2007 on the GFSM 2001 framework.
XI.

Resident Representative:

The resident representative office in Seoul was opened in March 1998 and will be closed in
September 2008. Ms. Meral Karasulu has been the Resident Representative since September 2006.

4
Annex II: Korea—Statistical Issues
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Korea has been a subscriber to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since September 1996. During 2007−08, most SDDS
requirements were met. Korea makes use of the timeliness flexibility option for two data
categories: the analytical accounts of the banking sector and public sector operations. Recently,
central government operations data have been disseminated with delays due to temporary
technical capacity constraints. A data ROSC was published in May 2003.
Real Sector Statistics
The overall structure of the national accounts follows the recommendations of the 1993 System
of National Accounts. Constant price (base year 2000) and nominal GDP estimates are compiled
using the production and expenditure approaches; nominal GDP estimates are also compiled
using the income approach. While the size of the informal sector has not been measured,
informal activities (including some illicit activities) are expected to be reflected in the next
revision of the national accounts. The commodity flow technique could be improved by moving
to the Supply and Use Table framework, but there have been difficulties in developing requisite
source data.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) covers 38 urban areas (about 80 percent of the urban
population) and is defined to exclude farm and fishing households. The CPI could be further
improved by extending coverage to rural areas. The consumption basket is updated every five
years; currently, expenditure weights are derived from the 2005 Family Income and Expenditure
Survey. The geometric mean of price changes should be used as a suitable alternative to the ratio
of arithmetic means of prices.
The Producer Price Index (PPI) covers all domestic industrial activities and a large segment of
service activity, as well as free trade zones and bonded warehouses. The weights are based
on 2005 revenue shares. The PPI could be improved by making more use of imputing missing
prices using the prices of similar commodities, rather than carrying forward the last reported
price. A geometric mean of price relatives should be used rather than an arithmetic mean.
Government Finance Statistics
Two sets of government finance statistics (GFS) are compiled for the central government, one
using national definitions and the other using internationally recognized standards. Concepts
and definitions used in the latter generally follow the recommendations of the Manual on
Government Finance Statistics 1986. The data cover the budgetary units of the central
government and certain extra-budgetary funds owned or managed by budgetary units. These
statistics are produced by the Digital Budget and Accounting System (D-Brain), which
integrates the preparation of budget data, accounting reports, and the generation of fiscal
statistics on a monthly basis. The D-Brain provides for automatic crosschecks at different levels
of the compilation process.

5
Consolidated GFS data on the general government are not provided to the IMF for publication
in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) or the International Financial Statistics
(IFS), while the last year for which GFS for the consolidated central government were reported
for publication in the GFSY and the IFS is 2005. Certain fiscal data for general government is
reported on national websites.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Following the recommendations of the 2001 data ROSC mission, revised monetary aggregates
have been compiled since early 2002. These aggregates almost fully comply with the IMF’s
Monetary and Financial Statistical Manual. Data relating to foreign assets and foreign liabilities
are affected by the Bank of Korea’s (BOK) practice of valuing its financial assets and liabilities
at book value (rather than at market value) and revaluing its foreign currency denominated
assets and liabilities twice yearly (rather than on a monthly basis). Also, some banks are using
nationality rather than the residency criteria (as defined in the Balance of Payments Manual,
fifth edition) to distinguish between resident and nonresident individual and household
accounts, affecting the accurate measurement of net foreign assets of the banking sector. The
authorities have begun reporting monetary data to STA using Standardized Report Forms, but
the data show discrepancies from those reported using the old forms. The authorities have been
informed of the problem, and resolution is pending.
Korea participated in the pilot project—Coordinated Compilation Exercise—for Financial
Soundness Indicators (FSIs) conducted by the IMF’s Statistics Department. Indicators as of end2005 were submitted along with metadata, which are now available to the public through the
IMF’s website at:
http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/fsi/fsicountrycategorylist/?strcode=KOR.
External Sector Statistics
The overall quality of quarterly balance of payments statistics is good. The BOK implemented
the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) in early 1998, but some
deviations remain in the classification and sectorization of certain transactions. There is also
incomplete coverage of transactions via intercompany accounts and non-cash transactions. Data
on reinvested earnings on direct investment are not compiled, except for the net profits/losses of
overseas branches of domestic banks. In the financial account, the direct investment data do not
include trade credits or short-term loans with affiliated entities, which are recorded as part of
other investment.
The quality of the quarterly external debt statistics has greatly improved since the financial
crisis. In early 2007, the BOK switched from annual to quarterly reporting of the International
Investment Position. Data dissemination on international reserves and foreign currency
liquidity generally meets the SDDS specifications. Since April 2006, the authorities have
disseminated foreign reserves data on a monthly basis rather than twice a month, as had been
done since 1997.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Asia and Pacific Department
September 5, 2008

1.
This supplement to the staff report summarizes the main developments since the staff
report was issued on August 11, 2008. Staff projections and the thrust of the staff appraisal
remain unchanged.
2.
Recent data releases indicate that, as expected, growth is slowing while inflationary
pressures remain elevated.
•

In line with staff projections and preliminary estimates, second quarter GDP data
suggest that the economy expanded by 0.8 percent (q/q seasonally adjusted), the same
rate as the previous quarter. Domestic demand weakness continued but net exports
remained robust.

•

Exports have continued to perform well, rising by 33 percent (y/y) in July, on resilient
demand from emerging markets. However, the current account swung back into a
sizeable deficit of about $2½ billion in July, with an oil-price-related surge in imports
(46 percent, y/y) and increased spending on overseas travel. The financial account
deficit rose to $5½ billion from $4 billion in June, reflecting continued large net
equity outflows. Preliminary August trade data indicate that, despite some slowing,
both import and export growth remained robust. Reserves fell by around $4 billion in
August, pointing to a slowdown in intervention.

•

Indicators of domestic demand point to a continued moderation of growth, consistent
with staff projections. Business confidence stabilized in August, albeit at low levels,
while consumer confidence fell further in July, to a near eight-year low. On a
sequential basis (m/m seasonally adjusted), industrial output declined by 0.2 percent
in July, but real retail sales growth rebounded to 5.1 percent after two months of
contraction and service sector output picked up by 1.8 percent after remaining flat
during May-June. Employment growth also picked up in July to 0.16 percent, the
fastest pace since January, but remains relatively sluggish.

2
•

Headline inflation fell slightly to 5.6 percent (y/y) in August from a decade-high of
5.9 percent in July, helped by the decline in global oil prices, but remained above the
Bank of Korea’s (BOK) target range for the tenth consecutive month. However, there
is increasing evidence of second-round effects, with core inflation edging up from
4.6 percent to 4.7 percent.

3.
The won has weakened further since August 11, falling by around 8¼ percent against
the dollar to a near-five year low and around 6¾ percent in nominal effective terms. In the
last two sessions, the won has recovered by 2⅔ percent against the dollar. Two of the three
CGER approaches—the macro balance and external sustainability approach—continue to
show the won as appropriately valued. However, the average of the three approaches yields
an undervaluation of around 7 percent. The Korean stock market has declined to a 17-month
low, down nearly 26 percent for the year, broadly in line with other Asian emerging markets.
Foreign investors have continued their sell-off, albeit at a slower pace, with their net selling
falling to $3 billion in August from $5 billion in July. In staff’s view, underlying
macroeconomic and financial vulnerabilities remain as assessed in the Staff Report.
4.
The BOK tightened monetary policy in August. After a one-year pause, the BOK
raised its policy rate by 25 bps, to 5¼ percent, citing continued concern about liquidity
growth and the need to anchor inflation expectations. This year’s fiscal stimulus package and
corporate tax reform legislation are still pending approval in parliament.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Korea
On September 8, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Korea. 1
Background
Difficult global conditions have made this a challenging year for Korea. First, against the
backdrop of a global slowdown, economic activity in Korea is moderating. Second,
surging global commodity prices and a weakening of the won are contributing to rising
domestic inflation. Finally, while the Korean financial system remains in good health,
increased global volatility has raised near-term risks, and ongoing structural changes to
the financial sector present opportunities but also challenges to financial oversight.
After reaching 5 percent in 2007, growth is expected to moderate to 4.1 percent this
year, before recovering to 4.3 percent in 2009. Headline inflation reached 5.6 percent in
August, exceeding the Bank of Korea’s target of 2½−3½ percent for a tenth consecutive
month. However, slowing domestic demand and moderating food and fuel price inflation
should help bring headline inflation down early next year. Reflecting a sharp
deterioration in Korea’s terms of trade, a current account deficit of 1¼ percent of GDP is
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

expected this year, declining to about 1 percent in 2009. This outlook is subject to
substantial uncertainty, with the possibility remaining of a deeper global slowdown,
further volatility in global financial conditions, or still higher oil prices.
After a one-year pause, monetary policy was tightened in August, with the Bank of
Korea raising its policy rate by 25 basis points to 5¼ percent, citing concerns about
liquidity growth and the need to anchor inflation expectations. This year’s fiscal stance
provides an expansionary impulse of about 1½ percent of GDP, including about 1
percent of GDP in measures adopted after the budget, to address higher fuel prices.
Despite the recent sharp depreciation, the exchange rate remains broadly in line with
fundamentals. Intervention has been stepped up since June to smooth volatility and
support the won.
The direct impact of the global financial crisis has been small, owing to limited exposure
to subprime assets, but Korea has not escaped the turmoil unscathed: stock prices have
declined; volatility has increased; and spreads on external debt have widened. Some
concerns have also arisen regarding the financial sector. In particular, the heavy
reliance of Korean banks on wholesale financing, has led supervisors to focus efforts on
containing liquidity risk. In addition, while overall bank loan quality is strong, an
economic slowdown could reveal some vulnerabilities, particularly in small- and
medium-sized enterprise (SME) lending. Short-term external debt has risen sharply in
recent years, as a counterpart to hedging activity, and more recently, with foreign
purchases of sovereign bonds. This debt should be monitored, but its sources and uses
are very different from those a decade ago, and risks remain moderate.
Looking ahead, structural changes to the financial sector will present both challenges
and opportunities. Increased financial sector competition, in light of the Capital Market
Consolidation Act taking effect in 2009, should contribute to growth, but will also require
enhanced financial oversight to meet new regulatory challenges, including from more
complex institutions and products. Korea also faces longer-term challenges to its
impressive record of economic growth from population aging, the erosion of its lowskilled manufacturing base and lagging service sector productivity. The government
aims to address these with a wide-ranging set of reforms, including through
deregulation, privatization, and tax cuts.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their continued skillful economic
management, which has contributed to the resilience of the Korean economy in the face
of challenging global circumstances. Korea’s growth momentum has been supported by
strong exports. The overall health of the financial sector and limited direct subprime
exposures have contained the direct impact of the global financial turbulence.
Nevertheless, growth has softened, equity prices and the won have weakened, and high
oil prices have contributed to higher inflation. While baseline projections point to only a

3
modest slowing of growth and a return of inflation to the Bank of Korea’s target band
during 2009, risks are skewed to the downside.
Directors supported the authorities’ macroeconomic policy mix for addressing the
difficult challenges facing Korea, in particular the priority being given to controlling
inflation. Noting the recent indications of second round effects of commodity price
increases, they emphasized that keeping expectations well-anchored is crucial to avoid
more forceful, and more damaging, tightening later. Directors therefore welcomed the
August policy rate hike. Going forward, some Directors suggested that the balance of
risks may call for further tightening, while some others saw merit in proceeding
cautiously. Directors also highlighted the importance of effective communication
regarding monetary policy and inflation developments in keeping inflation expectations
well-anchored. They noted that a more accommodative monetary policy could be
envisaged if inflation eases and growth remains soft.
Directors agreed that the won remains broadly appropriately valued, despite the recent
depreciation. They considered that Korea’s flexible exchange rate regime continues to
be appropriate, and generally supported the view that foreign exchange intervention
should remain limited to smoothing excessive volatility. Directors stressed that Korea’s
inflation targeting framework remains the most effective policy tool for addressing
inflation. At the same time, some Directors suggested that exchange rate management
could also have a role in containing inflation.
Directors saw the slightly expansionary fiscal stance in 2008 as broadly appropriate.
They underscored, however, that the scope for further fiscal stimulus is limited given the
inflation pressures and the medium-term fiscal challenges facing Korea. Any further
transfers to protect the vulnerable against high oil prices should be temporary, timely,
and well targeted.
Directors noted that Korea’s financial system remains healthy, although the ongoing
financial turbulence has raised vulnerabilities. Global credit market stresses have
highlighted that banks reliant on wholesale funding are subject to elevated liquidity risk.
In that context, Directors agreed that the strengthening of liquidity risk management by
banks and regulators in line with emerging best practices is a priority. Short-term
external debt has increased in recent years and warrants close monitoring, although
risks remain moderate. While loan quality is strong, Directors encouraged continued
upgrading of banks’ risk assessment, in line with the introduction of Basel II, noting that
this would help address potential risks from lending exposures to SMEs and the real
estate and construction sectors during a downturn.
Directors welcomed the Capital Market Consolidation Act, taking effect early next year,
as an important step to develop Korea’s financial sector and support long-term growth
by increasing competition and the scope for innovation. They agreed that enhanced
financial oversight will be needed to meet new regulatory challenges, including those

4
associated with more complex financial institutions and products. Directors therefore
welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen risk monitoring and enhance regulatory
and supervisory capacity ahead of domestic market growth and innovation. Directors
also welcomed the authorities’ intention to privatize remaining state-owned banks, while
emphasizing that any loosening of constraints on bank ownership by nonfinancial
corporates should not threaten hard-won progress on corporate governance.
Directors commended the authorities’ reform efforts to address long-term challenges to
Korea’s impressive growth record. They supported the plans to boost investment and
growth through privatization and deregulation. Directors encouraged the authorities to
meet head-on the longer-term implications of an aging society. They underscored, in
this context, that proposals for reducing taxes should be part of a broader reform plan to
address longer-run fiscal challenges.

Statement by Richard Murray, Executive Director for Korea
and Jong-Won Yoon, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
September 8, 2008
My authorities greatly appreciate the productive policy dialogue during the Article IV
consultation, and thank staff for their high-quality papers. Issues covered in the staff papers
reflect pertinent risks and challenges that the Korean economy is facing, and there has been a
broad consensus between the authorities and staff on most aspects of the staff assessments.
My authorities will give due consideration to the staff recommendations on macroeconomic
policies and structural reforms.
Challenges and New Administration’s Focus
The Korean economy is facing both cyclical and structural challenges. The worsening of the
external environment, including the ongoing financial turmoil, global slowdown, and higher
oil prices, have cast clouds on both the growth and inflation outlook. In particular, the
continued terms-of-trade deterioration during the current decade has caused real income to
grow much slower than output growth, worsening consumer and business sentiment. On the
structural front, intensified competition is incessantly demanding restructuring of SMEs at a
faster pace than they can absorb smoothly. In addition, the rapid ageing of the society will
not only reduce growth potential through lower factor inputs, but also cast an increasing
burden on long-term fiscal sustainability. While the authorities have striven to meet these
challenges, which are not new in nature, these are still ongoing, calling for constant efforts
for further structural adjustment.
Against this backdrop, and despite socio-political headwinds caused by protests against
restarting U.S. beef importation due to food safety concerns and insufficient consensusbuilding, the Lee Myung-Bak Administration, installed in late February this year, is
strengthening efforts to reinvigorate the reform momentum. With efforts to build greater
public consensus, the new administration has embarked on major reform measures. The
policy initiatives include fostering a business-friendly environment through deregulation and
privatization, strengthening structural adjustment of the economy, and securing
macroeconomic stability with priority on containing inflation. While these efforts will require
painful adjustment and might not be popular in the initial phase, the authorities are confident
of the fruits that will be borne over time through these reforms, to which they are fully
committed.
Macroeconomic Outlook
The near-term prospects are not favorable, given the adverse external conditions. After
achieving 5 percent growth in 2007, slightly higher than potential, the economy is
experiencing a downturn with risks tilted to the downside. Employment increases in the first
half of 2008 have significantly slowed to 191,000, compared to 277,000 in the same period

2
last year. While continued strong exports (20.4 percent, y.o.y., for the first half year), aided
by rapid increases to non-traditional markets, contributed to the first half year GDP growth
performance at 5.3 percent, weakening domestic demand is dragging down growth. The
authorities project this year’s growth to slow to mid 4 percent level, slightly higher than the
staff estimate. However, they are cognizant that the economy is running at a slower pace
since the second quarter, and stay alert to the possibility that the economic downturn would
continue for more than a year, depending on future developments in the external environment.
Like most countries, higher food and fuel prices pushed up CPI inflation well above the
target range (2.5-3.5 percent) from 2.5 percent last year to 5.6 percent in August (4.7 percent
in terms of core inflation). Given declining output growth and slack in the labor market,1 the
authorities expect CPI inflation to return to within the target range next year if oil prices
stabilize. Nevertheless, they are closely watching inflation developments so that the current
cost push inflation is not entrenched into higher inflation expectation. Higher oil prices are
also likely to keep the external current account in deficit. Considering the improvement in the
service account deficit due to a weaker won and lower income growth, the authorities expect
that the current account deficit in 2008 would remain at about 1 percent of GDP, with further
improvements in coming years.
While the Korean financial market has remained resilient, the global financial turmoil and the
negative terms-of-trade shock have increased volatility in the financial market. The stock
market indices declined 22.3 percent as of end-August this year, and spreads on external debt
have increased. Partly reflecting the impact of the oil price shock, to which the Korean
economy is considered particularly vulnerable, the won/US dollar exchange rate has
depreciated sharply by 16.3 percent as of end-August this year, considerably more than other
currencies. Given renewed risks and concerns in the financial sector and the impact of the
adverse external environment on the Korean economy, the authorities are closely monitoring
financial and foreign exchange market developments so as to preserve market stability.
Macroeconomic Policy Responses
Prospects of declining output and job growth, rising inflation, and heightened financial
market risks have posed a difficult policy dilemma, and there is not much room to maneuver.
Under trade-offs among growth, inflation, and financial market stability, the authorities are
striving to maintain a delicate balance among these objectives with greater emphasis on
containing inflation. The authorities’ policy mix includes tackling inflationary pressures
mainly through monetary policy; providing a modest fiscal impulse with the spending focus
on protecting the vulnerable, and keeping exchange rate flexibility, while minimizing
financial sector vulnerabilities through strengthening financial oversight.
1

In addition to the significant decline in employment growth, there is little sign yet for a wage-inflation spiral.
Despite higher inflation, negotiated wage increases remained at 5.1 percent for the first half, compared to
4.8 percent for the same period last year, which is broadly in line with the recent trend.

3
Considering the declining output growth, the cost-push nature of current inflation, and
concerns about the impact of an interest rate hike on the household and SME sector balance
sheets, monetary policy has remained in cautious mood until recently, with the policy rate
left unchanged. With consumer price inflation continuing to exceed the target range since
November 2007, however, the Monetary Policy Committee raised the policy rate by 25 basis
points to 5.25 percent in August in order to contain inflation expectations which have
gathered strength influenced by the recent sharp rise in headline inflation. The monetary
authorities will carefully review the need for a further move, considering inflation, economic
activity, and the financial market conditions. We found useful the staff’s analysis on stress
testing household debt for interest rate rises (Chapter II of selected issues). However, we note
the need to consider other channels that could affect household balance sheets, including
through asset markets. Staff’s emphasis on the importance of clear communication with the
public on the consistency of price developments within the IT framework is well taken.
The foreign exchange market situation has changed drastically since early this year.
Contrary to the continued appreciation pressures that dominated the market for several years,
the won has weakened significantly this year, reflecting the impact of higher oil prices as
well as net equity selling by foreign investors in the midst of the global financial strain.
Market participants, who used to be bullish on the Korean won, have moved in the other
direction with the expectation of further won depreciation. Despite the market whims and the
relatively high pass-through of exchange rate changes to inflation, the authorities have
maintained the floating regime, which has served the country well, while limiting
intervention only to temporary smoothing operations.
On the role of the exchange rate in controlling inflation, we agree with staff that there is little
room for the exchange rate to play, and inflation should be tackled through monetary policy.
This would be particularly the case for Korea, given the past experience in the mid 1990s
when inflation consideration had led to an overvalued won and reserve depletion.
Nevertheless, we interestingly note a recent IMF occasional paper which suggested that the
bigger role for the exchange rate in inflation targeting for emerging market countries reflects
a number of factors, such as higher exchange rate volatility, a high pass-through from
exchange rate changes to inflation, and less developed financial markets.2
Fiscal policy this year will be slightly expansionary, relative to the contractionary stance in
2007. The 2008 budget envisages the overall deficit, excluding social security funds, at
around 1 percent of GDP. However, the authorities have announced plans to provide
temporary support to protect the vulnerable from higher oil prices. Part of the greater-thanexpected revenue gains attained last year will be utilized to finance this additional spending.
On the revenue front, the broadened revenue base and improved tax administration resulted

Countries?”, Mark Stone and others, June 2008.

4
in unexpected revenue gains in 2007 of more than 2 percent of GDP, a large portion of which
is expected to continue in the future. Given the unexpectedly heightened revenue burden
from 24.7 percent in 2006 to 27 percent of GDP last year, the authorities now have some
room for lowering overall the tax burden in line with the policy initiative to protect the
vulnerable and to foster a business-friendly environment. In this regard, the authorities
recently announced a plan to lower the tax burden, including the phase-down of corporate
income tax from 25 to 20 percent and the lowering of personal income tax by 2 percentage
points by 2010. Cautious of the looming longer-term fiscal challenges, however, the
authorities will continue to keep long-standing fiscal prudence by maintaining a broadly
balanced fiscal position over the medium-term, including through implementing further
expenditure consolidation in tandem with the tax cuts.
Financial Sector Risk and Reform
We welcome the greater coverage of financial sector issues in the staff papers, which is
particularly relevant and useful at this current juncture. While the Korean financial sector has
remained healthy, the authorities are cognizant that the current global financial turmoil and
the economic downturn could easily raise risks and vulnerabilities in the financial market. In
this regard, the authorities have been vigilant in monitoring risk factors based on an early
warning system and strengthened regulatory and supervisory oversight over financial
institutions and markets.
On banks’ increased reliance on wholesale funding and the related liquidity risk, we
appreciate staff’s analysis (Chapter III in selected issues) which examined the global banking
sector trend, the implications for the Korean banking sector, and the policy recommendations
relevant for Korea. To address the heightened liquidity risk, the authorities have been closely
monitoring banks’ liquidity indicators, strengthening regulation on banks’ liquidity risk
management, implementing money market reform, as well as encouraging banks to diversify
funding and income sources, such as expansion of fee-based businesses. Further efforts will
be made in line with the staff recommendations, which include strengthening of stress testing
and its integration into contingency planning; introduction of international best practice on
liquidity risk management; and completion of the money market reform agenda.
External short-term debt has rapidly increased by more than US$60 billion since end-2006,
which has drawn continued attention from the authorities. As staff noted, a majority of these
flows is driven by hedging-related demand and, recently, there are some signs of moderation
of this trend. Nevertheless, the authorities will continue to monitor market developments,
given the potential destabilizing impact of reversals of short-term capital flows.
Significant progress has been made in advancing the financial sector, including the
implementation of the Capital Markets Consolidation Act (CMCA) and plans to privatize
public banks. By consolidating the Securities and Exchange Act, Futures Trading Act, and
other capital market-related laws, the CMCA will unleash financial innovation and

5
competition through deregulation, providing unprecedented impetus for structurally changing
the future financial landscape. Given the CMCA’s potential impact on financial market
stability, the authorities have stepped up preparations for its smooth implementation. The
preparations include the recent inter-government committee’s review on improving
operational regulations for financial institutions; improving financial consumer protection;
and enhancing regulatory and supervisory capacity. The new administration’s initiative to
reduce the role of public banks will provide additional momentum for financial sector
development.
Structural Reform
As indicated above, the new administration has strengthened policy efforts to enhance
growth potential by promoting investment and raising total factor productivity. The policy
priorities include deregulation through greatly relaxing cumbersome business regulations;
simplifying laws and regulations; lowering the tax burden while keeping long-term fiscal
sustainability; enhancing the competitiveness of the service sector; supporting SME
restructuring; and enhancing labor market flexibility.
In this regard, we welcome staff’s analysis on the determinants of investment in Korea
(Chapter V in selected issues). The staff’s stress on the need to focus on SMEs and service
industry in boosting investment is consistent with the government’ Service-PROGRESS
Initiative, designed to improve competitiveness of the service industry, such as tourism,
medical service, and knowledge-based services.
