KIRIBATI
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 18, 2011

KEY ISSUES:
Context and growth prospects. The economy has emerged from the 2008–09 recession with strong
forward momentum. Key externally financed infrastructure projects are expected to spur growth
over the next few years. The main challenge is to manage the investment boom that is underway
without creating inflationary pressures. Downside risks are mainly external and relate to higher
inflation pressures from a further escalation of international fuel and food prices and a stalled global
recovery that would hit Kiribati’s remittances and wealth funds. These are balanced by the potentially
faster rebound in domestic demand driven by large public investments in the pipeline.
Impact of food and fuel prices. Further increases would pose a challenge for Kiribati, but there are
some mitigating factors compared to the 2008 spike. The price of rice (the main food import) is still
well below the 2008 peak. The strong appreciation of the Australian dollar has helped mitigate
imported inflation pressures.
Achieving a sustainable growth path. Productivity gains from infrastructure investments will prove
transitory if progress in fiscal and structural reforms lags behind. On the fiscal side, preserving the
Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) is key to ensure fiscal sustainability and intergenerational
fairness through fiscal consolidation once key public projects in the pipeline are completed. Over the
medium term, to better anchor fiscal plans, the government should aim to stabilize the real value of
the RERF in per capita terms. To shift to a high growth path hinging on a vibrant private sector, the
implementation of the structural reform agenda should be accelerated.
Safeguarding financial stability. Enhancing competition in the banking sector is crucial to boost
private activity. The authorities’ plans to revitalize the Development Bank of Kiribati (DBK) in the
medium term are welcome.
Enhancing external competitiveness and stability. Securing grant financing and containing fiscal
deficits are key to ensure external debt sustainability, as the joint IMF-WB Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA) points out.
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Significant
progress has been made in the timeliness of core macroeconomic data since the 2009 Article IV. GDP
and BOP data have been recently revised with Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC)
assistance, but still suffer from shortcomings. The authorities have requested additional technical
assistance in these areas.

KIRIBATI 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

INTRODUCTION
1.
Kiribati is a small Pacific island
economy reliant on foreign aid and
vulnerable to external shocks, particularly
climate change. The export and production
bases are narrow and limited to copra,
seaweed and fishing. The country relies
heavily on foreign aid to finance its structural
trade deficit. Tourism accounts for less than
2 percent of GDP due to Kiribati’s remoteness
and poor infrastructure. Given its high import
dependence, the economy is vulnerable to
swings in commodity prices. The public sector
dominates the economy, but private sector
activity has picked up lately. Fishing license
fees and remittances provide key sources of
income as does Kiribati’s wealth fund (derived
from phosphate deposits that were exhausted
in 1979). The increasing costs of climate
change and still large development needs also
raise important policy challenges.
2.
Against this background, the 2011
Article IV discussions tackled both short-

term and longer-term questions. Discussions
focused on policies to support sustainable
growth and priorities for structural reforms.
In the near term, the main challenge is to
manage the investment boom that is
underway without creating inflationary
pressures. In the medium-term, economic
prospects
are
contingent
on
the
implementation of a critical mass of structural
reforms. Lifting productivity growth and living
standards depend on the scope and speed of
the
government’s
own
economic
transformation program. The global crisis has
led to a rethinking of Kiribati’s development
strategy, with the private sector playing a
more vibrant role. The emerging view is that
the country is now at a crossroads.
3.
Political background. The current
government
was
elected
in
2007.
Parliamentary elections are scheduled for
August 2011. The presidential election is to be
held in October 2011.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A.

From Crisis to Recovery

4.
The impact of the global crisis was
stronger than anticipated at the time of the
2009 Article IV consultation. Kiribati has been
affected by a fall in remittances and large
declines in the value of its wealth and pension
funds—the Revenue Equalization Reserve
Fund (RERF) and the Kiribati Provident Fund.
The spike in food and fuel prices in 2008 has
already taken a toll on economic activity.
Vulnerabilities to climate change, including
coastline erosion, have also worsened, with
recurring disruptions at two transportation
lifelines (the main road in Tarawa and its
airport). As a result, full achievement of the
MDGs goals by 2015 is likely now out of reach
(Table 1 and Box 1).
5.
After two years of contraction, the
economy recovered in the second half of

2010. It is estimated to have grown by
1¾ percent for the year (Table 2). Despite a
weather-related drop in copra production,
private sector activity appears to have picked
up, especially in retail. Tourist arrivals
rebounded by 20 percent compared to 2009,
although from a very low base.
6.
Inflation pressures dissipated in 2010.
Despite the rise in world food and fuel prices,
inflation has plunged from 2008 crisis-highs
into negative territory, reflecting the strong
appreciation of the Australian dollar—which
is used as the domestic currency—and a
decline in the world price of rice (Box 2).
7.
Credit growth in the overall economy
declined in 2009 as economic activity stalled,
but started to pick up in the second half of
2010 as the recovery gained traction.

Box 1.

Poverty Trends in Kiribati 1

The spike in food and fuel prices in 2008
and the global crisis have undermined past
gains in poverty reduction. The UNDP and
the authorities estimated that an additional
10 percent of population is likely to have
fallen below the poverty line as a result,
with the incidence of poverty increasing
from 22 percent to 26 percent. Poverty is
highly concentrated in urban areas (South
Tarawa) and less in the outer islands where
there is greater access to land and marine
resources. However, the outer islands face
higher transportation costs.
As a result, progress against the
achievements of the MDGs has been set
back. Five out of eight goals seem out of
reach. Increased vulnerabilities to climate
change have also slowed the achievement
of poverty reduction goals. This reflects the
need to divert resources from development
expenditure toward building of seawalls.

The government’s plan and development
partners’ assistance are expected to
alleviate poverty going forward. The
authorities’ strategy toward poverty
reduction is embedded in the Kiribati
Development
Plan
(2008–11)—the
government’s overarching plan to “enhance
economic growth and poverty reduction for
sustainable development”. The main pillars
include
supporting
private
sector
development as a key engine of growth,
especially in eco- tourism and in the
domestic processing fishing industry, as well
as creating employment opportunities both
domestically and abroad.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

In March 2010, the government formulated
a national framework for climate change
and climate change adaptation and
migration. Progress has been achieved so
far in creating temporary employment
opportunities abroad thanks to the
engagement of development partners (in
particular Australia and New Zealand).

Outlook and Risks

Staff’s Views
8.
Growth momentum in the near term
is expected to strengthen. Under current
policies,
key
public
projects—the
rehabilitation of Tarawa’s road, airport and
port—financed with external assistance
should support growth in the 3 percent range
over the next few years, restoring prospects
that had been undermined by the
infrastructure failures. Growth would revert
to 1½–2 percent in the medium to long term
assuming that the impact of climate change
will continue to negatively impact economic
activity.

Risks to the near and medium-term
outlook are balanced, but long-term
challenges remain. On the upside, domestic
public works in the pipeline may have largerthan-expected impact on output, despite
their large import content. On the downside,
if the global recovery stalls, Kiribati’s
remittances would be hit, while a surge in
world food and oil prices could raise inflation
pressures even further (Box 2) undermining
past gains in poverty reduction. Higher than
expected pressures from the upcoming
investment boom could also arise. Over the
long run, vulnerabilities to climate change
could take a toll on economic activity
undermining its long-run prospects.

stepped-up reforms at a realistic pace, GDP
growth could reach 3 percent over the

Box 2.

Kiribati: The Impact of High Fuel and Food Prices

Kiribati is vulnerable to a surge in
commodity prices. Food and fuel imports
represent 30 percent of GDP. Their share in
total imports increased from less than
40 percent to about 60 percent over the
last decade as commodity prices trended
up.

The pass-through of food—especially rice—
and energy prices to domestic inflation is
high. Rice accounts for 20 percent of the
CPI food basket. An increase in international
fuel prices historically has resulted in an
equal increase in domestic prices, with a
three-month lag.
However, there are some mitigating
factors compared to 2008. Rice prices have
fallen in 2010 and they are still well below
the 2008 peak and the Australian dollar has
appreciated significantly helping mitigate
imported inflation pressures.
Yet, a further increase in commodity prices
may eventually pass through to domestic
inflation, worsening both the fiscal and
external positions. This could occur
through higher imports and public
spending, especially in light of the large
investment projects in the pipeline, and
possibly through higher food and fuel
subsidies, although they account for a very
small part of GDP (1 percent). Under an
adverse scenario with oil price increasing by
40 percent in 2011, the fiscal balance is
expected to deteriorate by 2½ percentage
points of GDP in 2011 compared to the
baseline, and the current account balance
by 3 percentage points of GDP, provided
that the Australian dollar does not
appreciate further.

POLICIES TO ENSURE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
A.

Fiscal Policy

Background
12.
The scope for countercyclical policy
in Kiribati is limited. The revenue base is
large but very volatile. Fishing license fees
account for about half of government
revenues (Box 3). The country depends on
foreign aid to finance its large development
needs. More extreme weather patterns
related to global climate change are also
putting strains on the budget. The only fiscal
cushion against negative shocks has been
provided by Kiribati’s wealth fund (RERF),
which in recent years has been severely
depleted.

13.
Fiscal policy has supported the
economy during the economic downturn.
Copra subsidies and civil servant wages have
increased and have helped mitigate the
impact of the output contraction on
households. The fiscal deficit bottomed out at
20 percent of GDP in 2008 (Table 3), but
narrowed substantially the following year as a
result of expenditure compression and
improved tax collection, with the introduction
of a withholding tax at the source in March
2009.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

14.
However,
the
RERF
suffered
substantial losses. The RERF assets declined
from A$637 million (420 percent of GDP) in
2007 to A$571 million (350 percent of GDP)
in 2009. This drop reflected exposure to failed
Icelandic banks (A$40 million, or 25 percent
of GDP), as well as continued drawdowns to
finance budgetary shortfalls.
15.
In 2010 the fiscal position
strengthened
and
budget
planning
improved. The estimated fiscal deficit is
8 percent of GDP, down from 12½ percent in
2009. The narrowing deficit reflects a large
increase in fishing licenses fees, as a result of
an auction scheme introduced in September
2010 as well as temporary factors—such as
fines collected from foreign fishing vessels.
The 2010 budget introduced a three-year
budget framework in line with previous IMF
policy recommendations (Appendix 1), with
the assistance of the AsDB.
16.
The 2011 budget marks a return to
fiscal expansion. The fiscal balance is
expected to deteriorate to 14 percent of GDP
in 2011 on the back of a large increase in
development expenditure in infrastructure
financed by a combination of external
assistance and RERF draw-downs.
17.
Over the medium term, fiscal deficits
will remain in the double digits (Table 4). The
current government’s fiscal strategy is to
target the RERF drawdown at A$15 million
per year during 2011–13. Given the expected
external loans to finance infrastructure
spending, this strategy would imply a deficit
of 10–14 percent of GDP. In 2014, revenues
are expected to drop by 2 percent of GDP

KIRIBATI 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

with
lower
tariffs
following
the
implementation of Pacific Islands Countries
Trade Agreement (PICTA).
Staff’s Views
18. The fiscal stance for the next two years
is appropriate, but fiscal adjustment will be
required in the out years. The deterioration
of the fiscal balance in the near term is
warranted by key development expenditures
that will spur productivity growth. However,
going forward, the focus will need to shift to
fiscal consolidation. In the last ten years,
budget deficits (averaging 12 percent of GDP)
have been financed by drawing down the
RERF. If this trend continues, the RERF real
per capita balance would reach one-third of
its 2000 value by 2030 (DSA baseline
scenario).
19. Should food and fuel prices escalate,
the authorities should refrain from
increasing universal subsidies and public
wages. However, as income inequality is very
low in Kiribati, it may be difficult to design a
targeted subsidy program. Instead the
mission supported the authorities’ plan to
take full advantage of the regional seasonal
employment scheme offered by Australia and
New Zealand to increase employment and
income generating opportunities in the short
term. Grant support from donors would also
help limit the harm to real incomes and
poverty. An increase in civil servant wages
would not be an appropriate countercyclical
policy because it is unlikely to be reversed
when the economy recovers, as the increase
introduced in early 2010 demonstrates.
20. Over the medium term, to help anchor
fiscal plans, the mission suggested stabilizing
the real value of the RERF in per capita

terms, once key public investments in the
pipeline have occurred.1 This would require
limiting budget deficits to 5–6 percent of GDP
over the long term (DSA reform scenario).2
Fiscal sustainability requires preserving the
value of the RERF as a buffer against external
shocks. While this fiscal anchor would only be
indicative, it could provide an internal
consistency check to link fiscal decisions to a
more
intergenerationally
equitable
drawdown of sovereign wealth.

Given the assumed rate of return on the RERF assets
(5½ percent per year), population growth (1.6 percent
per year) and inflation (2½ percent per year), to
preserve the real per capita balance of the RERF, the
nominal RERF balance would need to grow by about
4 percent per year (2½ percent inflation plus a
1.6 percent increase in population). This implies a yearly
nominal draw-down of about 1½ percent of the RERF
total balance. See paragraph 12 of the Supplement DSA.

2

Part of the difference in the size of fiscal deficits in the
baseline scenario and in the reform scenario is due to
the assumption that development expenditure is fully
funded by grants over the medium term in the latter.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21.
Staff commended the authorities for
adopting a multi-year budget framework as
it would provide more fiscal discipline.
Realistic fiscal plans would be more easily
designed and fiscal sustainability safeguarded.
Given the uncertainty surrounding revenue
and aid flows, revenue projections should be
conservative
assumptions.
Downside
scenarios should also be fleshed out, with
revenue shortfalls, as a result of a temporary
shock, and the prospective costs of climate
change mitigation, explicitly considered.
Overall, lower fiscal deficits (and a stronger
sovereign balance sheet) are needed to
reconstitute room for countercyclical fiscal
maneuver, as well as scope to meet the longterm spending pressures arising from a rising
sea level.
22.
As the recovery proceeds, stronger
than anticipated revenues should be saved.
To help moderate pro-cyclical fiscal policies
driven by volatile revenues, windfalls should
be saved during upswings and used only
during downturns to support the economy.
This will help create fiscal space by
safeguarding the RERF against external shocks
and support a smooth path of expenditure.
23.
Savings can also be achieved by
rationalizing expenditure and tax structures.
Poorly targeted and distortionary subsidies to
copra producers and other state-ownedenterprises (SOEs), amounting to some
5 percent of GDP, should be phased out. The
restructuring of loss-making SOEs should also
proceed apace. Customs administration—
which reportedly has worsened in the last few
years—should be shored up and exemptions
reduced. The introduction of a VAT tax should
also be considered.
24.
Staff welcomed the introduction of
an auction scheme on fishing licenses. This
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

would provide scope for increasing fishing
license revenues over the medium term.
25.
The authorities should reconsider
RERF investment strategies in line with the
recent MCM TA recommendations. The
report suggested reviewing current strategic
asset allocation to reflect more closely the
currency composition of Kiribati’s imports.
The report also recommended strengthening
the governance of the RERF by increasing inhouse expertise over the medium term
through training or secondment at other
wealth fund institutions, hiring a long-term
consultant to improve the investment
framework, closer monitoring investment
risks and returns, and publishing annual
reports to increase transparency.
26. Kiribati is at high risk of debt distress.
Fiscal risks have been exacerbated by the
crisis as RERF assets—the primary source of
deficit financing—dropped significantly. The
uncertainty about aid flows and the impact of
climate change will add to pressures on
Kiribati’s fiscal position over the long term.
The joint IMF-WB debt sustainability analysis
shows that despite low external public debt—
currently estimated at about 10 percent of
GDP—the debt outlook is projected to worsen
in the years ahead as Kiribati undertakes
infrastructure investment (partly financed
through borrowing from development
partners) and the fiscal costs of climate
change. Improving debt dynamics will require
prudent
borrowing,
continued
grant
financing, fiscal consolidation, and a step up
in structural reforms.
Authorities’ Views
27. The authorities reiterated their strong
commitment to preserve the value of the
RERF. They saw merit in staff’s advice to save

KIRIBATI 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

stronger-than-anticipated revenues in the
upswing, as well as in maintaining the real per
capita balance of the RERF constant once the
large public investments have occurred. They
noted that their nominal drawdown rule,
while imperfect, is simple to communicate
and is the first step toward a fiscal anchor.
Should the increase in commodity prices be
persistent they may consider increasing the
import levy and then using the proceeds to
reimburse the freight costs for goods
transported to the outer islands, where
transportation costs are higher. While they
agreed that the increase in civil servant wages
effective in January 2010 was not a
countercyclical policy measure given its
permanent nature, they noted that the
previous increase dated back to 2006 and
thus was overdue.

28. On technical assistance, they requested
assistance from PFTAC on the macroframework and tax administration. They also
expressed concerns about the volatility in
fishing revenues as they are collected in U.S.
dollars and are currently looking at options
for hedging exchange rate risk through
financial derivatives and for denominating
fishing license fees using a basket of
currencies. Officials would welcome technical
assistance from development partners. They
highly appreciated the TA on the RERF
provided by MCM.

Box 3.

Kiribati: Prospects for Fishing License Revenues

Fishing license fees are a key source of income
for Kiribati. Over the last ten years they
represented on average 45 percent of
government revenues. They are the highest (in
terms of GDP) among regional peers reflecting
the largest marine resource endowment across
the Pacific.
Kiribati has still untapped potential to exploit
its fishing resources and reduce the volatility
of fishing revenues and some steps have been
recently taken.
In September 2010, the authorities
introduced an auction scheme for fishing
rights,
replacing
bilateral
access
agreements—in line with previous IMF
recommendations. Bilateral agreements
specified a fixed fee per vessel and were renegotiated on a yearly basis, regardless of
the value of fish catches. Thanks to the
introduction of the auction scheme, as well
as some other temporary factors (paragraph
15) in 2010 fishing license fees surged by
almost 40 percent (year-on- year) to
52 percent of GDP.
The authorities are seeking options to
reduce the volatility of license fees due to
exchange rate movements of the U.S. dollar
through financial derivatives or by
denominating fishing license fees using a
basket of currencies. They are currently
evaluating pros and cons of moving away
from the current U.S. dollar denomination as
it provides a natural hedge against U.S.
dollar-denominated imports.
Recent initiatives to encourage investment
in domestic marine processing would
increase proceeds from fishing resources.
The recent agreement among the
government of Kiribati and Chinese and
Fijian fishing companies to set up a joint
venture for marine processing could provide
a significant boost to the economy. The FDI
involved is expected to reach A$50 million.

29. Weak private sector development is an
impediment
to

growth.
Participation of the private sector in the
economy is tenuous although it has increased
over the last few years. According to the 2011
WB Doing Business Report, procedures for
starting and closing a business, and dealing
with construction permits are more
cumbersome than in other Pacific islands.
Also, access to credit is limited and costly,
while poor infrastructure continues to hold
back long-term growth. The government’s
Development Plan (KDP), spanning 2008–11,
correctly recognized the need to rotate the
sources of growth toward the private sector
in areas such as tourism and marine
resources—including the development of
niche tourism in Kiritimati (Christmas)
Island—and identified key weaknesses of the
current system. The outstanding issue
remains the slow pace of implementation in
key areas:

reform. The KDP calls for cutting back
government guarantees on SOEs’ borrowing.
The contingent liabilities from SOEs
amounted to about 20 percent of GDP in
2010.

Staff’s Views
30. With a shift to a higher growth path
hinging on a vibrant private sector, the
implementation of the structural reform
agenda should be accelerated. Private sector
development is crucial to improve growth
prospects, especially in tourism and fish
processing.3 While there was agreement that
3

Kiribati’s extensive marine resource endowment of
Kiritimati and Tabuaeran Islands, and the Phoenix
Islands Protected Area—the largest world heritage
marine protected area—could provide substantial
opportunities for eco-tourism. However, basic
infrastructure is needed.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT KIRIBATI

the pace of reforms needs to be calibrated to
political realities, staff advised the authorities
to bring the current structural reform
momentum forward and take measures to
improve the business climate. A critical mass
of reform is needed to continue attract
foreign assistance and increase opportunities
for foreign investment. Reforms aimed at
streamlining starting up businesses, and
obtaining
construction
permits,
and
expanding access to credit are key. A new
land law that improves access to land by
strengthening administrative systems for
transferring property rights and improves the
legal framework for land usage and
ownership is also urgent. The authorities’
interest to liberalize telecommunication with
the assistance of the World Bank is a welcome
step.
31.
Staff supported the SOE reform
underway with the assistance of the AsDB.
Reforming the SOEs would create space for
private sector development and reduce the
drain on the budget. As advocated by the
Fund in past consultations, it is important to
limit SOEs to areas where the private sector
operations are not viable such as in public
utilities (water, electricity, and fuel
distribution to the outer islands).
32.
Strengthening
public
financial
management (PFM) is crucial. PFM in Kiribati

legislation
and

information about fiscal risks from
nonperforming SOEs, and poor links between
capital investments and recurrent budgets.
These weaknesses weight on business
activity. The PFM Reform Plan, which sets out
the government’s reform priorities based on
the findings of the 2010 Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability, provides a good
platform for policy dialogue and more
focused technical assistance.
Authorities’ View
33. The authorities shared the view that a
meaningful uplift in trend growth requires
structural reforms on a broad front. The
authorities have reiterated in the 2011
budget speech their commitment to SOE
reform. While they pointed out that the pace
of reforms may slow down in the second half
of the year ahead of elections, the need for
the private sector to support the economy
has gained consensus among policymakers
and the public. They are considering a law to
ease constraints to the use of land as
collateral. To streamline the red tape for
business they are planning on instituting a
“one-stop shop” to ease procedures for
opening a business. They also stressed that a
review of the investment regulatory
framework should take place with the
assistance of development partners to
increase interest of foreign investors. In their
view, one of main impediments to private
sector development is the difficulty in
accessing credit. However, they agreed that
this in turn reflects the absence of clear
property rights.

34. Kiribati’s financial sector is undercut by
structural impediments and a lack of
competition. It consists of two banks, one
insurance company, and a pension fund. ANZ
Bank (Kiribati) Limited is the only commercial
bank.4 Restrictions on land ownership by
foreign entities tilt the bulk of its lending
toward public enterprises. ANZ Bank NPLs are
less than 1 percent of total loans. The
Development Bank of Kiribati (DBK), wholly
government-owned, has a larger share of
loans to the private sector but its loan book is
marred by high NPLs and secured lending
remains underdeveloped. Insurance coverage
is provided by another government financial
institution, the Kiribati Insurance Corporation.
Finally, the Kiribati Provident Fund (KPF)
manages the assets of the pension system,
about 60 percent of GDP in 2010 (Box 4).
Overall, access to credit by the private sector
remains restricted and expensive. The
interest rate spread is slightly above the
Pacific Islands average. The private sector has
regularly complained about high charges and
fees, including on remittances.

35. The authorities have tried to bolster
competition and intermediation. Entry into
the insurance industry was liberalized at end2008, although the incumbent insurer
remains unchallenged to date. The KPF
introduced a lending scheme in July 2010,
which allows short-term borrowing (i.e., one
year) for any purpose of up to 14 percent of a
member’s balance in the pension fund, using
his pension entitlements as collateral5. In
2010, loans under this scheme totaled
A$3 million (about 3½ percent of the fund’s
portfolio). There are also plans afoot to
strengthen the commercial orientation of the
DBK through a foreign partnership.
Staff’s Views
36. More competition in the banking
sector would help to spur private sector’s
development. The authorities’ ongoing
efforts are appropriately focused but other
steps could be considered. These include: (i)
expanding micro-credit with the development
of village banks as done in other Pacific
islands; (ii) containing NPLs at the DBK by

it was known as the Bank of Kiribati.

5

Loans could amount up to 20 percent of a member’s
collateral, the latter being defined as 70 percent of the
member’s balance.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT KIRIBATI

tightening lending standards and improving
risk management; and (iii) introducing a longoverdue land law to ease access to credit and
improve collateral recovery. Bank regulation
and supervision need to be strengthened
before an expansion of the DBK’s lending
activity is considered. Staff also stressed the
need to enact and implement the draft law on
anti-money laundering and combating the
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).
37. The new lending scheme of the
pension fund could prove problematic.
Although collateralization limits credit risks to
the KPF, contingent liabilities to the
government could build up if members
exhaust their pension wealth ahead of
retirement. Thus the size of the scheme
should not be increased. If this were the case,
asset allocation may be adversely affected by
the need to ensure greater liquidity of the
assets, if draw-downs under the scheme
increase. If members were to use the loans
for consumption or improper investments,
they might compromise their future pension
income. Hence, the government and/or KPF
should invest in financial education. Technical
assistance, including from the IMF, could help
the authorities improve the design of the
lending program.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Authorities’ Views
38. The officials broadly shared staff’s
views on the challenges facing the financial
sector and requested IMF technical
assistance in this area. They agreed that
greater competition would improve the
private sector’s access to credit and reduce
credit costs. Fund technical assistance on
financial supervision and regulation would
strengthen the underpinning of the reforms
underway, including the restructuring of the
Development Bank.
39. The authorities noted that the new KPF
lending scheme is an initial step to improve
households’ access to credit. Since lending is
a relatively small fraction of the accumulated
individual assets and collateralized, the
solvency of the pension fund or its exposure
to credit risk are not at issue. Nonetheless,
the authorities requested IMF technical
assistance in reviewing the asset allocation
strategy of the KPF as well as an assessment
of its long-term viability.

KIRIBATI 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 4.

Financial Sector Developments: The Provident Fund and Kiribati Development Bank

Kiribati Provident Fund (KPF) is Kiribati’s
government-managed pension fund.
 The 2008 crisis hit the KPF hard. Assets values
dropped by 20 percent, but rebounded in
2009-10, reaching pre-crisis value. Its assets
totaled A$100 million (60 percent of GDP) at
end-2010. Employers and employees each
contribute 7½ percent of the employee’s
salary. At the retirement age (50 years),
participants receive a lump-sum payment.
However, at the age of 45, members have the
option of withdrawing 50 percent of their
accrued balance while continuing working
until age 50, or 100 percent of their balance if
they retire at 45 for medical reasons. With a
minimum yearly rate of return guaranteed at
4 percent, the fund is a defined-contribution
scheme with an element of defined benefits.
25
20

fees at terms below market rates in 2007
have further deteriorated its financial
position.
 Recognizing these risks, the KPF
management has committed to a more
active asset allocation strategy, increasing
asset diversification in mid-2010 and hiring
an additional portfolio manager.1
The Development Bank of Kiribati (DBK) is a
government-owned banking institution.


About 40 percent of loans are for business
purposes. The interest rate charged is close
to market rates. Loans of all types are
collateralized (by land or pension
contributions for borrowers older than
45 years). Loans are funded by a revolving
government fund.



Although NPLs declined since 2008, they
were still high at 24 percent of total loans in
2010.



DBK lending activity has started to pick up in
the second half of 2010 as the economy
recovered. In spite of the 60 percent
provisions for NPLs, poor prospects for loan
recovery due to issues with land titling and
poor risk management undermine the
soundness of the bank.

 The KPF has built a buffer fund to
accumulate “surpluses” when rate of return
on assets exceed rate of return accrued to
members (decided by the KPF board).
Through the years, this buffer has, however,
been depleted in the wake of losses during
the crisis resulting in a gap between assets
and projected liabilities. Additionally, earlier
losses related to lending operations to the
DBK (amounting to A$1½ million) to allow
households to borrow funds for education

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT KIRIBATI

ADDRESSING EXTERNAL COMPETITIVENESS AND SAFEGUARDING
EXTERNAL STABILITY
40.
The Australian dollar circulates as
legal tender. Kiribati has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4
and maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on payments and transfers for
current international transactions.
41.
The real effective exchange rate has
appreciated by 20 percent since 2008, driven
by the strong Australian dollar and appears
to be overvalued compared to its long-run
level. However, the current account balance
has improved over the last few years,
reflecting strong income from fishing license
fees. Looking ahead, the current account
deficit is expected to deteriorate in the near
term as Kiribati undertakes large public
investment, and to narrow again by the end
of the projection period to 24 percent of GDP
(from 29 percent in 2011) in line with an
improvement in the fiscal position (Tables 5
and 6). In the short term, large deficits are
likely manageable as they are driven by key
investment in infrastructure and financed by
capital transfers.

Kiribati: Real Effective Exchange Rate
(Index, 2005 = 100)

43.
While it is desirable to maintain the
Australian dollar as nominal anchor,
pursuing structural reforms is crucial to
regaining competitiveness following the
strong real appreciation. As noted
(paragraph 29), competitiveness based on
institutional indicators suggests that the
business environment needs to be
significantly improved.
44.
Continuing to secure grant financing,
instead of loans, and containing fiscal deficits
are key to ensure external stability. From a
macro balance perspective, the sustainability
of the current account in the medium-term is
totally driven by fiscal policy.

Staff’s Views
42.
The use of the Australian dollar as
the official currency remains appropriate
given Kiribati’s close linkages with Australia
and has provided a strong nominal anchor.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45.
The authorities agreed that there is
no scope to have an independent monetary
policy. They also stressed that the fluctuation
of the Australian dollar makes the economy
vulnerable to exchange rate risks, given the
RERF assets are mostly held in Australian
dollars, while imports are not, resulting in a
currency mismatch. They noted that the large
current account deficit reflects to a large
extent the surge in commodity prices, not
only a loss in competitiveness and a large
structural component—low public saving
driven by large developments spending.

KIRIBATI 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

STAFF APPRAISAL
46. Kiribati is at a crossroads. The economy
has recovered from the crisis with strong
forward momentum. Large public investment
in key infrastructures financed by foreign
assistance underpins its favorable mediumterm growth prospects. Yet gains will prove
transitory if a broader agenda of fiscal and
structural reforms remains unfinished.
Further reforms are necessary to bolster the
economy’s resilience and to ensure
sustainable growth. The increasing costs of
climate change and still large development
needs raise important policy challenges.
47. Preserving the real per capita value of
the RERF is key to ensure fiscal sustainability
and intergenerational fairness. Once key
public projects in the pipeline are underway,
the focus should shift to fiscal consolidation.
Lower fiscal deficits and a stronger sovereign
balance sheet are necessary to rebuild fiscal
space and help cope with long-term spending
pressures arising from climate change.
48. The authorities have taken steps to
bolster the public finances by introducing a
multi-year budget framework. Casting
budget decisions in a multi-year perspective
will help design realistic fiscal plans. Positive
windfall revenues compared to the budget
should be saved during upswings and used
only during downturns to support the
economy. Continuing strengthening the
medium-term fiscal framework is important
to facilitate public planning and help guard
against pro-cyclical policies.

for private sector development and reducing
the drain on the budget.
50. Competition in the banking sector is
crucial to boost private activity. The
authorities’ plans to revitalize the DBK in the
medium term are welcome. In the meantime
any further expansion of the DBK’s activity
should be postponed until a regulatory and
supervisory framework is in place. Expanding
micro-credit schemes would also help ease
credit constraints.
51. The use of the Australian dollar
remains appropriate. To preserve external
stability, continuing to secure grant financing
would be key to supporting the country’s
large development need, as indicated in the
joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability
analysis.
52. The quality of macroeconomic data
should continue to improve. The authorities
should
press
ahead
with
PFTAC
recommendations on the compilation and
dissemination of economic data.
53. It is recommended that the next Article
IV consultation take place on a 24-month
cycle. This recommendation is in accordance
with the Decision on Article IV Consultation
Cycles
(Decision
No.
14747-(10/96)
(9/28/2010),
http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx
?id=4515.

49. The implementation of the structural
reform agenda should be accelerated.
Reforming the SOEs is key to creating space

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT KIRIBATI

APPENDIX 1: MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 2009 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION
Fund Recommendations 1

Policy Actions

Fiscal policy: Staff noted that there was scope for fiscal
policy to mitigate the impact of the global shocks
through deficit neutral options, such as expediting or
bringing forward project implementation and through
well targeted social expenditure to ease the impact on
the poor.

Fiscal policy supported the economy during the
crisis. The impact of the global crisis was stronger
than anticipated at the time of the 2009 Article IV
consultation as was the global recession.
Consequently, deficit-neutral measures were not
applicable. Copra subsidies and civil servant wages
have increased.

Staff suggested introducing some tax and revenue
measures: strengthening the administration and
merging the tax and custom offices, and establish a
single tax payer identification number, as well as the
adoption of a broad –based consumption tax and the
introduction of excises to counterbalance the drop in
custom revenues under the upcoming regional trade
agreement (PICTA). Staff advised to increase fishing
license fees through the use of auctions and/or
collective agreements. It also advised to control
expenditure by reducing wage bills.

The authorities introduced a withholding tax at the
source in March 2009 (retroactive to January 2009).
A PFTAC mission on tax administration will be
discharged in 2011. The implementation of PICTA
commitments has been postponed to 2014. To
increase license fishing fees, the government
introduced an auction scheme in September 2010.

Staff also recommended introducing a multi-year
budget framework as well as a well-defined target or
rule for the RERF draw-downs.

A three-year budget framework was introduced in
October 2009. It targets the RERF drawdown at
A$15 million per year during 2011–13.

Structural reforms: Staff suggested limiting SOE
operation to areas where the private sector was not
viable and improving SOE performance, improving
investment climate, and land tilting.

An SOE will be privatized by May 2011 and five
additional SOEs have been identified for reform later
in 2011. The authorities are considering a law to
ease constraints to the use of land as collateral.

Financial sector policy: Staff recommended more
competition in the financial sector to facilitate access
to credit and decrease its cost. Given DBK’s large NPLs,
staff recommended to limit its expansion until an
appropriate risk management framework is in place.
Staff advised Kiribati Provident Fund (KPF) to review its
investment strategy and limit dividends until its capital
position is strengthened.

The KPF introduced a lending scheme in July 2010. It
also revised its investment strategy in mid-2010.
There are also plans afoot to strengthen the
commercial orientation of the DBK through a foreign
partnership. DBK’s lending activities were contained
and NPLs reduced by 2 percentage points of total
loans over the last two years.

ANNEX II. KIRIBATI: RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE (PFTAC)1
(As of March, 2011)
1

During the current funding cycle (May 2008 to
May 2011), PFTAC assistance to Kiribati has
included eight advisory missions. Kiribati also sent
15 officials to regional seminars and workshops.

However, in February 2009, the cabinet
approved the introduction of legislation to
treat income tax deductions from salary and
wages (PAYE) as a final tax.

Tax Administration and Policy

PFTAC stands ready to assist the authorities
implement the wider reforms including
introduction of automated processes once
the cabinet has made a firm commitment to
proceed.

In 2003, PFTAC recommended several
reforms. These included: a value-added tax
(VAT); a presumptive tax; and a single ad
valorem tax on imports from non Pacific
countries; simplified personal income tax
(PIT); single rate of corporate income tax
(CIT). A steering committee was established
to manage the introduction of the reforms. In
2009, a subsequent review mission was
provided to update tax recommendations.
The domestic revenue issues require to be
addressed with some urgency. Compliance
levels are low and the impact of trade
liberalization (PICTA and the Pacific
Agreement on Closer Economic Relations) is
expected to reduce trade revenues by up to
15 percent. PFTAC provided support and
training in customs procedures in 2009.
Although agreed to in principle little progress
has been made to introduce the reforms.

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre
(PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji is a multi-donor technical assistance
(TA) institution, financed by IMF, AsDB, AusAID, and
NZAID, with the IMF as Executing Agency. The Centre's
aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for
effective economic and financial management that can
be sustained at the national level. Member countries
are: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji,
Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau,
Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau,
Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

Public Financial Management
AusAid maintains a long-term TA program
aimed at improving public sector financial and
economic management. A joint PFTAC
mission with Asian Development Bank (AsDB)
on public financial management reform was
undertaken in August 2006. Following this
mission, a multi-donor mission of AusAID,
PFTAC, and AsDB visited Kiribati from
December 12–15, 2006. AusAID and AsDB
have taken the lead in supporting
implementation of the recommendations.
PFTAC is ready to provide additional technical
support, such as the review of IFMIS
procedures undertaken in late 2009.
Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
In August 2003, the PFTAC advisor and an IMF
legal expert visited Kiribati to conduct
consultations with industry and government
officials on a Financial Institutions Bill that
had been drafted in July 2002. No major
concerns arose from the discussions.
Proposed responses to comments raised in
the meeting, together with appropriately
amended draft legislation, were forwarded to
the authorities in December 2003 for action.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX KIRIBATI

In 2005, the advisor was invited to attend a
government and industry workshop to discuss
aspects of the Financial Institutions Bill. The
mission did not proceed. However, the
advisor provided authorities with papers,
which highlighted the need for such
legislation. To date there has been no further
progress on the draft Financial Institutions Bill
or the previously drafted Anti-money
Laundering Legislation. The PFTAC advisor
makes periodic contact with the Ministry of
Finance regarding the status of the draft
legislation.

with drafting by PFTAC. A brief mission was
undertaken in August 2006 to assess TA
needs. The BOP compiler benefited from
training provided in regional courses in 2005
and 2010. PFTAC provided TA on balance of
payments in 2008 and 2010, improving
compilation methods and use of source data,
as well as providing training, and helping with
the transition to BPM6. PFTAC provided TA on
national accounts 2008, 2009, and 2010; and
assisted the authorities in making significant
improvements in methodology and use of
source data. The NA compiler benefited from
a regional course in 2009. PFTAC also
sponsored a one-month attachment for the
BOP compiler with Statistics New Zealand in
May 2009.

The
Fund
Kiribati
mission
chief—
Ms. Tumbarello—met with the World Bank
team 7 in March 2010, in Tarawa, at the
Development Partner Forum, to exchange
views on the recent economic developments,
identify macro structural challenges ahead
and discuss a work plan to prepare the first
joint debt sustainability analysis.
In September 2010, the IMF and World Bank
teams held two phone conferences to
coordinate the teams’ work plan for the
period September 2010–August 2011 (see
below). Since then the teams consulted very
frequently, especially on issues related to the
debt sustainability analysis and the economic
outlook. Bank staff joined the 2011 IMF
Article IV mission in February for the first
time.
There has been close cooperation on the
following issues:
Macroeconomic developments and economic
updates. There has been close dialogue
throughout the year on macro policies and
economic developments with regular sharing
of information.
External debt and debt sustainability analysis.
The teams have engaged very closely on
discussions around government plans to
borrow. Despite the existence of a wealth
fund, going forward the fiscal costs of climate
are expected to be substantial. They
produced two joint DSAs.

Structural reform. The Bank program will
support reforms related to telecoms
liberalization,
strengthening
road
maintenance
arrangements,
improving
returns from fisheries resources, the
operation of the import levy fund given the
liberalization of food import arrangements.
The Bank agreed to update the Fund on
developments in these areas as needed.
The teams agreed that Kiribati’s main
macroeconomic challenges include:
Striking a balance between the need to
preserve Kiribati’s wealth fund through fiscal
consolidation and the need to address the
large infrastructure, health and education
needs;
High vulnerability to climate change and rising
sea level. An important first step is to
recognize the fiscal risks involved and start
building a fiscal buffer—with the assistance of
international donors—and to consider the
implications for expenditure programs.
The teams have indentified the reform of the
state-owned enterprises as s a macro-critical
structural reform.
The teams agreed to continue the close
cooperation going forward. The following
table details the specific activities planned by
the two country teams over the period
September 2010–August 2011. The Fund will
continue to lead on macro issues, and the
Bank will continue to lead on macro critical
structural reform issues. The Bank and the
Fund closely cooperated in preparing a joint
DSA, also in consultation with the Asian
Development Bank and in the run-up of the
IMF 2011 Article IV.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1 (As of March 1, 2011)

1

Kiribati became a member of the World Bank
Group in 1986.
On March 1, 2011, the World Bank’s Board of
Executive Directors discussed the first
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Kiribati,
which had previously been covered by a
Pacific
Islands
Regional
Engagement
Framework. The CAS is structured around the
themes of: (i) addressing the existential threat

Prepared by World Bank staff.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

posed by climate change; and, (ii) mitigating
the effects of geographic isolation.
The CAS anticipates a significantly expanded
program of advisory and financial support for
Kiribati. Consistent with Kiribati’s limited
repayment capacity highlighted in the DSA, it
is anticipated that IDA financing will be
provided on 100-percent grant terms. IDA
grants and trust fund investments of as much
as US$50 million are anticipated over the four
year CAS period from FY11 to FY14. Such a
program of investments is intended to build a

KIRIBATI 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

foundation for the World Bank to play a more
substantive role, in close collaboration with
the IMF and other donor partners, in a
coordinated economic policy dialogue with
the Government of Kiribati.
Key components of proposed World Bank
Group engagement include:


Climate change adaptation and
building resilience against shocks is
at the core of Bank engagement in
Kiribati. The Bank, with trust fund
financing, has been supporting
climate change mitigation since 2003
through the Kiribati Adaptation
Program (KAP). Staff anticipates
seeking Board agreement in mid-2011
to enlarge and extend activities under
KAP Phase 3. Trust fund financing of
US$7–10 million has been agreed in
principle for KAP 3 from GEF, GFDRR,
Australia, and, potentially, New
Zealand. This will involve a significant
scale up compared to previous
phases. Activities will focus on
seawalls, mangrove planting, and
water conservation and supply. In
addition to KAP, the Bank is proposing
to work with the government and
other donors to consider options for
an integrated program in the water
sector, which is the key issue where
the climate change and development
agendas intersect in Kiribati. Kiribati’s
already limited supply of fresh water
adversely
affects
development
outcomes, and population growth
and the impact of climate change is
likely to put further pressure on this
critical resource. Beyond climate
change adaptation, the Bank is
committed to accelerating efforts to
address wider issues of vulnerability
in Kiribati, including accessing trust

fund resources to improve renewable
energy generation to reduce reliance
on volatile imported diesel, and to
support the transport of food to
remote outer islands.


Mitigating the effects of geographic
isolation. Given Kiribati’s remoteness,
the Bank anticipates scaling up
support
for
climate
friendly
infrastructure investments. A South
Tarawa
road
improvement
investment of US$24m in IDA and TF
financing—to be undertaken jointly
with the AsDB—was approved by the
Board on March 1, 2011, with the
Kiribati CAS. The Bank is also
considering options, in collaboration
with New Zealand and other partners,
to help bring Kiribati airports – a vital
link with the outside world – up to
international safety standards.



Supporting economic reform and
regional integration. An expanded
program of investments will provide a
foundation for a more substantive
engagement by the Bank Group in a
coordinated economic policy dialogue
in Kiribati. Bank staff, for instance,
joined the IMF Article IV mission in
2011 for the first time. Reform of the
large and inefficient state owned
enterprise sector will be especially
important to improve services and to
reduce the fiscal costs to the budget
from such enterprises. The AsDB, with
support from Australia, has to date
led efforts to support the government
to develop a legal and regulatory
framework for reforming SOEs.
Building on this, the Bank Group
anticipates supporting government
efforts to open the telecoms market
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX KIRIBATI

to new private investments. As well
as the direct benefits, telecoms
reform has elsewhere in the Pacific
proven to be especially successful in
building
public
support
and
momentum for reform more broadly.
The Bank and IFC will cooperate
closely in supporting telecoms
reform, in providing advisory services
more broadly, and on other potential
SOE transactions. As well as domestic

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

reform, the Bank Group continues to
support efforts by Kiribati and other
Pacific Island Countries to gain
benefits from greater regional
integration, including participation in
temporary labor migration schemes
established by New Zealand and
Australia and anticipated analytical
support to help countries improve
management and returns from the
pelagic fishery.

KIRIBATI 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX IV. KIRIBATI: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK 1
(As of February, 2011)
The Asian Development Bank has approved
seven project loans to Kiribati amounting to
US$27.14 million, all from Asian Development
Fund (ADF) resources since Kiribati joined the
AsDB in 1974. In addition, TA amounting to
US$13.9 million has been provided for 41
projects. The latest AsDB loan to Kiribati, for a
road rehabilitation project, was approved in
December 2010. The AsDB most recently
approved an US$0.85 million TA grant for
Tarawa Sanitation Improvement in October
2009 and a supplementary of US$0.2 million
for the same TA in December 2010.
The strategy of the AsDB in Kiribati directly
supports
the
government's
Kiribati
Development Plan (KDP) 2008–11. Further,
AsDB’s approach is anchored in the mid-term
review of the Pacific Strategy, which put a
stronger emphasis on issues of supporting a
conducive environment for private sector
development, good governance, and capacity

development. Rapid population growth and
urban migration has left Kiribati with
overcrowded urban areas, and its most
pressing development challenges are social
and environmental concerns, including the
impacts of climate change, access to clean
water and sanitation, and the spread of
HIV/AIDS. AsDB supports the government’s
efforts to balance growth more evenly
throughout the country through TA for the
Integrated Land and Population Development
Program on Kiritimati Island. AsDB supports
also efforts to improve the government's
financial management through TA for
Economic Management and Public Sector
Reform recognizing the sizeable constraint
the poor performance of public enterprises is
placing on government ability to fund needed
goods and services.

the most affected area.
National Accounts: With PTFAC assistance,
GDP estimates have been significantly
improved. Three TA missions from STA took
place in January 2009 and 2010 and in April
2011 to improve national account data and
revised estimates through 2009. However,
further capacity building would be needed to
continue to improve the quality of GDP
estimates. So far, estimates are limited to
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at current and
constant 2006 prices, using the production
approach. There are no expenditure-based
GDP
estimates.
Also,
unemployment
indicators are not regularly available. PFTAC
has also recommended that the statistics
authorities work more closely with other
agencies (e.g., tax authorities, public
enterprises).
Price statistics: The monthly retail price index
(1996=100) is produced with a short lag
(about a month), based on a survey in the
capital (a national index is not available).
There are no producer, wholesale, or trade
price indices.
Government finance statistics: The budget
outcome is available with a lag of about a
year. Currently, a provisional budget outcome
for 2008 is available. There are
misclassifications in the current statistics,
which have been identified by PFTAC. Audited
financial statements of public enterprises are
not available.
Monetary statistics: The balance sheets of all
the financial institutions (Bank of Kiribati,
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Development Bank of Kiribati, Kiribati
Provident Fund, and Kiribati Insurance
Corporation) are available with lags, but the
consolidated balance sheet of the financial
sector is not available. Data on interest rates
are reported with a long lag.
Balance of payments: The quality of the data
has been improved with recent PFTAC
assistance. However, there still remain some
shortcomings: i) external statistics are
reported with a long delay (about a year or
more), ii) there are large errors and omissions
in some years, which appear to partly reflect
the underestimation of private transfers, iii)
and there are some inconsistencies between
the balance of payments data and budget
data. A PFTAC mission took place in April
2010. The mission revised the BOP estimates
up to 2007, and updating estimates to end
2009. As in the case of GDP data, PFTAC has
suggested the need for further statistical
capacity building.
Data Standards and Quality
Kiribati has been a participant in the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
2004.
No data ROSC are available.
Reporting to STA (Optional)
No data are currently reported to STA for
publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook, the Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook or in the IFS.

JOINT IMF/WORLD BANK DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS 20111
Approved By

Prepared By

Kenneth Kang and Thomas Dorsey (IMF)
Vikram Nehru and Jeffrey D. Lewis (WB)

The International Monetary Fund and
The World Bank

Kiribati continues to be at high risk of debt distress according to this new debt
sustainability analysis (DSA). Containing the risk of debt distress will require prudent
financing by continuing to secure grants to support the country’s large development
needs, fiscal consolidation, and stepping up the implementation of the structural reform
agenda to raise long-term growth.

____________________________
1

This DSA has been produced in consultation with the Asian Development Bank (AsDB). It is based on the

common standard LIC DSA framework. Under the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), Kiribati
is rated as a weak performer, and the DSA uses the indicative threshold indicators on the external public debt
for countries in this category: 30 percent for the present value (PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio; 100 percent for the
PV of debt-to exports ratio; 200 percent for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio; 15 percent for the debt serviceto-exports ratio; and 25 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio.

IDA’s recent decision to double the base

in an increased IDA envelope of an additional

incorporates an anticipated US$11million in
regional IDA funds for a regional aviation safety
investment; 3) improved economic prospects
over the next 2–3 years taking into account new
projects, including Tarawa’s port rehabilitation
financed with grants (US$45 million) and a fish
processing joint-venture; and 4) a slightly
improved fiscal outlook due to higher fishing
license fees following the introduction of an
auction scheme in 2010. In addition, this analysis
adopts the latest authorities’ balance of payment
(BOP) series revised with the assistance of Pacific
Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC).

The

outlook has improved compared to the previous
DSA, although risks to the outlook remain. Early
reading of 2010 data suggests that the recovery is
underway. The economy is estimated to have
grown by about 2 percent in 2010. The fiscal
deficit is estimated to have narrowed to 8 percent
of GDP in 2010 driven by stronger than
anticipated revenue, following the introduction of
a fisheries license auction scheme as well as some
temporary factors. Going forward, key public
projects—the rehabilitation of Tarawa’s road,

balance, after deteriorating initially, is projected
to improve somewhat in the longer term. The

Macroeconomic Assumptions Under the Baseline Scenario



GDP growth and population. Large
infrastructure investments supported by external
loans are expected to boost real growth to about
2–3½ percent in the medium term. Growth will
moderate to 1½ percent over the longer term.
Population growth (net of migration) is projected to
increase by 1.6 percent per year.

key infrastructure projects have occurred.
However, fiscal costs of climate change, assumed
to be roughly 1½ percent of GDP each year in the
long term will continue to put pressure on the
budget.1/ Fiscal deficits are expected to be
financed by a combination of RERF draw-downs
and external loans.





New loan disbursements are assumed to
amount to about US$50 million—27 percent of
GDP—over the next four years. This amount
includes lending on concessional terms from the
World Bank and non-concessional lending from
other development partners. These loans will
finance the rehabilitation of Tarawa’s main road
and airport, as well as projects to adapt to the
adverse impacts of climate change. Over the longer
term, additional concessional borrowing amounting
to US$10 million per year related to climate change
expenditure is assumed starting in 2015.


Aid flows and FDI. Aid flows are expected to
pick up over the medium term with main donors
increasing ODA allocations. In the long term, aid
flows decline slightly in terms of GDP, assuming
that the main donors (AusAID, NZAID, Japan, EU,
and Taiwan Province of China) do not reduce their
envelopes (Table 5). FDI will slowly increase over
the next twenty years, reflecting foreign equity
participation in fish processing projects.

The current account deficit is projected to
deteriorate in 2011, mainly reflecting large
imports related to infrastructure projects in the
pipeline. Over the medium and long term, the
balance is expected to improve compared to 2009
due to a narrowing fiscal deficit.


The average nominal return on the RERF
assets is projected at 5½ percent. The drawdown
from RERF (i.e., flow) each year equals the fiscal
deficit net of external financing. Under current
policies, the RERF balance is projected to decline
to 216 percent of GDP by 2030 (down from
350 percent of GDP in 2009).

The fiscal deficit after widening to

in the near term reflects the loan-financed increase
in infrastructure spending and a decline of fishing
license fees from 2010. Over the longer term, the
fiscal balance is projected to revert to historical
averages (about 12–13 percent of GDP) once the

1/ Public sector includes central government and nonfinancial public sector. Gross debt is used. Inlcudes AUD$34 million of public enterprise loans guaranteed by the government.
2/ Large residuals reflect RERF drawdowns, and capital transfers to the government.
3/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
4/ Revenues excluding grants.
5/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Large residuals reflect RERF drawdowns; government capital transfers; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows. Under this scenario
PV of debt reduces to zero due to increases in reserve assets.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the
shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Large residuals reflect RERF drawdowns; government capital transfers; and valuation adjustments. The size of residuals in 2011-2015 is close to baseline, but the composition has changed: drawdowns from RERF are smaller, but capital
transfers are larger due to increased grants.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Kiribati
On May 2, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Kiribati.1
Background

Kiribati has been affected by the global crisis through a fall in remittances and large decline
in the value of its wealth and pension funds—the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund
(RERF) and the Kiribati Provident Fund. The spike in food and fuel prices in 2008 has
already taken a toll on economic activity. Vulnerabilities to climate change, including
coastline erosion, have also worsened.
After two years of contraction, the economy recovered in the second half of 2010 and
inflation pressure dissipated. It is estimated to have grown by 1¾ percent for the year.
Despite a weather-related drop in copra production, private sector activity appears to have
picked up, especially in retail. Tourist arrivals rebounded by 20 percent compared to 2009,
although from a very low base. Despite the rise in world food and fuel prices, inflation has
bounced from 2008 crisis-highs into negative territory, reflecting the strong appreciation of
the Australian dollar, which is used as the domestic currency, and a decline in the world
price of rice. Credit growth in the overall economy declined in 2009 as economic activity
stalled. But it started to pick up in the second half of 2010 as the recovery gained traction.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Fiscal policy has supported the economy during the economic downturn. Copra subsidies
and civil servant wages have increased and have helped mitigate the impact of the output
contraction on households. The fiscal deficit bottomed out at 20 percent of GDP in 2008, but
narrowed substantially the following year as a result of expenditure compression and
improved tax collection, with the introduction of a withholding tax at the source in March
2009. However, the RERF suffered substantial losses, with its assets declining from
420 percent of GDP in 2007 to 350 percent of GDP in 2009.
In 2010, the fiscal position strengthened and budget planning improved. The estimated
fiscal deficit is 8 percent of GDP, down from 12½ percent in 2009. The narrowing deficit
reflects a large increase in fishing licenses fees, as a result of an auction scheme
introduced in September 2010. The authorities introduced a three-year budget framework
with the 2010 budget. Structural reform momentum, especially in privatizing SOEs gained
traction at end 2010.
The Development Bank of Kiribati’s (DBK) non-performing loans (NPLs) have been reduced
by 2 percentage points as a share of total loans in the last two years, but they remain high.
A new lending scheme was introduced by the Provident Fund in July 2010 to ease access
to credit.
Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors noted that the economy has recovered from the global crisis and that
growth in the next few years is expected to strengthen owing to key public infrastructure
projects financed by foreign assistance. Nevertheless, as a small island economy, Kiribati
faces many policy challenges and is also vulnerable to external shocks, particularly climate
change. A further escalation of food and fuel prices could result in higher inflation and erode
past gains in poverty reduction. Directors concurred that ensuring sustainable growth and
poverty reduction over the medium term and bolstering the economy’s resilience
necessitates timely implementation of comprehensive structural reforms.
Directors stressed the importance of preserving the real per capita value of the Revenue
Equalization Reserve Fund to ensure fiscal sustainability and intergenerational fairness.
Once key public projects in the pipeline are completed, the focus should shift to fiscal
consolidation, with a view to rebuilding fiscal space and addressing the long-term spending
pressures arising from climate change.
Directors commended the authorities for introducing a multi-year budget framework, which
should help in designing realistic fiscal plans. They looked forward to further strengthening

of the medium-term fiscal framework to facilitate public planning and help guard against procyclical policies.
Directors stressed that accelerating structural reforms, especially reforming the state-owned
enterprises and developing the private sector are critical to ensure sustainable growth and
reduce the drain on the budget. Welcoming the steps taken by the authorities to boost
competition, Directors called for further efforts toward enhancing the business climate and
increasing competition in the banking sector. Strengthening bank regulation and supervision
and introducing a new law to improve access to land and collateral recovery are also
important.
Directors noted the joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis and encouraged the
authorities to continue to secure grant financing to support the country’s large development
needs. They also noted that containing fiscal deficits will be essential for maintaining
external stability.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue improving the quality of macroeconomic
data.

Statement by Christopher Y. Legg, Executive Director for Kiribati
and Teea Tira, Advisor to Executive Director
May 2, 2011
The Kiribati authorities welcome and endorse the Staff’s frank and objective assessment of
Kiribati’s current economic conditions and its future outlook.
Managing the impact of increases in future food and fuel prices and pick-up in economic
activity from the upcoming major infrastructure investments will occupy the authorities over
the short term. The longer-term concern is achieving the increasing growth path amidst the
challenges posed by Kiribati remoteness, geographical dispersion, and climate change
effects. The authorities’ development and policy initiative directions are broadly consistent
with Staff’s advice.
Managing Near-term Pressures
In the near term, the authorities agree that fiscal consolidation will need to be managed with
the inflationary pressures from increases in food and fuel prices and the pickup in economic
activity from the upcoming major infrastructure investments.
A further escalation of fuel and food prices is a concern to the authorities, given the limited
policy instruments available to cushion the adverse impact on the population. Targeted
subsidies are not easy to implement, given the relatively low income differential. A
mechanism is currently in place that subsidizes the transportation cost of goods to the outer
islands aimed at equalizing the price of goods across the nation. The mechanism is basically
self-sustaining through a levy on all imports. However, the import levy rate has remained
constant since its introduction more than 10 years ago. With the recent hike in fuel prices
resulting in the increase in transportation costs, the import levy fund balance has been
consistently eroded. Recognizing the need to adequately manage the import levy in the face
of further hikes in fuel and food prices, the authorities welcome the grant assistance from the
World Bank towards this mechanism. They are also very appreciative of the assistance (both,
in-kind and financial) from their other development partners in cushioning the impact of the
fuel and food price hikes.
Urban poverty is a complex issue. Given the lack of policy instruments to address the impact
of hikes in the food and fuel prices, the authorities are very active in seeking employment
opportunities for their people in external labor markets. They agree with Staff that an
increase in civil servant wages is not an appropriate countercyclical policy measure, given its
permanent nature, as well as its potential spill-over effects to the nation as a whole. The
authorities have generally noted that the SOEs and the private sector usually follow the
trends in the civil service wages. Given the low level of competition, costs are then passed on
to the consumers, adding to inflation pressures. In this context the authorities are generally
very cautious about awarding increases in civil service wages. However, the authorities
consider that the recent increase in civil service wages in 2010 was long overdue, with the
last increase in 2006, and with real wages remaining below 2006 levels.

2
In terms of the drawdown from the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF), as an initial
step towards fiscal restraint, the authorities have set a cap on the drawdown from the RERF
for this fiscal year and three years forward at a nominal value of $15 million per annum. This
is a reduction of $5 million as compared to the average drawdown in prior years. This rule is
simple to implement and to manage. However, the authorities recognize the need to reduce
further the drawdown to preserve the value of the RERF as a buffer against external shocks
and for the benefit of future generations. In this context they are very appreciative of the
recent MCM TA on the RERF, with key components of the TA mission outcomes currently
under consideration for implementation. The authorities also expect to build on their current
collaboration with MCM in maximizing the use and value of the RERF. The authorities are
also committed to saving windfall earnings whenever possible.
Medium-term Fiscal Policy Settings
Over the medium term, the authorities agree that reining in the fiscal deficit will be crucial
once key public investments have been addressed. Drawdowns from the RERF will continue
to be anchored by the long-term objective of preserving the per capita value of the RERF.
As part of reining in the fiscal deficit, the authorities are pursuing improvements in revenue
collection and have requested technical assistance (TA) to support their tax reform agenda.
They have also taken steps to reduce the volatility of the fishing license revenues (the main
source of government income) and are working towards further maximizing returns from
their marine resources.
On the expenditure side, the authorities consider that an overall rationalization of government
operations and services will be necessary. This includes the SOE reforms currently in
progress. The authorities are also currently working on strengthening PFM and have initiated
a multi-year budget framework. However, the authorities are conscious that the robustness
and effectiveness of multi-year budgeting is constrained by the lack of a relevant macroeconomic policy framework. In this context the authorities have requested TA from PFTAC
on setting up a credible macro-economic policy framework that should be complemented
with strengthening the capacity for fiscal forecasting.
Lifting Sustainable Growth
To achieve a sustained growth path, the authorities underscore the importance of a vibrant
private sector as an engine of growth. The authorities also concur with the Staff that
productivity gains from infrastructure investments will prove transitory if progress in fiscal
and structural reforms lags. Overarching structural reforms will be key to addressing the
impediments to private sector growth as well as recognizing the benefits from the
infrastructure investments.
As part of the structural reform process, the SOE reform is in progress, with the privatization
of one SOE recently concluded. The recent successful conclusion of the privatization
exercise has given the authorities confidence to move forward with four more SOEs,
currently targeted for extensive reform measures. We consider this particularly noteworthy,

3
given that this is an election year with the authorities moving forward despite the political
challenges.
The authorities are also targeting measures that will be relatively easy to implement and at
the same time, will have a significant positive impact on the business environment, drawing
from successful initiatives around the region. In this context, the authorities have targeted
liberalization of the telecommunication sector with the World Bank’s assistance. They aim to
build on their success in such initiatives to address other impediments to private sector
development.
Other measures which the authorities are considering include streamlining the business startup process, addressing the long-standing land tenure issue, and improving households’ access
to credit. As part of improving access to credit, micro-credit schemes such as village banks
have been initiated with negative and positive experiences. The village banks appear to work
better in the rural areas whilst in the urban areas, credit consumers tend to look more to the
services of the mainstream financial institutions’, whose lending products include relatively
small scale loans.
The lending schemes offered by the Development Bank and the Kiribati Provident Fund are
initial steps to improve the urban households’ access to credit. However, the authorities agree
with Staff that such schemes need to be managed carefully. In this context the authorities
have requested TA from MCM to review the asset allocation of both, the Kiribati Provident
Fund (KPF) and the Kiribati Insurance Corporation, which will include a review of the
current credit schemes managed by the KPF. The authorities have also requested TA from
MCM to assist in formulating a financial supervision and regulation framework in the event
that further expansion of the financial sector, particularly through the Development Bank of
Kiribati (DBK) is possible.
Conclusion
The authorities are very appreciative of the lead taken by the Fund Mission Chief and her
team in strengthening collaboration with both, the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank, in particular in the context of Kiribati’s DSA. A tangible outcome has been the stance
taken by the World Bank to provide assistance through grants, as underlined in the recently
approved Kiribati Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) covering the period 2011 to 2014.
With limited fiscal space and balancing the need to preserve the per capita value of the
RERF, such assistance to address the infrastructure gaps is welcome. However, the
authorities are conscious of absorptive capacity constraints and will endeavor to ensure that
they work closely with their development partners to manage implementation of these
investment projects.
More generally, the authorities are well aware of the challenges that they face. They would
like to stress their commitment to moving the economy forward and greatly appreciate the
assistance from their development partners. In addition, the authorities would like to put on
record their appreciation of the constructive efforts of the mission chief and her team. They
look forward to maintaining this strong relationship as they navigate the challenges ahead.
