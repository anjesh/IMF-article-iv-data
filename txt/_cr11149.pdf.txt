EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Mozambique’s economic performance and outlook remain strong. Helped by appropriate
countercyclical policies, the authorities managed to keep economic growth buoyant during
the global crisis. The country is poised for an acceleration of economic growth over the
medium term, reflecting new mega-project activity in the natural resource sector and
stepped-up public investment.
Nonetheless, Mozambique faces important short- and medium-term policy challenges:


In the short run, fighting inflation is the authorities’ key policy priority. Headline
inflation surged in 2010, accompanied by a ratcheting up of core inflation. Since mid2010, the BM has tightened monetary policy decisively, and it intends to preserve this
policy stance in 2011. Fiscal policy has been supportive of disinflation as well, as the
authorities have shown spending restraint and been keeping the fiscal deficit in check,
including through a revised 2011 budget law. However, given the lower domestic
currency value of donor support in light of the appreciated exchange rate, the
government will need to take moderate recourse to bank financing during 2011,
which is not expected to crowd out private sector borrowing.



Over the medium term, against the backdrop of stagnant poverty reduction and
street riots last year, the authorities aim to adjust their growth strategy to make
it more inclusive. Based on extensive deliberations with all stakeholders, including
during a high-level conference on inclusive growth in February 2011, they have
adopted a new Poverty Reduction Strategy (PARP) that emphasizes creating
employment opportunities and continued human and social development. This
strategy will complement the authorities‘ efforts to foster economic growth through
stepped-up public investment and be embedded in their traditional policy focus on
safeguarding macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability.



Sustaining economic growth would benefit from the creation of additional fiscal
space, a larger contribution of the financial sector, and implementation of key
structural reforms. These efforts are embedded in the authorities‘ economic
program supported under the PSI.

Staff recommends the completion of the second review under the PSI. All but one
quantitative AC and all structural conditionality have been met. Staff supports the waiver for
the non-observance of the end-2010 AC on reserve money, since corrective action was taken,
and the proposed modifications to end-June 2011 AC in light of the authorities‘ revised
short-term policy objectives.

I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Mozambique’s economic performance remains strong, although economic
growth is somewhat weaker than expected. A downward revision in quarterly GDP
(mainly in agricultural production) suggests that the economy grew by
MEFP ¶2-4
6½ percent in 2010, supported by external demand. Growth remains one
of the highest in the region (Figures 1 to 3). This partially reflects the authorities' supportive
policy stance during the global crisis, consistent with past Fund policy advice (Box 1).

Box 1. Mozambique’s Implementation of Past Fund Policy Recommendations
Mozambique’s policies have been consistent with Fund recommendations over the past years.
The authorities and the staff generally agreed on the appropriate macroeconomic policy stance and
the focus of the structural reform agenda.
The 2009 Article IV discussions focused on ways to mitigate the adverse impact of the global
crisis and on strengthening the country’s growth prospects. Consistent with Fund policy advice,
the authorities took advantage of their strong policy buffers to ease fiscal and monetary policy to
support economic activity in the short run. As to exchange rate policy, they also began to pay more
attention to a broad basket of currencies, which resulted in larger volatility but effectively addressed
the previously observed overvaluation. With a more medium-term angle, the question of sustaining
Mozambique‘s growth momentum was tackled in the context of the design of the successor PSI
program, which placed considerable emphasis on addressing infrastructure bottlenecks and
implementing bold reforms to improve economic decision-making (e.g., through public financial
management (PFM), debt management, and investment planning) and boost financial sector
development and stability. However, as illustrated in Appendix II, the pace of structural reforms to
enhance competitiveness through improvements in the business environment has been slow.

2.
Inflation reached double digits. Average inflation in 2010, at 12¾ percent, was in
line with projections, but well above the authorities‘ initial objectives. End-of-period
inflation fell from 16½ percent at end-2010 to 13 percent in April 2011. However, core
inflation (excluding food and fuel) has been ratcheting upward since mid-2009 and remains
at 10 percent. Headline inflation was affected by exogenous factors such as global price
trends, as well as the initiated reduction of the fuel subsidy which triggered price increases
for gasoline and diesel of 42 and 21 percent, respectively, over the last 12 months. The rise in
core inflation mirrors the lingering effects of the accommodating monetary policy stance
during the global crisis and the pass-through of a sharply depreciating metical throughout
much of 2010. Inflation pressures have abated little in recent months despite the recent
appreciation of the metical and a tightening of macroeconomic policies.

Mozambique’s balance of payments strengthened in 2010. The current account
deficit narrowed more than expected. Notwithstanding weakening traditional exports,
buoyant mega-projects exports and a smaller-than-expected import bill put the current
account deficit (after grants) at 10½ percent of GDP. This, together with sustained net private
capital inflows, resulted in a comfortable import cover of reserves of close to 5 months.

private sector credit slowed down
markedly. Nonetheless, these policy actions were somewhat thwarted by unusually high
government spending in the third and fourth weeks of December. This lack of coordination
between the government and BM made it impossible for the BM to meet the end-year reserve
money program target for lack of time to sterilize this liquidity injection.
5.
Remarkably strong revenue collections and spending restraint helped contain
the fiscal deficit in 2010. Both the primary and overall fiscal deficits were 1 percent of GDP
or more below expectations and the prior year outcome, allowing the authorities to support
the BM‘s policy stance and comfortably meet the AC on net credit to the government (NCG).
Revenues surged by 2¼ percent of GDP relative to 2009, primarily thanks to a very strong
tax administration effort, reflecting the authorities‘ excellent track record in implementing
technical assistance (TA) advice. This helped offset a shortfall in donor resources, as the
appreciating exchange rate in the second half of the year lowered the local currency value of
foreign assistance and the late adoption of the annual budget law due to elections delayed
implementation of investment projects. However, the fuel subsidy (1½ percent of GDP)
partially crowded out priority spending.
II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS

The outlook for 2011 and beyond remains favorable. Real
MEFP ¶9
GDP growth is projected to accelerate from 7¼ percent in 2011 to
near 8 percent over the medium-term on account of new mega-project
activity and stepped-up public investment, bringing Mozambique back toward its pre-crisis
growth trajectory. Reflecting the authorities‘ policy priority to rein in inflation, the CPI is

Given banks‘ low excess reserves (equivalent to ½ percent of average reserve money in the second half of
2010), the tighter reserve requirement ratio significantly affected banks‘ liquidity and triggered a sharp
slowdown in credit growth. However, it also contributed 3½ percentage points to the 29 percent reserve money
growth rate in 2010.

projected to decline to single digits by end-2011 and reach the authorities‘ policy objective of
5 to 6 percent over the next two years. The current account deficit is expected to hover at
10 to 11 percent of GDP, as a rising import bill, including for food and fuel products, should
be broadly offset by strong exports, including from new coal mining mega-projects, allowing
the BM to build a cushion of international reserves covering 5 months of imports by 2016.

There are several risks to the economic outlook in the short run:



Inflation expectations may have become too entrenched already, which may lengthen
the time that the authorities need to maintain a tight macroeconomic policy stance,
with adverse implications on private sector activity and bank soundness and
profitability.



Continued high spillovers of international food and fuel prices may negatively affect
social stability, given the absence of significant safety nets; the September 2010 street
riots were triggered by rising food prices. Such spillovers may be exacerbated by
adverse exchange rate movements, such as from an appreciating rand as a result of
continued strong capital inflows to South Africa; the large neighbor accounts for
more than one-third of Mozambique‘s total trade and most imports of food products.



While staff projections on the coming online of new mega-projects are prudent, the
projects‘ smooth exports hinge on the authorities and investors rapidly addressing
bottlenecks in transportation infrastructure.

8.
Going forward, the largest risks to
economic and social development would
come from continued insufficient growth
dissemination and a slowdown in donor
support. As outlined below, the authorities
aim to create more inclusive growth over the
medium term. This partially hinges on
enhancing the contribution of mega-projects
to government revenue and safeguarding

donor support to help provide sufficient resources for addressing the country‘s development
needs in a sustainable way. While donor support has long been expected to gradually decline
after its peak during the global crisis, any abrupt withdrawal, possibly as a result of budget
problems in donor countries or flared-up governance concerns (see Box 1 in Country Report
No. 10/174), could likely not be offset by a parallel tapping of new revenues from the natural
resource sector. As a result, the authorities‘ envisaged ambitious reduction in poverty may
not materialize within the envisaged time frame.
III. SHORT-TERM CHALLENGE: FIGHTING INFLATION
9.
The authorities were adamant that tackling inflation was an immediate priority.
They recognized that to achieve single-digit inflation, continued monetary tightening was
needed until non-food and non-fuel inflation was brought down and
MEFP ¶10-13
inflation expectations were prevented from becoming further
entrenched. To that end, they considered it preferable to accelerate the tightening in the short
run and to adopt a more accommodating policy stance once core inflation had clearly abated
(Figure 4). While they saw the cost of a temporary slowdown of credit expansion which
could stifle private sector activity, they on balance expected a front-loaded and decisive
response to be more promising in curbing inflation expectations—a view that was shared by
the mission. In light of this, the BM emphasized its determination to strictly control reserve
money growth to about 14 percent in 2011, making full use of its available set of monetary
instruments.2 In addition, the March 2011 agreement on information sharing between the
Minister of Finance and the BM should considerably facilitate the predictability of budget
execution and the forecasting of liquidity in the banking system, thus supporting the intended
policy stance and helping avoid a repeat of the end-2010 lumpiness of spending that
complicated the BM‘s conduct of monetary policy.
10.
In its monetary policy implementation, the BM agreed that the exchange rate
should adjust freely but emphasized that exogenous factors could complicate the policy
stance. Staff analysis suggests that the current value of the real
MEFP ¶15
effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals,
following the depreciation of the metical during 2010 (see Appendix II).
The BM shared this analysis and stressed that it would continue to pay close attention to the
effective exchange rate vis-à-vis a broad basket of currencies, rather than focusing on
bilateral exchange rates. Nonetheless, it expressed concern that exchange rate volatility in
2010 had partially contributed to headline inflation and that other factors beyond its control,

2

While not an issue at present, the authorities nonetheless reiterated their objective of adopting an inflation
targeting (IT) framework over the medium term, supported by Fund TA. They acknowledged that further
conceptual work was needed to specify the targeted inflation rate, enhance its monitoring, understand the
monetary transmission mechanism, and strengthen monetary policy instruments so as to be able to steer
monetary conditions effectively. The mission emphasized the importance of a persuasive communication
strategy with the private sector prior to effectively adopting an IT framework.

such as capital inflows to neighboring South Africa, could affect bilateral exchange rates and
complicate efforts to rein in inflation. Based on last year‘s experience, the BM intended to
step up its smoothing of undue fluctuations in the relatively shallow foreign exchange market
going forward, yet without managing the exchange rate. It also expressed concern that a
further increase in international oil prices could undermine its efforts to safeguard NIR in
light of a sharply rising import bill.
11.
The authorities agreed that while monetary policy should take the lead, fiscal
policy should be supportive of disinflation as well (Figure 5). To this end, the government
has decided to tighten fiscal policy relative to earlier intentions for
MEFP ¶17
2011. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit, at about 6 ½ percent of
GDP, would be ½ percentage point lower than previously envisaged.
While the deficit would still widen compared with 2010, reflecting mainly the boost in public

that a tightening of fiscal policy
would support the disinflation effort and urged the authorities to go further in this regard,
including by applying part of any revenue overperformance to further reduce the
government‘s recourse to domestic financing.
12.
In late April, the government submitted a revised budget law to Parliament.
While curtailing the overall spending envelope, it envisages a reallocation from capital to
current spending. It also takes into account the lower domestic
MEFP ¶18
currency value of donor support in light of the appreciated exchange
rate, which necessitates a slightly higher NCG. The reallocations became
necessary to afford the costs of the fuel subsidy—including related to 2010, based on an
agreement signed with fuel importers in January 2011—and provide resources for the new
emergency measures to preserve social peace (see below). Recognizing the significant
burden on the budget, the government in late March announced the full yet gradual removal
of the fuel subsidy; fuel prices were raised in April for the first time in six months.

IV. MEDIUM-TERM CHALLENGE: BUILDING STABLE AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH
A. Creating Fiscal Space to Sustain Investment and Support Broad-Based Growth
13.
The authorities’ medium-term growth model to create the conditions for
sustainably raising economic growth and reducing poverty is built on significantly
stepping up public investment. To meet the country‘s development needs and close the
skills and infrastructure gaps, fiscal policy will aim at creating fiscal space through a
sustained revenue effort and increasing recourse to domestic and external borrowing,
including on nonconcessional terms (a cumulative US$900 million over the period of the
PSI). The new sources of fiscal space are expected to also offset the gradual decline in donor
resources from their peak during the global crisis.
A Prudent Start of Nonconcessional Borrowing
14.
The authorities reiterated that their investment strategy would be consistent
with macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. They were
MEFP ¶22
particularly mindful of the need to avoid any undue domestic demand
pressures in the current inflationary environment. Their decision to pursue a
very prudent approach in negotiating any nonconcessional borrowing (NCB) with potential
partners will help stretch somewhat the public investment profile compared to earlier
projections, without scaling back the overall multi-year investment envelope. Reflecting the
revised public investment and borrowing plans, a DSA update suggests that Mozambique
continues to face a low risk of debt distress (see Supplement 1).

15.
The mission welcomed the authorities’ prudence in tapping nonconcessional
resources and the progress made in stepping up debt management and investment
planning. To date, the authorities have signed two nonconcessional
MEFP ¶25
loans to finance infrastructure investment, using up only some one-

15
sixth of the overall NCB envelope under the program: (i) in December 2010, a loan from
China of US$66 million to modernize Maputo airport;3 and (ii) in April 2011, a loan from
Brazil on the construction of Nacala airport over US$80 million. In addition, they are making
good progress in modernizing their PFM, debt management, and project selection
procedures, in line with program commitments.4 All related structural conditionality was met,
although the technically challenging elaboration of a medium-term debt strategy (MTDS)
encountered a five-month delay. The mission and the authorities agreed to revisit the MTDS
later this year once other enhancements in debt management and project selection are being
fully applied and additional TA has been received.
A Need to Sustain the Revenue Effort
16.
The mission commended the authorities for the impressive increase in revenue
collections over the past five years but called for revenue diversification. Since 2005,
revenues have risen by more than 6½ percent of GDP, thanks to a determined tax
administration effort. However, staff projections suggest that the pace
MEFP ¶26-27
of further revenue increase would slow down going forward unless
other revenue sources could be tapped. The authorities agreed with this assessment. They
reiterated their intention to continue implementing their tax policy and administration
reforms consistent with Fund TA recommendations, which should allow Mozambique to
approach the average collections of peer countries in the SADC region.
17.
The authorities indicated that they would consider options to enhance revenues
from the natural resource sector. Compared to other resource-rich countries, minerals
revenues account for only a fraction of

The loan, denominated in RMB, has an estimated grant element of 31 percent, marginally below the minimum
concessionality of 35 percent. Staff‘s calculations reflect using the SDR-CIRR discount rate (as is usually the
case with loans denominated in the currency of other non-OECD countries). The authorities and China are
considering renegotiating the loan to make it fully concessional.
4

A new PEFA assessment was released in December 2010, confirming continued strong progress in enhancing
the PFM framework. The new assessment and the strong sub-CPIA rating could have a positive impact in the
next capacity assessment exercise under the Fund‘s debt limits policy.

Staff estimates that total taxes paid by companies in the mega-project and mining sector account for about
5 percent of their profits. If the 2007 fiscal regime was fully applied, companies in this sector would be subject
to royalty and income taxes and expected to pay an average rate of at least 30 percent on their profits.

16
debate has emerged in Mozambique on renegotiating existing contracts. The mission
recommended that the authorities adopt a prudent approach in this regard that balances the
interest to generate additional revenues for the budget with protecting
MEFP ¶28-29
Mozambique as a destination for foreign investment. It pointed to
experience from elsewhere (e.g., Peru, Tanzania) which suggested
aiming for an amicable agreement with existing investors by trying to convince them that
social peace and economic development in the country were in their interest as well. Should
such efforts be fruitful, the authorities would consider the creation of a stabilization fund to
smooth inter-temporal natural resource revenue flows and pro-growth spending over the long
term. In the meantime, Mozambique has taken all necessary steps to soon become a fullfledged member under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
B. Building Inclusive Growth
Stagnant Poverty Reduction
18.
Mozambique’s growth take-off has not been accompanied by economic
diversification nor by commensurate employment creation. Its productive and export
base has become increasingly concentrated—a reflection of the emergence of mega-projects
and weaknesses in the business environment that have prevented diversification of the
economy, in contrast with SSA peer countries.
19.
The September 2010 riots prompted the authorities to rethink their economic
growth strategy (see Country Report No. 10/375, Box 2). The unrest underlined the extreme
vulnerability of the urban poor to a price shock and the lack of social safety nets.
Furthermore, the third national household survey (2008/09) published in 2010 indicated that
the incidence of poverty had stagnated at 55 percent since 2003, after a decline from 69 percent in 1997.

In spite of the lack of poverty reduction, Mozambique’s performance with

A Strategy for Inclusive Growth
22.
Against this background, the authorities intend to broaden the country’s
development strategy to make economic growth more inclusive. A high-level conference
in Indy Village (Maputo) in February 2011 provided a forum to discuss ways for
Mozambique to achieve this objective (Box 2).
Box 2. Indy Village Seminar on Inclusive Growth
The three-day high-level conference took place in the aftermath of the September 2010 urban
riots and recent data evidence of stagnant poverty reduction. It was designed to allow the
Mozambican authorities to learn from international experience on how to adjust their growth model
and design the new poverty reduction strategy. It was organized by the authorities, in close
coordination with the World Bank, the Fund, the African Development Bank, and UK-DfID,
followed the blueprint of the successful 2010 Namaacha conference,1 and attracted some 100
participants from the authorities, civil society, private sector, donors, and academia.
The discussions concluded that economic growth in Mozambique would need to be sustained
over several more years, and be broader and more diverse, to become inclusive. Based on the
analysis of cross-country experiences, including from China and Brazil, this would need to entail a
structural transformation of the economy to allow the emergence of a more competitive and
diversified productive and export base and boost production and productivity in labor-intensive
sectors, with a special focus on agriculture. Participants also stressed the need to preserve
Mozambique‘s key assets, such as the strong track record of macroeconomic stability, and agreed
with the authorities‘ emphasis to boost public investment as a way to crowd in private sector
activity. It was also suggested to further improve the management of revenues from the country‘s
natural resources to support closing the infrastructure and skills gaps and expand social protection.
The conclusions were presented by Bank and Fund staff, and discussed, in a ministerial
meeting chaired by the Prime Minister. The conference received wide media coverage.

23.
The new Poverty Reduction Strategy (PARP) for 2011-14 was adopted in early
May 2011. It leaned heavily on the Indy Village seminar. Pending a
MEFP ¶5-7
more thorough joint staff assessment of the document with the World
Bank in the context of the third program review, the mission welcomed
the overall consistency of the PARP with the authorities‘ economic program under the PSI
and the appropriateness of its three main pillars to take up the challenge of growth
dissemination (Box 3). The mission underscored that the challenge will be in implementing
the strategy in a coordinated manner with all stakeholders.
Box 3. Action Plan for Reducing Poverty (PARP) 2011–14
The PARP is a concise document that establishes the achievement of inclusive growth as one
of its overarching objectives. Based on a candid assessment of the extent of poverty—including
uneven progress across regions, urban and rural districts, and genders—the authorities‘ ambition is
to reduce poverty incidence from 55 percent in 2009 to 42 percent in 2014.
The strategy is based on three interlinked main pillars that require extensive inter-ministerial
coordination:

(i)

Increased production and productivity for the agricultural and fisheries sectors;

(ii)

Promoting employment; and

(iii)

Human and social development.

The plan‘s three main pillars benefit from two supporting pillars focused on fostering good
governance and preserving macroeconomic stability. The PARP‘s objectives and indicators will be
reviewed, and if needed, updated annually under the Economic and Social Plan (PES) in light of
developments and in tandem with the implementation of underlying sectoral strategies.

Expanding Social Protection Systems
24.
The mission advised the authorities to leverage fiscal space to design sustainable
social protection systems. The authorities acknowledged that the fuel subsidy was illtargeted and fiscally unsustainable, as outlined above, and that there was
scope to replace the emergency subsidies introduced in the wake of
MEFP ¶8
the September 2010 unrest. To this end, they announced new basic
food and transport voucher programs for the urban poor, to be introduced from mid-2011
onwards. The mission, but also development partners and civil society, expressed concern
about the targeting, implementation constraints, and potential administrative cost of the
proposed voucher programs and recommended that the authorities seek outside expertise to
refine them or develop alternative measures. In this context, the mission emphasized that the
removal of the fuel subsidy created a unique opportunity to redirect public resources towards
perennial and better targeted social protection schemes, which could be gradually rolled out,
based on a joint costing pilot work involving various development partners, including the
Fund (Box 4). It underscored that Mozambique should seize this momentum to become a
―front runner‖ in sustainable social protection in Sub-Saharan Africa. The authorities
indicated that they would deepen the dialogue with relevant stakeholders on the various
options and decide around July 2011 on the future direction of basic social security.

19

Box 4. Social Protection in Mozambique
Social protection policy in Mozambique has received more impetus lately. The National
Strategy for Basic Social Security (ENSBB)—adopted in April 2010 and aiming at promoting an
integrated approach to social protection—and the Regulation for Basic Social Security (RBBS)—
approved in December 2009 and organizing social protection in four components (social transfers,
health, education, social inclusion through work)—were essential milestones towards establishing
a national social protection floor.
Nevertheless, the coverage of the population remains limited. The cornerstone of social
security is the Food Subsidy Program (PSA). Although the national coverage of this cash transfer
program has more than doubled since 2006 to 220,000 beneficiaries, the amount of transfer is low.
Overall, social protection programs cover only about 8 percent of poor households.
Strategic decisions to scale up social protection are expected to be taken by the Council of
Ministers in July 2011. The policy dialogue is being informed by a joint pilot exercise involving
the UN (including the ILO), the Bank, the Fund, and bilateral partners. The exercise includes (i) a
Bank-led review of existing social security programs and expenditure; (ii) a costing exercise led
by the ILO, focusing on public works programs, conditional cash transfers, and a universal
pension system; (iii) a Fund-led assessment of available fiscal space consistent with the
macroeconomic framework; and (iv) a simulation of the impact of policy options on the poverty
gap, led by UNICEF.

Fiscal Decentralization to Improve Spending Outcomes
25.
The authorities intend to strengthen the link between spending and outcomes
through a gradual decentralization policy (Box 5). They are following a two-pronged
approach: (i) a simple de-concentration of budget implementation to
MEFP ¶30
units of the central government posted in districts outside the capital,
which currently accounts for 30 percent of total spending; and (ii) a gradual devolution of
selected taxation and spending responsibilities to high-capacity municipalities (e.g.,
Maputo, Beira), which at present represents less than 1½ percent of total spending. The
authorities viewed their experience on both fronts positively and saw merit in further
increasing local involvement going forward, as they expected service delivery to improve.
26.
The mission welcomed these intentions but pointed to the need to further
develop capacity and monitoring standards before expanding such efforts on a larger
scale. Based on cross-country experience, it advocated that fiscal de-concentration, rather
than devolution, would be a sensible step forward in the current environment, given that
most municipalities in the vast territory do not yet have sufficient administrative capacity.
As such, de-concentration could be seen as a way to build this capacity before smaller
municipalities would be in a position to gradually take over authority for taxation and
spending responsibilities. In this context, important questions needed to be tackled, such as
on the feasibility of improving the effectiveness and transparency of existing vertical
transfer systems, the need for horizontal equalization of tax revenues (since some regions

20
may reap large dividends from the booming natural resource sector), and the elimination of
currently overlapping responsibilities between districts and municipalities.
Box 5. Fiscal Decentralization in Mozambique
Fiscal decentralization in Mozambique aims to (i) enhance participation of the local
population in the definition of spending priorities, (ii) strengthen administrative capacity at
the district and municipal level, and (iii) improve the link between spending and outcomes.
Early in the post-civil war period, the authorities favored devolution through municipalities, which
in 2002 was complemented by a de-concentration approach in view of the lack of capacity of most
municipalities in sparsely populated areas. Since some municipalities (e.g., Maputo, Beira) have
enhanced their capacity to manage key assets and services, a Law on Municipal Finance was
approved in January 2008 to enhance the framework of fiscal devolution. This law will be
complemented by an implementation strategy, expected to be approved in mid-2011.
Municipalities both collect revenues and benefit from central government transfers. They
directly collect various service fees and taxes, such as on property and vehicle registration. They
also benefit from central government transfers to finance current and capital expenditures. These
transfers are allocated across municipalities according to population and other criteria. On the
expenditure side, municipalities are responsible for road maintenance, public transportation, solid
waste collection, land management, and urban planning. Primary and secondary education and
basic public health are also executed locally but centrally managed by the central government.
Districts are the centerpiece of the de-concentration policy. They are assigned to manage the
local civil service, including primary school teachers, purchase goods and services for the
administration, and elaborate a local investment plan in consultation with local citizens. Although
districts are empowered to levy some taxes, in practice their budget relies almost exclusively on
transfers from the central government.

27.
The authorities broadly agreed with the mission’s reasoning. Nonetheless, they
intended to go ahead with the planned mid-2011 adoption of the implementation strategy
for the further devolution of responsibilities to municipalities. They indicated that the
strategy would take the need for adequate capacity standards into consideration. The
mission stressed the importance of the strategy also clearly spelling out minimum
requirements for internal and external controls and reporting mechanisms so as to minimize
fiscal risks and ensure value for money. Given the complexity of the tasks at hand, the
mission also encouraged the authorities to seek the expertise of development partners.
C. Strengthening the Financial Sector
28.
The authorities view the financial sector as an essential ingredient to sustain
growth. They are finalizing their 2011-20 Financial Sector Development Strategy which
follows up on the recommendations of the 2009 Financial Sector
MEFP ¶33-34
Assessment Program (FSAP) update. It includes a wide-ranging and
clearly sequenced action plan, covering ways to, among other things, enhance financial
inclusion, competition, consumer protection, and financial literacy. The mission
emphasized the key role that a more developed financial sector could play in diversifying
the investor base in Mozambique and promoting long-term growth.

21
29.
The banking sector appears to have withstood the global crisis reasonably well,
but continuous vigilance in banking supervision is needed. Against the backdrop of very
strong credit growth and high foreign ownership of domestic banks, system-wide indicators
suggest that profitability and liquidity, while abating over the past two years, remain at
reasonable levels. The capitalization of the banking sector remains comfortably above
required levels and compares well with the 2009 FSAP update. Stress tests prepared by
staff and shared with the authorities, however, signaled one undercapitalized medium-small
bank on which the authorities should act decisively, and a persistent high concentration risk
throughout the banking sector (Appendix IV).
30.
The mission cautioned that Mozambique’s specific provisioning rules hindered
cross-country comparison and could generate lags in the recording of non-performing
loans.6 Their level had remained low and stable at about 2 percent of gross loans while
claims on the private sector tripled during 2008–10. The authorities explained that they had
adopted a gradual approach and first focused on aligning their loan classification rules in
2009. The mission encouraged the authorities to align the remaining provisioning rules in
due course as well. It also noted that the welcome transition to the more risk-based Basel II
standards by 2014 should further consolidate domestic banks‘ capital base.
31.
The authorities were confident that their regulatory framework limits the
contagion risk which could stem from distressed foreign parent institutions. They saw
comfort in the recent decisions by foreign shareholders to increase the capital of the three
largest Mozambican banks, all of them majority foreign-owned. They also quoted existing
regulatory limitations on the concentration of domestic banks‘ deposits in parent banks, and
considered that the BM‘s formal authorization of credit lines from parent banks provided
additional safeguards against sudden withdrawals of liquidity. Staff urged the BM to
scrutinize intra-group liquidity flows, in particular with Portuguese parent banks, and to
seek participation in colleges of supervisors led by parent banks‘ supervisors.
32.
The mission welcomed the move towards completion of a banking crisis
resolution framework. In addition to the already implemented prompt corrective action
procedures and coordination with foreign supervisors (a structural benchmark for end-April
2011), the remaining modules of the plan will comprehend rules for closing and liquidating
banks, managing bidding processes for private sector takeovers, temporary public
ownership, and emergency liquidity assistance. As envisaged in the 2009 FSAP, the
government is also making progress in establishing, and securing the financing for, a
deposit insurance scheme. This set of reforms should enhance confidence in the banking
sector.

6

The provisioning regime differs from international standards insofar as provisions apply to past due
installments of a loan only, and not to the entire loan, and the speed of the classification into doubtful loans
depends on the residual maturity of a loan.

22
33.
Steps need to be taken for a more effective AML/CFT framework. While a
Financial Intelligence Unit (GIFIM) is being made operational and benefitting from donor
support, the amendment of the AML/CFT law, which would allow Mozambique to move
toward compliance with the 40+9 Recommendations of the FATF, is still awaiting
parliamentary approval. As Mozambique’s first AML/CFT Mutual Evaluation by the
Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG) has been
considered by the ESAAMLG Plenary in April 2011, the mission urged the authorities to
fully draw on the report‘s forthcoming final recommendations.
V. MOZAMBIQUE'S ECONOMIC PROGRAM UNDER THE PSI
34.
The PSI’s program design reflects the authorities’ policy priorities, as outlined
above. Its focus areas benefited from a consultative approach, such as through the two
conferences on Mozambique‘s economic challenges (Namaacha, March 2010) and
inclusive growth (Indy Village, February 2011), and are consistent with the new PARP.
35.
The program remains largely on track. The end-December 2010 AC on reserve
money was missed due to unexpectedly large government spending during the last two
weeks of the year which the BM had little time to sterilize. Since then, the authorities
succeeded in further decelerating reserve money growth, with a view to cutting it by half in
2011 relative to 2010. In addition, the end-2010 indicative floor on priority spending was
missed; while allocations for health and education were not affected, project spending in
infrastructure, agriculture, and rural development suffered. The shortfall was largely due to
a slower execution of externally-financed projects. In addition, while the domestic
investment component for priority spending was fully spent, domestic current priority
spending fell short of expectations, likely reflecting the higher costs of the fuel subsidy. The
authorities met all structural benchmarks through end-April, although the MTDS
experienced a longer (five-month) delay, as outlined above.
36.
The program’s focus remains broadly unchanged. Macroeconomic policies in
2011 are consistent with the objective to curb inflation, while supporting the country‘s
development needs over the medium term, as outlined above. Structural reforms will
continue to aim at building institutional capacity to shore up the authorities‘ policy
objectives and improve economic decision-making, covering improvements in tax policy
and administration, natural resource management, debt management, investment planning,
financial sector stability, and good governance. Given their macroeconomic relevance,
conditionality was set on measures related to the monitoring of the government wage bill,
finalization of the financial sector contingency plan, the adoption of an integrated
investment program, and the submission to Parliament of an ambitious package of reforms
to support the fight against corruption—a key measure to safeguard growth and donor
support.

23
37.
Some modifications to the quantitative program targets are proposed. First, as
advised in Country Report No. 10/375, the 2011 NCB ceiling reflects the unused amount
carried over from 2010 so as to support the authorities‘ development objectives. Second,
the end-June 2011 AC on reserve money, NIR, and NCG were adjusted according to the
authorities‘ short-term policy objectives and the end-2010 outcome. In particular, while the
targeted annual reserve money growth rate for 2011 remains at 14.3 percent, the reserve
money AC for end-June represents a tighter stance than previously envisaged, reflecting the
authorities‘ intention to frontload the disinflation process. By contrast, the NCG path
needed to be adjusted consistent with expected donor aid flows, taking into consideration
the lower domestic currency value of such assistance in light of the appreciated exchange
rate. And third, the end-June 2011 indicative floors on revenue and priority spending were
adjusted in light of the revised 2011 budget law and updated information on the expected
budget execution. Finally, the program now includes an adjuster for the reserve money AC
to neutralize the impact of changes in reserve requirements, given that commercial banks‘
maintain very limited excess reserves.
VI. EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS
38.
On May 20, 2011, the authorities accepted the obligations under Article VIII of
the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. They welcomed the cooperation with the Fund in
identifying existing exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices
MEFP ¶16
and in proposing ways to eliminate them. New foreign exchange
regulations have become effective, and the BM intends to adopt
implementation norms shortly to eliminate all of the remaining exchange restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The BM has also
taken formal decisions to eliminate existing multiple currency practices (see Supplement 2).
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Mozambique’s economic performance remains strong. The country was less
affected by the global crisis than many others on the continent. Helped by appropriate
countercyclical policies, it managed to keep economic growth buoyant and benefitted from
a quick recovery of its balance of payments.
40.
Although Mozambique is poised for sustained economic growth going forward,
significant challenges remain. In the short run, the authorities need to move decisively to
prevent inflation expectations from becoming entrenched. Their resolve to further tighten
fiscal and monetary policy in 2011 to bring about an early decline in core inflation is thus
welcome. However, the authorities should stand ready to tighten policies further should
inflation pressures persist. The recently signed information agreement between the
government and the BM should be conducive to enhancing the effectiveness of the policy
stance and strengthening the BM‘s ability to keep reserve money growth in line with the
programmed path.

24
41.
The authorities’ new PARP contains the right ingredients to allow more
Mozambicans to benefit from economic growth. The stagnation in income poverty
reduction and the September 2010 unrest are clear warning signals that Mozambique‘s
traditional growth model needs to be complemented by well-targeted efforts to broaden the
country‘s productive and export base and create employment opportunities. The challenge
will be in the implementation of the PARP, as extensive inter-ministerial coordination is
required and underlying sectoral strategies need to be aligned and, in some cases,
reinvigorated.
42.
In this context, the challenges on fiscal policy are expected to rise appreciably.
While development partners have accompanied Mozambique through the years with
generous financial support, such support is likely to have peaked. The authorities need to
carefully assess their options to create new fiscal space for their ambitious development
agenda. Their prudent first steps to borrow at nonconcessional terms bode well in this
regard and generate confidence that Mozambique‘s strong track record of macroeconomic
stability and debt sustainability will be preserved. But the true challenge will be to sustain
the strong tax administration effort and tap new revenue sources, including in particular
from the natural resource sector. The current public debate on this question should pave the
way for a sensible solution that balances Mozambique as a destination for foreign investors
and the need to have mega-projects provide a fair contribution to the country‘s
development.
43.
The authorities need to ensure that social protection systems are expanded
while becoming well-targeted and affordable. Staff welcomes the announcement to
continue with the gradual phase-out of the fuel subsidy which has been overly costly and
negatively affected Mozambique‘s traditionally strong prioritization of government
spending. However, care needs to be taken that those truly in need are supported by
efficient safety nets—for which adequate fiscal space should become available over time.
The authorities‘ plans to create food and transport vouchers carry some risks, especially
with respect to coverage and administrative obstacles and costs. The authorities are advised
to seek the expertise of development partners and other stakeholders to get any expansions
to the social safety net right, so as to truly target the most vulnerable and contain risks to
social peace.
44.
The banking system has shown resilience during the global crisis, but vigilance
is warranted in light of vulnerabilities. The authorities are urged to ensure adequate
capitalization of all banks, tackle the persistent concentration risk in banks‘ balance sheets,
and carefully monitor intra-group financial flows with parent banks abroad. While the
progress in establishing a banking crisis resolution framework is commendable, more
resolve needs to be shown to make the AML/CFT framework more effective, as a lack of
action could entail serious reputational risks detrimental to investment and growth and
endanger Mozambique‘s donor relations.

25
45.
The authorities’ acceptance of Article VIII status is welcome. They have shown
commendable diligence in removing existing exchange restrictions and potential multiple
currency practices.
46.
Based on the strong program performance, staff recommends completion of
the second review under the PSI. It also recommends the modification of the end-June
2011 AC and a waiver for the non-observance of the end-2010 AC on reserve money, since
corrective action was taken through the information sharing agreement between the
government and the BM.
47.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place within 24 months,
subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in program countries.

APPENDIX I: LETTER OF INTENT—MOZAMBIQUE
May 20, 2011
Mr. John Lipsky
Acting Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.

Dear Mr. Lipsky:
The Government of Mozambique requests the completion of the second review under the
Policy Support Instrument (PSI). In support of this request, we are transmitting the attached
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), which reviews implementation
of our economic program under the PSI and sets out the Government‘s objectives and
policies over the short and medium term.
The Government‘s economic program aims to maintain macroeconomic stability, promote
more inclusive growth through productive employment, and reduce poverty. The program is
consistent with the new Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PARP) for 2011-14, which the
Government formally adopted on May 3, 2011.
We met all quantitative assessment criteria (AC) through end-December 2010, except for the
one on reserve money. We also made strong progress in implementing our structural reform
program.
The Government believes that the policies outlined in the MEFP are adequate to achieve the
objectives of the PSI-supported program. We stand ready to take any additional measures
necessary to achieve our policy objectives. The Government will consult with the IMF—at
its own initiative or whenever the Managing Director requests such a consultation—should
revisions be contemplated regarding the policies contained in the attached MEFP. The
Government will provide the IMF with such information as the IMF may request to be able
to assess the progress made in implementing the economic and financial policies and
achieving the objectives of the program.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Manuel Chang
Minister of Finance

Governor
Bank of Mozambique

ATTACHMENT 1: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
May 20, 2011
1.
This updated MEFP (i) describes recent developments and performance under the
Government of Mozambique‘s economic program under the three-year Policy Support
Instrument (PSI) through April 2011; (ii) summarizes the Government‘s poverty reduction
strategy envisaged in the new PARP; and (iii) elaborates on macroeconomic policy and
structural reform intentions for 2011. It builds on the MEFPs underlying Mozambique‘s PSI
request and first review dated May 28, 2010 and November 8, 2010, respectively.
I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
2.
Mozambique continues to show resilience in a turbulent external economic
environment. Our economy has weathered the global financial crisis well. Real GDP
growth in 2010, at an estimated 6.6 percent, fell slightly below expectations but was one of
the highest in the region. Economic activity was broad-based and supported by strong global
demand. Higher megaproject exports offset the rising import bill related to surging fuel and
food prices and helped keep the current account deficit well below expectations. However,
the recent increases in food and fuel prices, through their secondary effects, prevented core
inflation from reversing its upward trend, despite our determined efforts to tighten monetary
and fiscal policies. Remarkably strong revenue collections were instrumental in containing
the primary domestic fiscal deficit to 3¼ percent of GDP, some 1 percent of GDP lower than
programmed, notwithstanding higher outlays for the fuel subsidy and emergency spending to
mitigate the impact of higher food prices on the poor.
3.
Amidst the difficult environment, Mozambique’s program performance remains
strong. All end-2010 quantitative AC have been met, except for reserve money. Quarterly
reserve money growth decelerated from 12½ percent in Q3 to 7¾ percent in Q4, above the
targeted Q4 growth rate of 5 percent. This was due, inter alia, to bunched Government
spending in mid-December 2010. Relative to prior years, this unusual spending pattern
reflected the delayed beginning of budget execution, since the 2010 budget was approved
only in May 2010 due to the formation of the new Government following the elections. This
in turn left the Bank of Mozambique (BM) with little time to counter the resulting monetary
expansion. With respect to the indicative target on priority spending, the Government
executed the domestic investment component in full, but fell short by MT 2.2 billion in
domestic current spending necessitated by the higher costs of the fuel subsidy. In addition,
the externally financed component fell short of the amounts included in the 2010 budget law,
mainly since investment projects in infrastructure and agriculture experienced delays. The
ACs on net international reserves (NIR) and net credit to the Government (NCG) were
comfortably met. As to non-concessional borrowing (NCB), we signed a nonconcessional
loan from China for revamping Maputo airport in the amount of US$66 million in December
2010, and from Brazil to rehabilitate Nacala airport in the amount of US$ 80 million in April
2011.

35
4.
Structural reforms are on track as well. All structural benchmarks through endApril have been met. However, the end-November 2010 benchmark on developing a
medium-term debt strategy (MTDS) was completed with a five-month delay, since the
conceptual work required more time. We have decided to continue working on the strategy
and revisit it later this year, once our enhancements in debt management and project selection
have been properly implemented and we have benefited from additional technical assistance.
We will submit a refined MTDS to the Council of Ministers for approval by mid-December
2011. With respect to the financial sector contingency plan, we have undertaken all necessary
steps under our control and are, as a final step, awaiting signature of a Memorandum of
Understanding with the South African bank supervisors to formalize the cooperation and
information sharing agreement.
II. POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY
5.
The new four-year PARP adopted by the Council of Ministers on May 3, 2011
demonstrates the Government’s commitment to more inclusive growth. It aims at
reducing poverty from 54.7 percent in 2009 to 42 percent by 2014 and rests on three main
pillars: (i) the increase in production and productivity in the labor-intensive sectors of
agriculture and fisheries; (ii) job creation through improvements in the business environment;
and (iii) human and social development, including through the significant expansion of social
protection systems. It will be embedded in two supporting pillars: (i) the maintenance of a
sound macroeconomic framework; and (ii) our strong commitment to good governance.
6.
The Government designed the PARP as a dynamic and flexible document. Its
objectives and indicators will be reviewed and, if needed, updated annually under the
Economic and Social Plan (PES) in light of national and international developments and in
tandem with the implementation of sectoral strategies, such as the forthcoming Agricultural
Reform Strategy, the Financial Sector Development Strategy, and the successor program to
the 2008-12 Strategy for the Improvement of the Business Environment in Mozambique. In all
of those efforts, the Government will pursue a coordinated approach across ministries,
recognizing the interlinkages across policy areas and institutions.
7.
The poverty reduction strategy complements the Government’s overall
approach to economic development. The PARP‘s strong focus on fostering social cohesion
will be conducive to supporting the Government‘s objective of promoting long-term
economic growth and complement the Government‘s intentions to further exploit
Mozambique‘s rich endowment of natural resources and rapidly developing public
infrastructure. In this context, the Government will continuously seek to create fiscal space,
including by improving the management of revenues from the natural resources sector so as
to help finance the closing of the infrastructure and skills gaps and the expansion of social
safety nets.
8.
The PARP aims at building sustainable social safety nets to help reduce poverty
while strengthening Mozambique’s long-term growth potential. It envisages a
comprehensive stocktaking of current social protection mechanisms to be carried under our

36
National Basic Social Security Strategy (ENSSB) and the Strategic Program for the
Reduction of Urban Poverty (PERPU). Several key undertakings are planned for the first half
of 2011 to support the evolving national policy dialogue, culminating in a Council of
Ministers meeting in July 2011 where key decisions regarding the future direction of basic
social security will be taken. These decisions will be informed by ongoing exercises,
supported by various development partners, such as a Public Expenditure Review in social
protection and a costing exercise around the different expansion options.
III. MACROECONOMIC POLICIES
A. Economic Objectives
9.
In spite of the challenging international environment, the Government foresees a
positive macroeconomic outlook for 2011. Economic growth could reach 7¼ percent in
2011 and over the medium term. Our strong efforts to arrest inflation expectations are
expected to decelerate headline inflation to single digits by end-2011, subject to international
food and fuel price developments, and to the Authorities‘ inflation objective of 6 percent
over the medium term. The external current account deficit (after grants) is set to stabilize
between 10 and 11 percent of GDP during the next few years, while the reserves coverage of
imports should approach 5 months on account of increasing private capital inflows, exports
from new megaprojects in the mining sector, and continued donor support.
B. Macroeconomic Policy Mix
10.
Arresting inflation expectations is the immediate priority for 2011. The BM will
sharply decelerate monetary expansion to unwind the monetary stimulus adopted in the wake
of the global crisis and to rein in second-round spillovers from international to domestic
prices. Fiscal policy will be supportive to the BM‘s efforts, with a further reduction of the
domestic primary deficit and limited recourse to domestic financing which should also help
avoid a crowding out of the private sector.
11.
Over the medium-term, consistent with the PARP, we will adhere to a policy
stance that supports economic development and allows more Mozambicans to directly
benefit from economic activity. These efforts will be embedded in a policy framework that
preserves macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, consistent with our strong track
record in this area. The envisaged policy stance will aim to be sufficiently tight to allow the
BM to achieve its inflation objectives. At the same time, it envisages stepping up investment
spending to close the skills and infrastructure gaps, which necessitates a temporary—albeit
smaller-than-previously expected—increase of the overall fiscal deficit to about 6 percent of
GDP during the program period. This increase partly reflects nonconcessional external
borrowing for investment projects that are expected to have a high economic return. Part of
the stepped-up investment program, but also of the intended expansion of social safety nets,
will also be financed by a continued strong revenue effort. As a result, we expect to be able
to stabilize the domestic primary deficit—our fiscal anchor—at around 3 to 3½ percent of
GDP during the period.

37
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
12.
The Authorities are determined to bringing inflation back to single digits from
2011 onwards. It is our objective to contain average inflation to 9½ percent in 2011 and
below 6 percent over the medium term. To this end, the BM will aim to decisively slow
down monetary expansion in the near term, building on our achievements in 2010 when
broad money (M3) growth decelerated by one-third and private sector credit growth by more
than half relative to the year before. We attribute this to the sharp increases in our key policy
rate, stepped-up foreign exchange and Treasury bill (BT) interventions, and, in particular, the
increased reserve requirements that effectively curtailed commercial banks‘ liquidity and
ability to extend loans.
13.
We will curtail reserve money growth to around 14 percent in 2011, after
29 percent in 2010. In this context, the BM will carefully monitor reserve money
developments so as to keep its main operational target on a trajectory that allows meeting the
quarterly program targets. In the process, it will rely on its full set of monetary policy
instruments to drain liquidity. Should second-round inflation pressures persist, the BM stands
ready to further tighten its monetary policy as needed.
14.
The BM intends to further strengthen its monetary policy operations framework
in line with technical assistance recommendations. This will be conducive to preparing its
move to an inflation targeting framework over time, improving open market operations,
developing financial markets, and enhancing the coordination with the government to
facilitate liquidity forecasting. Specifically:


Improving liquidity forecasting: The BM and the government will implement the
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed on March 25, 2011 on the exchange of
information.



Consolidating monetary policy instruments: By end-October 2011, the BM will
reduce the frequency of BT issues, concentrate the BT maturities, and make them
fungible in the interbank money market (MMI) module. The BM will consider in due
course publishing a BT issuance calendar providing information on auction frequency
for each maturity.

15.
Mozambique’s flexible exchange rate regime has served the country well and
remains appropriate. The BM will allow the exchange rate to adjust freely to evolving
patterns of trade and financial flows while further strengthening Mozambique‘s international
reserves, which are projected to approach 5 months of projected imports over the medium
term. Following the strong depreciation in 2010, current indications point toward the
exchange rate being broadly in line with fundamentals. The BM will continue to closely
monitor developments in the real effective exchange rate vis-à-vis a broad basket of
currencies.

38
16.
On May 20, 2011, we notified the Fund of our acceptance of the obligations
under Article VIII sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. New foreign
exchange regulations were issued on December 31, 2010. Consistent with recent Fund
technical assistance recommendations, the BM will issue shortly implementing guidelines
which provide further clarifications on procedural aspects of the foreign exchange
regulations so as to ensure that all previously existing exchange restrictions have effectively
been removed. On March 30, 2011, the BM adopted formal decisions to (i) limit potential
deviations between the exchange rates in the interbank market (MCI) and the exchange rate
used by the BM in its transactions with the government and the World Bank; and (ii)
temporarily discontinue its multiple price auction system which in any case had not been
used since 2009. The latter decision has been communicated to banks in writing and will
remain in effect until further notice.
D. Fiscal Policy
17.
Fiscal policy will aim to enable the Government’s development strategy, but in
the short run be geared toward supporting the BM’s monetary tightening to fight
inflation. To that effect, we will aim to limit the primary domestic fiscal deficit to 3 percent
of GDP in 2011, close to ¼ percent of GDP lower than initially projected. This entails that
NCG will be contained to ½ percent of GDP. The lower deficit target reflects prudence in
expenditure execution and continued buoyancy in revenue collections, which we expect to
reach MT 76.8 billion this year (20.2 percent of GDP), some MT 5 billion higher than the
projections underlying the November 2010 MEFP. The program‘s indicative revenue floor is
prudently set ½ percent of GDP below the ambitious objectives of the revised 2011 budget
law, but the Revenue Authority will be instructed to collect the full revenue target under the
revised budget law (20.7 percent of GDP).
18.
We have submitted a revised budget to parliament to reallocate expenditure
appropriations in line with changing spending priorities. In particular, we will increase
the budgetary ceiling for transfers and subsidies so as to accommodate the costs of past fuel
subsidies and new government programs to subsidize the consumption of food products and
urban transportation in light of continued high world prices. Consistent with the organic
budget law (SISTAFE 2002), an amendment in the planned revised budget law will
exceptionally authorize the government to reinforce outlays in the subsidies and transfers
budget category from contingency lines in other budgetary categories should adverse
circumstances arise.
19.
The revenue contingency instituted on April 1, 2011 through administrative
acts—Delegação de Competência sobre a Execução do Orcamento No. 4/2011 and
Circular Ministerial No. 01/GM-MF de 05/01/2011—remains in force. Consistent with
SISTAFE 2002, they limit budget execution to cautionary ceilings as long as revenue
collections remain uncertain. Accordingly, the following contingency ceilings relative to the
planned revised budget apply: (i) 90 percent for goods and services and other current
expenditures; (ii) 85 percent for civil service wages and transfers; and (iii) 90 percent for
domestically-financed capital spending.

39
20.
We consider the higher budgetary costs of previously adopted support measures
for fuel and food products as temporary and work toward their elimination. Over the
medium term, we intend to replace those measures by better targeted and fiscally sustainable
social protection measures that will benefit an increasingly large number of our citizens (see
Section II). To effectively contain the costs of the current subsidies, we will take the
following measures:


Gradually phasing out fuel subsidy during 2011: Following the subsidy removal for
mega projects and several groups of wholesale customers, the Government is
determined to gradually return to formula-based fuel price adjustments, provided that
our planned better-targeted support mechanisms for the more vulnerable segments of
the population can be implemented as planned (see below). It will seek an agreement
with fuel importers to compensate them for any interim losses that may be incurred,
considering various compensation options. Consistent with the agreement reached
with fuel importers in December 2010, the Government will settle any debt incurred
by fuel importers in 2010 by end-May 2011. Finally, it will continue to show the full
costs of any government outlays for fuel products in budget documents, in line with
best fiscal transparency principles.



Refining food and transport subsidies for the poor: The Government intends to
move away from generalized subsidies and design more targeted schemes. We plan to
establish from August 2011 onwards a transport voucher covering low-income
workers, students, and the elderly, and as of June 2011 a food voucher for eligible
citizens, covering basic food staples in an effort to replace the current rice and bread
subsidy. The Government will proceed with the ongoing efforts but also consider
possible options that could ensure appropriate coverage.

21.
Priority spending will be preserved despite the tight fiscal policy stance. Priority
spending will, for the time being, continue to be defined as under the 2006-10 PARPA
program categories, comprising spending in education, health, HIV/AIDS, infrastructure
development, agriculture, rural development, governance, and the judicial system. Such
spending is targeted from MT 49.2 billion in 2010 to MT 58 billion in 2011, allowing priority
spending to account for at least half of all spending. Upon completion of the programming
exercise later on in the year, priority spending will be redefined by capturing all spending
related to the new PARP‘s three main pillars (agriculture, job creation, and social and human
development) and supporting pillars (macroeconomic management and governance).
22.
Our investment priorities in transportation and energy infrastructure and
related program commitments, as specified in the November 2010 MEFP, remain valid.
We will continue our prudent approach in selecting projects, especially those that will be
financed with non-concessional resources. In our assessment, the temporary increase in the
overall fiscal deficit over the next few years will remain consistent with debt sustainability.
Our very gradual launch of the projects financed by those two external sources should be
conducive to containing inflation pressures in the short run.

40
23.
The government is determined to proceed gradually and prudently with the
implementation of the wage policy. The Government will assess in due course the findings
of the recently completed review of the implementation strategy of the new salary policy.
Current indications point to us being able to complete the enhancements to our electronic
payroll reporting system (e-FOLHA) and our civil servant master database record (e-CAF) in
line with the timeline specified in the November 2010 MEFP. The first monthly wage bill
report will be issued by end-July 2011, providing an overview of the civil servant population,
wage payments by sector and the impact of promotion and recruitment at all levels
(structural benchmark). The system will be further rolled out to three provincial
directorates by end-December 2011.

Improving the reporting, monitoring, and control of budget execution remains a
fiscal reform priority.


Expanding budget coverage: The roll-out of the e-SISTAFE budget execution
system will continue, with a view to completing it for all Government institutions
over the next few years. To this effect, the Government aims to adopt by endSeptember 2011 a roll-out plan for the remaining budgetary entities that are currently
not covered. To be cost effective, the Government will exclude entities from the rollout provided their spending and number of transactions fall below a threshold to be
defined. By end-December 2011, e-SISTAFE will cover 45 percent of all spending
and a total of 50 institutions.



Integrating all public finance IT systems: By end-August 2011, we will adopt an IT
master plan to support e-SISTAFE and other PFM components. It will provide a
medium-term road map on IT priorities, define basic operating and hardware
standards, and assess costs and risks associated with the expansion of electronic
budget execution processes.



Bringing state accounts in line with International Public Sector Accounting
Standards (IPSAS): Based on recent technical assistance, the Accounting Directorate
will undertake, by end-August 2011, an exercise to simulate IPSAS-compatible
account data for the 2010 State Account report, in parallel with the current format.
This will enhance accrual recording, integrate financial flows and stocks, and
incorporate public entities into the general government budget. We will analyze the
results of the exercise with a view to developing IPSAS-compliant national state
account presentation in the coming years.
B. Debt Management and Investment Planning

25.
We intend to maintain the reform momentum on debt management and
investment planning and aim to make the newly created framework operational. As
outlined above, our focus will be to launch the work of the new Debt Management

41
Committee (DMC) and Project Coordination Committee (PCC) to help us improve our
decision making in these areas.


Launching DMC and PCC: The DMC, an advisory body to ensure prudent
borrowing decisions, will meet quarterly, with its inaugural meeting scheduled for
end-June. The work plan aims to allow final approval of the MTDS by the Council of
Ministers by mid-December 2011. It also envisages that the DMC (i) establishes
procedures to ensure timely and regular data provision; (ii) supports the finalization
of the second Government Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), to be completed by
end-December 2011; (iii) reviews and advises on the first annual borrowing plan for
2012 (see below); and (iv) seeks donor support to develop domestic financial markets
from 2012 onwards.



Implementing new project selection processes: To strengthen capacity to identify
and implement high-potential investment projects, we will strictly implement the
newly adopted project selection protocol and standard evaluation template. The DMC
and PCC will each issue quarterly reports to the respective supervising minister,
providing a full overview on proposed projects and their evaluation, as well as their
implications for debt management. The first of these reports will be ready by endSeptember 2011.



Developing annual borrowing plan: The Government will develop, upon approval of
the budget law by parliament, an annual borrowing plan for all domestic borrowing
envisaged for 2012. The plan will be consistent with the Government‘s projected net
annual financing needs and the projected cash flow throughout the year.



Identifying pipeline of investment projects: The Integrated Investment Program will
be prepared, and approved by the Minister of Planning and Development by endDecember 2011, in consultation with the PCC (structural benchmark). The program
will list the government‘s priority investment projects for the next four years, and be
consistent with the broad strategic objectives outlined in the new PARP.
C. Tax Policy and Administration

26.
The Government is committed to a more business-friendly environment, and
simplifying our tax system is key to achieving this target. Based on the approved action
plan of priority measures (a completed structural benchmark for end-March 2011), we will
initially focus on further modernizing tax administration, particularly with the support of new
technologies. This will include the continued development and roll-out of customs and tax IT
systems (single window and e-Tax, respectively), which will generate strategic information
to guide subsequent tax policy reforms.
27.
The Government will step up efforts to improve tax compliance through
automated revenue collection and better monitoring of large taxpayers.


Facilitating tax payment through banks: By end-July 2011, the Ministry of Finance,
in coordination with the BM, will approve the Strategic Plan for Tax Payments

42
through Banks, defining a time-bound roll-out plan. This will allow real-time control
over budgetary resources thanks to the prompt channeling of revenues to the single
treasury account (CUT).


Strengthening Large Taxpayers Division (LTD – DCAT): The LTD´s coverage will
be expanded from 47 percent at end-2009 to 70 percent by end-2014, expecting to
reach 52 percent by the end-2011. To expand the coverage of LTD, we will integrate
the revenue collected by the Customs Directorate from the large taxpayers. Moreover,
in order to improve processes, enhance cooperation, and provide incentives for
voluntary compliance of large taxpayers, we will start in 2011 with the
implementation of the model of ―Taxpayer Manager,” assigning (initially) a number
of large taxpayers to one manager.



Lowering transaction costs for taxpayers: The Government intends to reduce, and
possibly eliminate, stamp tax obligations on administrative acts. A study to this effect
will be completed by end-December 2011, on which basis a proposal will be
formulated to take the legal reform forward in 2012.
D. Improving Natural Resource Management

28.
We expect to become a full-fledged EITI member soon while we will continue to
improve the transparency of natural resource revenues. In our view, we have completed
in a timely manner all formal requirements to acquire the EITI membership status. The
Government reiterates its commitment to the EITI objectives and work toward further
improving the intersectoral exchange of information so as to assure that timely and adequate
information is available on mega-projects in general, and on the extractive industry in
particular. Following the first EITI audit report recommendations, we intend to (i) assess and,
if necessary, improve procedures on the valuation of minerals; (ii) determine whether capital
gains can be considered as source of revenue, in line with best international practice; and (iii)
undertake a study to define a proper tax allowance regime that clearly differentiates between
depreciation and capital allowances in the context of fiscal mining regulation, with technical
assistance sought from the IMF.
29.
The Government will consider options to enhance revenues from the natural
resources sector. In tandem with the ongoing public debate, the Government will carefully
analyze the perspectives for potential renegotiation of fiscal benefits in the natural resources
sector with willing investors while safeguarding the stability of the business climate in
Mozambique. With a more medium-term objective, supported by technical assistance that is
being sought, the Government will assess the feasibility of creating a stabilization fund that
could accumulate revenues from Mozambique‘s rich minerals endowment and channel them
to targeted spending that would be smoothed over time and strengthen the country‘s longterm growth factors.
E. Fiscal Decentralization
30.
We intend to gradually implement our fiscal decentralization strategy to
enhance service delivery, improve the link between spending and social outcome, and

43
support economic development. Our strategy aims to initially transfer larger budget
proposal and execution responsibilities to decentralized levels of the central government
(Districtos, Provincias) in areas such as education, health, regional infrastructure, and for jobcreating projects. At the same time, the legal framework instituting the municipalities
(Autarchias) allows for the devolution of certain taxation and spending responsibilities to
incorporated cities and towns, including in the areas of urban transportation, basic health
services, primary education, and water management. After the encouraging experience in
places such as Maputo and Beira, we aim to further transfer responsibilities to other
interested municipalities while at the same time ensuring that there is minimum capacity to
manage those responsibilities and ensure proper internal controls.
F. Good Governance Framework
31.
The Government acknowledges the importance of ensuring adequate governance
standards in promoting the business environment and relations with development
partners. The Attorney General‘s Office approved the Strategic Plan for the Central Bureau
for the Fight against Corruption (GCCC) in January 2011. By end-July 2011, the
Government will submit to Parliament, a package of administrative reforms to support the
fight against corruption, including: (i) the revision of anti-corruption law 6/2004; (ii) the
revisions of laws 4/1990 and 7/1998 on the declaration of assets by government officials;
(iii) the revision of law 22/2007 reforming the organic law of the public sector, in particular
regarding the competencies of GCCC; and (iv) a new law to define and regulate conflict of
interest in the public service (structural benchmark). The legislation aims to conform with
the United Nations Convention on Anti-Corruption and ensure that the GCCC has legal
competencies for accusation of corruption-related crimes. The Government has begun
consulting with relevant stakeholders, such as civil society and the private and public sectors,
on the objectives and specifics of the legislation.
G. Reform of National Social Security Institute (INSS)
32.
We will continue to focus on strengthening the INSS’ finances and organization.
INSS will implement the new investment strategy that will be approved by end-May 2011
and solely aim to protect the interests of the beneficiaries. By end-September 2011, we will
publish the validated 2009 accounts. By end-2011, we will approve the actuarial study which
will be prepared based on audited accounts of 2004-08, with technical assistance support
from the ILO. INSS will continue to revamp its IT system that will support the reorganization
of human resources management. In 2012, we will seek to enhance coverage of the selfemployed and professionals, by integrating our database with the taxpayer information
maintained by the tax authorities.
V. FINANCIAL SECTOR POLICIES
33.
Financial sector development and stability is an essential ingredient for more
inclusive growth in Mozambique. Improving financial intermediation and access to credit
while safeguarding the soundness of the banking system remains a top priority. To this end,

44
benefitting from the February 2011 validation workshop with development partners, we will
finalize, by end-September 2011, the 2011-20 Financial Sector Development Strategy which
will include a wide-ranging and clearly sequenced action plan, covering ways to, among
other things, enhance financial inclusion, competition, consumer protection, and financial
literacy.
34.
We will continue to closely monitor the banking system to assure its continued
soundness. While commercial banks weathered the impact of the global crisis well and were
able to provide enterprises with financial resources as external funding became more scarce,
the high credit growth of the last two years and the close financial sector linkages with banks
abroad require the BM‘s focused attention. We intend to pursue the following reform efforts:


Finalizing financial sector contingency plan: The plan‘s remaining plan modules
will be adopted by end-November 2011. They include modules for (i) closing and
liquidating banks, (ii) managing bidding processes for private sector takeovers,
(iii) bailouts (i.e., taking banks into temporary public ownership), and (iv) emergency
liquidity assistance to promote rehabilitation of problem banks into viable institutions
(structural benchmark). Adoption of the remaining four modules will make the full
contingency plan effective.



Moving toward Basel II standards: With a view to strengthening the risk-based
approach to banking supervision, the BM will begin implementing the recently
adopted timetable for the migration to Basel II by 2014. The focus in 2011 will be on
training of staff.



Introducing deposit insurance: In light of the approval by the Council of Ministers‘
Decree on Deposit Insurance in November 2010, as envisaged in the 2009 FSAP, the
Government will seek to launch the system as soon as the necessary financing,
including from external sources and the budget, will be secured. In that event, the
Minister of Finance will approve the necessary regulations, and the Board members
of the related Executive Committee will be appointed.



Broadening electronic banking: As part of the plans to promote financial inclusion
to unserved areas and assure the safety and efficiency of the national payment system,
the BM and commercial banks are in the process of establishing the Sociedade
Interbancária de Serviços (SIMO), an interbank company that will be responsible for
processing all retail electronic transactions in a single platform in 2011 (pilot phase).
SIMO will also provide other interbank services, such as electronic funds transfer and
mobile banking.



Fighting money laundering: While the Financial Intelligence Unit (GIFIM) has been
made fully operational, the amendment of the AML-CFT law is still awaiting
parliamentary approval. Upon its approval, the BM will issue guidelines that would
allow Mozambique to move toward compliance with the 40+9 Recommendations of
the FATF. In order to ensure a consistent application of the AML-CFT framework
across the various regulators, the Government will establish, and appoint the
members of, the National AML Task Force by end-September 2011.

45
VI. PROGRAM MONITORING
35.

48
ATTACHMENT 2: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
May 20, 2011
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) defines the quantitative
assessment criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks on the basis of which the
implementation of the Fund-supported program under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) will
be monitored. In addition, the TMU establishes the terms and timeframe for transmitting the data
that will enable Fund staff to monitor program implementation.
I. DEFINITIONS
Net credit to the central government
2.
Net credit to the central government (NCG) by the banking system is defined as the
difference between the outstanding amount of bank credits to the central government and the
central government's deposits with the banking system, excluding deposits in project accounts
with the banking system, recapitalization bonds issued to the Bank of Mozambique (BM), and
proceeds from the signing fee for mineral resource exploration. Credits comprise bank loans,
advances to the central government and holdings of central government securities and
promissory notes. NCG will be calculated based on data from balance sheets of the monetary
authority and commercial banks as per the monetary survey. The limits on the change in NCG by
the banking system will be cumulative from end-December of the previous year.
3.
The central government encompasses all institutions whose revenue and expenditure are
included in the state budget (Orçamento do Estado): central government ministries, agencies,
and the administration of 11 provinces. Although local governments (43 municipalities or
autarquias) are not included in the definition because they are independent, the bulk of their
revenue is registered in the state budget as transfers to local governments.
Government revenue and financing
4.
Revenue is defined to include all receipts of the General Directorate of Tax (Direcção
Geral dos Impostos, DGI), the General Directorate of Customs (Direcção Geral das Alfândegas,
DGA), and nontax revenue, including certain own-generated revenues of districts and some line
ministries, as defined in the budget. Net receipts from privatization received by the National
Directorate of State Assets (Direcção Nacional do Património do Estado) and unrealized profits
transferred by the central bank to the treasury will not be considered as revenue (above the line)
and will be accounted for as other domestic financing (below the line).
5.
For the purpose of program monitoring, revenue is considered as collected at the time
when it is received by the relevant government collecting agencies, in cash or checks, or through
transfers into the respective bank account.
Priority social spending
6.
Priority social spending is based on the PARPA program categories. Accordingly, it will
include total spending in the following sectors: (i) education; (ii) health; (iii) HIV/AIDS;
(iv) infrastructure development; (v) agriculture; (vi) rural development; and (vii) governance and
judicial system.

49
Reserve money
7.
For the purposes of program monitoring reserve money is defined as the sum of currency
issued by the BM and commercial banks‘ holdings at the BM. The target is defined in terms of
the average of the daily end-of-day stocks in the month of the test date. The reserve money stock
will be monitored and reported by the BM.
Net international reserves
8.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the BM are defined as reserve assets minus reserve
liabilities. The BM‘s reserve assets include (a) monetary gold; (b) holdings of SDRs; (c) reserve
position at the IMF; (d) holdings of foreign exchange; and (e) claims on nonresidents, such as
deposits abroad (excluding the central government‘s savings accounts related to mineral resource
extraction concessions). Reserve assets exclude assets pledged or otherwise encumbered,
including but not limited to assets used as collateral or guarantee for a third–party external
liability (assets not readily available). The BM‘s reserve liabilities include: (a) all short-term
foreign exchange liabilities to nonresidents with original maturity of up to and including one
year; and (b) all liabilities to the IMF.
New nonconcessional external debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government,
the BM, and selected state-owned enterprises, with maturity of more than one year
9.
The ceiling on nonconcessional external debt applies to external debt contracted or
guaranteed by the central government, the BM, the Road Fund, the water authorities (FIPAG),
and the electricity company (EDM). It also applies to debt contracted by these three state-owned
enterprises from domestic banks or from other state-owned enterprises that is contractually interrelated to external nonconcessional loans.
10.
The ceiling applies to external debt with original maturity of one year or more and with a
grant element below 35 percent. The grant element is calculated using currency-specific discount
rates based on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
commercial interest reference rates in accordance with the annual Budget Law. The term ‗debt‘
will have the meaning set forth in Point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with
Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements adopted on August 3, 1979, as amended August
31, 2009, effective December 1, 2009. The concept of external debt is defined on the basis of the
residency of the creditor. The ceiling also applies to commitments contracted or guaranteed for
which value has not been received. This assessment criterion is defined cumulatively from the
beginning of the program and will be assessed on a continuous basis.
Stock of short-term external public debt outstanding
11.
The central government will not contract or guarantee external debt with original
maturity of less than one year. This assessment criterion applies not only to debt as defined in
Point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund
Arrangements adopted on August 3, 1979, as amended August 31, 2009, effective December 1,
2009, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received.
Excluded from this assessment criterion are short-term, import-related trade credits. This
assessment criterion will be assessed on a continuous basis.

50
External payments arrears
12.
The government undertakes not to incur payments arrears on external debt owed or
guaranteed by the central government, with the exception of external payments arrears arising
from government debt that is being renegotiated with creditors. This assessment criterion will be
assessed on a continuous basis.
Foreign program assistance
13.
Foreign program assistance is defined as grants and loans received by the Ministry of
Finance through BM accounts excluding those related to projects (Table 1).
Actual external debt service payments
14.
Actual external debt service payments are defined as cash payments on external debt
service obligations of the government and central bank, including obligations to Paris Club and
other bilateral creditors rescheduled under enhanced HIPC Initiative completion point terms,
multilateral creditors, and private creditors, but excluding obligations to the IMF (Table 1).
II. ADJUSTERS
Net international reserves
15.

The quantitative targets (floors) for net international reserves (NIR) will be adjusted:



downward by the shortfall in external program aid less debt service payments (up to
US$100 million), compared to the program baseline (Table 1);



downward/upward for any revision made to the end-year figures corresponding to the
previous year; and



downward to accommodate higher external outlays because of natural disasters, up to
US$20 million.

Net credit to central government
16.
The quantitative targets (ceilings) for net credit to the central government (NCG) will be
adjusted:


upward by the shortfall in the MT value of external program aid receipts less debt service
payments (up to the MT equivalent of US$100 million at exchange rates prevailing at the
respective test dates), compared to the program baseline (Table 1);



downward by privatization proceeds in excess of those envisaged in the program, unless
these proceeds are deposited in the government‘s savings accounts abroad;



downward (upward) for any increase (decrease) in domestic financing from the nonfinancial
private sector; and



upward to accommodate the higher locally-financed outlays because of natural disasters, up
to the MT equivalent of US$20 million at exchange rates prevailing at the respective test
dates.

51
Reserve money
17.
The quantitative target (ceiling) for reserve money will be adjusted upward by the excess
of the stock of currency in circulation above the level envisaged in the program. For
programming purposes, both the stocks of reserve money and currency in circulation are defined
in terms of the average of the daily end-of-day stocks in the month of the test date. The target
will be adjusted up to MT 500 million for end-March, end-June, and end-September and up to
MT 750 million for end-December (Table 1).
18.
The ceiling on reserve money for every test date will be adjusted downward/upward to
reflect decreases/increases in the legal reserve requirement on the liabilities in commercial
banks. The adjuster will be calculated as the change in the reserve requirement coefficient
multiplied by the amount of commercial banks‘ liabilities subject to reserve requirement,
considered at the end of the period of constitution of the required reserves prior to the change in
regulation.
III. DATA AND OTHER REPORTING
19.

The government will provide Fund staff with:



monthly and quarterly data needed to monitor program implementation in relation to the
program‘s quantitative targets and broader economic developments;



weekly updates of the daily data set out in Table 1;



weekly data set out in Table 4 of the TMU dated May 26, 2005;



monthly updates of the foreign exchange cash flow of the BM;



monthly data on government revenues (in detail according to the fiscal table) with a lag not
exceeding one month;



monthly information on the balance of government savings accounts abroad;



monthly data on domestic arrears;



monthly budget execution reports (that will also be published) with a time lag not exceeding
45 days;



monthly monetary survey data with a time lag not exceeding 30 days; and



monthly data on gross international reserves, with the composition by original currencies and
converted to US dollars at the actual exchange rates.

20.
The monetary survey made available by the BM will clearly identify donor-financed
project deposits (with a breakdown between foreign and domestic currency) included in net
credit to the government in both the central bank‘s and commercial banks‘ balance sheets.
21.
The government will provide Fund staff with documentation concerning external loan
agreements once these have been signed and become effective.

APPENDIX II: EXCHANGE RATE ASSESSMENT1
1.
In 2010, the metical depreciated against the currencies of major trading
partners. It depreciated by 24 percent against the dollar, 10 percent against the euro, and
26 percent against the rand. In 2010, the United States accounted for about 4 percent of total
trade, the Euro area for 32 percent, and South Africa for 41 percent. Relative to its peak in
November of 2008, the metical depreciated by 33 percent in real effective terms, mainly
driven by a 40 percent depreciation in nominal effective terms.
2.
A qualitative exchange rate assessment suggests that the value of the real
effective exchange rate is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals. Macroeconomic projections conditional on a constant real effective exchange rate indicate
sustainable balance of payments dynamics over the medium term. The current account deficit
is projected to stabilize at 10½ percent of GDP by 2015, while gross international reserves
should approach 5 months of imports. The current account deficit is primarily financed by
relatively stable long-term private capital inflows related to mega-project investments and
public capital inflows on concessional terms.
3.
A quantitative exchange rate assessment suggests a small undervaluation of the
REER, with a mid-point estimate of the three standard methodologies of 1.5 percent.2,3
Under the macroeconomic balance approach, the estimated current account norm of
−9 percent of GDP is below the projected underlying current account of −10.5 percent of
GDP, implying a slight overvaluation of 0.5 percent. Under the external sustainability
approach, the most recently observed NFA position of −80 percent of GDP implies a current
account norm of −9.5 percent of GDP, which translates into an undervaluation of 1 percent.
The equilibrium real exchange rate approach suggests an undervaluation of about 4 percent.
4.
While empirical findings suggest that the previous large overvaluation has been
corrected, external competitiveness remains a challenge in Mozambique (Figure 1). It
has shown little progress under various survey-based indicators, such as the Doing Business
and Global Competitiveness Index.
5.
These results suggest that restoring external price competitiveness is no longer a
pressing issue. Further improving external competitiveness rests on continuing efforts to
enhance institutions, infrastructure, the provision of health and education services, and on
determined steps to improve the business climate.

APPENDIX III: THE MACROECONOMICS OF INCLUSIVE GROWTH1
Notwithstanding Mozambique’s high real GDP growth over the last two decades, economic
growth has not been as pro-poor as in other countries with comparable high and sustainable
growth episodes. It has also become less pro-poor over time. Making economic growth more
inclusive in Mozambique will require policies and reforms to diversify the country’s
productive and export base and raise production and productivity in labor-intensive
industries, especially agriculture. These policies should be supported by improvements in the
macroeconomic management of natural resource wealth to help close the infrastructure and
skills gaps and expand social protection systems. Broader, well-targeted, and fiscally
sustainable social protection systems would also be crucial to mitigate the economic impact
of rising income inequality, thereby ensuring social cohesion and avoiding growth collapses.
I. WHAT IS INCLUSIVE GROWTH?
1.
Traditionally, the elements widely considered as being conducive to economic
growth are: 2 (i) macroeconomic stability, including moderate fiscal and current account
deficits, a low debt-to-GDP ratio, low and stable inflation, and adequate international reserve
levels; (ii) high investment and savings rates in physical and human capital; (iii) openness to
trade; (iv) enforcement of property rights and the rule of law; and (v) good governance.
2.
Inclusive growth goes beyond this concept. It is defined as growth that is sustained
over decades, is broad-based across economic sectors, creates productive employment
opportunities for the majority of the country‘s population, and reduces poverty noticeably.3
3.
As a result, in order for growth to be considered as inclusive, several additional
elements are needed: (i) high growth rates that are sustained for several years, through a
combination of more frequent and sustained growth accelerations and, importantly, by
avoiding growth collapses; (ii) the structural transformation of the economy, including the
diversification of output and exports, the transition from an agriculture-based to a
manufacturing- and services-based economy, and the migration within manufacturing and
services from low value-added to high value-added activities; (iii) productive employment,
defined as employment growth accompanied by productivity growth; (iv) significant
reduction in absolute poverty; 4 (iv) a propitious business environment or investment climate;

The inclusive growth definition is more in line with the absolute definition of pro-poor growth. Under the
absolute definition, growth is considered to be pro-poor as long as poor people benefit in absolute terms, as
reflected in some agreed measure of poverty (Ravallion and Chen, 2003). It is less in line with the relative
definition, whereby growth is pro-poor if, and only if, the incomes of poor people grow faster than those of the
population as a whole, i.e., inequality declines.

56
(v) efficient natural resource management; and (vi) equality of opportunity through
investments in education, health, and infrastructure.
II. HOW INCLUSIVE HAS GROWTH BEEN IN MOZAMBIQUE?
4.
Economic growth in Mozambique, despite its high rates, has not been as propoor as in other successful countries, and has become less pro-poor over time (Figure 1).


Mozambique‘s economic growth averaged 8 percent over the period 1995-2009, the
second highest among non fuel-exporting countries in the region. Real GDP per
capita almost doubled after 1992. This performance has been anchored on sound
macroeconomic management and structural reforms.



Poverty reduction has initially been significant. The poverty headcount fell from
69 percent in 1997 to 54 percent in 2003 as consumption per capita grew by a
cumulative 50 percent over the same period. Reduction in rural poverty was even
more pronounced, declining from 71 to 55 percent during the same period.



However significant, poverty reduction did not reach the magnitude observed in other
high-growth countries. Cross-country estimates of the elasticity of the headline
poverty rate with respect to the growth of real GDP per capita suggest an average
elasticity close to 0.20, which is only a fraction of that observed in countries like
China, Vietnam, and even Uganda.



Similarly, preliminary evidence from household survey data shows that over the
2002/03 to 2008/09 period, growth has not followed an inclusive or pro-poor pattern.
In particular, the growth incidence curve shows that households in the bottom three
deciles of the distribution of per-capita expenditure experienced absolute declines,
while the other seven deciles experienced positive growth. This sharply contrasts the
experience of other countries, such as China and especially Brazil, over the last three
to four decades.



Not only has growth in Mozambique been less pro-poor than in other successful
countries, but such pro-poor characteristics appear to be declining over time. With
growth remaining relatively high, this reflects stagnant poverty numbers. The latest
National Poverty Report (MPD-DNEAP, 2010) suggests that the poverty rate in 2008
has remained high and stagnant, at about 54 percent, with rural poverty increasing to
57 percent.

5.
Moreover, economic growth in Mozambique still needs to be sustained for
several more years, and be broader and more diverse, to become more inclusive.


In terms of the length of Mozambique‘s growth take-off which started around 1992, it
still needs to be sustained for several more decades to match successful growth cases.
Indeed, all the countries considered by the Growth Commission as successful cases of
inclusive development have sustained high growth rates for at least three decades.



Growth has not been accompanied by economic diversification either. Measured by
the Herfindahl-Hirschman index, Mozambique‘s export base has become increasingly
concentrated—a reflection of the emergence of megaprojects. This contrast with the
experience of countries like Uganda, which was able to successfully diversify its
exports notwithstanding its low level of initial GDP per capita, its protracted civil
conflict, and the fact that it is landlocked.

III. INCLUSIVE GROWTH STRATEGIES, POLICIES, AND REFORMS
6.
Mozambique needs to make greater progress towards more inclusive growth. In
particular, it needs to: (i) accelerate growth while avoiding growth collapses; (ii) diversify its
economy away from capital-intensive, low-value added products; (iii) increase production
and productivity in labor-intensive sectors, particularly in agriculture (Box 1); and (iv) promote equality of opportunities, by leveling the playing field among households and firms. All
these elements have proved fundamental elsewhere in order to sustain rapid poverty
reduction.
7.
In all these endeavors, Mozambique should preserve macroeconomic stability—
one of Mozambique’s key assets. Much of the post-1995 improvement in economic
performance in Mozambique is attributable to avoiding growth collapses. To a large extent,
this was the direct result of the implementation of policies and reforms to keep inflation low
and to achieve, and then preserve, debt sustainability.
8.
Country-specific growth opportunities and challenges will also play an
important role in inclusive growth strategies. In the case of Mozambique, geography and
geology matter. Mozambique is a coastal country and a neighbor of a large regional market:
South Africa. Promoting exports to better tap into regional and international markets has
proved a very successful strategy in other coastal developing countries, particularly those
with very small domestic markets.

59

Box 1 : Increasing Agricultural Production and Productivity in Mozambique1
Increasing agricultural production and productivity needs to assume central stage in
Mozambique’s inclusive growth strategy. It will be critical to foster pro-poor growth, as it
could create more productive and better-paid job opportunities for the 80 percent of the
Mozambican population living in rural areas, most of it locked in subsistence agriculture.
Productive gains in agriculture would also be a necessary condition for the structural
transformation of the economy, as it endows the surplus labor released from agricultural
activities with additional skills to facilitate the transition towards an industrialized economy
and eventually to a services-based economy (McCalla 2011). Mozambique is still in an early
phase of this transition. In fact, the share of the population employed in agriculture
experienced little change between 2002/03 and 2008/09, which suggests stagnant agricultural
productivity (Fox 2011).
Mozambique has great agricultural potential. Deninger (2011) estimates that
Mozambique is among the ten countries with the greatest unexploited farming potential.
Mozambique, along with other countries located in the African Guinea Savannah, also has
the right agro-climatic conditions for obtaining very high yields in the production of
important food staples, including cassava, corn, and rice, as well as cash crops such as sugar
and cotton (Morris 2011). A number of countries with similar agro-climatic and factor
endowments, such as Brazil and Thailand, have succeeded in getting agriculture going.
After having made agriculture more productive, Mozambique can further accelerate
the transition away from agriculture and into manufacturing and services, by:
(i) improving educational levels; (ii) enhancing the business environment, particularly in
labor-intensive sectors; (iii) supporting start-ups and improve productivity of the selfemployed; and (iv) increasing access to markets through better infrastructure (Fox 2011).
The experiences of Brazil and China show that agricultural productivity can be
improved through coordinated policies: first, through a combination of price liberalization
(e.g., dismantling of control prices and boards and elimination of export taxes) and
agricultural policies that move away from direct subsidies for certain products (e.g., wheat
flour in Mozambique) and towards the provision of public goods such as basic research,
infrastructure, and agricultural extension services (de França 2011, Li 2011); and second,
through subsidized credit policies in the form of credit guarantees (Morris 2011). In the case
of Mozambique, it is also particularly important to have a clear definition of property rights,
akin to China‘s reform in the late 1970s which set the stage for subsequent increases in
agricultural productivity.

9.
However, to foster inclusive growth, export promotion will need to be tackled
through export diversification strategies that boost productivity and, hence,
competiveness in labor-intensive sectors. Countries that have successfully implemented
this strategy have done so by: (i) stepping up public investment to remove infrastructure and
skills gaps; (ii) accelerating regulatory reforms to improve the business environment;
(iii) improving access to finance to small and medium-sized enterprises; and (iv) optimizing
market access and regional integration. Leadership and intergovernmental coordination has
also proved to be a critical element. In most successful cases, the President or the Prime
Minister led the implementation effort, helped by a small office directly accountable to
him/her, with coordination powers.
10.
Export diversification needs to be supported by a strategy that improves the
management of natural resources. Mozambique is a resource-rich country, with an
abundance of minerals, gas, coal, and now even oil. To avoid the resource curse,
Mozambique will need to sustain the reform momentum to ensure that natural resources are
managed well. It would be particularly important to avoid the ―resource curse‖ by setting the
right institutions at an early stage. Elements of a successful strategy for mineral revenue
management include: (i) getting a fair price for mineral resources through appropriate
contracts, concessions, and taxation schemes; (ii) improving revenue transparency, among
other things by acceding to the EITI on a timely basis; (iii) establishing special fiscal
institutions to smooth revenues across the economic cycle, thus avoiding the typical boombust cycles; (iv) continuing to improve public financial management systems to ensure that
spending is properly and efficiently allocated; and (v) an appropriate monetary and exchange
rate policy that avoids the emergence of Dutch disease and suffocating traditional export
sectors.
11.
Broader, well-targeted, and fiscally sustainable social protection systems would
also be crucial to prevent income inequality from rising, thereby ensuring social
cohesion and avoiding growth collapses.5 As income inequality rises, so does the risk of
social conflict—as the recent events in the Middle East provide a topical reminder of. One
way of accelerating poverty reduction and mitigating the effects of increasing inequality is
through the introduction of a targeted social safety net, such as conditional cash transfer
schemes, such as Bolsa Familia in Brazil, or public work programs, such as those in India
and Ethiopia. These programs have a relatively low fiscal cost and have been shown to
positively affect labor productivity.
18

5

Drawing on previous work showing that countries with more equal income distributions tend to have
significantly longer growth spells and less frequent growth collapses, Berg and Ostry (2011) suggest welltargeted subsidies and social protection measures as successful policies that could be capable of improving
income distribution without undermining incentives.

APPENDIX IV. STRESS-TESTING OF THE BANKING SECTOR1
Stress-testing undertaken during Mozambique’s 2009 FSAP update based on September 2008
data was replicated with September 2010 data. The results do not vary significantly (see
Summary Table): The level of capitalization appears sufficient to withstand plausible
macroeconomic shocks; the concentration of loans on single borrowers remains a major
vulnerability; the direct exchange rate risk on banks’ capitalization is likely to be limited; and
liquidity conditions have somewhat tightened over the recent period.
1.
The Mozambican banking system has recently expanded and remains highly
concentrated. The number of banks operating in the market has increased from 14 in 2008 to
16 at end-2010. The size of the sector‘s assets has been growing rapidly as a result of the
expansion of the three largest banks reflecting strong credit growth (from 18.7 percent of GDP
at end-2008 to 28.2 percent of GDP at end-2010). The concentration of the sector has remained
very high: The three (four) largest banks, all foreign-owned, account for about 80 (90) percent
of the system‘s assets.
2.
The sensitivity tests broadly used the same methodology as for the 2009 FSAP
update. The stress tests assume uniform shocks. In particular, new nonperforming loans (NPLs)
stemming from the shocks are presumed fully provisioned and reducing the regulatory capital in
due proportion. Capital adequacy ratios (CARs) before shocks are corrected on the basis of the
following lump provisioning rate on existing loans: 1 percent on performing loans, 33 percent
on nonperforming loans, and 100 percent on losses.2 The macro financial shock of a drop in
exports, foreign aid, and FDI used the same elasticity coefficient of -3 to estimate the effect of a
GDP growth decline on NPLs. The whole exercise excludes an outlier undercapitalized
medium-sized bank on which the authorities should take corrective action.
3.
The banking system appears similarly resilient to a large shock on external sources
of growth. A large shock combining a 25 percent decline in real export volumes, foreign aid
and private FDI, causing real GDP growth to decline by 5.3 percentage points, would lead to
moderate decreases in CARs. The results suggest that the top three banks would better
withstand the suggested external shocks than medium-small banks.
4.
Concentration on the largest exposures remains a major risk to banks’ solvency.
Should each bank‘s largest borrower default, the largest banks‘ and the system-wide capital
adequacy ratio could be jeopardized. This is because primary borrowers‘ risks account for about
65 percent of banks‘ regulatory capital on average. Sector or industry-specific shocks were not
simulated in the absence of detailed information on large exposures.

Absent recent data, the results and analysis do not reflect off-balance sheet exposures.

5.
Shocks on balance-sheet foreign exchange open positions still suggest a limited
impact on banks’ capitalization. Most banks reported a moderate and positive net open
foreign exchange position, thereby benefiting from potential depreciation of the domestic
currency. The regulatory requirement to ex ante provision 50 percent of foreign exchange loans
to non-exporters circumscribes FX-related credit risks on unhedged borrowers. The risk of a
potential currency mismatch should nevertheless be monitored as, system-wide, foreign
currency deposits largely exceed foreign currency loans.
6.
Liquidity shocks would have a more pronounced effect on the largest banks.
Liquidity ratios have generally decreased over the past two years, partly reflecting strong credit
growth. The largest banks would be more vulnerable to a simulated impact of a 30 percent drop
in all deposits and 20 percent drop in demand deposits. Generally, though, as the interbank
market remains shallow (domestic interbank gross credit is very limited), direct interbank
contagion is unlikely.

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE
Joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis - Update
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Roger Nord and Dominique Desruelle (IMF)
and Marcelo Guigale and Jeffrey Lewis (World Bank)
May 24, 2011
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) updates the joint IMF/IDA DSA from May 27, 2010
reflecting the most recent macroeconomic developments.1 Its main results indicate that
Mozambique remains at a low risk of debt distress.2 In line with the previous DSA, the
government’s plans to temporarily increase public investment partially financed by external
borrowing on nonconcessional terms still calls for caution and resolve to improve debt
management capacity. As public debt is largely external, the evolution of public debt
indicators mirrors that of external debt.
I. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
1.
This DSA is consistent with the macroeconomic framework outlined in the Staff
Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation and Second Review under the Policy
Support Instrument. Compared to the previous DSA,3 this update includes:
a. A revised macroeconomic framework, including in particular lower fiscal and current
account deficits over the medium term. Fiscal performance has surpassed
expectations on account of a sustained revenue administration effort, which is likely
to continue. The external accounts are expected to benefit from buoyant mega-project

1

In line with the 2010 Staff Guidance Note, a full joint LIC DSA is expected to be prepared once every three
years for PRGT-eligible IDA-only countries. In between, short annual updates are expected to be produced
unless macroeconomic conditions since the last full DSA have significantly changed. See: ―Staff Guidance Note
on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries‖
(IMF/SM/10/16 and IDA/ SecM2010-0029)
2
The DSA presented in this document is based on the standard low-income countries (LIC) DSA framework.
See ―Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Further Considerations on an Operational Framework,
Policy Implications‖ (IMF/SM/05/109 and IDA/SECM2004/0629, 9/10/04)

exports, which should more than offset the rising import bill related to surging global
food and fuel prices.
b. Updated debt stocks. The current DSA is based on the stock of debt as of end-2010,
while the previous one was based on the stock of debt as of end-2009.
c. A revised public investment profile reflecting a slower recourse to nonconcessional
external borrowing (NCB) than projected in the past.4 This DSA update still assumes
the full use of the US$900 million NCB ceiling over the three-year program, but
projects a slightly slower pace of disbursements. Disbursements under the Portuguese
credit line have also been updated, in line with current developments.
d. Revised grant financing projections, reflecting a lower grant component in external
financing going forward.

The authorities have signed two nonconcessional loans to date: (i) in December 2010, a loan from China
amounting to US$66 million to modernize Maputo airport; and (ii) in April 2011, a loan from Brazil for the
construction of Nacala airport over US$80 million.

II. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
2.
Under the baseline scenario, all debt indicators remain well below their
respective thresholds, including in the longer term (Table 1a and Figure 1). However, the
debt indicators rise significantly towards their respective thresholds over the next five years,
as the authorities step up their borrowing to address the country‘s infrastructure gap. Stress
tests reveal that Mozambique‘s external debt is vulnerable to a one-time depreciation of the
exchange rate and an exports shock.5
3.
The debt sustainability indicators are also sensitive to a recurrence of past
macroeconomic performance. However, basing the analysis solely on historical trends
(scenario A1) does not take into account the significant structural changes in the
Mozambican economy in the post-civil war period and the considerable improvements in the
macroeconomic environment under successive Fund-supported programs, all of which should
lessen the likelihood of a repeat of the past economic performance. Among other things,
there was a shift in the structure of the economy, as large private capital inflows in the early
years of the decade in the natural resources sector subsequently supported a surge in exports
and a sharp fall in the current account deficit.
4.
In a scenario under which nonconcessional resources are not used productively,
external debt indicators would deteriorate, but remain below their respective
thresholds. The customized high investment-low growth scenario assumes that foreign
financing and related spending would remain unchanged relative to the baseline in nominal
terms. However, it assumes a much lower rate of return of the public investment projects
compared to the baseline (and therefore a much lower impact on GDP growth over the
projection period).
III. PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
5.
The evolution of the public debt indicators (including domestic debt) mirrors
that of the external indicators because of the predominance of external debt
(Table 2 and Figure 2). The medium-term increase in public debt reflects the temporary surge
in public investment financed by external borrowing on nonconcessional terms. However,
over the longer term, the public debt stock projections also include a marginal increase in
domestic debt from about 3 percent of GDP at end-2010 to 4 percent of GDP in 2031.6

5

In last year‘s DSA, the standard export shock was tailored to capture the historical volatility over the past two
decades of prices of aluminum, which accounts for roughly half of Mozambique‘s export proceeds. The current
export shock reflects the same modification.
6

This should not affect the availability of credit to the private sector.

4
VI. CONCLUSIONS
6.
Mozambique continues to face a low risk of debt distress. Its external debt levels
are expected to remain below their indicative thresholds for debt distress. However, the
government‘s plans to temporarily increase public investment financed by external
borrowing on nonconcessional terms, will noticeably increase debt vulnerability, as debt
ratios under the stress tests approach, and in some instances temporarily and marginally
exceed, the relevant thresholds. Although Mozambique‘s public debt is expected to decline
beyond the medium term, stress tests suggest vulnerability, mirroring the large share of
external debt in total debt. However, the authorities‘ commitments under the current PSI,
including the continued pursuit of prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms to
boost their debt management capacity, should be conducive to containing debt
vulnerabilities.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt. Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ?(1+g)]/(1+g+?+g?) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ? = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
7/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ The stress test A2 (borrowing in less concessional terms) has not been included in this case (in line with the 2010 DSA). Given the commercial financing terms already included in
the
baseline for the investment projects, this scenario would yield unrealistic results, as marginal borrowing under this shock is calculated on the average terms of new borrowing; therefore
assuming harsher terms than Mozambique would actually face in the need to cover a financing gap.
2/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

Safeguards assessment
An update safeguards assessment of the Bank of Mozambique (BM) was completed on
January 11, 2010 for the ESF. The assessment found improvements in financial reporting
practices following the implementation of IFRS. It noted vulnerabilities in the oversight
mechanism for external and internal auditing, controls, financial reporting, and in the BM‘s
legal structure. It recommended that the BM commission an external quality assurance
review of the internal audit function. Staff will follow-up on progress in implementing the
assessment‘s recommendations.
Exchange arrangement
Mozambique has a de jure and de facto floating exchange rate arrangement. The exchange
rate is largely determined in the interbank foreign exchange market (MCI). The BM regularly
intervenes in the market to smooth seasonal fluctuations, provide foreign exchange liquidity
received by the government in the form of aid, and sterilize domestic liquidity as part of its
monetary policy operations.
On May 20, 2011, Mozambique accepted its obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4 of the Fund‘s Articles of Agreement. This process benefited from an Article VIII
mission by LEG and PDR in March 2004, a follow-up mission to conduct the jurisdictional
review of the foreign exchange system led by LEG and MCM in September 2010, and a
number of video-conferences and bilateral exchanges between the authorities, and LEG and
MCM from October 2010 to May 2011. A new foreign exchange law—―Foreign Exchange
Law‖ Law No. 11/2009—came into effect on March 11, 2009. A new foreign exchange
regulation to implement the foreign exchange law—the ―Regulation for the Foreign
Exchange Law‖ (the ―Regulation‖) (Decreto No. 83/2010)—was issued on December 31,
2010. The Regulation, in conjunction with the implementing norms to be issued shortly by
the BM, is intended to fully remove the existing exchange restrictions subject to Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund‘s Articles of Agreement arising from: (i) the discretionary
prior approval for remittances of family living expenses; (ii) the authorization for the
purchase of foreign exchange in excess of US$5,000 for certain transactions; (iii) the
prohibition of advance payments for the import of goods; (iv) the prohibition of advance
payments for services; and (v) the prohibition of the conversion of balances of nonresidents‘
domestic currency accounts into foreign currency or transfer abroad.
The 2010 LEG/MCM mission also identified two multiple currency practices (MCP). The
MCPs arise from: (i) potential deviations between the rate used by the Bank of Mozambique
in its transactions with the government and the World Bank and the exchange rate in the
interbank market (MCI); and (ii) the multiple price foreign exchange auction system. With
respect to the MCP arising from potential deviations between the rate used by the BM in its
transactions with the government and the World Bank, on March 30, 2011, the BM adopted a
formal decision to limit potential deviations between the exchange rates in the interbank
market and the exchange rate used by the BM in its foreign exchange transactions with the
government and the World Bank, with a view of eliminating the MCP. The notifications to
the affected parties will be issued in due course, and the new practice will be implemented as
soon as the necessary technical conditions will be in place. The MCP arising from the
multiple price foreign exchange auction system has been removed effective April 27, 2011
through the adoption of a new regulation on the interbank exchange market (Aviso

5
nº2/GBM/2011), temporarily discontinuing the previous multiple price auction arrangement,
which in any case had not been used since 2009.
AML-CFT framework
A Financial Intelligence Unit (GIFIM) is in the process of being made fully operational,
while the amendment of the AML/CFT law is still awaiting parliamentary approval. Upon its
approval, the BM will issue guidelines that would allow Mozambique to move closer toward
compliance with the 40+9 Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). In
order to ensure a consistent application of the AML/CFT framework across various
regulators, the Government intends to establish, and appoint the members of, the National
AML Task Force by end-September 2011. Mozambique‘s first AML/CFT Mutual Evaluation
Report by the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG) has
been considered by the ESAAMLG Plenary in April 2011. The FATF‘s International
Cooperation Review Group (ICRG) is expected to conduct a preliminary review of
Mozambique‘s evaluation report in October. The ICRG process is designed to publicly
identify high-risk jurisdictions, and could result in a public statement by the FATF to apply
counter-measures against non-cooperative jurisdictions.
Article IV consultation
In accordance with Decision No 12794–(02/76), as amended by Decision No 12854–(02/96),
Mozambique is on a 24-month Article IV cycle due to the approval of a PSI in June 2007.
The 2009 Article IV consultation was completed by the Executive Board on June 30, 2009
(Country Report No. 09/227).
In concluding the 2009 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors welcomed
Mozambique‘s continued strong macroeconomic performance in 2008 despite a challenging
external environment. They commended the authorities‘ flexible policy response to higher
fuel and food import prices, which helped to mitigate the impact of these shocks. Directors
noted that Mozambique remains vulnerable to the global economic slowdown and agreed that
the country‘s strong track record of prudent macroeconomic policy implementation has
provided room to ease fiscal and monetary policy in the near term. In the medium term,
Directors underscored the importance of preserving macroeconomic stability and supported
efforts to enhance domestic revenue mobilization and to improve public financial
management. They welcomed the authorities‘ intention to limit recourse to domestic
financing of the budget so as to preserve sufficient room for private sector credit growth.
With respect to the overvaluation of the exchange rate in real effective terms, Directors
suggested paying closer attention to a basket of currencies, which could help support
Mozambique‘s competitiveness and economic diversification. Further progress in structural
reforms and in developing and safeguarding the soundness of the banking system were seen
as instrumental in supporting the business environment.
Ex post assessment of performance under Fund-supported programs
An ex post assessment (EPA) of Mozambique‘s performance under Fund-Supported
Programs since 1987 was undertaken in December 2003 under the guidelines on assessments
of countries with a longer-term program engagement. The EPA was circulated to the
Executive Board on November 21, 2003 (Country Report No. 04/53).

6
Directors commended the authorities for their pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies and
wide ranging structural reforms over the past fifteen years which contributed to strong
growth of the economy, and a steady decline in poverty rates. Noting that despite
considerable progress Mozambique remains a very poor and vulnerable country, Directors
urged the authorities to persevere in their efforts to consolidate macroeconomic stability and
accelerate and deepen structural reforms with a view to sustaining economic growth,
encouraging employment creation, and further reducing poverty.
FSAP participation and ROSCs
A Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for Mozambique was undertaken during the
first quarter of 2003. The related Financial Sector Stability Assessment was circulated to the
Executive Board on November 19, 2003 (Country Report No. 04/52). An update to the FSAP
took place in February 2009 and the related Financial Sector Stability Assessment circulated
to the Board on June 19, 2009 (Country Report No. 10/12) A ROSC on fiscal transparency
was issued on February 22, 2001. This ROSC was updated in the context of the 2002
Article IV consultation (Country Report No. 02/140) and the 2003 Article IV Consultation
(Country Report No. 04/50). The ROSC on fiscal transparency was updated in May 2008. A
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) data module was prepared in
June 2002 and issued on March 5, 2003. This data module was updated in August 2005.
Management’s visit
At the invitation of the authorities, Mr. Kato, Deputy Managing Director, visited Maputo,
Mozambique in July 2005. The Managing Director visited Mozambique on August 2007 for
a meeting with the African Consultative Group on Quotas, Voice, and Representation.
Resident representative
Mr. Victor Lledo has been the IMF‘s resident representative to Mozambique since
June 21, 2010.

APPENDIX II. WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
36.
The Fund Mozambique team met with the World Bank Mozambique team in
Maputo during the 2011 Article IV consultation and second PSI review mission in April
2011. The objective was to identify macro-critical structural reforms and to coordinate the two
teams' work for the period May 2011- April 2012.
2.
The teams agreed that Mozambique's main macroeconomic challenges are to
sustain higher and more inclusive economic growth going forward. To meet these
challenges, Mozambique needs to enable broader-based economic activity led by the private
sector, in particular in areas where it has competitive advantages, such as agriculture, traderelated services in support of booming commodity export sectors, labor-intensive manufacturing,
and tourism. Given the low level of infrastructure, this will entail policies and reforms to boost
public investment, coupled with enhancements in the business environment. While traditional aid
will continue to address needs in infrastructure investment and the social sector, increasing
public investment may require resorting to nonconcessional financing and stepping up capacity
in the investment selection and debt management areas.
3.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified six structural reform areas as
macro-critical, in view of their central role in achieving higher and more inclusive growth:
Debt management and investment planning. The authorities‘ ambitious investment program
will need to be backed by a strong reform agenda to enhance capacity to manage fiscal risks and
ensure value for money. In the field of investment selection, several measures will be
implemented to establish an investment pipeline and define project selection standards and
protocols. A new legal framework supporting private-public partnership and concessions will be
implemented. Debt management will be strengthened to ensure that borrowing and investment
decisions entail value for money. This will be underpinned by a new medium-term debt strategy.
Public financial management. The focus will be on enhancing the capacity to manage risks
outside the central government, including in the area of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and
decentralized administrative units. To achieve this objective, the authorities will step up riskbased controls and audits, continue rolling out their new PFM system, and enhance budget
execution and monitoring reports. Other critical measures aim at enhancing control of the wage
bill, both in budget preparation and execution. These reforms are macro-critical since they will
create fiscal space needed to reduce poverty and increase priority spending, while managing risks
related to SOE‘s large-scale investment plans and enhancing the government‘s oversight.
Tax administration. Despite the strong increase in revenue collections, the tax system is still
complex to administer and comply with. It is marked by numerous tax benefits and an overall
low contribution from the mega-project sectors. Going forward, the government plans to
facilitate tax compliance through electronic tax payment and continue to expand the tax base to
cover the large informal sector. The revenue management system will be enhanced, in line with a
set of agreed performance indicators. The large tax-payers unit will be made fully operational.
Social safety nets. The recent social unrest in light of the food and fuel price spikes has exposed
the contrast of a fast-growing economy with still large pockets of poverty. This, in turn,

10
undermines the country‘s long-term growth potential. To address this, the authorities intend to
strengthen their safety nets. Measures include: (i) rationalizing and expanding health insurance
coverage; (ii) strengthening higher education and vocational training; (iii) strengthening the financial
sustainability and administration of the National Social Security Fund, and creating a new pension
system for private sector workers; and (iv) improving the targeting of social protection systems to the
most needy. These measures are macro-critical, as better health and education services, stronger
pensions systems, and a more effective social safety net can enhance the productivity of the
workforce and support social cohesion.
Investment climate. Mozambique's corporate sector is held back by the high costs of doing business.
These arise mainly from weaknesses in governance, access to finance, power supply, tax and
regulatory systems, and contract enforcement. Wide-ranging reforms are needed to address these
issues. They are macro-critical because a better investment climate is conducive to supporting private
sector activities, thereby broadening the country‘s productive and export base, creating jobs, and thus
helping reduce poverty.
Financial sector stability and development. Credit to the private sector has strongly expanded
during the last few years, and there are concerns about the impact on the quality of the loans. A
number of measures are envisaged to strengthen the supervision of the financial sector, as well as
the capacity to identity and address potential sources of vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, improving
financial intermediation and access to credit remains a top priority. To this end, the authorities
will finalize, by end-September 2011, the 2011-20 Financial Sector Development Strategy which
will include a wide-ranging and clearly sequenced action plan, covering ways to, among other
things, enhance financial inclusion, competition, consumer protection, and financial literacy.
4.

The teams agreed on the following division of labor:

Debt management and investment planning reforms. The Fund will continue to play a key role
in building government capacity to assess debt sustainability and define a coherent debt strategy
through TA and continued support from HQ. Both institutions will assist the authorities in
strengthening their debt management capacity, with TA support from the Fund and on-site
assistance from the Bank. The Fund will continue to play a key role in helping the authorities
establish a project selection pipeline, in line with recent TA and program commitments, while
the Bank will take a lead in enhancing project evaluation and monitoring processes and protocols
from its office in Mozambique, in consultation with the Fund. The Fund review missions will
provide further opportunities to assess progress in this field and discuss possible actions with the
Bank.
Public financial management reform. The Band and the Fund will cooperate in the field of
rolling out the new PFM system to cover local administrations and SOEs engaging in large-scale
infrastructure investments. The Fund will secure its support through regular TA missions from its
RTAC office. The Bank will provide ongoing consultation from its local office and supervision
missions of projects under implementation in this area. The Fund program review missions will
provide further opportunities to assess progress in this field.
Tax administration reforms. The Fund will provide support through ongoing advice based on
regular TA. The Bank will advance reforms in this area in the context of its business
environment policies and portfolio.

11
Social safety net reform. The Bank will take a lead in this field through continued TA in the
design of more comprehensive and performing safety nets, in cooperation with other
development partners and international organizations (including UNESCO and ILO). The Fund
will play its role in identifying the fiscal space for the safety nets. The results will be discussed
among the collaborators on a regular basis, so as to inform policy discussions with the
authorities.
Investment climate reform. The Bank will take a lead in enhancing the investment climate by
deepening its agenda to cut red tape and simplifying the legal framework. The results will be
shared on an ongoing basis and discussed during the Fund program review missions.
Financial sector stability and development. The Fund will continue to help the Bank of
Mozambique to build its capacity to assess risks to financial stability of the banking sector in
upcoming missions, while the Bank will take the lead in supporting financial sector development
and reforms, including through enhanced financial inclusion, competition, consumer protection,
and financial literacy. The results of their respective work will be shared and discussed regularly.
5.

The teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:



The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in the above macro-critical
structural reform areas. Timing: when milestones are reached; and at least semiannually
during Fund program review missions.



The Bank team requests to be kept informed of the Fund's assessments of macroeconomic
policies and prospects, and analytical work on areas under the Fund‘s lead, as well as on
recommendations of Fund TA missions. Timing: in the context of Fund program review
and other missions, and at least semi-annually.

APPENDIX III. MOZAMBIQUE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Despite the increase in budget resources allocated to the compilation of official statistics,
continued high reliance on external funding raises concerns about the sustainability of the
programs of the National Institute of Statistics (INE). The authorities are making efforts to
improve the quality and timeliness of economic and financial data through participation in
the Fund‘s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and in the external sector module
of the GDDS Project for Anglophone African Countries (funded by the U.K. Department for
International Development (DFID)). Weaknesses exist, particularly in the areas of national
accounts, prices, and government finance statistics.
Real sector statistics: The national accounts are prepared by the INE in accordance with
the 1993 System of National Accounts (1993 SNA). In August 2007, the INE released
quarterly GDP estimates at constant prices covering 2000–07 for the first time, along with a
revised annual GDP series for the period 1991–2006, with 2003 as the new base year. The
authorities are working to strengthen quarterly national accounts compilation at current
prices. The INE‘s new household income and expenditure survey and economic censuses
leading to a new business registry still need to be incorporated to strengthen the national
accounts. A revamped consumer price index for Maputo based on weights derived from
the 2008–09 household survey was released in February 2011. A national index obtained by
integrating the indices for Maputo, Beira, and Nampula was released in April 2006. INE has
adopted a new software from INE Portugal which helps to correct a probable downward bias
caused by carry-forward techniques for discontinued products. Several issues remain
outstanding, however, including how to improve the housing market rent sample and expand
coverage to include the Quelimane and Greater Maputo areas. There are insufficient sectoral
labor market and employment data, and where available, they have limited coverage. A oneyear labor market survey of the entire country, undertaken by INE in collaboration with the
Labor Ministry, was launched in October 2004.
Government finance statistics: Government finance statistics (GFS) are not compiled
using an internationally accepted statistical methodology and no staff has been identified to
do so. A complete list of public sector entities is lacking. Work on a correspondence table
between budgetary information and GFS needs to be completed. In addition, work on an
integrated information system to capture completely stocks and flow information needs
further development.

14

Monetary and financial statistics: A 2004 work plan was developed to implement the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) and develop an integrated monetary
database (IMD) to meet the needs of the Bank of Mozambique (BM), AFR, and STA. In
November 2007 the IMD was completed and allows the derivation of accurate and timely
monthly monetary statistics, while reducing BM‘s reporting burden.
Balance of payments: With assistance from STA, provided in the context of the GDDS
regional project, the BM has made significant progress toward compiling and disseminating
balance of payments (BOP) and international investment position (IIP) statistics that are
fully aligned with the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). The BM has an
adequate institutional framework for the compilation of BOP and IIP statistics. However,
further strengthening of external sector statistics needs to focus on: strengthening
information technology (especially to apply data warehouse and on-line analytical
processing tools); excluding the effects of price and exchange rate fluctuations from reserve
asset flows; applying a methodology (provided through STA technical assistance) to
estimate reinvested profits and stocks of financial assets and liabilities held abroad by the
nonfinancial public sector; improving business surveys; publishing methodological notes, in
general, and more data covering the Reserves Template, foreign direct investment, goods
trade and current transfers; and beginning the gradual process to implement the new Balance
of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition. Joint work with
other institutions to improve the quality of external trade data, especially with regard to price
and volume indices, also merits attention.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Mozambique commenced its participation in
the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) in November 2003; but has since
then not updated much of its metadata.

In May 2005, an update of the June 2002
data module of the Report on the Observance
of Standards and Codes (Data ROSC) was
prepared. Improvements in the institutional
environment and increased allocation of
resources for the compilation of national
accounts and balance of payments statistics
aimed to address weaknesses in the
prerequisites for the quality of the statistics.
Methodological soundness, accuracy, and
reliability of macroeconomic statistics began
to show improvements as a result of these
efforts.

15

III. Reporting to STA
Mozambique does not report fiscal data for publication in the IFS or the Government Finance
Statistic Yearbook (GFSY). Mozambique now reports monthly monetary data to STA using
the standardized reporting forms (SRFs). As a result, these enhanced data are being published
in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) Supplement. In 2007, the BM started to
compile and report comprehensive IIP data in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 27, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Mozambique
On June 17, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Mozambique.1
Background
Mozambique has sustained strong economic growth over nearly two decades, helped by foreign
investment, mainly in mega-projects in the natural resource sector, and generous support by
development partners. However, trend growth has declined in recent years and poverty
reduction stagnated, suggesting the need for building more inclusive growth through economic
diversification, employment creation, and the expansion of social protection.
Mozambique has weathered the adverse shocks of recent years relatively well. Economic
growth remains one of the highest in the region, partially reflecting the authorities’ supportive
policy stance during the global crisis. Growth in 2010 is estimated at 6½ percent, supported by
external demand. Inflation, even excluding food and fuel, strongly picked up and reached
double digits, triggered by the accommodating monetary policy adopted during the crisis and a
depreciating exchange rate during much of the year. The current account deficit narrowed more
than expected, supported by buoyant mega-projects exports. Strong revenue collections,
reflecting tax administration efforts, and spending restraint helped contain the fiscal deficit in
2010, in spite of the high costs of the fuel subsidy which put pressures on domestic spending.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

Mozambique’s medium-term outlook remains favorable. Economic growth is projected to
accelerate to 7¼ percent in 2011 and close to 8 percent over the medium term. This mainly
reflects strong new mega-project activity and stepped-up public investment. Headline inflation is
projected to decline to single digits as a result of appropriately tight macroeconomic policies,
while Mozambique’s external position should remain comfortable. Nonetheless, continued
spillovers from international food and fuel prices could be a drag on macroeconomic and social
stability.
Significant policy challenges remain over the medium term. The new Poverty Reduction
Strategy aims to respond to these challenges and create the conditions for high, sustained, and
inclusive economic growth. This includes policies to increase production and productivity in
labor-intensive sectors, such as agriculture, and promoting employment through improvements
in the business environment. Private sector activity would benefit from a larger contribution of
the financial sector. Fiscal space needs to be created to finance large public investment and
support an expansion of social protection, while safeguarding macroeconomic stability and debt
sustainability. This will hinge on enhancing government revenues, safeguarding donor support,
pursuing a prudent borrowing strategy, and stepping up debt management and investment
planning. Continued improvements in public financial management will facilitate expenditure
prioritization and execution.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for prudent policies that have resulted in a
strong economic performance. Directors noted that, although Mozambique’s medium-term
prospects continue to be favorable, significant challenges remain in managing macroeconomic
risks and ensuring that the benefits from growth are shared fairly across the population.
Directors underscored that safeguarding price stability and containing inflation expectations
remain key policy priorities for the period ahead. In this regard, they supported the authorities’
intention to tighten fiscal and monetary policies as needed to bring about an early and sustained
decline in core inflation.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ new Poverty Reduction Strategy (PARP). They supported
the goals of broadening the country’s productive and export base, creating additional
employment opportunities, and expanding the social safety nets. Continued structural reforms to
improve productivity and the business environment will be important to achieve sustained
growth and poverty reduction. Directors encouraged the authorities to seek the expertise of
development partners in designing well-targeted social protection systems.
Directors supported the authorities’ prudent fiscal stance aimed at preserving macroeconomic
stability and debt sustainability. They welcomed the authorities’ intention to gradually phase out

3
the fuel subsidy. With a view to creating fiscal space, Directors encouraged the authorities to
sustain efforts to improve tax administration and seek new revenue sources. In particular, they
encouraged the authorities to adopt a prudent approach to generating additional budgetary
revenue from the natural resource sector while protecting Mozambique as a destination for
foreign investment. Directors emphasized the importance of adhering to a prudent borrowing
strategy, further strengthening debt management, and improving investment planning.
Directors noted the resilience of the banking system during the global crisis, and recommended
continued vigilance in light of remaining vulnerabilities. In particular, Directors stressed the
importance of adequate capital buffers at all banks, better diversified loan books, and a strict
oversight of financial flows between banks and their parent companies abroad. They welcomed
progress in establishing a crisis resolution framework and enhancing bank supervision, while
noting the need for steps to make the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework more effective.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ acceptance of the obligations under Article VIII of the
Fund’s Articles of Agreement.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Completes Second Review Under Policy Support Instrument for
Mozambique
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the second
review of Mozambique‘s economic program under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI). In
completing the review, the Board approved a waiver for the nonobservance of the
quantitative assessment criterion on reserve money.
The Executive Board approved Mozambique‘s second three-year PSI on June 14, 2010 (see
Press Release No. 10/242). The IMF's framework for PSIs is designed for low-income
countries that may not need, or want, IMF financial assistance, but still seek IMF advice,
monitoring, and endorsement of their policies (see Public Information Notice No. 05/145).
At the conclusion of the Executive Board discussion on Mozambique, Ms. Nemat Shafik,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, made issued the following statement:
―Mozambique‘s economic performance and outlook remain strong. Helped by appropriate
macroeconomic policies, the economy proved resilient to the global economic crisis. The
country is poised for an acceleration of economic growth over the medium term, reflecting
expanded production in the natural resource sector and stepped-up public infrastructure
investment.
―Fighting inflation should be the key priority for macroeconomic policy in the short run. The
authorities‘ policies aimed at bringing about an early decline in core inflation are welcome,
and the authorities should stand ready to tighten policies further should inflation pressures
persist.
―The new Poverty Reduction Strategy (PARP) contains the right ingredients to allow growth
to become more inclusive. The PARP‘s emphasis on broadening the country‘s productive
and export base and creating employment opportunities is appropriate, but determination is
needed in implementing the strategy. The authorities‘ commitment to continue the phase-out
of the fuel subsidy is welcome, and they should move forward in expanding well-targeted
and affordable social protection systems.

2
―The authorities‘ ambitious development agenda appropriately addresses Mozambique‘s
economic challenges. In implementing the investment strategy, it will be important to
continue to pursue a prudent borrowing policy to safeguard macroeconomic stability and debt
sustainability. Efforts to strengthen tax administration should be sustained and new revenue
sources tapped, including in particular from the natural resource sector. The authorities are
also well advised to continue implementing key structural reforms in debt management and
investment planning, as well as public financial management.
―While the banking system has shown resilience during the global crisis, vigilance is
warranted in light of vulnerabilities and potential contagion. The progress in establishing a
banking crisis resolution framework and improving banking supervision is welcome, while
more resolve needs to be shown to make the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the
Financing of Terrorism framework more effective.
―The acceptance of the obligations of Article VIII of the IMF‘s Articles of Agreement is
welcome,‖ she added.

Statement by Mr. Moeketsi Majoro, Executive Director for Mozambique
June 17, 2010

Introduction
My authorities are grateful to Fund management for their continuous support and to staff for
constructive policy dialogue and guidance against the backdrop of a very challenging global
economic environment. The authorities share the thrust of the staff report as it provides a
forthright assessment of recent economic developments and program performance.
Recent Economic Developments
Despite the uncertain external environment, economic developments in 2010 were characterized
by strong growth, strengthened balance of payments and better-than-expected fiscal
performance. The Mozambican economy proved resilient boosted by significant exports in
mineral mega-projects and infrastructure investment. Real GDP grew at 6.6 percent in 2010,
higher than that of its regional peers. However, despite robust efforts by the authorities to tighten
monetary and fiscal policies, inflation reached double digits for the first time in a decade, fueled
by global food and fuel price increases.
Program Performance
Program performance has been strong. All end-December 2010 quantitative assessment criteria
(AC) were observed, with the exception of the target on reserve money for which the authorities
have since taken corrective action to rein in its growth. On the structural front, all benchmarks
were implemented. In this context, my authorities request Directors' support for the completion
of the second review under the Policy Support Instrument, and for modification of assessment
criteria as outlined in the staff report. My authorities remain committed to prudent
macroeconomic policies and maintaining strong program implementation going forward.
Economic outlook
Reducing the current level of poverty, improving social safety nets, expanding infrastructure
investment, and boosting key sectors such as agriculture, fishing, minerals, tourism and transport
are key priorities for the Mozambican authorities. However, they are caught between supporting
sustainable economic growth and arresting inflation expectations in the context of a challenging
internal and external environment. For 2011, my authorities foresee a positive macroeconomic
outlook as real GDP is projected to grow by 7¼ percent. They are committed to tightening fiscal
and monetary policies in order to control liquidity and monitor reserve money developments
aimed at reducing headline inflation to single digits from 2011 onwards. The external current
account deficit is projected to stabilize during the next few years, while reserves coverage should
approach 5 months of projected imports, fully supported by exports from new mega projects in
the mining sector, and continued external support from development partners.

2
Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy
In May 2011, my authorities adopted a new four-year Poverty Reduction Strategy aimed at
reducing poverty from about 55 percent to 42 percent by 2014. The program is focused on three
pillars: i) increasing production and productivity in sectors such as agriculture and fisheries;
ii) creating employment through improvements in the business climate; and iii) pursuing human
and social developments. The Government is committed to promoting long-term economic
growth, and in this regard, intends to create the necessary fiscal space, including from improving
collection of revenues from the natural resource sector in order to finance infrastructure
investment and expand social safety nets. In this regard, they plan to build on the existing
National Basic Social Security Strategy (ENSSB), Strategic Program for the Reduction of Urban
Poverty (PERPU) and the ongoing national policy dialogue to refine their strategy for social
protection.
Fiscal Policy
The 2011 fiscal objective is to limit the primary domestic fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP,
¼ percent lower than initially projected. The government will continue to target a lower fiscal
deficit through prudent expenditure execution and continued buoyancy in revenue collection.
However, in line with changing social spending priorities, the government has submitted to
Parliament a revised budget incorporating adjustments in the budgetary ceiling for transfers and
subsidies to accommodate an existing fuel subsidy and planned outlays to cushion the effects of
increases in food and fuel prices on the vulnerable groups. My authorities would like to affirm
that the previous measures will be gradually phased out as better targeted and sustainable
interventions are implemented. In addition, government will continue to reflect the costs of any
government outlays for fuel products in the budget, in line with the best fiscal transparency
practices.
Mozambique has a low risk of debt distress as shown in the latest Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA). My authorities reiterate that fiscal policy will continue to be geared toward safeguarding
macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. In this regard, they will move carefully in
making use of the ceiling on nonconcessional borrowing under the program. They will continue
to improve their debt management and investment planning, in line with commitments under the
program.
Monetary and Financial Sector prospects
Bringing inflation to single digits is a key priority for the authorities. With average inflation
surging to around 12.7 percent in 2010, the Central Bank of Mozambique intends to take
measures to contain it at 9½ percent in 2011 and to reduce it further in the years ahead by
continuing to decelerate the pace of monetary expansion. The authorities are committed to
maintaining the flexible exchange rate regime and the exchange rate looks broadly in line with
macroeconomic fundamentals. On May 20, 2011, my authorities accepted the obligations under
Article VIII of the Fund's Articles of Agreement and are on track to remove all identified
exchange restrictions shortly.

3
Financial sector reform will be guided by the prospective 2011-20 Financial Sector Development
Strategy that will be finalized no later than end-September 2011. The BM will continue to
monitor the banking system closely to safeguard its soundness, enhance financial competition,
and protect consumers. In particular, work will continue to fully develop a financial sector
contingency plan, migrate to Basel II, introduce deposit insurance, broaden electronic banking
and strengthen defenses against money laundering.
Structural Reforms
My authorities are committed to continue with the reforms in public financial management
(PFM) as well as improving their reporting, monitoring, and control of budget execution. They
will continue to improve the e-SISTAFE budget execution system and will roll it out nationally
with the aim of completion by 2015. My Mozambican authorities are aware that enhanced debt
management and investment planning are critical to ensure prudent borrowing decisions. Thus,
they will continue reforming debt management and investment planning through the
strengthening of the new Debt Management Committee (DMC) and Project Coordination
Committee (PCC) that will oversee project cycle management and borrowing options.
In addition, the authorities intend to pursue a more business-friendly environment through tax
policy and administration reforms. They will step up efforts to improve automated revenue
collection and better monitoring of large taxpayers through strengthening the existing large
taxpayers unit, and lowering transactions costs for taxpayers. Furthermore, an Anti-Corruption
Strategy was approved in January 2011, and the authorities intend to submit to Parliament by
end-July 2011, the legislation required to implement the strategy.
