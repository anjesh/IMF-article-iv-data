STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Near-term outlook. Prospects for Malaysia’s well diversified economy are favorable
despite lower prices for its exports of energy and other commodities. Growth is
expected to moderate in 2015 to 4.8 percent from 5.9 percent in 2014. Headline
inflation will increase slightly, to 3.2 percent in 2015 from 3.1 percent in 2014,
reflecting the net impact of subsidy rationalization, Goods and Services Tax (GST)
implementation, and exchange rate depreciation. Inflationary pressures should
remain subdued, aided by lower oil and gas prices.
Impact of lower oil prices. The sharp decline in energy prices is expected to have a
modest negative impact on Malaysia’s near-term growth prospects and lower its
current account surplus. Although lower commodity prices will be a drag on the
economy, manufacturing exports should get a boost, aided by a weaker exchange
rate and higher growth in the U.S.
Macroeconomic policy mix. The current macroeconomic policy mix is appropriate.
Fiscal consolidation is well timed, appropriately paced, and remains on track. While
monetary policy is on hold reflecting increased global uncertainty, a market-driven
tightening of domestic liquidity and financial conditions is under way.
Fiscal Policy. The elimination of fuel subsidies and introduction of the GST are timely
and decisive reforms with long-lasting benefits. In the near term, eliminating fuel
subsidies will help offset the fiscal impact of lower energy revenues. In the medium
term, these reforms will also help the authorities diversify budgetary revenues,
balance the budget, and lower the debt to GDP ratio.
Financial stability. High house prices and household debt remain a concern,
although rising real interest rates should dampen growth of financial risks. BNM is
pro-actively managing the risks through stress testing, enhanced supervision, and
targeted macroprudential policies. Nevertheless, further macroprudential measures
may be needed.
Structural policies. The authorities are implementing structural reforms on a wide
front in support of Malaysia’s goal of achieving high-income status by 2020.
Continued investment in infrastructure and in research and development can help
spur home-grown innovation. Together with improvements in the quality of
education and increased female labor force participation, these efforts can help raise
productivity, support higher sustainable growth, and foster a more inclusive society.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
1.
Recent developments. The Malaysian economy continued to perform well in 2014 and the
authorities have taken advantage of favorable conditions provided by the growing economy, full
employment, and a benign political calendar to implement key fiscal reforms. These decisive steps,
driven by the authorities’ multiyear adjustment and reform agenda, are consistent with Fund policy
advice (Appendix 1). Growth accelerated to 5.9 percent as the recovery of exports and continued
strong private demand offset mild headwinds from lower public spending. Private investment
continues to be fueled by accommodative financial conditions and the catalytic effects of long term
public investment programs. Strong employment and wage growth supported private consumption.
The removal of fuel subsidies pushed inflation above its historical average but without any signs of
more generalized inflationary pressures, despite a positive output gap. Credit growth has moderated
yet remains brisk, with residential property loan growth close to 14 percent in September. Deposit
growth has slowed to the single digits and domestic liquidity conditions are beginning to tighten.
The ringgit appreciated against the U.S. dollar through mid-August but subsequently depreciated by
10 percent as oil prices fell, for a cumulative depreciation by year-end of about 6.3 percent since
January 2014, with further depreciation pressures in early January 2015. Reserves have declined by
over US$15 billion between mid-August to end-December 2014 amid capital outflows.
2.
Outlook. Growth is expected to moderate to a still robust rate of 4.8 percent in 2015. Activity
will be led by growth in private investment in the non-oil sector, which is likely to benefit from lower
energy costs. Private consumption growth is likely to moderate, reflecting the net effects of lower
commodity prices, the impact of GST, and slower credit growth. The projected decline in average
crude oil prices for 2015 compared to 2014 is a large negative terms of trade shock for Malaysia
(Appendix 2).1 Nevertheless, only a modest negative impact on growth is expected as lower energy
costs should help stimulate the non-oil sector and boost activity in Malaysia’s main trading partners.
Financial conditions remain accommodative but are tightening, a trend that should continue in 2015
and become a drag on growth, particularly private consumption. GST implementation will increase
inflation on introduction in April 2015 but lower fuel prices, subdued underlying inflation, and a
narrowing output gap will mitigate the impact.
3.
Risks. Risks to the baseline are tilted to the downside. Despite the improved outlook for the
US economy, weak prospects for Europe and Japan along with falling fuel and commodity prices, are
adding to economic uncertainties (see Appendix 3).


External risks. A protracted period of slower growth in advanced economies and emerging
markets would slow growth in Malaysia through the trade channel with second round effects on

a VAR Approach” by Niamh Sheridan (2015).

domestic demand. Sizeable foreign holdings of local currency assets expose Malaysia to volatility
in international capital flows. In a risk scenario, a surge in global volatility could see investors
reducing their exposure to Malaysian assets. This risk is mitigated by Malaysia’s flexible exchange
rate, ample monetary policy credibility, well timed fiscal adjustment, and financial cushions from
large official reserves and institutional savings. Malaysia could be vulnerable to contagion and
financial volatility in the case of a disorderly adjustment to persistent dollar strength, although
the export-oriented manufacturing sector is likely to benefit.


4.

Domestic risks. The authorities are proceeding with fiscal reforms but should guard against
slowdown in reform momentum. It will be important to continue on this path and balance the
budget by 2020. The impact of lower global oil and gas prices on Malaysia could be larger,
dampening growth through delayed investment plans and the impact of higher real interest
rates; in addition the current account surplus could narrow and additional measures would be
needed to meet the fiscal targets. Although there are signs of cooling in the housing market and
personal lending growth has been curtailed, financial vulnerabilities remain due to high
household debt and elevated house prices.
Authorities’ views. The authorities were in broad agreement with staff’s assessment.



They expect growth to remain steady in 2015, led by private demand. Private consumption will
continue to expand, albeit at a more moderate rate following implementation of GST and other
price adjustments. Slower household credit growth is not expected to have a significant impact
on consumption as long as economic growth is sustained. Investment in the oil and gas sector
could be affected, if oil prices remain low for an extended period of time. It must be noted that
Malaysia’s investment is broad-based with the oil and gas sector accounting for less that
20 percent of private investment and the services and manufacturing sectors contributed to
80 percent of growth in investment in 2013. On the external front, commodity and resourcebased exports will be affected by lower commodity prices, however, non-resource based
manufacturing exports, which account for 53 percent of total exports, will provide support to
export growth.



The authorities viewed the external risks to the outlook as significant. They voiced concerns
about the recovery in advanced economies, where growth risks and widening policy divergence
could trigger global financial market turbulence with negative spillovers to the real economy.



In terms of financial sector risks, the authorities were less concerned than staff. They noted that
credit and house price growth have moderated while successful implementation of targeted
macroprudential measures has curtailed risks and increased financial sector resilience. The
authorities have assessed the capacity of banks to withstand and respond to a wide range of
shocks and adverse scenarios. These stress tests indicate that bank balance sheets are resilient,
including to large changes in house prices and interest rates.

FISCAL POLICY: TIMELY AND DECISIVE MOVES
5.
Background. The authorities undertook important fiscal reforms in 2014, taking advantage
of the favorable conjuncture provided by full employment, strong growth momentum, low inflation
and, lately, declining oil prices. On December 1, 2014, remaining fuel subsides on RON95 gasoline
and diesel fuel were removed, culminating an effort that began with the floating of prices for RON97
premium petrol in 2010 and also included earlier moves (in September 2013 and October 2014)
which raised the prices of diesel and RON95 petrol by 20 sen per liter (about 10 percent) each. Prices
for RON95 petrol and diesel are now set monthly to track international oil prices. Implementation of
a GST in April 2015 is on track. Other subsidies are being reformed and budget transfers are being
better targeted. These moves were timely as well as bold and they will help shield the budget from
declining oil and gas revenues and reinforce fiscal sustainability. They will also enhance the efficiency
and equity of Malaysia’s fiscal policy.
6.
2014 Budget outturn. Malaysia is on track to meet the 2014 federal budget deficit target of
3.5 percent, down from 3.9 percent in 2013. Revenues have come in higher than budgeted owing to
stronger growth and higher oil and gas production, which raised oil-related revenues despite the
weakening of oil and gas prices. Over-performance on the revenue side was matched by a higherthan-budgeted wage bill and higher development spending. Subsidy spending was lower reflecting
subsidy rationalization.
7.
2015 Budget. The 2015 budget, including the January 2015 revision, stays the course of
steady, gradual fiscal consolidation. As originally promulgated in October, it was based on a Brent
crude oil price of US$100 and targeted a budget deficit of 3 percent of GDP, reflecting the GST and
the reduction of fuel subsidies announced on October 1. It was revised on January 20 and now
assumes an oil price of US$55 (average Tapis crude price of US$61) and the dismantling of fuel
subsidies announced on December 1. The revised budget deficit target has been changed to
3.2 percent of GDP in 2015, owing to additional expenditures related to floods that recently affected
200,000 people, partly offset by a reduction in lower priority operational spending. The 2015 Budget
includes measures to ease the impact of GST, including reductions in individual and corporate
income taxes as well as the SME tax of between 1–3 percentage points. As a result, only a small net
positive revenue impact from GST is expected in 2015. The removal of fuel subsidies is expected to
bring in savings of RM10.7 billion (0.9 percent of GDP). This savings will be offset by lower oil and
gas revenues in the baseline scenario. The revenue loss will be lower if oil prices come in higher, in
which case it would be important to save the windfall. If Tapis oil prices fall below US$60, the budget
would face a net loss, requiring additional measures to meet the deficit target.
8.
GST. Staff welcomes the introduction of GST, which will help broaden the base of Malaysia’s
fiscal system and reduce its reliance on volatile oil and gas revenues. GST preparations are well
advanced and registration of taxpayers for the GST credit-invoice procedure is running ahead of
projections; staff encourages the authorities to save any upside GST revenue. Looking ahead, GST
effectiveness could be enhanced by gradually narrowing the list of exempt and zero-rated items

which would help raise GST buoyancy. In addition,
fewer GST exemptions would allow tax authorities
to generate more information through crosschecking of returns, which would raise
compliance. There is also room to gradually raise
the GST rate as part of the strategy to reduce
fiscal dependence on hydrocarbons and balance
the budget: Malaysia’s 6 percent GST rate is the
lowest in the region (Singapore’s and Thailand’s
GST is 7 percent; it is 10 percent elsewhere in
Asia).

Taxes, 2013.

9.
Subsidy rationalization. Staff welcomes the elimination of subsidies on diesel and RON95
petrol. Fuel prices were floated when the gap between the market and subsidized price was small.
Along with the removal of sugar subsidies and a 15 percent increase in electricity prices in January
2014, the authorities are now closer to achieving their goal of eliminating untargeted price subsidies.
LPG use in the fishing and transportation sectors is still subsidized at an estimated cost of
RM2 billion (0.2 percent of GDP) in 2015. In future, consideration could be given to imposing GST on
fuels and also to taking into account carbon content, in order to capture the negative effects on
Malaysia’s environment and global climate change. These measures would help support the Prime
Minister’s commitment to lowering the carbon intensity of Malaysia’s economy and creating a “new
energy economy”.
10.
Enhanced protection for the poor. Strengthening the social safety net is an integral part of
the authorities’ fiscal strategy. Untargeted fuel subsidies were regressive: households in the top two
quintiles of per capita consumption received 60 percent of the subsidies while only 3 percent went to
the bottom decile. The elimination of fuel subsidies freed up resources that can be redirected to
better support the poor. To mitigate the impact of subsidy rationalization and GST, the 2015 budget
calls for increased cash transfers to poorer households (those earning less than RM4,000 per month).
The authorities are also reviewing overlapping and fragmented cash transfer programs.
11.
Medium-term fiscal strategy. The authorities’ goal of balancing the budget by 2020 will
help reduce the federal debt to near pre-crisis levels and give them more room to deal with major
shocks and absorb contingent liabilities. Balancing the budget will require a continuous effort amidst
pressures from oil revenues that are declining in relation to GDP and from rising expenditure
commitments. Lower energy prices highlight the need for fiscal consolidation to remain ambitious, to
continue with the drive to broaden revenue bases and diversify them away from hydrocarbons, and
to increase expenditure equity and efficiency. If the decline in oil prices is permanent more measures
would be required over the medium term to meet the fiscal targets which remain feasible in light of
GST implementation – a powerful revenue mobilization tool―and the removal of consumer fuel
subsidies. Potential additional measures include broadening the GST base or increasing the rates
combined with rationalization of subsidies from public enterprises, for example, electricity and gas,
and operational expenditure restraint. The authorities’ commitment to sound public finances allows
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

flexibility in phasing the adjustment effort. Automatic stabilizers and countercyclical policies could be
employed if the economy slows down by more than expected and the adjustment could be stretched
beyond to 2020.
12.
Fiscal framework. Malaysia is making important progress in reforming its fiscal institutions.
Top-down macro-fiscal control was strengthened significantly with the creation of the Fiscal Policy
Committee (see 2013 staff report), while the size of supplementary budgets has been substantially
reduced. The move toward performance-based budgeting is welcomed, as is the piloting of accrual
accounting in 2015 ahead of full implementation in 2016. The government would benefit from
publishing its medium-term fiscal framework; from adopting a fiscal risks management framework
and publication of an annual fiscal risks statement; and from reducing further the use of
supplementary budgets.2 And while Malaysia’s federal government and most Government-linked
Corporates (GLCs) are increasingly transparent, more proactive communication and greater
transparency of business objectives and operations for all GLCs would help.
13.
Authorities’ views. The authorities reiterated their commitment to sound public finances
and to far-reaching fiscal reforms supported by strengthened fiscal institutions. They emphasized the
need for a gradual approach to reducing the deficit and for the need to protect the vulnerable. The
change in the budget deficit target announced on January 20 is a timely and pragmatic change in
response to sharply lower energy prices than envisaged earlier. Their strong political commitment
will help them overcome implementation challenges. And although contingent liabilities are sizable,
government loan guarantees have a low probability of being called as they are granted strategically
to nonfinancial entities with healthy balance sheets.

MONETARY POLICY: GETTING THE BALANCE RIGHT
14.
Monetary policy stance. Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) raised its Overnight Policy Rate (OPR)
in July 2014, the first increase since May 2011. BNM has since adopted a wait and see attitude and
this cautious stance is appropriate for now taking into consideration lower expected inflation, the
slowdown in domestic economic growth, which will narrow the output gap, and increased
uncertainty surrounding the domestic and global outlook. In addition, a market-driven tightening of
domestic liquidity conditions is underway amidst capital outflows and intensified bank competition
for deposits following a slowdown in deposit growth and ahead of the phased implementation of the
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) beginning in June 2015. Moreover, there is no evidence of generalized
price pressures, and while GST introduction will push headline inflation up by 0.7–0.9 percent, it is a
one-off fiscal shock that should be accommodated and the impact could be offset by lower fuel

the Domestic and International Experience,” by Juan Jauregui and Lewis Murara (2015).

prices. In staff’s view, it would be prudent to move from the current accommodative monetary policy
stance towards a neutral stance consistent with the need to maintain price stability and curb financial
imbalances once the uncertainty surrounding the global outlook dissipates. The calibration of
monetary policy could prove challenging though: too slow a pace risks further build-up of financial
imbalances yet too fast risks an over-correction of the real economy. In the event global financial
volatility were to lead to large capital outflows and a squeeze on liquidity, BNM should stand ready
to provide liquidity to maintain orderly market conditions and prevent an excessive tightening in
monetary conditions.

Macroprudential policies. Monetary policy should continue to be complemented by
macroprudential policies. Until the rate tightening in July, and with the strength of the domestic
recovery uncertain, BNM appropriately relied on macroprudential policies to dampen financial risks.
BNM’s macroprudential policies were aimed at reducing credit and house price increases but have
also focused on enhancing the resilience of the banking system (see table 8 and paragraph 18).
16.
Authorities’ views. The authorities viewed the current monetary policy stance as being
appropriate to maintaining price stability and consistent with sustainable growth prospects. Their
step towards monetary policy normalization in July 2014 reflected assessments at the time of lower
downside risks to growth and an increase in upside risks to inflation. The decision also took into
consideration the risks of destabilizing financial imbalances. They viewed their current policy setting
as appropriate, taking into account: the increased uncertainty since the summer in the growth
outlook in major advanced and emerging markets economies; the fall in oil and commodity prices;
and the heightened risk of global financial volatility along with a moderating risk of domestic
financial imbalances. Further adjustments, given the significant uncertainty, remain contingent on
new information.

the ratio of credit-to-GDP is above long-term
trend. Real interest rates on deposits have been
negative since 2009 and deposit growth has slowed while savings in financial products have grown
strongly, raising concerns about disintermediation in the banking sector and excessive financial risktaking (see Appendix 8).
18.
Household debt. Household debt has
grown rapidly since 2008, reflecting growth in
both mortgages and personal credit. Just over half
the debt is owed on residential property, of which
about 70 percent are variable rate mortgages.
NBFI lending to households has doubled since
2009 and accounted for about 20 percent of
household debt at end-2013. Since 2008, house
prices have increased by 60 percent, outpacing
income and rental growth. Mitigating the risks are
strong financial buffers, with household financial
assets at just over twice household debt. However
lower income borrowers are more highly
leveraged. And while there are signs of cooling in the housing market, this could also be a temporary
respite reflecting property re-pricing ahead of GST implementation and the prohibition of Interest
Capitalization Schemes. Macroprudential measures have been successful in curbing risks. Personal
loan growth has slowed in response to measures targeting NBFIs in July 2013 and tighter caps on
debt-service ratios of lower income households. An enhanced framework for risk-based pricing is
also helping reduce loan applications and approvals. Nevertheless, additional macro-prudential
measures, such as LTV caps on second and first mortgages, may be needed.

Disintermediation. Deposit growth has been trending down since end-2011 and was
7.8 percent y-o-y at end November 2014, compared with 8.3 percent at end-2013. Growth in
deposits by individuals has also declined to 3.8 percent at end November, compared with 6.0 percent
at end-2013. Combined with strong loan growth this has pushed up the loan-to-deposit ratio to 86.6
percent at end-November 2014 compared with 84.6 percent at end-2013. The banks remain
predominately deposit funded but slow system-wide deposit growth along with the pending
implementation of the Basel III LCR is nudging up deposit interest rates. The new reference rate
framework for loan pricing, which came into effect in 2015, should ensure that higher funding costs
are passed on to retail lending rates, although this could be offset by stiff competition in the
mortgage market. A higher policy rate would help to ease these pressures by increasing deposit
rates, encouraging savings to remain in the banking system and curbing the pace of
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

disintermediation, while also reversing negative real interest rates and curtailing the growth in
leverage. Savings in financial products has grown rapidly since 2009, almost doubling in size; this
development reflects ongoing structural development in the financial market but also fueled by low
interest rates and the search for yields by investors.
22.
Foreign currency and overseas exposure of banks. Overseas operations of domestic banks
continue to expand within Asia, primarily into Indonesia and Singapore. Total assets of overseas
subsidiaries and branches grew by 16.3 percent during 2013. The assets of overseas operations are
dominated by loans and investment in plain vanilla debt securities and are largely funded by local
currency deposits, limiting potential cross-border funding risks. Malaysian banks are primarily
deposit-funded, however, foreign currency borrowing has increased, reflecting the foreign currency
needs of their customers and as part of the banks’ foreign currency liquidity management.
23.
Authorities’ views. The authorities view financial sector vulnerabilities as having moderated
pointing to a slowdown in the growth of household debt and in lending from the nonbank sector
and a decline in speculative behavior in the real estate market. These developments reflect
macroprudential measures taken by BNM and other government agencies in a holistic approach to
address rising household indebtedness and house prices. Their approach has been deliberately
gradual and targeted in order to avoid any over-correction. The authorities do not see the need for
additional policy action in this area at this time. Existing measures—such as risk informed pricing,
more rigorous borrower affordability assessment, continued supervisory vigilance over underwriting
practices and additional capital requirements—continue to be effective in strengthening the risk
taking practices of financial institutions (including the nonbanks). The authorities are of the view that
slowing deposit growth is a natural consequence of financial sector development.

EXTERNAL SECTOR
24.
External Sector Assessment. Following several years of external rebalancing, the current
account surplus shrank from 11 percent of GDP in 2011 to an estimated 3.5 percent of GDP in 2014.
The surplus was reduced in the second half of 2014 reflecting lower crude oil and gas prices,
although manufacturing exports increased and imports also fell. Despite the dramatic reduction in its
current account surplus in recent years, Malaysia’s external position is still assessed to be stronger
than is consistent with medium term fundamentals and desirable policies (see Appendix 4). For 2014,
staff assesses the gap between the cyclically-adjusted current account and its norm to be about
3 percent of GDP and Malaysia’s real effective exchange rate (REER) by about 10 percent (consistent
with the identified current account gap). In the medium term, staff projects the current account
surplus to decline to 2 percent of GDP as external rebalancing continues and lower oil and gas prices
reduce the oil and gas trade surplus. Foreign reserves, at about 85 percent of the Fund’s reserveadequacy metric, are assessed to be adequate given the flexibility of the exchange rate.

provides an important first line of defense against
the risks from rising debt. Strong bank and corporate balance sheets, which reduce fear of floating,
make this buffering role possible. Moreover, exchange rate flexibility and domestic currency
borrowing allow Malaysia to avoid the currency mismatch problem associated with “original sin”, by
creating more balanced risk-sharing with foreign creditors during risk off episodes. The current
account surplus, substantial official international reserves, and domestic investors are also important
sources of resilience. In particular, deep-pocketed institutions such as the Employee Provident Fund
(EPF) have ample liquidity and tend to step in during risk off episodes for opportunistic investments.
Hence, while potential outflows by foreigners could be larger in future, they are likely to be
accommodated by financial markets and could be offset by lower outflows by domestic investors.
26.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agree that the current account is likely to remain in
surplus for the foreseeable future, however, they disagree with staff’s assessment of external
imbalances, particularly with regard to the exchange rate, pointing to the absence of qualitative
evidence that the ringgit is undervalued. The uncertainty surrounding the EBA estimates and poor fit
in the case of Malaysia, suggests that caution is warranted in drawing conclusions about Malaysia
using this approach. In the authorities’ view, Malaysia has over the years, strengthened its resilience
to bouts of capital flow volatility, as demonstrated during the May 2013 Fed taper tantrum episode
with no spillovers to the real economy.

SUSTAINING GROWTH
27.
The record. Malaysia’s economic record is impressive. With growth averaging over 6 percent
since independence, its per capita income has reached the high middle income mark. Malaysia’s
public investment has reached a commendable 14 percent of GDP over the last 10 years, partially
funded through PPPs. This has contributed to an increase in the national investment rate in recent

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

MALAYSIA

years and helped improve productivity and growth. Malaysia’s diversified economy, political stability,
and attractive business climate hold promise that this growth momentum can be sustained.3
28.
Avoiding the middle income trap. Staff supports the authorities’ efforts for Malaysia to
avoid a middle income trap and reach high income status by 2020. They are intent on pursuing
reforms that would create the conditions for a knowledge-based economy. Their multi-year
transformation programs place appropriate emphasis on synergies between the ingredients needed
to deliver on this, including plans to improve infrastructure, upgrade the quality of education, and
boost Malaysia’s research and development spending and raise its effectiveness in generating homegrown innovation. A key priority is infrastructure investment, supported by enhanced public financial
management, which can ease bottlenecks in Malaysia’s growing urban centers, support sustainable
growth and help lower income inequality.4 As Malaysia’s demographic dividend slowly dissipates, it is
also necessary to further increase female labor force participation. Taken together, these reforms,
reinforced by better services delivery, continued financial sector development and greater financial
inclusion, and supported by a strong social safety net, can accelerate productivity growth and
encourage higher value-added activities. Staff encourages the authorities to take advantage of
current strong economic conditions that offer an opportunity to pursue these reforms.
29.
ASEAN economic integration. Continued economic openness, including through deeper
regional integration and the pursuit of high-quality trade agreements, should be an integral
component of the reform strategy. Malaysia stands to benefit from its outward economic orientation
and the strengthening of regional economic and financial integration underway, including the
creation of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2015. Bold steps forward in ASEAN and
regional integration, especially elimination of behind the border barriers, could reap substantial
dividends for Malaysia and ASEAN, including upgrading of services sectors, which are fast growing in
Malaysia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. For example, the income gain for Malaysia from the TransPacific Partnership (TPP) has been estimated at 6 percent relative to the status quo.5 Progress with
integration can also help unlock structural reforms yielding further gains.

In 2014, Malaysia ranked 18th in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Report, up two notches from 2013. See
http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings#. Malaysia also improved its ranking in the World Economic Forum’s Global
Competitiveness Index, where it ranked 20th among 144 countries in 2014/15, an improvement of four relative to
2013/14. See http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-competitiveness-report-2014-2015; and
http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GCR2013-14/GCR_Rankings_2013-14.pdf. The Doing Business indicators should be
interpreted with caution because of the limited number of respondents, limited geographical coverage, and
standardized assumption on business constraints and information availability.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Outlook. The economy continues to perform well and Malaysia is on track to reach high
income status by 2020, reflecting the authorities’ skillful economic management amidst an uneven
global recovery. Robust domestic demand supported by sound macro-financial policies is driving
strong, noninflationary growth in the face of uncertain external conditions and declining commodity
prices. Inflation remains subdued.
31.
Fiscal Reforms. The authorities are to be commended for seizing the opportunity afforded
by full employment, low inflation and falling energy prices to implement ambitious fiscal reforms.
These reforms will have far-reaching and long-lasting benefits, helping to diversify Malaysia’s
revenue system away from oil and gas and raising the efficiency and equity of public spending. Fiscal
implementation risks have receded. In staff’s view, the recent revision of the 2015 federal budget
represents a timely and pragmatic response to fast-changing international energy prices. The
decision to float RON95 petrol and diesel prices and implement the GST in April 2015 sends a strong
signal of the authorities’ commitment to achieving fiscal targets for 2015 and beyond. Also on track
is work to strengthen Malaysia’s social protection mechanisms and public financial management—
important elements in ensuring the political sustainability of subsidy and other reforms that are likely
to raise the prices of basic goods consumed by the public. The authorities would benefit from having
a fiscal risks management framework, including publication of an annual fiscal risks statement.
32.
Monetary policy. BNM took a step at normalizing monetary conditions in July but has since
paused. This cautious stance is appropriate for now taking into consideration lower expected
inflation, the slowdown in domestic economic growth, and increased uncertainty surrounding the
domestic and global outlook. Staff considers it prudent to move to a neutral monetary policy stance
as soon as the uncertainty in the external environment dissipates. However, should the global
financial markets turn turbulent, leading to capital outflows and a squeeze on domestic liquidity,
BNM should stand ready to provide liquidity to maintain orderly market conditions and avoid an
excessive tightening in monetary conditions.
33.
Managing financial sector risks. Despite the recent deceleration of growth in credit and
housing prices, risks of financial imbalances remain elevated, the result of a prolonged period of
extraordinarily low real interest rates and the consequent buildup of leverage in the economy. The
authorities are to be commended for successful implementation of macroprudential policies to date;
these have succeeded in lowering personal credit growth and reducing speculative behavior in the
property market. However, with interest rate normalization on hold due to heightened global
uncertainty, additional macroprudential measures may be needed to contain financial sector risks.
34.
Structural reforms. Favorable domestic economic conditions offer a window of opportunity
to continue structural reforms in the context of the 11th Malaysia Plan now under preparation. The
prospect of lower potential growth in the advanced economies makes it more challenging to sustain
strong noninflationary growth and provides additional impetus to the pursuit of structural reforms to
raise productivity growth. What is needed is to increase innovation activity, raise the quality of
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

education, address youth unemployment, and increase female labor force participation. Malaysia also
stands to benefit from its outward economic orientation and the strengthening of regional economic
and financial integration underway, including the creation of the AEC in 2015 and other regional
trade initiatives. Accelerating the pace of regional integration should help unlock Malaysia’s and
ASEAN’s economic potential.
35.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Malaysia take place on a
standard 12-month cycle.

from the 2012 and 2013 Article IV Consultations
Staff Advice

Policy Actions
Fiscal

Bring down debt to sustainable levels (e.g., pre­2008 levels
by 2020) and articulate credible revenue and spending
measures to achieve that target (2012 and 2013).

The authorities’ medium term fiscal consolidation and reform plans
remain on track. They reduced the federal deficit further, to 3.5 percent
of GDP in 2014 and are targeting a fiscal deficit of 3.2 percent of GDP
by 2015 and a balanced budget by 2020. They are developing a medium
term budget framework and have established a Fiscal Policy Committee
(FPC) that strengthened top down macro-fiscal control.

Strengthen macro-fiscal framework and public financial
management and issue a statement of fiscal risks (2012
and 2013).

The authorities are strengthening their fiscal systems and institutions. The
federal government and most GLCs are increasingly transparent,
although more progress is needed in this area, including publication of
the authorities’ medium term fiscal framework and DSA as well as a fiscal
risks statement, and more proactive communication and greater
transparency for all GLCs. The authorities are on track with multi-year
plans to adopt outcomes based budgeting and are piloting accrual
accounting in 2015 ahead of full adoption in 2016.

Broaden tax bases by implementing a GST and rationalizing
tax incentives (2012 and 2013).

GST implementation in April 2015 remains on track. The authorities are
undertaking a study on the effectiveness and costs of tax incentives.

Phase out subsidies and replace with targeted cash transfers
to the needy (2012 and 2013).

The authorities took additional decisive action in this area in 2014. These
included hikes in electricity tariffs (by 15 percent in January) and
additional increases in diesel and RON95 prices (by 10 percent, in
October). Then on December 1, they took advantage of declining
international crude oil prices to float fuel prices. They are also reviewing
their cash transfer schemes with a view to better targeting these to the
poorer segments of the population.

Monetary and Financial Policies
Begin normalizing monetary conditions, taking into account
the unusual degree of uncertainty around the external
environment and consistent with the need to safeguard
domestic financial stability (2012 and 2013).

The authorities raised their overnight policy rate by 25 bps in July and
then paused, consistent with the benign inflation outlook, declining
energy prices and the increased uncertainty surrounding the global
environment.

Continue to employ macroprudential policies to dampen
financial risks, such as those from rapid credit growth to
households and continue to enhance monitoring. Strengthen
monitoring of risks through collection of granular data on
household assets and liabilities (2012 and 2013).

The authorities continued use a variety of macroprudential measures and
introduced an enhanced framework for risk-based pricing to deal with
rising household indebtedness (Table 8). These efforts have reduced risks
from credit growth and house price increases and also increased the
resilience of the banking system, as evidenced by slowing down of
personal credit growth and reduction in both loan applications and
approvals.

Continue to monitor regional exposures; deepen cooperation between home and host country supervisors and
strengthen crisis prevention and mitigation mechanisms, as
outlined in Malaysia’s Financial Sector Blueprint (2012 and
2013).

The authorities continue to collaborate with other countries on
information sharing and collaboration in cross border supervision. The
adoption of the CMIM amendment and the conversion of AMRO to an
international organization in 2014 are important first steps in
strengthening regional surveillance and crisis prevention and mitigation.

Structural
Boost growth, productivity and inclusiveness by scaling up
infrastructure and by reforming the education system to
improve educational attainment (what students actually
know), upgrade skills and human capital, and retain
Malaysian-grown talent in the domestic economy (2012 and
2013).

The authorities are making progress on a broad front implementing a
variety of multi-year transformation programs, including the Economic
Transformation Program and Government Transformation Program,
whose substance is consistent with staff recommendations. They have
reformed the Ministry of Education in accordance with the Malaysian
Education Blueprint 2013−25) and consistent with good international
practice.

Strengthen the social safety net to make government policies
more inclusive and help reduce precautionary savings and
narrow the current account surplus (2012 and 2013).

The elimination of fuel subsidies and the improved targeting of cash
transfers should strengthen the budget and make government policies
more inclusive.

Develop defined contribution private pension plans and
increase the age of withdrawal from EPF accounts from 55.
Increase the retirement age for public workers to 60, in line
with the private sector (2012). Provide an option for workers
to receive their pensions in the form of annuities (2012).

A private retirement scheme (defined contribution) has been introduced.
The retirement age for private workers has been increased to 60 from 55,
although workers can still withdraw savings from the EPF at 55.

Appendix 2. Malaysia―The Impact of Lower Oil Prices
Introduction. This Appendix examines the impact of lower crude oil and natural gas prices on
Malaysia’s economy. The net effect is not clear cut a priori: Malaysia has an important hydrocarbons
exploration, extraction and processing sector but diversified long ago into industry and services,
which now account for more than 80 percent of its output.
Energy intensity, production and trade. Malaysia is a high middle income country with a
diversified economy dominated by services (55 percent of GDP) and manufacturing (25 percent), with
mining (8 percent) and agriculture (7 percent) following in the distance. Malaysia’s economy is also
highly open to international trade. Exports amount to over 70 percent of GDP, of which three
quarters are manufactures and oil and gas about 14 percent. This has undoubtedly contributed to
the energy intensity of Malaysia’s GDP remaining relatively stable, unlike the declining pattern seen
in most advanced economies.

Malaysia’s business and commodity cycles are
positively correlated; in addition, empirical evidence indicates that supply-driven reductions in
energy prices lead to lower GDP growth in Malaysia (see Selected Issues Paper). Domestic energy
consumption has until recently been subsidized.

Crude oil
Background. Malaysia is Southeast Asia’s second largest crude oil producer after Indonesia. Almost
all of its crude oil comes from offshore fields. Malaysia produces a light sweet crude oil called Tapis
whose price is a benchmark in Asia. Because Tapis oil can produce higher-value products, it is priced
higher than other benchmarks. During 2014, Tapis oil averaged about US$10 above the IMF’s
average spot price for crude oil. Futures markets indicate a Tapis crude average price of US$64 in
2015.

Oil production. Malaysia’s crude oil production for the first 11 months in 2014 was about 590,000
barrels per day (bbl/d), down from a peak of about 844,000 bbl/d in early 2000s. The decline was
caused by the maturing of oil fields and has prompted Malaysia to seek joint ventures with partners
and the government has provided incentives to undertake enhanced oil exploration in order to
prolong the life of mature oil fields.
Oil consumption and exports. Rapid economic growth in recent years has raised domestic energy
demand and consumption of crude oil. Coupled with declining output, this has resulted in a
reduction of crude oil exports. Malaysia remained a net exporter of crude oil and products in 2013,
with exports of 240,000 bb/d in 2013 and imports of 183,000 bb/d. It exports sweet crude, which
commands a premium, and imports heavier crude oils from the Middle East and other locations for
refining and domestic consumption. Primary export destinations are Australia, India, Thailand and
Japan.
Natural gas
Overview. Natural gas is playing an increasingly important role in Malaysia’s energy production and
trade. Its proven gas reserves of 83 trillion cubic feet are the third largest in Asia. Production comes
from offshore fields in Sabah and Sarawak and has steadily increased steadily to 2.3 Tcf per year in
2013. Domestic consumption has also risen to meet the needs of power generation (50 percent) and
industry (33 percent). Demand for natural gas is expected to remain strong as Malaysia transitions to
high income status, both to for power generation and industrial use. A number of ongoing and new
gas projects are under way. Interestingly, high demand for natural gas in peninsular Malaysia has
forced Malaysia to import LNG and invest in regasification.

Japan crude cocktail (JCC). In practice, prices for
Malaysia’s LNG exports tend to follow those of the JCC with a lag of about 3–5 months. These prices
tend to be higher than those for domestic consumers of gas, which are regulated by the
government. In addition, PETRONAS maintains a fleet of LNG tankers that meet spot demand for
natural gas worldwide.
Bottom line: the effects of lower oil and gas prices
Growth and inflation. Malaysia’s diversified production structure makes the economy resilient to
energy shocks. Thus, while the recent decline in oil prices is expected to be a drag on Malaysia’s
energy production, it should have only a modest negative overall effect on growth. (This is also
confirmed by empirical work presented in the related Selected Issues Paper, using a Vector Auto
Regression approach).1 For one, the large oil and gas sector comprises important downstream
activity which benefits from lower energy prices. In addition, lower energy costs can benefit the
nonenergy sectors, although the effect will be muted: at crude oil prices in the US$65–75 range,
domestic energy users face about the same cost of energy as before fuel subsidies were eliminated,
although this would change if Tapis oil prices remain below US$60).2 Improved prospects in the

United States and a weaker exchange rate should also provide a fillip to Malaysia’s sizeable exportoriented manufacturing sector and partial relief to the commodity sector. Regarding the impact of
lower energy prices on inflation, domestic fuel prices have declined significantly only since January 1.
While lower inflation in advanced economies tends to reduce inflationary pressures in Malaysia, this
impact is likely to be somewhat offset by the recent exchange rate depreciation.

Current Account. Lower energy prices are estimated to reduce Malaysia’s oil and gas trade surplus
by about 1¼ percent of GDP in 2015. Oil and gas volumes unlikely to be affected: they are set by
long-term contracts for gas exports and, moreover, Malaysia is a low cost gas producer. Export
earnings from crude palm oil (the major non-energy commodity export) will also be somewhat
reduced. The reduction of the commodities trade balance should be partially offset from expanding
manufacturing exports as lower oil prices boost the US economy—Malaysia’s most important final
export destination (18 percent of value added of exports). As a result the current account is expected
to remain in comfortable surplus, projected at about 2.9 percent of GDP in 2015.
Budget. Lower oil prices, fuel subsidy removal, and GST introduction will all have important
budgetary impacts, both on the revenue and

the Ringgit. Weaker global
growth would reduce export
volumes and commodity
prices, with second round

and fueling growth in leverage.
Medium
The main impact on Malaysia
will be through trade channels,
with a depreciated domestic

Expected Impact of Risk

Recommended Policy Responses

Medium

The exchange rate should be allowed to act
as a shock absorber, intervening only to
smooth excessive volatility. Liquidity support
(including in FX) could be provided. Given
limited fiscal space, any fiscal expansion
should be temporary, well-targeted, and
anchored in a credible medium term
consolidation plan.

High share of foreign holdings of sovereign
and BNM securities makes these markets
vulnerable to risk-on, risk off cycles, but this
is offset by demand by domestic institutional
investors. Recent and earlier outflow
episodes have had limited impact on credit
or the real economy.

Low to Medium
Higher household and corporate debt would
increase Malaysia’s vulnerability to external
shocks. In addition, continued rapid credit
growth could fuel asset price bubbles.

Low to Medium
Malaysia’s external debt is primarily
denominated in local currency, reducing the
balance sheet effects of U.S. dollar
appreciation. Resident companies with
foreign currency exposure are either hedged
or have a natural hedge.

A faster pace of fiscal consolidation would
offset the expansionary impact of strong
capital inflows on aggregate demand.
Macroprudential policies can help curb
growing domestic financial risks. Rapid
growth in shadow banking merits close
monitoring.

The exchange rate should be allowed to act
as a shock absorber, intervening only to
smooth excessive volatility.

Protracted period of
slower growth in
advanced economies
and emerging markets.

High
Trade (both volume and price),
would be the dominant
channel, with adverse second
round effects on domestic
demand.

Low to Medium
Prolonged weakness in external demand
would likely dampen domestic demand,
lowering growth, increasing unemployment,
dampening housing and asset prices,
weakening bank, corporate, and sovereign
balance sheets, in a negative feedback loop.

The ability of policy to provide a long-lived
cushion against a protracted slump is limited.
Policymakers would need to adjust to slower
medium-term growth although carefully
selected infrastructure projects and structural
reforms could increase productivity.

Implementation risks
associated with fiscal
consolidation and
reforms envisaged in
the 2014 and 2015
budgets. Reforms, such
as the GST introduction,
entail political, design,
and execution risks.

Low to Medium
Realization of implementation
risks would have adverse
consequences for the
credibility of fiscal policies,
raising the sovereign’s
financing cost and result in
higher interest rates
throughout the economy.

Medium to High
Higher financing costs for the sovereign, a
relatively high public debt, and failure to
implement fiscal reforms would exacerbate
concerns about public debt sustainability
together with a potential sovereign credit
downgrade.
Capital outflows further compound the
harmful effects of lack of fiscal resolve on the
economy.

The authorities’ ability to mount
countercyclical responses would be limited
and policy procyclicality would be
heightened.
The exchange rate should be allowed to act
as a shock absorber, intervening only to
smooth excessive volatility.

Sharp decline in house
prices, in a rising global
interest rate
environment: house
price growth has been
rapid in recent years

Low to Medium
The real economy would be
adversely affected through
weaker household and bank
balance sheets, along with
negative wealth and
confidence effects.

Medium
Household debt is high at 86 percent of GDP
and one half of this is mortgages. Offsetting
this are high household financial assets.

Monetary policy easing, exchange rate
flexibility, along with a temporary fiscal
stimulus anchored in a credible medium term
fiscal sustainability framework, could help
support growth.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF
staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability
below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the
source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix 4. Malaysia—External Sector Assessment
Overview of External Sector Developments
Current Account (CA)
Malaysia’s economy has undergone a large external rebalancing in recent years, and its once very
large current account surplus has declined by about 8 percentage points since 2011, to an estimated
3.5 percent of GDP in 2014. The current account narrowing is largely structural, reflecting Malaysia’s
comprehensive reform agenda, which has led to a broad-based boost in investment and a higher
investment-to-GDP ratio, while domestic consumption growth has also been strong. Rebalancing by
the rest of the world and, more recently, declines in energy and other commodity prices have also
contributed to the adjustment in the current account balance.
In terms of the saving-investment balance, the narrowing of the current account surplus reflects both
lower savings and higher investment. The savings rate declined sharply in 2008 at the onset of the
crisis, from about 38 percent to 35 percent of GDP, and then declined further to an estimate of about
31 percent in 2014. The fall in savings was driven by robust private consumption growth fueled by
rapid credit growth and, more recently, lower commodity incomes. Gross domestic investment rose
from 22 percent of GDP in 2008 to an estimate of about 27 percent in 2014, driven by investment in
large ETP­related projects, that are highly import intensive. This sustained and substantial increase in
investment is a welcome development. It is the first time in which the investment ratio has moved
significantly following its slump during the Asian financial crisis. It could help ease supply
bottlenecks, boost productivity, and support efforts to modernize the economy and raise incomes.

Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)
The ringgit strengthened by about 4 percent against the U.S. dollar during the first eight months of
2014 but has depreciated by about 10 percent between September and end-2014 as energy priced
turned sharply lower, other commodity prices weakened, and the U.S. dollar strengthened. In the
absence of large movements in inflation differentials, nominal depreciation of the ringgit leads to
real depreciation. Fluctuations in the multilateral effective exchange rate have been smaller than

42

those of the ringgit against the U.S. dollar, since currencies of other trading partners have had similar
movements against the dollar.

The Financial Account and Reserve Accumulation
Like other emerging market economies in recent years, Malaysia has experienced volatile capital
flows that reflected both push and pull factors, including shifting global risk aversion, low policy rates
in advanced economies and Malaysia’s strong fundamentals and deep financial markets. A healthy
(albeit narrowing) current account surplus and deep financial markets, including large institutional
investors, have limited the impact of capital flow volatility on the real economy.1 Malaysia has
typically recorded net capital outflows. Although net FDI flows are generally small, gross FDI flows
are large, reflecting the growing importance of Malaysia as a direct investor abroad. In the first three
quarters of 2014, net outflows were about 7 percent of GDP, with portfolio outflows accounting for
more than 2 percent of GDP.

which 50 percent is short-term debt. Foreign-currency debt was 45 percent of GDP. Ringgitdenominated debt held by nonresidents, particularly Malaysian government securities, has increased
rapidly since the global financial crisis. Malaysia’s slightly negative NIIP is a puzzle in light of its large
current account surplus in the last decade. Valuation adjustments and possible current account
measurement issues may be at play.

Standard Benchmarks
The External Balance Assessment (EBA), a regression based model analysis, suggests that the
cyclically adjusted current account is stronger (by about 4.3 percentage points of GDP) than the level
consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Applying the EBA methodology,
based on data and projections available as of October 2014, the estimated 2014 current account
norm for Malaysia is 0.2 percent of GDP, adjusted for relative output gaps and for commodity terms
of trade. The current account balance in 2014 is estimated at 3.5 percent of GDP and the cyclically
adjusted current account balance at 4.5 percent of GDP. The resulting EBA-estimated gap of
44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAYSIA

4.3 percent of GDP comprises policy gap contributions of about 1.1 percent of GDP, and an
unexplained residual of 3.2 percent. However, Malaysia’s current account surplus mainly reflects
factors that are not well captured in the EBA. This is the case in particular for insufficient social safety
nets, which drive up saving rates; bottlenecks to investment, resulting in relatively low private
investment rates, despite the recent increase. This first factor is not fully captured by health
spending, which is the variable used in EBA to proxy for safety nets. Taking these factors and the
uncertainty surrounding model estimates into consideration, we assess the current account gap to
be in the order of 4 percentage points of GDP.

EBA estimates Malaysia’s real effective exchange
rate (REER) to be 29 percent below levels
warranted by fundamentals and desirable policies,
although most of the gap (24 percent) is an
unexplained residual.2 Staff’s preferred estimate of
the degree of REER undervaluation is about
10.3 percent. This range is consistent with staff’s
view of the current account gap based on the
macro-balance approach and relies on the semielasticity of the current account with respect to
the REER. The estimate of the semi-elasticity is 0.29 and it takes into account Malaysia’s trade
openness and commodity exports.

Sources: CEIC Data Co. Ltd.; and IMF staff calculations.

The Role of Fiscal Consolidation
Malaysia’s multiyear fiscal consolidation also affects the current account in the medium term. Staff
estimates that every 1 percentage point improvement in the fiscal balance could strengthen the
current account by 0.4 percentage point, although the composition of the fiscal adjustment matters.3
The impact on the current account depends on how different measures affect saving and investment
of private agents. For example, fuel subsidy rationalization is likely to have a positive direct effect on
the current account. From a macroeconomic perspective, a stronger fiscal position increases the
sustainability of the external sector.
The Role of Oil and Gas Exports
Malaysia is an important commodities producer and exporter, including nonrenewable resources. Its
oil and gas trade surplus is estimated at 5.7 percent of GDP in 2014, and its current account deficit,
excluding oil and gas, is estimated at 2.2 percent of GDP. The EBA captures the fact that the current
account surplus is a salient characteristic of oil- and gas-exporting countries. Two aspects are

The fit of the EBA REER regression for Malaysia has fallen off in recent years, and part of the problem arises from the

important: first, from an intergenerational perspective, it is optimal for countries to save part of their
earnings from exporting nonrenewable resources, which results in an increase in their current
account balance. Second, the fraction of their resource earnings that is saved and exported also
depends on the longevity of these resources—according to the Permanent Income Hypothesis,
short-lived increases in national income should be primarily saved.4 In terms of the impact of oil and
gas exports on Malaysia’s current account, EBA estimates that Malaysia’s oil and gas reserves
contributes about 1.7 percent of GDP to the estimated current account norm.

Overall Assessment
Malaysia’s current account surplus is elevated on account of structural factors that boost private
savings and constrain public investment. From a multilateral perspective, and consistent with the
authorities’ intentions, stronger social safety nets and efforts to remove bottlenecks to investment

would help to further rebalance the economy towards domestic demand led growth and moderate
the current account surplus. The sharp reduction in energy prices in the second half of 2014, not fully
captured in the current EBA, should, if sustained, help to narrow Malaysia’s oil and gas trade surplus
and help reduce the CA gap. A sustained real depreciation should boost Malaysia’s noncommodity
exports and also reduce imports, thus working to offset the deterioration in the energy trade
balance.

Appendix 5. Malaysia—Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Background. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) framework for market access countries is used to
assess Malaysia’s debt sustainability and other risks related to its funding and debt structure. The
new framework uses a risk-based approach and expands upon the basic DSA to include: (i) an
assessment of the realism of baseline assumptions and the projected fiscal adjustment; (ii) an
analysis of risks associated with the debt profile; (iii) macro-fiscal risks; (iv) a stochastic debt
projection taking into account past macro-fiscal volatility; and (v) a standardized summary of risks in
a heat map. This DSA also examines the implications of implementation risks by considering a noadjustment scenario.
Coverage. This DSA is performed on federal budget and debt. It excludes local and state
governments and statutory bodies which borrow from the federal government or receive explicit
government guarantees. The liabilities of these entities are captured in the federal government’s
gross debt and stock of loan guarantees.1 Borrowing by GLCs, which are in some cases under federal
government guarantees, has increased in recent years and is projected to continue to increase in the
medium term.
Macro-fiscal assumptions. Growth is projected at 5.9 percent in 2014, slowing to 4.8 percent
in 2015, and expected to average 5 percent in the medium term. In staff’s baseline, the federal deficit
is reduced from 3.5 percent of GDP in 2014 to 3.2 percent in 2015 and 1.5 percent in 2019. The fiscal
consolidation assumed in the baseline is consistent with the authorities’ targets and is supported by
reforms being implemented in 2014-15, including the elimination of fuel subsidies and their gradual
replacement with targeted cash transfers to lower income groups. The introduction of a goods and
services tax (GST) in 2015 is also assumed.
Choice of framework. Malaysia’s relatively high federal debt and gross financing requirement call
for using the more detailed (higher scrutiny) version of the new DSA framework. Federal gross debt
increased sharply in 2009, reflecting sizable discretionary fiscal stimulus, declining real and nominal
growth, and a large fall in oil prices. Although growth has recovered since then, primary deficits have
remained high, pushing the debt-to-GDP ratio to about 55 percent, the authorities’ self-imposed
debt ceiling. Gross financing needs (GFN) are estimated at 10.6 percent of GDP in 2013 and are
expected to remain below 10 percent in the medium term.
Realism. An important strength of the new DSA framework is that it tests the realism of staff’s
baseline assumptions. The median forecast error for real GDP growth during 2005−13 is zero, so
there is no evidence of a systemic projection bias that could undermine the assessment. The median
forecast error for the GDP deflator is 2.9 percent, suggesting that staff forecasts have been
conservative. The median forecast error for primary balance of -0.72 percent of GDP suggests that
staff projections have been slightly pessimistic, but this forecast bias has declined recently.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAYSIA

Results. Cross-country experience suggests that the projected fiscal adjustment is feasible. The
maximum three-year adjustment in the cyclically adjusted primary balance (CAPB) over the
projection period is 3.2 percent of GDP, which is ambitious but realistic because it is premised upon
concrete measures endorsed by the government. The maximum level of the primary balance
(0.4 percent of GDP) assumed in the projections is reasonable when compared to the experience in
other market-access countries. Malaysia’s government debt-to-GDP ratio remains below 70 percent
and its gross financing needs remain below 15 percent of GDP under different macroeconomic and
fiscal shocks.


Under the baseline, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall to about 45 percent
by 2019. If, on the other hand, the projected consolidation were to not take place, as captured
under the constant primary balance simulation, federal debt would decline to only 50 percent of
GDP by 2019. Under most macro-fiscal stress tests, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio continues to
decline; however, in the event of a one standard deviation shock to real GDP growth, the federal
debt-to-GDP ratio initially rises to about 55 percent in 2016 and declines thereafter. A macrofiscal shock combined with a permanent 20 percent oil price shock leads to a flat debt-to-GDP
profile in the medium term. Stochastic simulations based on historical volatilities in Malaysia’s
macroeconomic variables show that the federal debt remains below 70 percent of GDP with high
probability of 90 percent. Gross financing needs under all scenarios remain below 12 percent.
The exception is the stress test where contingent liabilities are realized. In this scenario, gross
financing needs peak at about 17 percent before declining to below 12 percent by the end of the
projection horizon.



A contingent liability shock whereby the federal government would have to absorb all loans it
has guaranteed (about 15 percent of GDP) over two years would increase risks significantly. If the
economy were also hit by a persistent shock to growth and interest rates rose by 150 basis
points, the debt-to-GDP ratio would remain just below the 70 percent debt benchmark. Although
this is a low-probability scenario, the simulations underscore the risks posed by contingent
liabilities.

Heat map. The heat map (page 52) is benign. The exception is the high external financing
requirement (34 percent) and large share of public debt held by foreigners (30 percent). The external
financing requirement is above the upper threshold of early warning benchmarks and the share of
debt held by foreigners is also relatively high. As discussed in the main text, Malaysia has the
advantage that a significant portion of its foreign debt is denominated in its national currency and is
traded in deep and liquid domestic markets in which large domestic institutional investors are active,
making opportunistic investments, thus providing some comfort along this dimension.

Appendix 6. Malaysia—External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Summary. Malaysia’s external debt is relatively high at present but is expected to remain on a
steady downward trend over the medium term, falling to about 57 percent of GDP by 2019. The
12 percentage point decline in the external debt to GDP ratio from 2014 to 2019 mostly reflects
sustained current account surplus. Stress tests indicate that external debt would remain manageable
under a variety of shocks, including weaker GDP growth, a lower current account balance, and a
one-time 30 percent depreciation of the ringgit. Under most of these scenarios, the external debt to
GDP ratio rises above the baseline over the projection period by only modest margins. However, in
the case of the exchange rate depreciation scenario, the debt ratio would rise sharply to about
90 percent of GDP on impact, but would subsequently fall to 75 percent of GDP by 2019.

Appendix 7. Malaysia—2013 FSAP—High Priority
Recommendations
Strengthening Financial Sector Oversight
Implement proposed new Financial Services Act (FSA) at an early date; and strengthen legal and
regulatory requirements for Islamic banks.
The FSA and related Islamic Financial Services Act (IFSA) were implemented on June 30, 2013. The IFSA
strengthens legal and regulatory requirements for Islamic banks including those for capital, financial
reporting, and audit. BNM has re-issued some polices and regulations under the new legislation, covering
for example, powers relating to external auditors, financial reporting for Islamic banks, financial reporting
for takaful operator, and streamlining capital funds for Islamic banks.
Strengthen framework for consolidated supervision of financial holding companies (FHC) including
capital standards and risk management.
BNM has extended its legal powers over FHC with the adoption of FSA and IFSA in June 2013. BNM is
currently in discussion with the financial institutions (for financial groups which have not been identified
under the previous legislation, BAFIA 1989) to identify and assess the appropriate holding companies to be
designated as FHC by June 2015, as provided under the legislations. BNM has issued a strategy paper on
the Bank's plan with regard to regulation and supervision of financial groups; re-issued final regulatory
expectations extending to FHC the application of the standards on External Auditors and Financial
Reporting; issued regulatory expectations concept papers on Consolidated Capital Standards and
Compliance. During 2015, BNM intends to issue concept papers on Corporate Governance and Risk
Governance, applicable to financial institutions and FHCs.
Ground the operational independence of the Securities Commission (SC) by changing the legal provisions
on removal of Commission members and protections given to Commission members and its staff.
Related amendments to the SC Act have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for tabling at the
Parliament in March 2015.
Strengthen the definition of connected lending.
BNM issued a revised policy to strengthen the definition of connected lending that includes definition of
connected party, influential shareholders and close relatives. This was added in the ‘Guidelines on credit
transactions and exposures with connected parties’ in July 2014.

Labuan International Business and Finance Center
Impose prudential and regulatory requirements on Labuan financial institutions in line with international
standards and best practice.
During 2014, Labuan FSA has issued guidelines to enhance capital adequacy requirements for (Re)insurers;
to harmonize financial reporting standards to complement capital requirements; and to enhance the fitness
and propriety person requirements. During 2015, there are plans to issue guidelines to further enhance
capital guidelines for (Re)insurers; to increase Basel capital adequacy requirements for Banks; and to
provide explicit legal backing to prudential requirements.
Undertake more proactive engagement and effective communication of LFSA with home supervisors and
external auditors.
The BNM continues to sign new MoUs with home supervisors of Labuan entities (5 more added in 2013 and
2014). These cover exchange of supervisory information and collaboration in enforcement. Labuan FSA has
written to the home regulators of Labuan licensed entities to seek their confirmation that the coverage of
their consolidated supervision includes Labuan entities and had obtained some responses.

Systemic Risk Management
Formalize a high­level committee involving BNM, SC, PIDM and the fiscal authority with the responsibility
for ongoing systemic risk monitoring, information sharing and crisis action.
The Financial Stability Executive Committee (FSEC) formed in 2010 now also includes, the Chairman of the
58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAYSIA

Securities Commission as a permanent member of the Executive Committee (since 2012) along with the
BNM, PIDM and MoF.

Macro-Financial Risks
Enhance data capture for household sector to facilitate a more robust and granular monitoring and
assessment of household sector leverage and issues especially in accordance to income category; and
review effectiveness of macroprudential measures.
Enhancements to the data capture for households are undertaken in phases. The first phase involves the
matching of credit and income data from the tax authority. This is in progress and expected to be completed
by second half of 2015.
Adopt multiyear top-down and bottom-up macroeconomic stress testing, and introduce more
conservative credit loss parameters in bottom up exercise.
The Bank has implemented a top-down multi-year macro stress test framework in 2013, with a number of
enhancements to the framework made in 2014 which include enhanced satellite models for multi-year
income/expenses shocks and projections by detailed income segments (net interest income, net trading and
investment income, fee income and staff costs/overheads); quantitative models to project multi-year
balance sheet growth (credit, market, operational risk-weighted assets); and simulated multi-year Basel III
phase-out of capital instruments.
This is complemented with enhanced calibration methods (multivariate regressions) using a wider range of
data inputs to derive better estimates of conservative sectoral credit risk shocks (probability of default, loss
given default)
The application of the multi-year stress test for bottom-up stress test has also been rolled out in 2014.

money market mutual funds, and other funds;
with approximately 85 percent invested in
domestic assets. The nonbank sector allows savers and owners of wealth to diversify their portfolio
away from bank deposits and housing.
Recent developments. The nonbank sector in Malaysia has grown from about 140 percent of GDP
at end-2009 to about 165 percent of GDP by end-2013, with strongest growth in the assets under
management segment, which increased by over 30 percent over the same period. In addition,
growth in nonbank credit intermediaries out-stripped the pace of growth in the banking system. The
experience in Malaysia is not unlike other emerging market economies which have also experienced
rapid growth in nonbank financial intermediaries since the global financial crisis. For example, in
Thailand assets of the nonbank sector increased as a share of GDP by over 9 percentage points.
Nonbank credit intermediaries. Lending from nonbank credit intermediaries to households
increased strongly in recent years. It has doubled since 2009, accounting for about 20 percent of
household debt at end-2013 (see Box 4: Household Debt, 2013 Malaysia Staff Report), and
contributing to rapid growth in household debt from 72 percent of GDP at end-2009 to 86 percent
of GDP by end-2013. Much of the increase from nonbank intermediaries was in personal lending.
Credit risk is relatively low, especially loans to government workers which are serviced through
automatic salary deductions with an aggregate deduction cap of 60 percent. However, asset growth
was also driven in part by increased offerings of personal finance products with unfavorable terms,
such as unrealistically long tenors. Measures taken by BNM in July 2013, using powers to address
systemic risk outside the regulatory perimeter, have been very effective in curtailing risks and
slowing growth in unsecured personal credit (see text chart). These measures included limiting
tenors on unsecured personal lending and prohibiting unsolicited offers of credit. The Financial

BNM defines non-bank financial institutions as those which undertake financial intermediation (including credit
intermediation) activities that are not under its regulatory and supervisory purview. The Securities Commission
regulates the fund management industry; Provident Funds and some development Financial Institutions are
regulated by government ministries; and the Malaysian Co-operative Societies Commission has oversight of
cooperatives. Building Societies and Factoring and Leasing companies are unregulated.

Services Act 2013 (FSA) and Islamic Financial Services Act 2013 (IFSA) came into force on 30 June
2013. These gave BNM broad powers to regulate and supervise nonbanks, when there is a risk to
financial stability.

Linkages with the banking system. Systemic risks to the banking system, stemming from direct
linkages with nonbank financial institutions, are likely to be limited. Nonbank credit intermediaries
are small, noncomplex entities, funded by internally-generated funds, bank borrowing, debt
securities, and, in some cases, deposits. Direct linkages with the banks are limited—deposits of
nonbank financial institutions with banks represents about 6 percent of total bank deposits while
bank lending to nonbank credit intermediaries (including holdings of debt) amounts to just
2.1 percent of total banking system assets, and are covered by BNM’s regulations on single
counterparty exposures. Nevertheless, there could be indirect linkages with the banking system
through participation in the domestic capital markets.

Exchange Arrangement:
On July 21, 2005, Bank Negara Malaysia announced the adoption of a managed float with the
exchange rate of the ringgit to be monitored against an undisclosed trade˗weighted basket of
currencies. Based on information on the exchange rate behavior, the de facto exchange rate regime
is classified as “other managed.”
Malaysia maintains bilateral payments arrangements with 23 countries. The authorities have
indicated that these arrangements do not have restrictive features.
Capital control measures imposed in early 1994 and in 1998 in the wake of the Asian crisis have
mostly been lifted, except for the internationalization of the ringgit. In particular, since May 2001,
nonresident portfolio investors are freely allowed to repatriate their principal sums and profits out of
the country at any time. Malaysia further liberalized exchange control regulations during 2002−13.
The main measures were a relaxation of regulations on investment abroad by domestic institutions,
an easing of regulations on ringgit borrowing obtained by nonresidents from residents for use in
Malaysia, ringgit and foreign currency borrowing obtained by residents from non-residents,

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAYSIA

abolition of overnight limits on all foreign currency accounts maintained by residents and of the net
open position limit imposed on licensed onshore banks, allowing residents to open and maintain
foreign currency accounts for any purpose, abolition of several reporting requirements, and a
relaxation of the conditions on residents and nonresidents to enter into foreign exchange forward
contracts to hedge current and capital account transactions with licensed onshore banks.
The Malaysian authorities view remaining exchange control regulations as prudential in nature and
necessary to ensure the availability of adequate information on the settlement of payments and
receipts as part of the monitoring mechanism on capital flows. These controls do not contravene
Malaysia’s obligations under Article VIII.
Malaysia, in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions, maintains restrictions on payments
and transfers for current international transactions with respect to some designated individuals and
entities. These measures are maintained for the reasons of national and international security and
have been notified to the Fund pursuant to the IMF Executive Board Decision No. 144 (52/51).
Malaysia also restricts current international transactions between Malaysian residents and Israeli
companies and individuals; however, since these restrictions affect the underlying transactions
themselves, they are not subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Section 2(b).
Article IV Consultation:
Malaysia is on the standard 12˗month consultation cycle. Discussions for the 2013 Article IV
consultation took place during December 5–16, 2013 (IMF Country Report No. 14/80). Staff
discussions for the 2014 Article IV consultation were conducted on a mission to Kuala Lumpur
during November 13–24, 2014. In addition, a staff visit took place during June 18−27, 2014.
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Participation:
Malaysia conducted its first FSAP in 2012 (IMF Country Report Nos. 13/52, 13/53, and 13/56−13/60).
Technical Assistance:
Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD): A fiscal ROSC mission was fielded in May–June 2011. A mission
on fiscal risks took place in January 2013. A mission to assist with implementation of the Goods and
Services Tax was conducted in March 2014. Several missions on Public Financial Management were
fielded in 2014.
Legal Department (LEG): Missions were fielded in May and September 2011 to help draft a
Centralized Asset Management Corporations Bill, in the context of a three-year project to assist
Malaysia in implementing an asset forfeiture regime. Technical Assistance
Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM): Mission in October 2009 on macrofinancial
risk analysis and vulnerability analysis for corporate and financial institutions. Workshop in May 2010
on monitoring financial risks. Technical assistance missions on stress testing capital markets was
conducted in 2013.

Statistics Department (STA): A mission to assist with implementing the sixth edition of the Balance
of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) was conducted during May–June,
2013. Technical assistance missions on Government Financial Statistics were conducted during 2014.
Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT):
In November 2014, Malaysia’s AML/CFT regime was subject of an on-site assessment by the Asia
Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) under the new methodology of the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF), the global standard setter for AML/CFT. LEG participated in the assessment and is
contributing to the final report, which is scheduled for discussion in APG’s July 2015 Plenary. In
addition, FATF admitted Malaysia as an observer country in October 2014, and is working with
authorities towards meeting all requirements for full FATF membership.
Resident Representative/Advisor: None.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of January 10, 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, further efforts to improve statistics
for the consolidated general government and public sector are necessary.
National accounts: Currently, the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) compiles and publishes
annual and quarterly estimates of GDP by activity and by expenditure at current and constant prices, and
annual estimates for gross disposable income, saving, and net lending for the economy based on
the 1993 SNA. The quarterly data are released about two months after the reference quarter.
Price statistics: The CPI and the PPI are available on a timely and comprehensive basis. A revised CPI was
introduced in January 2011; it covers all 14 states and features a more disaggregated measure of the
consumption basket and updated expenditure weights based on a 2009/10 comprehensive household
income and expenditure survey.
Government finance statistics: There is a need to improve the timeliness, detail, and availability of data
on NFPEs and the state and local governments. Dissemination of more detailed data on nonlisted NFPEs’
assets and liabilities and domestic and foreign financing by type of debt instrument and holder would be
desirable; efforts in this direction will require continued close collaboration among the Economic Planning
Unit (EPU), the Treasury, and Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM). There is also a need to disseminate more
information on public private partnerships.
Monetary statistics: The monetary and financial statistics (MFS) are reported on a timely and regular basis
and are broadly in conformity with the Fund’s data needs. There is a need to improve the institutional
coverage of the financial corporations, sectorization of the domestic economy, and classification and
valuation of financial instruments to ensure full adherence to the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. In addition, due to the growing importance of insurance corporations, pension funds, and other
financial intermediaries in Malaysia, coverage of MFS should be expanded to include these institutions. The
MFS missions of January 2004 and 2005 developed an integrated monetary database to be used for
publication and operational needs of the BNM, STA, and APD. The Bank Negara Malaysia reports data in
STA’s standardized report forms (SRFs) which provide more detailed classification of certain items, fuller
sectoral and instrument breakdown, and currency aggregation. MFS based on the SRFs are published in
the quarterly IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics.
Balance of payments: Department of Statistics Malaysia compiles and publishes quarterly balance of
payments estimates in accordance with the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual and the SDDS.
The quarterly data are released three months after the reference quarter. No data are shown for the capital
transfers or acquisition/sale of nonproduced nonfinancial assets, and transactions in reserve assets are
computed as differences in amounts outstanding and thus include valuation changes. The international
investment position data on other investment—assets and liabilities—are reported only in an aggregate
form.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Malaysia subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). It is using a timeliness flexibility
option for general government operations (within six quarter lags after the end of reference year).

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Malaysia

On February 13, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Malaysia.
Malaysia’s well diversified economy continued to perform well in 2014. Growth accelerated to
5.9 percent, aided by robust domestic private demand and a recovery in exports. Lower energy
costs helped contain inflation to 3.1 percent despite the removal of fuel subsidies and increase in
electricity tariffs. Investment sustained its rising trend, reaching 26.8 percent of GDP in 2014,
fueled by accommodative financial conditions and continued public spending on infrastructure.
Growth is expected to moderate to 4.8 percent in 2015. Strong investment momentum should
help offset headwinds from continued fiscal consolidation. Lower energy prices will be a drag on
oil and gas production but should provide a boost to the large non-oil sector. Consumption
growth will moderate following the introduction of goods and services tax (GST), although a
strong labor market and supportive—albeit gradually tightening—domestic financial conditions
and lower energy costs should help consumers.
Fiscal consolidation is well timed, appropriately paced, and remains on track. The authorities
recently revised the federal budget resulting in a slight change of the budget deficit ceiling, to
3.2 percent from 3.0 percent of GDP, in a timely and pragmatic response to the sharp recent
decline in international crude oil prices. They took bold fiscal action in 2014, continuing a multiyear drive to reduce costly and untargeted subsidies. After raising electricity tariffs in early 2014,
they took advantage of lower energy prices in the second half of 2014 to reduce and ultimately
remove remaining gasoline and diesel subsidies. Subsidy reform together with the GST, which is
on track to be introduced in April, should help offset the reduction in energy revenues. They
should also help broaden the base of federal revenue system and diversify it away from volatile
oil and gas revenues. A strengthening of Malaysia’s social safety net is an integral part of the
authorities’ fiscal strategy. The removal of subsidies freed up resources that can be redirected to
better support poorer households through better targeted cash transfers. Malaysia is making
progress in reforming its fiscal institutions. Top-down fiscal management and control are also

being strengthened and the size of supplementary budgets has been substantially reduced. These
reforms will help reinforce the sustainability of Malaysia’s public finances and make the fiscal
system more effective in promoting efficiency, equity and growth.
Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) took a step at normalizing monetary conditions in July but has
since paused as downside risks to growth increased and inflation remained low, while risks to
financial stability abated. Headline inflation will increase slightly, to 3.2 percent in 2015 from
3.1 percent in 2014, reflecting the net impact of subsidy rationalization, GST implementation,
and exchange rate depreciation. BNM has adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and this cautious
stance is appropriate for now taking into consideration lower expected inflation, the slowdown in
domestic economic growth, and increased uncertainty surrounding the domestic and global
outlook. It would be prudent to move to a neutral monetary policy stance as soon as the
uncertainty in the external environment dissipates. Malaysia’s financial system is sound and
well-placed to withstand stresses, including from a potentially bumpy and asynchronous
normalization of monetary policies in the advanced economies. The high level of household debt
together with large participation of foreign investors in Malaysia’s financial markets warrant
continued vigilance. The flexible exchange rate system and substantial financial buffers, as well
as offsetting action by domestic institutional investors, provide multiple lines of defense against
capital flow volatility.
Favorable domestic economic conditions offer a window of opportunity to continue structural
reforms to raise productivity growth by increasing innovation, raising the quality of education,
addressing youth unemployment, and increasing female labor force participation. Malaysia also
stands to benefit from its outward economic orientation and the strengthening of regional
economic and financial integration underway, including the creation of the ASEAN Economic
Community in 2015 and other trade initiatives. Accelerating the pace of regional integration
should help unleash Malaysia’s and ASEAN’s economic potential.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They considered that Malaysia’s
economic prospects remain favorable, notwithstanding risks from softening external demand,
volatile capital flows, and lower commodity prices. Directors shared the view that Malaysia is
well-placed to address these risks, given a track record of skilful macroeconomic management,
strong policy frameworks, and a sound financial system.
Directors commended the authorities’ continued commitment to fiscal prudence. They welcomed
their response to weaker oil-related revenues, especially the removal of poorly-targeted fuel
subsidies which creates budgetary space for needed social and capital investment. Directors
cautioned, however, that a prolonged period of depressed commodity prices may require further
fiscal adjustment. Accordingly, they encouraged the authorities to consider broadening the

revenue base, phase out remaining untargeted subsidies, and further improve public financial
management and social transfers.
Directors agreed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate, given
subdued inflation and the likelihood that prospective price increases related to the introduction of
a value-added tax will be offset by lower energy prices. More broadly, they commended Bank
Negara Malaysia’s cautious policymaking to ensure that monetary policy continues to support
non-inflationary growth and financial stability.
Directors noted that Malaysia’s financial system is sound and benefits from a strong regulatory
and supervisory framework. They considered that policies have been successful so far in
containing financial vulnerabilities, although high household debt warrants continued vigilance.
In this regard, Directors cautioned that additional macroprudential measures could be needed if
the low interest rate environment leads to excessive leverage.
Directors welcomed the ongoing reduction of Malaysia’s current account surplus, which reflects
in part the economy’s rebalancing toward domestic demand. They took note of the staff’s
assessment that the external position remains somewhat stronger than warranted by mediumterm fundamentals, but stressed the uncertainty surrounding such an assessment.
Directors praised Malaysia’s impressive strides in economic development, which is the outcome
of comprehensive initiatives to boost investment, improve infrastructure, and upgrade human
capital. They agreed that Malaysia’s commitment to regional integration should also help support
the country’s transition to high-income status by further enhancing competition and productivity.

Statement by Mr. Wimboh Santoso, Executive Director for Malaysia and
Ms. Nooraihan Mohd Radzuan, Advisor to Executive Director
February 13, 2015
1.
On behalf of the Malaysian authorities, we would like to thank the IMF team for the
constructive and open discussions on macroeconomic developments and policy issues in
Malaysia. For the most part, there is broad agreement on almost all the major policy thrusts.
We are further encouraged by the assessment that the current policy stance is appropriately
calibrated to reflect the outlook and risks facing the economy. This statement will provide an
update on the latest developments in Malaysia and elaborate on selected policy issues.
Economic Outlook
2.
The outlook for the Malaysian economy remains favorable, despite the more
challenging global environment. The authorities have projected the Malaysian economy to
expand at a steady pace of between 4.5% and 5.5% in 2015, driven mainly by domestic
demand. The staff estimates and recent forecasts by private sector economists are therefore,
in line with the authorities’ projection. Private consumption will remain supported by the
steady rise in incomes, stable employment conditions and the additional disposable income
from the lower oil prices. Investment activity is projected to remain resilient, with
broadbased capital spending by both the private and public sectors cushioning the lower oil
and gas-related investment. On the external front, the expected improvement in manufactured
exports will partly offset the impact of lower commodities exports. With lower energy and
commodity prices, inflation for 2015 is expected to be lower than earlier anticipated. The
projected lower energy prices will partially offset other domestic cost factors, including the
impact of the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).
3.
Malaysia has, over the last decade, embarked on various structural reforms and
initiatives to achieve strong foundations and well-diversified economic structure. Thus, while
the commodities sector has an important role in the economy, the existing structure of the
economy will allow the country to weather the negative impact from the sharp decline in
commodity prices. The mining sector accounts for only 8% of GDP, a relatively small share
compared to the services (55% share of GDP) and manufacturing (25% share) sectors. In
terms of exports, the commodities sector accounts for 23% of gross exports while the bulk of
Malaysia’s exports is manufactured goods (76% of gross exports). In addition, the higher
disposable income from the lower fuel prices will offset the fall in commodity-related
income. Employment in the commodity sectors account for only 13% of total employment,
compared to 60% and 17% shares in the services and manufacturing sectors, respectively.
While the oil shock will affect investment in the oil and gas sector, capital spending in
Malaysia remains broad-based, with 83% of the growth in total investment in 2013 coming
from the services and manufacturing sectors.
External Sector Assessment
4.
The current account balance will narrow but is expected to remain in surplus. While
the sharp decline in energy prices will result in a narrowing of the commodities surplus,
exports of manufactured goods will continue to expand, in line with the improvement in the

2
global growth trajectory. Malaysia’s external sector will continue to reflect the changing
global environment and the on-going structural transformation of the domestic economy.
5.
Given the significant degree of integration with the global economy and financial
markets, Malaysia has experienced increased volatility in recent months amid shifts in global
liquidity and heightened uncertainty, particularly with regard to global growth prospects and
the decline in commodity prices. This has led to capital flow reversals and a depreciation of
the Malaysian ringgit, developments that have also affected other emerging economies.
Notwithstanding the challenging external environment, Malaysia’s well-developed financial
markets and well-capitalized banking institutions have ensured that these reversals of flows
were effectively intermediated by the financial system, without adversely affecting real
economic activity. Greater exchange rate flexibility, a healthy level of international reserves
and the availability of a wide range of monetary instruments have also accorded authorities
the policy flexibility to manage these external shocks. In this regard, the recent market
overreaction that resulted in portfolio flow reversals provided clear evidence of the need for
an open economy like Malaysia to have a sufficient reserves buffer. Going forward,
authorities will remain focused on their mandate to maintain orderly financial market
conditions and mitigate risks of abrupt adjustments to the exchange rate over a short period
of time in order to minimize potential disruptions to the real economy.
Monetary Policy
6.
The current monetary policy stance remains accommodative and is assessed to be
appropriate given the balance of risks to the outlook for domestic growth and inflation,
having taken into consideration the greater downside risks emanating from the external
environment and the lower than anticipated inflation going forward. The Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) of BNM will continue to carefully assess the external developments and
their implications for the Malaysian economy. The MPC will also continue to monitor the
risks of destabilizing financial imbalances. This is to ensure that the monetary policy stance
is consistent with the longer-term sustainability of the Malaysian economic growth.
Fiscal Policy
7.
The Malaysian authorities have remained steadfast in their commitment towards
fiscal consolidation. Since first announcing its target of achieving a balanced budget by 2020,
the Government has consistently achieved its annual fiscal targets. The fiscal consolidation
strategy was comprehensive, with reforms to broaden the Government’s revenue base and
reduce reliance on oil-related revenue over the longer-term. As a result, the share of oil
related revenue to total Federal Government revenue has fallen from around 40% in 2009 to
30% in 2013.
8.
Going forward, the conduct of fiscal policy will continue to be centered on ensuring
sound public finances while remaining supportive of policies for sustainable and balanced
economic growth. In response to the significant decline in oil prices, the Government had
proposed a mix of expenditure-optimization and revenue-enhancement measures to ensure
that fiscal consolidation would remain on track. As a result of these measures, the fiscal
deficit is expected to further decline from 3.5% of GDP in 2014 to 3.2% of GDP in 2015, the
sixth consecutive decrease in the fiscal deficit to GDP. While this is a more gradual

3
consolidation compared to the earlier announced fiscal deficit target of 3%, the course of
fiscal consolidation remains intact and will be underpinned by reforms to broaden the
Government’s revenue base, the removal of fuel subsidies and greater optimization of
supplies and services expenditure. As a result of the measures announced, the Federal
Government debt-to-GDP ratio will be contained within 55%.
9.
The Malaysian authorities remain committed to ongoing reforms to strengthen public
finances over the long-term. Fiscal reforms and a more strategic management of resources
will continue to be judiciously pursued on several fronts without undermining economic
growth and the well-being of the population, particularly, the low-income and vulnerable
groups. In light of the lower oil prices, the Government had removed fuel subsidies and
implemented a managed float system for fuel prices. Of significance, the broad-based and
more efficient Goods and Services Tax (GST) is on target to be introduced in April 2015.
The move is expected to streamline the present tax structure to make it more efficient,
transparent and business friendly. Other initiatives to enhance fiscal sustainability include the
implementation of accrual accounting and the adoption of outcome-based budgeting. Apart
from embracing fiscal reforms to strengthen the Government’s financial position, fiscal
resources will be geared towards invigorating high value-added investments, intensifying
human capital development and enhancing public sector delivery.
Financial Sector
10.
Financial stability continued to be preserved in 2014 supported by financial strength
and capital buffers both at the system and institutional levels. Stress tests undertaken by the
authorities and staff have demonstrated the resilience of the banking system to major
economic and financial market shocks. Of significance, the recent volatility in financial
markets has not disrupted financial intermediation, with lending activities continuing
smoothly. Businesses, including small and medium enterprises, continue to have access to
financing from banking institutions and the capital market. Banking system liquidity also
remains ample.
11.
Growth in household debt has moderated since its peak in 2010, underpinned by the
moderation in personal financing. Risks to domestic financial stability arising from
household indebtedness remain manageable, supported by strong overall household financial
capacity as well as continued improvement in the quality of new household debt. At the
aggregate level, household financial assets remained healthy at 2.2 times of household debt.
The likelihood of a material impact on the stability of the financial system arising from
exposures to the household sector remains low, given the strong capitalization and financial
strength of financial institutions.
12.
While banking system deposit growth has moderated, this has largely been driven by
a confluence of factors. These include growing investment abroad by large domestic
institutional investors such as pension and provident funds and asset and fund management
companies for revenue diversification and increase investments in higher yielding assets such
as unit trust funds for wealth management and retirement savings purposes by households via
the institutional fund/asset managers.

4
13.
The macroprudential alongside fiscal measures introduced by the authorities in 20102013 have yielded positive results. Growth in personal financing by the non-bank financial
sector has slowed considerably and growth in house prices has moderated. These measures
were wide-ranging and include enhancing responsible lending practices by key credit
providers, increasing the property gains tax, prohibiting the development and financing of
property projects with elements of interest capitalization schemes and requirements on
greater transparency in property prices by developers. Furthermore, the measures announced
were targeted, in order to minimize unintended cross-sectional spillovers. Instead of a
broadbased LTV ratio limit, the limit was aimed to curb speculative purchases whilst
ensuring that eligible first time home buyers and those investing in a second house for wealth
diversification would continue to have access to financing. Whilst the authorities deem the
current macroprudential measures to be sufficient at this juncture and risks are assessed to be
contained, the authorities continue to maintain their surveillance and supervisory vigilance at
a heightened level. The authorities stand ready to act preemptively to address any resurgent
of build-up of risks and threats to domestic financial stability.
14.
The legislative framework underpinning Malaysia’s financial sector was further
strengthened with the enactment of the AMLATFA (Amendment) Bill addressing the risks
and threats of money laundering and terrorist financing. In addition, the enactment of the
Netting of Financial Agreements Act has now established Malaysia as a netting friendly
jurisdiction.
Regional initiatives
15.
Malaysia’s chairmanship of ASEAN in 2015 comes at a critical juncture, with the
ASEAN Economic Community 2015 (AEC 2015) expected to be established by the end of
the year. Through collective efforts, the establishment of AEC 2015 aims to create a single
market and production base and will entail the reduction or elimination of tariffs, the
progressive liberalization and removal of barriers to trade and services, much of which have
already been accomplished. As ASEAN chair in 2015, Malaysia will also help to develop the
region’s 10-year post-integration plan which will steer ASEAN’s continued growth strategies
from 2016 to 2025.
Reforms to enhance growth potential
16.
Reform initiatives to accelerate Malaysia’s transformation into a high-income
economy by 2020 have also advanced. In recent years, the Government had implemented
farreaching reforms to raise productivity, including raising the retirement age, implementing
the minimum wage policy and enhancing the quality of education through the National
Education Blueprint. Going forward, reform initiatives include tabling the Companies Bill
2014 which introduces provisions relating to Corporate Insolvency Law and the
implementation of measures to improve logistics and enhance trade facilitation.
Final remarks
17.
The authorities remain vigilant that the global economy is facing important economic
shifts. The commodity price shock is sizable and there remains considerable uncertainty
about global growth prospects. Investor sentiments have also been adversely affected.
Nonetheless, the Malaysian economy is well-diversified, which will allow the economy to

5
weather these shocks with greater resilience. Economic fundamentals remain sound
following decades of policy efforts to strategically and pro-actively address areas of
vulnerabilities, and to build buffers to absorb any shocks to the system. While growth may be
affected in the short-term, the Malaysian economy will continue to perform well, driven by
the private sector across a diversified range of economic activities. Of importance,
employment remains strong and incomes are rising. Inflation will remain anchored and the
current account balance will remain in surplus. The strength of Malaysia’s external position
remains intact, with international reserves at healthy levels and external debt within prudent
limits.
18.
The authorities are pleased to inform the Executive Board that they agree to the
publication of the full suite of reports, covering the 2014 Malaysia Article IV Staff Report
and the Selected Issues Papers.
