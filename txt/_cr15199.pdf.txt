IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Singapore
On July 15, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Singapore.1
As Singapore celebrates its 50th Anniversary this August, its economy continues to deliver strong
noninflationary growth will full employment. Growth moderated to 2.9 percent in 2014 from
4.4 percent in 2013, on the back of the slow global recovery, domestic restructuring, and the
turning of credit and housing cycles. Inflation declined to 1 percent in 2014 from 2.4 percent in
2013. In response to lower expected inflation and a more uncertain growth outlook, the Monetary
Authority of Singapore (MAS) reduced the pace of appreciation of the nominal effective
exchange rate in January 2015. Private sector credit growth and house prices continued to ease,
supported by the total debt service ratio (TDSR) framework. Singapore’s financial markets have
been resilient to the volatility associated with diverging global monetary conditions. The current
account surplus rose by 1.2 percentage points to 19.1 percent of GDP in 2014.
Growth is projected to remain steady at about 2.9 percent in 2015. Activity will be supported by
accommodative macroeconomic policies, lower energy costs and a gradual recovery in external
demand. The relative easing of monetary policies in January should help export-oriented sectors.
Fiscal policy is being recalibrated to deal with a rapidly aging population and to maintain
Singapore’s competitive edge while also fostering equality of opportunity and inclusiveness. It
will also deliver a sizable impulse in 2015, providing added insurance to real activity. Headline
and core inflation are expected to average 0 and 1 percent in 2015, respectively, before both
rising to 1.8 percent in 2016. The current account surplus is projected to increase by about
1.3 percent of GDP, on the back of lower oil import prices. As a city state with a very open
economy, Singapore’s economy is exposed to external shocks, including slower growth in
advanced and emerging economies and side effects from volatility in global financial markets.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

These risks could be exacerbated by elevated levels of private indebtedness, but the authorities
have ample policy and response space.
The economic restructuring underway aims at reducing reliance on foreign workers and is
expected to ultimately raise capital-labor ratios and productivity growth but is subject to
transition costs. The current account is expected to moderate over the medium term with the
drawdown of accumulated pension savings in response to aging. Additional government
spending to strengthen health care and other infrastructure and make the distribution of
consumption more even within and across generations is also expected to contribute to the easing
of the current account surplus going forward.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ consistent pursuit of sound macroeconomic and
pro-growth policies, which have resulted in impressive increases in living standards over the past
half century. They noted that following a moderation last year, economic growth is expected to
remain stable in 2015. However, as a highly open economy, Singapore is exposed to external
risks, including a protracted slower growth in advanced and emerging economies and volatility
in global financial markets. Directors encouraged the authorities to be vigilant and maintain
prudent policies, while noting that Singapore’s strong fundamentals and ample buffers can help
absorb external shocks. More broadly, Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to restructure
Singapore’s growth model and address income inequality, raise labor productivity, and deal with
population aging.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ expansionary fiscal stance and relative easing of monetary
policy in January in view of subdued inflation prospects and downside risks to growth. They
considered that monetary policy should continue to respond flexibly to evolving inflation and
real sector developments.
Directors commended the authorities’ continued maintenance of high regulatory and supervisory
standards in the financial sector, including progress in implementing the FSAP
recommendations. They welcomed the moderation in credit growth, progress in reducing foreign
currency liquidity risk, and the modest and gradual price adjustments in the property market. At
the same time, they called for continued vigilance in view of the high levels of household
leverage and corporate debt. In this regard, they welcomed the authorities’ plan to monitor
developments in credit and asset markets and to adjust macroprudential tools as necessary.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors also recommended continuous efforts to bring the AML/CFT framework in line with
enhanced international standards.
Directors supported the authorities’ aim to transition the Singapore economy to a new growth
model to boost productivity while reducing reliance on foreign workers. They agreed that
investment in infrastructure and education and healthcare facilities will help underpin
productivity and growth, while incentives to upgrade skills and enhance business practices
should facilitate the transition. Directors highlighted the merit of a flexible and pragmatic
approach to restructuring, including potential adjustments to foreign worker policies and
investment incentives, as needed, in light of experience.
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to reduce income inequality, raise labor force
participation, and strengthen pensions and health care amid a rapid aging of the population. They
welcomed recent reforms to the defined-contribution pension system, including budget support
for pensioners with lower incomes and measures to raise the adequacy of retirement incomes.
They recommended further enhancements to the Central Provident Fund, and looked forward to
the conclusions of the authorities’ review of additional measures to enhance retirement savings.
Directors took note of the staff assessment that Singapore’s external position is substantially
stronger than is consistent with medium-term fundamentals. They acknowledged that
Singapore’s status as a trading hub and financial center, as well as its very high per capita
income, rapid population aging, and pension system, are non-standard factors relevant to its
external assessment. They noted that the drawdown of pension savings, additional age-related
spending, and lower immigration are expected to help reduce the current account surplus over
the medium term.

STAFF REPORT FOR 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 25, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and risks. As Singapore prepares to celebrate its 50th anniversary in August,
its economy continues to perform well. Despite the slow pace of the global recovery
and a gradual decline in domestic credit growth and housing prices, projected
economic growth of about 2.9 percent in 2015 is consistent with full employment and
price stability. Growth is projected to slow down in the medium term, consistent with
reduced reliance on foreign workers and rapid population aging. The authorities’ new
growth model takes into account Singapore’s physical resource limits and aims to
boost labor and land productivity. Risks to the baseline are tilted to the downside:
Singapore’s highly open economy is exposed to external shocks, most notably slower
global growth and the side effects from volatility in global financial markets.
Domestic vulnerabilities, including elevated private indebtedness, can amplify the
impact of external shocks.
Policies. In January, in response to a decline in expected inflation and a more
uncertain outlook for growth, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) reduced
the pace of appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) band. The
more benign near―to medium-term inflation outlook warrants the relative easing of
monetary policy. The monetary policy framework is robust and flexible but rising
domestic leverage and heightened global interest rate and exchange rate volatility
warrant heightened vigilance in assessing the balance of forces between the various
channels of monetary policy. Singapore continues to maintain high regulatory and
supervisory standards. Recent macroprudential measures have contributed to
smoothing the cycle for credit and house prices. The budget’s focus on boosting
productivity, equality of opportunity, and inclusiveness is laudable, while the fiscal
impulse is opportune given cyclical conditions.
Restructuring and population aging. Building on Singapore’s success and faced
with high income inequality and the physical limits of a city state, the authorities have
re-engineered the country’s growth model to boost productivity while reducing
reliance on foreign workers. The restructuring entails lower steady state growth and a
shift in the functional distribution of income toward labor. Incentives provided for
firms to increase productivity-enhancing investments and for Singaporeans to
upgrade their skills should help ensure a successful transition. But slower potential
growth and a lower share of profits in income could affect those investments, and
gains in productivity could be realized only slowly. Flexibility in the application of
foreign worker policies and continued review of incentives are warranted. The
authorities are recalibrating fiscal policies with associated inter―and intragenerational impacts in order to proactively deal with Singapore’s rapid population
aging, enhance inclusiveness and reduce inequality, while remaining true to the
principles of individual responsibility and sound public finances.

SINGAPORE

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Introduction
1.
Singapore’s macroeconomic performance during the past half century has been
impressive. Apart from achieving rapid economic growth and low unemployment, Singapore’s
remarkable development journey has been characterized by a progressive broadening and
deepening of its economic structure. In addition to being a financial center and trading hub,
Singapore retains a competitive manufacturing sector which has played an instrumental role in
allowing the city state to achieve one of the highest living standards in the world. Concomitantly, the
role of service sectors has evolved from catering mostly to domestic demand to serving the growing
Asian market. The next phase of economic development will be based on an even greater shift to a
knowledge- and skills-based economy, driven by productivity gains to overcome inevitable supplyside constraints.
2.
Amid changing economic and social settings, the country has been reinventing itself.
This year’s Article IV consultation takes place against the backdrop of the recent passing of Lee
Kwan Yew who has led the country for the first three decades of its establishment, remained a
cabinet member for another two decades, and stayed influential until his death. Singapore is also
celebrating the 50th anniversary of its independence and is gearing up for parliamentary elections,
which are to be held no later than January 2017. The incumbent People’s Action Party is still firmly in
charge. However, its popular support had been slipping before it fell another 6 percentage points, to
60 percent, in the 2011 election. In response to the physical limits of a city state and high inequality,
the government has re-engineered Singapore’s growth model toward more productivity-driven
growth by reducing reliance on foreign workers, providing incentives for firms to upgrade business
practices and capital, and raising productivity of the resident labor force. Efforts to enhance
inclusiveness and secure retirement income adequacy have also been stepped up.
3.
Macroeconomic and financial policies have been broadly in line with past Fund advice.
The authorities maintained a moderately tight monetary policy stance through 2014, before
reducing the tightening bias slightly early this year in response to a significant downward
adjustment in the inflation outlook, reflecting the large oil price shock, and uncertainties about the
global outlook. Singapore’s budget this year includes well articulated plans to increase social
spending and infrastructure investment over the next five years, consistent with past staff
recommendations. These plans will promote inter- and intra-generational equity, strengthen social
safety nets, foster investment and help Singapore maintain its competitive edge. Additionally they
will contribute toward narrowing the current account surplus. The authorities have also continued to
make good progress in implementing the 2013 FSAP recommendations. Consistent with staff advice,
the authorities maintained existing macroprudential policies aimed at reducing risks from the
property market. A new prudential measure limiting the amount of unsecured borrowing was
introduced this year, which will reign in excessive borrowing by a small minority of households.
Finally, the authorities took several measures to bring the Anti Money Laundering / Combating the

Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework more in line with the enhanced international standards
of the Financial Action Task Force.

B. Recent Developments
4.
Singapore’s economy continues to perform well in 2014–15 but activity has been
impacted by reduced reliance on foreign workers, the slow global recovery, and the turning of
credit and housing cycles. The moderation in growth from 4.4 percent in 2013 to 2.9 percent in
2014 partially reflects the transition to the lower trend growth rate dictated by reduced contribution
from labor supply. Cyclical factors reflecting a slow and uncertain global recovery and the turning of
credit and housing cycles have also played a role. In 2014, consumption growth slowed down
considerably and gross fixed investment contributed negatively to growth, held back by the
uncertain economic outlook and its impact on investor confidence (Figure 1). Growth in the first
quarter of 2015 was robust at 3.2 percent (q/q) in annualized seasonally-adjusted terms, following a
strong fourth quarter in 2014, with both consumption and investment showing signs of modest
pick-up. Private sector credit growth slowed to 4.6 percent in April 2015 (y/y), the slowest pace in
five years. House prices have continued to decline modestly and are below their peaks by 9 percent
and 6 percent in the public resale and private market segments as of the first quarter of 2015,
respectively. The pace of house price decline has been slower over the past 7 quarters, suggesting
that policy actions such as the introduction of the total debt service ratio (TDSR) framework in mid2013 have helped engineer the soft landing targeted by policy makers.

6.
The current account surplus increased in
2014, reflecting low import demand and lower
energy prices, while exports have been restrained.

Inflation has declined significantly on the
back of a steep decline in oil prices and softer
housing and car permit prices, while a tight labor
market has not so far translated into inflation
pressures. Headline inflation fell to -0.3 percent (y/y)
in the first quarter of 2015, down from an average of
1 percent in 2014, and 2.4 percent in 2013. Core
inflation also eased, to 1.1 percent (y/y) in the first
quarter of 2015 (Figure 1). The labor market has
remained strong and unemployment has declined
below 2 percent. A remarkable increase in the hiring
of resident workers has pushed the labor force
participation ratio to a new record high. Pass-through
of rising unit labor costs partly driven by wage
increases has been smaller than expected amid weak
demand and uncertain business outlook, contributing
to subdued inflation.

The current account surplus rose to 19.1 percent in 2014, up by 1.2 percentage points relative to
2013, driven by both the goods and the services balance. The trade balance improved significantly in
the first quarter of 2015, reflecting mainly the impact of the oil price shock. Singapore’s exports have
been relatively weak, due to the slow pace of global economic recovery, as well as supply-side
constraints. The overall balance of payments surplus narrowed in 2014 and recorded a deficit in the
first quarter of 2015, amid higher net outflows in the financial account.

mid-March and end-May the Singapore dollar has appreciated by about 3 percent vis-à-vis the
U.S. dollar. The stock market has performed well over the past year and in early-2015, reaching a
peak in April.

C. Outlook and Risks
8.
Despite uncertainties in domestic and external environment, growth is expected to
average 2.9 percent in 2015. The uncertain external environment and the ongoing transition to the
new growth model could continue to weigh somewhat on private consumption and investment.
However, several factors should support a broad-based recovery in domestic demand. These include
the loosening of the monetary policy stance in January, a supportive fiscal policy stance, lower
energy prices, the temporary pause in the hike of foreign worker levies announced in the 2015
budget, and the projected gradual recovery in external demand.1 These factors are expected to
offset the drag from the continued softness in the housing market and an expected increase in
interest rates. Headline and core inflation are expected to average 0 and 1 percent in 2015,
respectively, before both rising to 1.8 percent in 2016 on recovering energy and commodity prices.
9.
The medium-term outlook will be characterized by lower growth rates. Restrictive
policies on foreign workers and rapid population aging will lower the rate of labor force growth,
slowing economic growth to about 3 percent over the medium-term (Appendix V). The economic
restructuring is expected to ultimately raise capital-labor ratios and productivity growth but is

budget, the authorities announced that the scheduled levy increase in 2015 will be deferred by one to two years
depending on the sector.

subject to transitional costs in the near-term. The magnitude of these transitional costs, and the
speed with which long-term gains in investment and productivity are realized, will have an important
bearing on potential growth and inflation. The authorities are implementing several programs to
actively support investment, the adoption of more advanced production technologies and processes
by firms, and the upgrading of skills by Singaporeans. There are some positive signs, including
improvements in some productivity indicators and increases in the number of new firms being
created, but many companies are also facing margin compressions and difficulties filling vacancies
in the meantime. These signs probably understate the extent of quality upgrading in the economy
(for example, capturing the effects of the information technology revolution in national accounts is
notoriously difficult.2 Fiscal policy will play an important role in Singapore’s medium term growth
performance. The authorities’ plans to invest in productivity-enhancing infrastructure, including in
support of education and healthcare, and to maintain Singapore’s leading role as a transportation
and logistics hub, should help underpin medium-term productivity and growth. Finally, as a highly
open economy with strong trade and financial linkages with the ASEAN region and beyond, regional
and global conditions will also play an important role in shaping Singapore’s growth trajectory.
10.
Risks to the baseline projections are tilted to the downside. As a city state with a very
open economy, Singapore is exposed to external shocks. Accordingly, a protracted period of slower
growth in advanced and emerging economies is an important short-term risk. Side effects from
surges in financial volatility and persistent U.S. dollar strength and asynchronous monetary policies
in the advanced economies (Box 2), as well as the growth slowdown and financial risks in China,
could also have an important impact.3 Were these risks to be realized, their effects could be
amplified by the elevated indebtedness of the domestic household and corporate sectors. Delays in
generating significant investment and productivity gains as part of the economic restructuring is
another risk. Principal risks, their transmission mechanisms, and recommended policy actions are
summarized in the Risk Assessment Matrix (Appendix I). Singapore’s strong macroeconomic
fundamentals—skillful and responsive macroeconomic management, a substantially strong external
position, adequate level of foreign reserves, large fiscal buffers and strong bank balance sheets—
could help absorb shocks and facilitate an effective countercyclical policy response.
Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities are confident in the strength of the Singaporean economy and see
short-term risks as manageable. For the rest of the year, a firmer recovery in the U.S., Europe and
Japan will provide support for the externally-oriented sectors. However, the extent of this uplift may
be partially offset by other global developments, including the slowdown in China, tighter financial
conditions and potential capital reversals associated with the normalization of U.S interest rates,
corporate realignments in the IT industry, and lingering weakness in the oil-related transport

of Agricultural Economics 93(2): 276–296.

The impact of a growth slowdown in China can be significant. For instance, estimates in IMF WP/14/52 based on a
panel regression model suggest that a 1 percentage point decline in growth in China can reduce growth in Singapore
by 0.36 percentage points.

engineering sector. Meanwhile, the domestically-oriented industries will be bolstered by firm
demand and temporary respite from the deferment in the hikes of foreign worker levies. The
authorities agreed with staff that key risks in the near-term are related to the growth prospects in
advanced economies and key emerging markets. The authorities noted the sensitivity of Singapore’s
growth to developments in China, through both direct and indirect links. They are confident that
Singapore can handle the increased volatility associated with monetary policy normalization in the
U.S. given their ample policy buffers and track record of strong macroeconomic management.

In January, in response to a decline in
expected inflation and a more uncertain outlook
for growth, MAS loosened its policy stance by
reducing the pace of appreciation of the nominal
effective exchange rate (NEER) band. The MAS
announcement, outside the biannual April-October
cycle, lowered appreciation expectations of the
Singapore dollar and led to an uptick in short-term
interbank interest rates. The monetary policy stance

(Appendix IV).5 Near term inflation risks are circumscribed by the large and sustained oil price
decline and the ongoing gradual decline in house prices and their second-round effects.6
Interestingly, labor cost increases in 2014 were lower than previously anticipated on the back of
heightened uncertainty about external demand and domestic growth prospects. With pass-through
of cost pressures relatively benign, inflation risks contained, and the balance of risks for external
demand tilted to the downside, monetary policy can afford to be less restrictive. In the medium
term, with the projected increase in U.S. policy rates, Singapore’s interest rates are also expected to
increase, contributing to a market-driven tightening of monetary conditions.7 Risks to inflation are
related to developments in external demand interacting with the ongoing economic restructuring. If
external demand does not pick up as expected, it could put further pressure on profit margins, as
firms are not able to pass-through costs. This could lead to a hollowing out in certain sectors, a rise
in unemployment and deflationary pressures. On the other hand, a stronger than expected pick-up
in external demand could lead to an uptick in inflation and labor costs if firms try to defend their
profit margins. The authorities are encouraged to use the flexibility intrinsic in Singapore’s basketband-crawl monetary framework to allow the exchange rate to respond within the band to minor,
temporary shocks. They could recalibrate band parameters on more rare occasions when significant
and sustained increase in real and financial volatility warrant reparameterization (recentering,
widening) of the band.

A standard Taylor rule with policy inertia and the short-term interest rate replaced by NEER appreciation as the
policy instrument explains the change in the NEER well. The estimated policy rule predicts a slowdown in NEER
appreciation in 2015 mainly reflecting the expected decline in inflation.

The oil price shock will have large but temporary effects on inflation but could also restrain pass-through of labor
costs in some energy-intensive sectors.

Under Singapore’s exchange-rate-based monetary policy framework, the policy loosening through a smaller
targeted appreciation of the NEER band can lead to higher short-term domestic interest rates. For example, the
January 2015 monetary policy easing has led to lower expected appreciation of the Singapore dollar, feeding into
higher short-term interest rates.

vigilance in assessing the balance of forces between the interest rate and exchange rate
channels of monetary policy and in the calibration of the monetary policy framework:


The authorities’ track record operating the exchange rate-based monetary policy, both in good
and in bad times, demonstrates that the policy framework is robust and flexible enough to deal
effectively with bouts of volatility. The large share of imported goods in the consumption basket
and the importance of externally-oriented sectors in the economy make the exchange rate the
dominant channel of monetary policy in Singapore. Nevertheless, leverage in the economy is
high and the expected increase in interest rates going forward can have larger effects on
demand than historically observed, mainly by restraining consumption growth for leveraged
households and investment growth in interest-sensitive sectors.8 Accordingly, the interest rate
channel could provide a larger offset to exchange rate action, requiring stronger adjustment in
the NEER band to achieve the objectives of monetary policy. The authorities are encouraged to
monitor the balance sheets of households and firms and incorporate the implications of the
expected rise in interest rates, potential asset price adjustments, and the financial cycle in their
calibration of monetary policy, taking into account a higher sensitivity of economic activity to
interest rates.



The current biannual frequency of policy meetings provides a good balance between the need
to orient monetary policy to medium term price stability while allowing flexibility for rare offcycle policy moves. Given the divergence of advanced economies’ monetary policies, the
biannual policy meeting framework could be subject to more tests going forward. More
frequent policy meetings are one option, but this could run counter to the longer-term
orientation of monetary policy. On balance, the flexibility afforded by the exchange rate band
and the track record (only two off-cycle moves in 15 years) suggest that biannual policy
meetings constitute an appropriate frequency.

16.
Singapore’s external position is assessed to be substantially stronger than consistent
with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies, although the current account surplus
is projected to moderate over the medium term. The assessment for 2014 and the size of the
imbalance are subject to a wide range of uncertainty reflecting Singapore’s highly open economy
and unique position as a global trading and financial hub. Since 2010, the current account has
narrowed by about 4.6 percentage points of GDP and the REER has appreciated by about
13 percent. Nevertheless, at 19.1 percent of GDP in 2014, the current account is 2−8 percent of GDP
larger than the norm (Appendix II). Importantly, Singapore’s openness and financial center status,
8

Staff’s empirical analysis suggests that the real exchange rate indeed has a stronger effect on growth than the real
interest rate in Singapore. Leverage is also found to have a significant negative effect on growth. Staff also included
interaction terms in the analysis with a view to examining the effects of leverage on the relative strengths of the two
channels of monetary policy. The negative impact of interest rates on growth does indeed increase with leverage, but
this effect seems to be driven by events surrounding the Asian financial crisis. Leverage is at an all time high at
present, and the heightened sensitivity of output to interest rates may be subject to threshold effects not adequately
captured in the sample. Staff is working on incorporating the interaction between leverage and interest rates in the
presence of threshold effects. Its judgment of rising risks due to the interaction of prospectively higher interest rates
and domestic leverage are at this point driven by theoretical considerations.

SINGAPORE

together with its very high per-capita income, rapid aging and defined-contribution pension system
are non-standard factors that make Singapore an outlier in international comparisons of external
positions, making a quantitative assessment of its current account unusually difficult. Consistent with
the authorities’ policies, several factors are expected to contribute to a moderation of the current
account surplus over the medium term. These include the drawdown of accumulated pension
savings in response to aging and additional government spending to strengthen health care
infrastructure and make the distribution of consumption within and across generations more even.
The changing growth model, with a much smaller absorption of foreign workers than in the past, is
also expected to reduce the current account surplus in the near-to medium-term, by leading to real
exchange rate appreciation and to productivity gains in non-traded sectors.
17.
Developments in late-2014 and early-2015, including the decline in the energy import
bill, are expected to have a modest impact on the external position. Singapore is a net oil
importer, with a net oil trade balance of -5.6 percent of GDP in 2013. The recent oil price decline
triggered a significant first-round increase in the oil trade balance at end-2014 and so far in 2015.
However, the overall current account gain from the oil shock is expected to be smaller once one
takes into account the high imported petroleum product content in Singapore’s exports of
petrochemicals and other oil intensive products and services (Box 1). In addition, sectors with strong
links to investment in the global oil market, such as the marine and offshore industries, are expected
to see their exports fall, especially as a large component of the oil price decline seems to be longterm in nature. Taking into account these factors, lower oil prices are expected to raise the current
account by about 1.5 percent of GDP in 2015. A weaker outlook for external demand and more
accommodative fiscal policies are expected to reduce the current account, partially offsetting the
oil-related gain. The recent easing of monetary policy is not expected to materially affect the
external balance. Overall, the current account is expected to increase by 1–1.5 percent of GDP in
2015.
18.
International reserves are adequate for precautionary purposes. While Singapore’s
position as a financial center warrants high reserve buffers, current levels appear adequate and there
is no clear case for further reserve accumulation for precautionary purposes.9 The decline in
Singapore’s official reserves (by about 10.6 percent or US$29.6 billion during June 2014-March 2015)
reflects valuation changes. Official reserves cover about 25 percent of short-term external debt as of
end-2014. Although this appears to be relatively low, it reflects the sizable short-term liabilities of
Singapore’s international banking system. These liabilities are concentrated in foreign banks
operating in Singapore and are largely covered by banks’ short-term external financial assets.

9

Singapore’s reserves-to-GDP ratio is also larger than in most other financial centers, but this may reflect in part that
most other financial centers are located in reserve-currency issuing countries or in countries that are members of
currency unions.

Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities thought the assessment of monetary policy was useful and balanced.
They noted that the monetary policy stance is related to the position and slope of the NEER band, as
opposed to the NEER movements within the band. The authorities also emphasized that interest
rates are factored in their calibration of monetary policy as part of their general equilibrium
approach to monetary policy. They agreed that there is considerable uncertainty about the effects of
rising interest rates, as the economy exits a prolonged period of very low interest rates with
significantly higher leverage. They take into account this uncertainty by assuming a conservative,
higher sensitivity in their calibration of policies. The authorities also agreed that divergent monetary
policies in advanced economies can create volatility and risks in currency markets. They also argued,
however, that a scenario where all advanced economies tightened policies at the same time could
be more challenging for emerging markets and for Singapore; in their view, while actions in the U.S.
have a larger effect, policy accommodation in Japan and the euro zone are providing a welcome
offset.
20.
The authorities did not agree with the characterization of Singapore’s external
position as substantially stronger than warranted by medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policies. In their view, the assessment does not fully capture Singapore’s unique features.
In particular, the large current account surplus reflects the country’s position as a global financial
center, trading and production hub, and its city state geography. It is not the result of “inappropriate
policies” and the real exchange rate in an economy as open as Singapore reflects developments in
relative prices and costs. They emphasized the unique setup whereby the exchange rate is in fact
used as an instrument to achieve internal balance objectives, which would be compromised if it were
used to directly target the external balance. The authorities also highlighted the need for the
external sector assessment to focus on longer term considerations related to consumption
smoothing over a life-cycle, preserving intergenerational equity and sustainability, rather than nearor medium-term notions of “equilibrium”. The authorities expect the current account surplus to
decline over time as population aging takes hold, lowering saving rates, and the size of government
rises to deal with rising old-age dependency ratios and upgrading of infrastructure.

B. Financial Sector and Macroprudential Policies
21.
The moderation of credit growth to both residents and nonresidents during the past
year is welcome. It has been supported by the active use of macroprudential policies. More
recently, moderation of credit growth to nonresidents also reflects a narrowing of interest rate
differentials vis-a-vis China, which has led to a weakening of demand for investment and trade
credits. The increase in domestic interest rates observed of late and the expected further upward
adjustment in interest rates reflecting the gradual normalization of monetary policy in the U.S.
should help contain household and corporate indebtedness and remove the onus from
macroprudential policy to reduce systemic financial risks in slowing credit growth.
22.
Some progress has been made in reducing foreign currency liquidity risk. The risk
posed by the high non-Singapore dollar loan-to-deposit ratio has been reduced thanks to declining

are desirable. In this regard, staff welcomes the continued monitoring of banks’ foreign currency
liquidity management through stress tests and the recent phasing in of Basel III Liquidity Coverage
Ratio (LCR) to the local banks, including reporting of LCRs for significant foreign currencies. In
addition, the application of LCRs, from 2016, to the domestic systemically important foreign banks’
operations in Singapore and subsidiarization of their operations in Singapore will be a significant
step forward. Staff recommends that MAS encourage banks to publicly disclose LCRs to encourage
careful liquidity risk management and ensure that banks voluntarily hold adequate volumes of liquid
assets. The planned implementation of Basel III Net Stable Funding Ratio requirements from January
2018 should complement the framework.

signs of excessive house price declines, associated with clear evidence of a tightening of financial
conditions.

lending to over-indebted individuals would help
address pockets of risks. In this regard, staff welcomes the phasing in of a limit on unsecured credits
to individuals from June 2015. Efforts aimed at assisting overextended individuals should continue,
including through assistance with debt restructuring and financial education.
25.
Corporate sector indebtedness and leverage have risen since the global financial crisis,
but companies’ debt servicing capacity remains high. Most publicly listed companies maintain
high interest coverage ratios and appear able to withstand interest rate and earnings shocks.
Nevertheless, the high level of overall corporate debt (about 75 percent of GDP) warrants caution.
Loans to SMEs, representing about 20 percent of domestic corporate loans, are highly collateralized
and subject to strong underwriting standards, with NPL ratios falling below 1 percent. Staff
welcomes MAS’ close monitoring of financial sector risks related to the corporate sector, including
through stress tests of listed companies’ balance sheets and surveys of banks’ exposure to SMEs. In
anticipation of the expected interest rate normalization and the effects of the restructuring on
corporate profitability, it is important for bank supervisors to remain vigilant in monitoring risks.
26.
Singapore continues to maintain high regulatory and supervisory standards. Stringent
capital requirements, above Basel minimum norms, and Basel III LCR requirements have been
phased in smoothly since January 2015. Staff observed important progress in implementing the
2013 FSAP recommendations (Appendix III). Among others, the collection of granular debt data for
individuals has been enhanced, supporting the enhancements made to the unsecured credit rules.
MAS is working with D-SIBs and the Singapore Exchange (SGX) to enhance recovery and resolution
arrangements. Staff welcomes the planned strengthening of the recovery and resolution framework
and encourages even closer coordination with other jurisdictions to facilitate cross-border
resolutions of global banks and further strengthening the resolution framework to enhance MAS’
operational independence.
27.
Efforts to bring the AML/CFT framework in line with international standards and
demonstrate effective cooperation with foreign counterparts, particularly on tax matters,
should continue. The authorities have implemented several actions in recent years to mitigate risks.

10

For example, MAS estimates that households’ monthly debt repayment could increase by 8–9 percent of their
income, should mortgage rates rise by 300 bps.

More recently, measures to prevent misuse of ownership structures were strengthened, by imposing
customer due diligence requirements on agents who help third parties (including foreigners) set up
Singapore companies, and by elaborating on such requirements for other regulated entities. The
framework’s tax coverage has been broadened and is aimed at making it harder to launder evaded
foreign taxes in Singapore. Singapore should continue efforts to demonstrate effective cooperation
with its foreign counterparts. Other recent changes include requiring regulated entities to undertake
comprehensive ML/TF risk assessments and increase scrutiny of cross-border transfers. Further steps
are planned for emerging risks posed by virtual currencies. The Financial Action Task Force and the
Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering will jointly assess Singapore’s AML/CFT regime in 2015,
including how effective it is.

Authorities’ Views
28.
The authorities were confident that the financial system remains resilient to the turn in
the financial cycle. They emphasized their commitment to proactive financial sector surveillance
and continued improvements in their supervision and regulation framework to address tail risks and
pockets of vulnerabilities. A significant rise in interest rates could cause vulnerabilities among
pockets of overextended households but with little systemic implications. The authorities also noted
that there are limits to matching loans and deposits in each foreign currency, especially in a financial
center that intermediates funding to the region. In their view, LCR requirements in all currency and
in domestic currency are hence appropriate tools to avoid a build-up of domestic liquidity risks
while ensuring efficiency in banks’ funding structure.
29.
Comprehensive and graduated macroprudential policies have been effective in
supporting a soft-landing of the property market boom. Macroprudential policy measures in
Singapore are targeted to specific risks, and multi-pronged to ensure effectiveness and efficiency
(see Box 1 of last year’s Article IV Staff Report). The authorities are committed to closely monitoring
the impact and effectiveness of various prudential measures, and stand ready to recalibrate when
deemed appropriate.
30.
AML/CFT policies and issues are taken very seriously and are being further
strengthened. The authorities emphasized their track record in strengthening the compliance of
their AML/CFT regulatory regime in line with international standards. They also noted that financial
institutions in Singapore are subject to a comprehensive AML/CFT regulatory regime, which includes
customer due diligence, ongoing account monitoring and suspicious transaction reporting
requirements. Legislative changes made in 2013, and the findings of the Global Forum on
Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes mean that Singapore’s exchange of
information regime is in line with the internationally-agreed standard, that ownership and identity
information is available for all types of companies, partnerships and trusts, and that overall
compliance with filing and reporting obligations is very high.

has over time resulted in the buildup of large fiscal
reserves. These savings now allow the government to meet expanding spending needs to maintain
Singapore’s logistics edge through additional infrastructure investments and to meet the needs of
its aging society.
32.
Going forward, the continued medium-term orientation of fiscal policy and the
modest strengthening of collective responsibility will serve current and future generations of
Singaporeans well. The FY2015/16 budget underscores the government’s focus on boosting
productivity, raising inclusiveness and reducing inequality, and managing the impact of the sharp
increase in the old-age dependency ratio. Staff takes note of the government’s well-articulated plans
to raise social and infrastructure spending over the next five years, which will result in a modest
increase in the size of government spending of about one-two percentage points of GDP. Planned
higher outlays on healthcare, education and training, public transport and airport expansion, and
domestic security serve clear public policy purposes. Building on Singapore’s strong track record of
high-quality government spending, they can be expected to strengthen the social and economic
foundation of Singapore, improve the prospects for potential output, and support external
adjustment.

which continue in the direction of government policies in recent years. The increase by
two percentage points in the marginal personal income tax rate for the highest income bracket and
the quarterly cash transfers to elderly with income in the lowest 30 percent (“Silver Support”) will
contribute to reducing intra- and inter-generational inequality. The inclusion of Temasek in the “Net
Investment Returns” framework could also help promote a more equitable inter-generational
distribution of income.11

Singapore’s fiscal reserves are held and managed by the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC),
MAS and Temasek. Under the “Net Investment Returns framework”, spending is capped at 50 percent of the
expected long-term real returns on the fiscal reserves held by the GIC and MAS only. Temasek’s net portfolio is 223
billion Singapore dollars, with a geographic allocation tilted towards Singapore and other Asia.

34.
The fiscal impulse, projected at 1.6 percent of GDP in FY2015/16, is opportune
(Table 5). While recognizing the medium-term orientation of fiscal policy, staff notes the insurance
value of a somewhat expansionary near term fiscal stance, which is warranted by the higher
downside risks to the external outlook and the prospective tightening of domestic credit conditions.
35.
There is scope to enhance the clarity and transparency of the fiscal accounts. The policy
debate in Singapore centers on the need for fiscal policy to continue being sustainable and to
become fairer and more inclusive both within and across generations. It is also framed by the
requirements of the fiscal rule, which limits the drawdown of accumulated government assets.
Within this framework, there is scope to provide more clarity of the coverage and meaning of the
reported fiscal balance. Several items, including the government’s investment income and intragovernment transfers via special funds and programs and land sales, require adjustments to be
made to the fiscal balance to obtain a macroeconomically relevant measure of the fiscal position.
While the presentation of the fiscal accounts in the annual budget is anchored in the Constitution,
fiscal policy discussions could be enriched further by supplementing the budget presentation with
an alternative based on the overall fiscal balance in line with Government Finance Statistics Manual
(GFSM) 2001. This would clarify the additions to the government’s fiscal reserves (held at the MAS,
GIC, and Temasek) implied by the budget. In doing so, it would help reveal the budget’s implications
for fiscal sustainability and evolution of fiscal reserves.

Authorities’ Views
36.
The authorities highlighted the medium-term orientation of the budget and their
commitment to make greater use of fiscal policy to improve inclusiveness while remaining
true to the primacy of personal and family responsibility. Recent measures to assist elderly
individuals earning lower incomes reflect the authorities’ belief that government has a role to
support social mobility and take care of the elderly as the size and structure of Singaporean families
change. Recent policies should be seen as an effort to provide help to people to take care of
themselves without weakening private initiative and without undermining personal and family
responsibility. Singapore supports a system of “sustainable inclusivity” where the government
provides active support for personal responsibility.
37.
Singapore’s fiscal balances are presented in line with the requirements of the
Constitution. Multiple presentations of the budget document would lead to confusion and possible
misinterpretation of fiscal spending permissible under the Constitution. The general government
finance data that follows the GFSM format are made available in the Yearbook of Statistics. All
revenue data, including government land sales and investment income, are also included in the
Budget documents, allowing analysts to make the necessary adjustments to the headline budget
figures. The Ministry of Finance has also been publishing the fiscal impulse, based on a commonly
accepted methodology, as part of the Budget documents. There is no ideal method of presentation
that will satisfy both the need to correctly reflect the level of government spending permissible
under the Constitution, and to facilitate analysis and cross-country comparisons.

38.
Budget over performance does not reflect a systematic bias toward fiscal surpluses.
The Ministry of Finance aims to be as accurate as possible during budget planning. In any given
year, revenues could deviate from the budgeted figures, and there is no deliberate or consistent
conservatism embedded in projections. The revenue over-performance in recent years was due to
unexpectedly buoyant demand for real estate and vehicles.

Singapore. This has raised firms’ long-term desired
capital-labor ratio and should translate into increased investment as the restructuring matures
(Appendix V). Staff welcomes policy measures, such as investment tax credits, that encourage capital
accumulation. Temporary wage subsidies are also useful, by helping to moderate the increase in the
relative price of labor and by smoothing firms’ transition to the new economic structure. These
measures should be subject to sunset clauses as planned to avoid distortions in the long run.
However, the restructuring has also compressed firms’ profits in the short run and lowered potential
growth to a level consistent with Singapore’s physical limits, leading to a weakening of investment
during the initial phases of restructuring. Staff expects that private investment will rebound over
time as firms react to higher wages and to government incentives by adjusting capital spending to
reach their new higher optimum capital intensity levels.

firms to invest in labor-saving technologies and processes, it can also have a bearing on firms’ ability
to flexibly adjust and organize their labor forces and reduce incentives to invest due to compressed
profits. Economic restructuring also entail risks, including higher than expected transitional costs (for
instance a sharp increase in frictional unemployment, hallowing out in some sectors) with more
long-term effects on growth and potential delays in achieving productivity gains. In such situations,
a recalibration of the DRCs would be called for. Targeted fiscal support to businesses is being
provided through grants and tax credits, to facilitate the restructuring. Staff welcomes the flexibility
demonstrated recently in the calibration of foreign worker levies. Additional measures could support
firms if activity falls or productivity does not pick up. The rising trend in public spending on health,
education and infrastructure is expected to provide a supporting environment to increase
productivity.
Authorities’ Views
41.
The 2015 budget continues to further the authorities’ goal of restructuring
Singapore’s economy and facilitating the country’s next phase of development. Accordingly,
the budget emphasizes long-term investment to develop human, physical and organizational
capital, including infrastructure, and encourages businesses to innovate and internationalize. It also
sharpens incentives for individuals and businesses to invest for the future and improve productivity.
Restructuring is taking place while Singapore is operating at full employment, making it harder to
force productivity improvements. In addition, changes in investment plans dictated by the tight
labor market and incentives to invest and innovate take several years to complete. The addition of
older individuals to the workforce is good from an inclusion and long-term structural points of view.
However, this increase in workforce can hold back productivity growth in the transition. The tight
foreign and local labor market has incentivized firms to invest in capital and reorganize their
businesses to use less labor. For instance, the take-up rate under the Productivity and Innovation
Credit scheme has increased from 33 percent of active companies in 2011 to 46 percent in 2014. The
pause in raising foreign worker levies for the manufacturing and services sectors does not alter the
government’s structural targets. The final tightening in quotas for the services sector is still set for
July 2015, when the DRCs become applicable to companies’ entire workforces.

E. Policies to Address Aging
42.
The authorities have embarked on a
multi-year effort to strengthen Singapore’s
institutional arrangements to deal with a
rapidly aging population. The share of the
working age population is projected to
experience a sharp decline of above
10 percentage points between 2010 and 2040,
one of the most precipitous declines in the
world. Singapore’s pension scheme, the Central
Provident Fund (CPF), is a fully-funded,

defined-contribution pension system (Appendix VI). It has the advantage of safeguarding financial
sustainability relative to defined-benefit, pay-as-you-go systems common in advanced economies.
But it could also provide weaker protection in terms of lower retirement income adequacy. A
relatively low CPF income replacement rate is an important issue, especially for workers with
interrupted work histories, such as women, the self-employed and others, who could not make
regular contributions amid rising costs of living12. Informal family-based old-age support systems
that have complemented the CPF could weaken over time or may not be operative in low income
families. In Singapore, retirement income adequacy is also affected by the use of CPF resources for
multiple purposes, including housing purchase and healthcare needs, with the former making
retirees asset-rich but cash-poor.
43.
Recent policy measures to enhance retirement income and to strengthen the labor
force participation of the elderly are welcome. The authorities have taken steps to raise the
adequacy of retirement and to provide targeted, budget-financed support for low-income
pensioners while encouraging people to work beyond the normal retirement age and save more
while in employment. Their reform process is ongoing (see Appendix VI ). Going forward, the
authorities need to continuously review the replacement rate for retirees to ensure that retirement
savings are adequate in light of the changes in living costs, life expectancy and labor markets. The
authorities have also increased spending on healthcare, including on infrastructure, and are
committed to increasing it further over the medium term in the face of rapid population aging.
These measures should help address high income inequality and rising costs of living that weigh
more on lower and middle-income groups, thereby promoting a more inclusive society.
44.
Going forward, the ability of the CPF to provide adequate retirement savings could be
enhanced, by continuing to develop market-based and other schemes to facilitate the monetization
of housing wealth, reducing its bias towards housing purchases, and raising the returns on the CPF
asset portfolio. Investment performance of pension funds over a long-term horizon is a key element
in providing adequate retirement income in fully-funded pension systems. It is especially important
for the CPF given that the contribution rates are already high at around 37 percent, limiting the
scope of enhancing retirement income through raising contribution rates. The CPF funds have been
mostly invested in non-tradable special Singapore government bonds since its introduction in 1955.
In return, the government offers the CPF a rate of return that is the higher of market rates
benchmarked to deposit rates or the interest rate of Singapore government bonds and a fixed
minimum guaranteed rate. In practice, since 1999, the minimum guaranteed return ranging from
2.5 to 4 percent has been applied, shielding retirees from the volatility in returns but not allowing
them to share the benefit of higher returns that could have been achieved from a well-diversified
asset portfolio. Despite the subdued outlook for investment returns on pension savings globally,
allowing CPF contributors to share more on the upside to investment returns can help increase
retirement income.

12

About half of active CPF members who turned 55 in 2013 could not accumulate enough CPF savings to meet their
Basic Retirement Sum that provide life-long monthly payouts of about S$700 estimated to cover their basic
expenditure needs during retirement.

20

45.
Productivity-enhancing policies, including investments in education and
infrastructure, and labor market policies remain critical in meeting the challenges of an aging
population. Singapore’s success in healthcare and education outcomes is commendable and
policies should continue to concentrate on improving productivity. Labor participation rates are
already high but there could be some scope to raise women’s participation rates further even as
policies continue to focus on increasing fertility rates. Policy measures could target improving the
availability of childcare facilities, part-time or flexible work arrangements and job-matching and
placement programs.
Authorities’ Views
46.
The authorities are committed to promoting inclusive growth in the face of rapid
population aging and globally-widening income gaps. The government’s goal is to create a
society where personal and collective responsibility reinforces each other, with personal
responsibility remaining the core value. There are various schemes to support low-income
households, including the Workfare program that supplements incomes and tops up CPF accounts,
and the higher interest earned on lower CPF balances. Beginning from 2016, the Silver Support
Scheme will play a key role in supporting the lower-income elderly as a permanent feature of the
social security system.
47.
The CPF and home ownership are twin pillars for ensuring adequate provisioning for
retirement. Home ownership is important to a secure retirement. Home ownership rate in
Singapore is high, even amongst the lower-income. Homes are assets that can be tapped on to
supplement retirement savings and the government has introduced several programs to help the
elderly monetize housing assets, depending on their family circumstances, preferences and needs.
For example, the Lease Buyback scheme offers elderly households the option to monetize their
housing equity by selling part of their flat lease to HDB. Income replacement rates in Singapore are
not readily comparable to that of other countries given the much larger share of retirees who own
their homes. Overall the CPF system is well-placed to enable active workers to accumulate sufficient
savings for retirement. Risk-free CPF returns of up to 3.5 percent on ordinary accounts and up to
5 percent on medical and special accounts are relatively high among countries with defined
contribution schemes. Various investment options including that with higher risk-return profiles are
also available for CPF members. To ensure adequacy of retirement income going forward, the
retirement sum which forms the basis of monthly payouts for life will be gradually increased from
2017 to 2020, accounting for both inflation and increases in the standard of living. The CPF Advisory
Panel has been established in 2014 to study possible enhancements to the CPF system, including
giving members more flexibility to invest in private investment plans and private annuities when
they retire as an alternative to CPF Life. The panel’s recommendations were released and endorsed
by the government this year. Further recommendations from the advisory panel are expected to be
released later this year.

STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
Singapore’s economy continues to perform well. Growth in 2014 moderated on the back
of the slow and uneven global recovery, the domestic restructuring away from reliance on foreign
workers, and the turning of credit and housing cycles. While the outlook is uncertain, growth is
expected to pick up during the year and average 2.9 percent in 2015. Inflation has recently declined,
driven by lower oil prices and modest downward adjustments in house rents and car permits.
Headline and core inflation are expected to average 0 and 1 percent in 2015, respectively. The labor
market is expected to remain tight. As a city state with a very open economy, Singapore is exposed
to external risks, including a protracted period of slower growth in advanced and emerging
economies and side effects from volatility in global financial markets. These external risks could be
exacerbated by the elevated private indebtedness and a disorderly correction in property prices.
49.
Macroeconomic policies are appropriately calibrated to reflect shifts in economic
conditions and outlook. The current monetary policy setting is appropriate as risks to external
demand are tilted to the downside and inflation is contained. The projected gradual increase in
domestic interest rates will also lead to a tightening in monetary conditions. The uncertainty
associated with the divergence of major advanced economies’ monetary policies has increased the
risk of higher interest rate and exchange rate volatility, which can pose challenges for the exchangerate-based monetary policy framework. Monetary policy should continue to respond flexibly to
evolving inflation and real developments. The medium-term orientation of fiscal policy and the
enhanced emphasis on inter- and intra-generational equity and inclusion are commendable. The
near-term fiscal impulse supports aggregate demand in a period of economic restructuring, through
measures that will also help raise potential growth in the medium-term.
50.
Singapore continues to maintain regulatory and supervisory standards that are among
the highest in the world. Stringent new capital and liquidity requirements have been phased in
smoothly since January 2015. Important progress was also made in implementing the 2013 FSAP
recommendations. Recent macroprudential measures have contributed to a welcome, gradual and
ongoing moderation of credit and house prices. The authorities are bringing the AML/CFT
framework in line with enhanced international standards and continuing their efforts to demonstrate
effective cooperation with foreign counterparts, particularly on tax matters.
51.
The ambitious restructuring to a new growth model requires continuing monitoring
and a flexible approach that recalibrates incentives to firms and households to achieve policy
objectives. The policy focus on upgrading skills and business processes and reducing income
inequality are commendable. The authorities are advised to monitor carefully the transition and to
respond quickly with targeted measures that foster transformation in business operations with
minimal disruption. As the more restrictive foreign worker policy has contributed to a tightening of
the labor market and led to higher participation of older workers and others with relatively low skills,
inclusiveness has increased. Compressed profit margins and managerial challenges associated with
new ways of doing business could provide disincentives to firms to invest and temporarily hold back

SINGAPORE

productivity growth. If such a situation persists, a recalibration of labor policies and of incentives to
firms and workers might be called for. Staff welcomes the targeted fiscal support being provided to
businesses through grants and tax credits, as well as the flexibility demonstrated recently in the
calibration of foreign worker levies. Additional measures to support investment and encourage the
adoption of new business and organizational models could be called for if activity falls or
productivity does not pick up.
52.
Staff commends the ongoing efforts to strengthen institutional arrangements to deal
with the rapid aging of the population and suggests continuous review of the adequacy of
these arrangements, especially retirement incomes of lower income groups. The authorities are
encouraged to continue to provide targeted, budget-financed old age support for lower-income
elderly groups. Being fully-funded, the CPF is well designed to safeguard fiscal sustainability. The
authorities need to continuously review the adequacy of retirement incomes provided through the
CPF, to ensure that retirement savings are adequate in light of the changes in living costs, life
expectancy, interest rates, and labor market conditions, taking into account Singapore’s high home
ownership rate. Going forward, the CPF’s ability to provide adequate retirement income should be
further strengthened, by continuing to develop market-based and other schemes to facilitate the
monetization of housing wealth, by reducing the bias in the system towards housing purchase and
by raising the returns on the CPF asset portfolio.
53.
Singapore’s external position is assessed to be substantially stronger than consistent
with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies, although the current account surplus
is projected to moderate over the medium term. The assessment is subject to uncertainty
reflecting Singapore’s very open economy, position as a global trading and financial center, the
existance of a fully funded pension system, and other idiosyncratic factors. An expected drawdown
of accumulated private savings and increased public spending in response to aging in coming years,
a stronger social safety net, and a lower growth of foreign workforce, are all expected to contribute
to a moderation of the current account surplus over the medium term.
54.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Singapore be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. The Oil Price Shock: Implications for Singapore
Staff’s assessment of the impact of oil price shocks in Singapore suggests that the source of the oil
price shock matters. A structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model following Kilian (2009) 1 is estimated
using quarterly data for 1979Q1–2014Q4.2 Consistent with the analysis in the 2015 April WEO, the estimated
SVAR suggests that the shocks affecting oil prices during the second half of 2014 were mainly supply and
oil-market-specific shocks. Although demand shocks also played a role, it was relatively smaller. More
generally, the impact of oil supply shocks on inflation and output are estimated to be relatively small,
whereas global aggregate demand shocks and oil-market-specific shocks have larger effects. A negative
global aggregate demand shock leads to an immediate decline in output and the price level, whereby the
effect on output is driven by the impact of the global demand contraction on Singapore’s very open
economy. A negative oil-market-specific shock that lowers oil prices has a positive effect on output realized
with a lag. A similar analysis conducted by the authorities finds comparable results.3

Box 1. The Oil Price Shock: Implications for Singapore (Concluded)
of 2015. Based on staff’s estimates, the impact of the oil price shock on headline CPI inflation will be about
1 percentage point in 2015. The impact on growth is estimated to be not significantly different from zero.
The point estimates suggest a small negative effect in the first year and a positive effect in the second year.
This could reflect a potential negative impact on Singapore’s oil-related industries, which is eventually offset
by a gradual pick-up in consumption. The fact that the recent oil price decline is driven in part by lower
global aggregate demand also contributes to the benign impact of the oil shock. Looking at the
performance of oil-related industries so far in 2015 suggests that marine and offshore engineering sectors
may indeed show some softness.5 Going forward, consumption should be supported by lower oil prices
although relatively high household debt levels and rising interest rates may lead consumers to save a larger
share of the windfall.
4

Although Singapore has a large energy trade deficit, the size of the oil price windfall is relatively
small given the sizable imported oil content in its exports of related goods and services. Singapore’s
oil trade deficit has averaged about 5 percent of GDP during 2010–13, reaching a peak of 6.6 percent of GDP
in 2012. In Singapore, a large share of the oil and gas

deficit in Singapore, the recent oil shock is expected to
have a modest, positive effect on the trade balance (by about 1.5 percent of GDP) in 2015. The positive
impact of the oil price shock on the trade balance is expected to be partially offset by a potential slowdown
in Singapore’s exports from the marine and offshore engineering sectors, due to investment cuts in the
upstream segment of the global oil industry.

Box 2. Monetary Policies in Advanced Economies: Implications for Singapore
Asynchronous monetary policies in advanced economies (AEs). Monetary policies in AEs started to
diverge in 2014 and are expected to remain asynchronous in the near and medium terms. While the US
Federal Reserve has wound down its asset purchase program and is expected to start raising policy rates
sometime in late 2015-early 2016, the ECB announced the start of its much-anticipated asset purchase
program in early 2015. The Bank of Japan significantly expanded its asset purchase program late last year.
The divergence in monetary policies among advanced economies reflects divergent relative economic
strengths and prospects. AE monetary policies and their implications for emerging markets, including in Asia
and ASEAN, have important financial and real spillovers for Singapore’s highly open economy.
Transmission channels. The main transmission channels of AE monetary policies on Singapore include
exchange rate movements; interest rates and the term premium; indirect spillover effects; and volatility in
global financial markets and funding conditions.

Interest rates in Singapore edged up late last year, increasing by about 85 basis points during November

implications for the region may lead to more abrupt and larger than anticipated increases in domestic
interest rates. This would have important effects on businesses and households, with a large share of
borrowing based on variable interest rates.

Box 2. Monetary Policies in Advanced Economies: Implications for Singapore (Concluded)
Indirect spillover effects. Monetary policy tightening in the U.S. may have far-reaching financial and real
effects on Singapore’s trading partners. Singapore’s very open economy and strong linkages with the region
implies that indirect spillovers can also play an important role.
Volatility in global financial markets and funding conditions. Changes and the divergence in monetary
policies can lead to excessive volatility due to heightened uncertainty about exchange rates and interest
rates. Spillovers from policies in the U.S. and Europe on each other and to the rest of the word can also
amplify stress in financial markets. Singapore’s financial sector may therefore be affected by this heightened
volatility, in particular if there are spillovers to Asia. Withdrawal of U.S. dollar liquidity and tightening in
monetary conditions in the U.S. can also lead to generalized tightness in liquidity. However, this would
be partially offset by monetary easing in the Euro area and Japan. Global banks which are present in
Singapore can play an important role in the transmission of these liquidity shocks in advanced economies
and regions to Singapore and Asia.

SINGAPORE

Figure 1. Singapore: Real Sector Developments
Growth moderated in 2014, on slowing consumption and
weak investment. Net exports held up.

Information and communication, and the finance and
insurance sectors were bright spots.

The construction sector, which had experienced the highest
cumulative growth since 2007, showed little growth in 2014.

The overall unemployment rate remains low; but
employment posted a decline in 2015Q1 for the first time
since 2009.

Core inflation amounted to 0.1 percent in May (y/y); overall
inflation fell to -0.4 percent on lower oil prices and…

…moderating COE premiums and house prices owing to
the implementation of macroprudential measures.

Figure 2. Singapore: Monetary and Financial Sector Developments
Recently, short-term interest rates ticked up noticeably…

…and real short-term rates are now at a 5-year high.

Broad money growth picked up to 8 percent (y/y) in April.

The stock market has performed well in 2014, but has
dipped slightly in 2015.

The FX market was affected by the mid-2013 turbulence
but volumes have increased since then.

The yield curve has shifted upward recently, at the short
end, but remains below pre-crisis levels.

Figure 2. Singapore: Monetary and Financial Sector Developments (Concluded)
The financial services sector has been an important
contributor to growth.

Financial services exports have reached about 8 percent of
GDP in 2014.

Financial services activity in Singapore slows down during
periods of heightened global risk sentiment.

Financial services activity in Singapore has been highly
correlated with economic activity in ASEAN-5 countries.

Cross-border banking activity in Singapore is dominated by
East-Asian and European regions.

Since the crisis, net lending to nonbank customers in East Asia
and bank funding from Europe turned positive.

Figure 3. Singapore: Banking Sector Developments 1/
Asset growth of ACUs has slowed down to about
7.7 percent (y/y) in 2015Q1.

DBUs rely primarily on deposit funding; while ACUs rely
on cross-border bank funding, reflecting the global
operations of foreign bank branches.

Loan to deposit ratios are around 1.1 for both ACUs and
DBUs.

48 percent of total DBU loans consist of housing loans
and loans to the building and construction sectors.

Growth in DBU loans to non-residents has slowed down.

The big 3 domestic banks now have about 45 percent of
their loan portfolio in other Asia (excluding Singapore).

1/ Asian currency unit (ACU) banking books are for non-Singapore dollar transactions, while domestic banking unit (DBU) books
may include transactions in Singapore dollars and other currencies. Historically, ACU and DBU were analogous to foreign and
domestic banks, respectively. More recently, banks with full banking licenses may maintain both DBU and ACU books, and DBU
books are not restricted to Singapore dollar activities. Thus, while the ACU-DBU distinction has become blurred, data under an
alternative classification that would be more economically relevant is not available.

Figure 4. Singapore: Housing Market Developments
Singapore’s housing market is cooling. The house priceto-income ratio increased again after the fall in 2014.

The house price-to-rent ratio has declined slightly and
remains close to its historical trend.

Housing transactions in the public market segment has
edged up in 2014. The private market remains subdued.

The vacancy ratio has reverted to the historical average on
easing supply constraints.

Supply bottlenecks owing to rapid population growth with
limited new housing supply...

…look set to ease as a pipeline of housing supply is
expected to come on the market in the coming years.

Figure 4. Singapore: Housing Market Developments (Concluded)
Banks have a substantial exposure to private housing
loans.

But MaPs helped improve their credit risk profile and
limited banks’ exposure to overextended households.

Households have strong balance sheets in aggregate…

…as house price appreciation in the recent past pushed up
households’ wealth.

However, households are highly indebted.

A rise in the overall indebtedness and debt-servicing
burden could pose risks for groups of households.

Figure 5. Singapore: External Sector
The current account surplus has averaged about 20 percent of
GDP over the past decade.

Negative valuation changes have kept Singapore’s NIIP
position at about 186 percent of GDP over the past 4 years.

Singapore has a net asset position in portfolio assets and a
net liability position in FDI holdings.

Gross official foreign reserves declined in 2014 weighed down
by valuation losses. The forward position was reduced.

The financial account is characterized by net FDI inflows and
net portfolio outflows.

Official flows and FDI are the largest contributors to net
financial flows, while bank-related flows are smaller but more
volatile.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

Figure 6. Singapore: Spillovers
Singapore depends mainly on foreign final demand from
the E.U. and U.S., while China, Japan, Indonesia and India
are important partners in the region.

Inward FDI are also dominated by the E.U. and the U.S.
and are mainly concentrated in the finance and insurance
sector.

Singapore has large portfolio assets, which would make its
external balance sheet vulnerable to shocks in the U.S and
several regional economies such as China and India.

Major sources of funding for Singapore’s financial center
include East Asian and European banks, followed by
deposits from East Asian nonbanks.

East Asia is the largest user of funds and likely to receive
outward spillovers from Singapore, in the event of a
banking sector stress in Singapore.

Cross-border exposures of domestic banks in Greater China
and other Asian economies increased, leading to higher
spillovers from the region.

Old-age dependency is projected to increase significantly

Singapore’s aging speed is among the highest in the region

The average number of children per woman is among the
lowest in the world.

Labor force participation rates have been rising for both
male and female workers.

Labor force growth has declined in recent years, after a
period of very strong growth during 2005−2009…

…contributing to a gradual increase in the capital to labor
ratio.

1/ The fiscal year runs from April 1 through March 31. The presentation of the table is based on GFSM 2001.
2/ Includes revenue from land sales and investment income.
3/ Central government spending is adjusted by adding spending by endowment and trust funds set up by the government (line (9)).
4/ Overall balance excluding investment income, capital revenue, and interest payments.
5/ Includes development and operating expenditure on education, health, national development, environment and water resources, culture, community and youth, social and
family development, communications and information, and manpower (financing security program). Includes spending on social development purposes from endowment
and trust funds set up by the government.
6/ The fiscal impulse is approximated by the change in the adjusted basic balance (basic balance derived from the authorities' budgetary accounts minus spending from
endowment and trust funds).
7/ The authorities’ budgetary accounts are based on Singapore's Constitutional rules governing the protection of Past Reserves. It includes the net investment returns
contribution, which reflects the amount of investment returns that is taken into the Budget. It excludes receipts such as proceeds from land sales and the remaining part of
investment income that accrues to Past Reserves and cannot be used to fund government expenditures without the approval of the President. While such receipts are not
reflected in the Overall Balance, the information is presented annually to Parliament and included in Budget documents.
8/ Gross asset stock figures are as at the end of March for each year.
9/ Gross debt stock figures are as at the end of the calendar year. Government debt is issued to develop domestic capital markets and to provide an investment vehicle for the
mandatory saving scheme.
10/ Temasek owns the assets on its own balance sheet. The government of Singapore is the sole equity shareholder of Temasek.
11/ The IMF staff projection for GDP is used to calculate the numbers for the 2015/16 budget in the authorities' budgetary accounts in percent of GDP.

Euro Area and Japan: High
Emerging markets: Medium
Direct and intraregional trade linkages. Singapore’s high degree of
openness and position as a financial center and a trading hub would
imply large spillovers from advanced or emerging economies’ lower
growth. High household leverage and potential asset price
corrections could exacerbate a slowdown in economic activity, with
potential spillovers to banks.

advanced markets with significant presence in Singapore’s domestic
market.

Medium

Side-effects from
global financial
conditions:
A surge in
financial
volatility
Persistent dollar

High
Corrections in asset prices and in exchange rates due to sustained
capital flow reversals and higher-than-expected increases in interest
rates could affect growth prospects through wealth effects and
deteriorate banks’ capital, especially in light of the elevated levels of
household and corporate debt and prevalence of variable interest
rates.
A decline in financial sector activity—an important driver of the
economy and very sensitive to the global risk sentiment—could
slow growth.
Liquidity risks owing to sudden retrenchment of interbank—
including intragroup—funding of offshore banks and funding
pressures due to foreign currency liabilities of domestic banks.
Dollar denominated loans off shore could see an increase in arrears.

Ensure financial institutions maintain prudent risk
management practices and have adequate
liquidity and capital buffers. Maintain close links
with home country supervisors. Recalibrate
macroprudential policies to mitigate financial
sector stress. In an extreme event, the strong
official reserve position could provide an
additional cushion. Swap lines with other central
banks could complement this.

Insufficient progress with reforms leads to a
continued buildup of vulnerabilities: Medium
Sharp slowdown in 2015–16: Low
Direct and intraregional trade linkages. A significant slowdown in
China would have both direct and indirect effects on Singapore’s
exports, on the back of increasing direct trade links between China
and the region. China is also the second largest source of tourists
for Singapore. Domestic demand would also be hit through
worsening investment sentiment.
Financial linkages. Although most of the domestic banks’ lending to
China is in the form of trade finance, total exposures have grown to
around 40 percent of GDP. Widespread corporate defaults could
lead to rising NPLs. More broadly, given Singapore’s role as a
financial center, financial stress in China could lead to a decline in
investor sentiment, pullback of funding and market volatility.

Medium to

Reputational risks. If risks related to opaque ownership structures in
the wealth management sector are not adequately addressed, any
change in perceptions about Singapore’s good reputation could
have adverse effects on the viability of the industry.

1 The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff).
The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent,
“medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and
overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix II. Singapore—External Sector Developments and
Assessment
Current account and real effective exchange rate (REER)
After narrowing by about 6½ percentage points during 2010‒12, Singapore’s current account
(CA) surplus increased by close to 2 percentage points over the past two years and reached
19.1 percent of GDP in 2014. The real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated by
26 percent since 2005, raising it above its previous peak in the late 1990s. The REER depreciated
by 0.2 percent in 2014 and is 0.5 percent lower as of May 2015 relative to the 2014 average. This
mainly reflects decelerating inflation but is also contributed by a lower NEER appreciation driven
by a strong U.S. dollar and the easing of monetary policy.
The oil price decline has led to a significant increase in the oil trade balance at the end of 2014
and the first quarter of 2015, and is expected to contribute to raising the CA in 2015 (by about
1.5 percent of GDP) if the price decline is sustained.1 A still-uncertain outlook for external
demand and more accommodative fiscal policies are expected to partially offset this. The easing
in January of MAS monetary policy through a lower trend appreciation of the nominal effective
exchange rate (NEER) band is not expected to materially affect the external balance. Overall, the
CA is expected to increase by 1–1.5 percent of GDP in 2015. The recent halt in REER appreciation
is expected to reverse over time as the temporary impact of the oil price shock on inflation is
reversed in 2016 and domestic demand picks up in response to the large terms of trade shock.
Despite narrowing during 2010–12, Singapore’s current account surplus is one of the highest in
the world and high relative to other financial centers. Historically, a very high savings rate (both
public and private) has underpinned Singapore’s current account. High public sector savings are
driven by Singapore’s prudent fiscal policy framework, which involves a balanced budget rule
over the political cycle and a cap on the transfer to the budget of investment returns earned on
government assets. In fact, fiscal policy has been more prudent than implied by these fiscal rules.
The relatively limited social safety nets, a rapid pace of projected aging, the mandatory definedcontribution pension scheme, and greater income inequality than in other countries may have
contributed to the high level of private savings. High corporate savings represent another
important driver of private savings in Singapore while its status as a financial center may have
contributed to precautionary saving motives.2
Despite having increased over the past two years, the narrowing of the current account
since 2010 is expected to be structural and continue in the medium term. In addition to the
adjustment in the rest of the world, the narrowing of Singapore’s current account will be driven

corporate savings and other structural factors that contribute to Singapore’s strong external position.

by Singapore’s economic restructuring in the near term, rapidly aging population, lower public
sector savings and enhanced social safety nets. Consistent with these structural trends, the REER
is expected to appreciate in the medium term.
Foreign asset and liability position
Singapore has a large positive net international investment position, reflecting large net portfolio
assets and official reserves. It stood at 182.5 percent of GDP at end-2014 and has been relatively
flat since 2011 after declining significantly relative to the pre-GFC peak of 254 percent of GDP in
2006. Although the size of official foreign assets held by Government Investment Corporation,
Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, is unknown, it likely accounts for a considerable share of the
portfolio holdings. Gross assets and liabilities are significant relative to GDP, which implies that
valuation changes are an important driver of changes in the foreign asset and liability position.
Singapore’s high net foreign asset position does not appear to make a significant contribution to
the current account through the income balance given the higher income paid on IIP liabilities
(mainly FDI) than on assets (portfolio and official reserves). Singapore’s NIIP position is expected
to increase over time, based on declining but still sizable current account balances that are
projected in the medium-term.
Capital and financial accounts
Singapore has a fully open capital account. The financial account deficit is mainly driven by
official sector flows, reflecting the reinvestment abroad of income from large foreign assets.
These flows tend to co-move with the global financial cycle. Net FDI inflows are also significant
and have historically been driven by foreign investment in the financial services sector. Net bankrelated flows are relatively small but gross banking sector-related flows are significant and highly
volatile. The financial account is expected to remain in deficit as long as income from net foreign
assets is reinvested abroad.
Reserve adequacy
During June 2014-March 2015, Singapore’s official reserves declined by 11 percent (29.6 billion
US$), reflecting valuation changes. There was also a large decline in the central bank’s FX swap
positions by 24 billion USD. Based on a statement issued by the central bank, most of the
receipts from maturing swaps were transferred to the sovereign wealth fund for longer term
investment.
There is no standard quantitative metric to assess reserve adequacy for advanced economies but,
as noted in recent IMF papers, scenario analysis can be a useful tool to assess a country’s reserve
needs.3 Staff’s assessment of reserve adequacy in Singapore takes into account both
precautionary and other factors related to the operation of its exchange-rate-based monetary
3

See IMF staff paper on Assessing Reserve Adequacy-Specific Proposals, April 2015.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

policy. Singapore’s position as an international financial center that does not issue a reserve
currency implies potential precautionary need for reserves in periods of market distress and low
foreign exchange liquidity.4 Singapore has a large stock of short-term external debt (354 percent
of GDP in 2014), which mainly reflects the cross-border activities of its large international
banking system and would therefore call for generous reserve buffers. However, banks’ shortterm liabilities are largely covered by their short-term external financial assets, and FSAP’s
U.S. dollar liquidity stress tests in 2013 showed that the banking sector’s FX funding gap over a
one-year horizon would be about 50 billion U.S. dollars, which is easily covered by Singapore’s
official reserves (at 252 billion U.S. dollars as of end-April 2015). In addition, Singapore’s strong
framework for effective supervision of banks and potential ability to access swap lines with major
central banks in case of a severe and generalized funding stress would reduce the need to have
significant reserve buffers.
Reserve buffers also serve an important role in the implementation of monetary policy under
Singapore’s managed exchange rate system. With the nominal effective exchange rate used as
the intermediate target, intervention is undertaken as required to achieve monetary policy’s
inflation and output goals. Based on considerations of both precautionary needs and the
effective implementation of the monetary policy framework, Singapore’s current levels of
reserves appear adequate and there is no clear case for further reserve accumulation.
Quantitative assessment of the current account and the REER
Singapore is a very open economy that serves as a regional financial center and trading hub. Its
export and import shares relative to GDP are one of the highest in the world (188 and
163 percent of GDP in 2014), and changes in its current account are relatively large, making
quantitative assessments difficult (see Figure). Singapore is also an outlier with respect to its
income per capita, pace of aging and type of pension system, and NIIP position, limiting the
applicability of quantitative assessments based on cross-country econometric models.

We use MAS’s official reserves in the assessment of reserve adequacy as opposed to the total foreign assets of
the public sector, given the more liquid nature of MAS’s foreign reserves.

7/ EBA-lite methodology extends the EBA approach to a a broader group of countries aand includes Singapore in its
sample of countries. The gap is computed relative to the cyclically-adjusted CA in 2014.

Standard CGER-like models and the EBA model were used to assess the external balance.5 The
macroeconomic balance (MB) approach allowing for a financial center dummy (staff’s preferred
MB approach specification) and the external sustainability approach imply a CA surplus of
8 percent of GDP as the norm consistent with medium-term fundamentals, and a CA gap of
7 percent of GDP relative to staff’s medium term CA projection of 14.7 percent of GDP.6 EBA-like
estimates imply a CA balance norm of 14–15 percent of GDP for 2014 in cyclically-adjusted
terms, suggesting a CA gap of about 4–6 percent of GDP relative to the cyclically-adjusted CA
balance in 2014.7 In the MB and EBA models, the current level of NFA is used as an explanatory
variable and if the high NFA level is a byproduct of past excessive surpluses, the CA balance
norm may be overstated. In the ES approach, the current level of NFA is implicitly assumed to be
optimal, which could overstate the norm in countries like Singapore with a large NFA position.

5

We only consider the current account specifications as they deliver more robust estimates compared to the
REER models.
6

The financial center dummy may capture precautionary saving motives, a high level of net foreign assets and
other characteristics that are associated with financial centers affecting saving and investment decisions.
7

Singapore is not in the sample used to estimate the EBA model because it is an outlier along several dimensions
(e.g. the NFA position, per capita income, fiscal balance and the aging speed) and nonlinearities in their impacts
on the CA would not be captured in the EBA framework. It is however included in the EBA-lite model which
extends the EBA methodology to a broader group of countries. Applying the EBA coefficients to Singapore
suggests that the CA surplus is mainly explained by the high level of productivity, the large fiscal surplus and high
rate of aging, plus a dummy regressor for status as a financial center, and its large NFA position. Of the
EBA-estimated CA gap of about 6 percent of GDP, about 1¼ percentage points is identified as policy gaps
(driven by the fiscal balance (both in Singapore and in the rest of the world) and public spending on health care)
and the remaining 4½ percentage point of GDP is the residual.

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SINGAPORE

Based on these model estimates and reflecting the wide range of uncertainty in the case of
Singapore, the current account gap is assessed to be in a range of 2‒8 percent of GDP. With
respect to the REER, staff assesses that the real exchange rate is around 4‒16 percent weaker
than warranted by medium term fundamentals and desirable policies. This estimate is drawn
from the CA assessment and relies on a semi elasticity of the CA with respect to the REER of
about 0.5, consistent with Singapore’s high level of openness. It therefore reflects the uncertainty
in the underlying CA assessment and the semi-elasticity of the CA with respect to the REER.
Despite the wide range of quantitative assessments for the current account and REER gaps, they
are still large relative to other countries covered in the External Sector Report (ESR).
Overall assessment
Based on a range of quantitative assessments and associated policy gaps, a large positive NIIP
position which is expected to increase in the medium-term, continuation of a deficit in the
financial account and adequate levels of foreign reserves, the external position is assessed to be
substantially stronger than what is consistent with medium term fundamentals and desirable
policies. However, this assessment and the size of the imbalance are subject to a wide range of
uncertainty reflecting Singapore’s very open economy and position as a global trading and
financial center. From a multilateral perspective, and consistent with the authorities’ current
policies, increased public spending, a stronger social safety net, a more-even distribution of
income across generations, helped by an expected slower absorption of foreign workers are
expected to contribute to further moderate the current account.

The current account surplus increased slightly in 2014, after
narrowing by 6½ percentage points during 2010‒2012.

The REER has depreciated slightly in 2014, driven by relative
inflation and reduced level of NEER appreciation.

Singapore’s large CA surplus reflects its extraordinary trade
openness, among other factors.

The trade balance has accounted for the strong current
account position, increasing significantly since the mid-1990s.

Singapore’s current account volatility is relatively high,

Mitigate legal risks to CCPs from
conflicts of law across jurisdictions.

4.

The CCPs to explore with members the

by MAS.

5.

6.

Encourage over-extended households
to reduce their leverage.

7.

Stand ready to adjust macroprudential
measures in the housing market in line
with changes in market conditions.

MAS has instituted a multi-year credit onsite inspection schedule
for major banks and updated the relevant guidance to supervisors.
MAS is also in the process of conducting a thematic inspection of
selected banks to assess their credit underwriting standards and
lending practices.
MAS monitors LCRs for consolidated currency, Singapore dollar and
significant foreign currencies (including the U.S. dollar) for locally
incorporated banks headquartered in Singapore on a monthly basis
since January 2015. Foreign banks subject to the LCR framework will
start reporting the LCRs from January 2016.
MAS has engaged with the U.S. and EU authorities to address crossborder legal risks to CCPs. The Singapore Exchange Derivatives
Clearing Limited (SGX-DC) is now registered with the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a derivatives
clearing organization, enabling US clients to clear trades on SGXDC. The Singapore CCP regime has been recognized by the
European Commission as equivalent, enabling European clients to
clear trades on CCPs within the Singapore CCP regime.
The Singapore Exchange (SGX) concluded that it is not practicable
to require posting of non-cash collateral at this point. A study in
2014 by SGX concluded that, although Singapore government
securities already qualify as eligible collateral, cash collateral was
preferred by clearing members of the Central Depository (Pte)
Limited and SGX-DC, because cash is most easily valued and
transferable.
MAS decided not to introduce a limit on owner-occupied loans.
When granting an owner occupied housing loan, a bank is primarily
exposed to the financial position of the borrower, and its exposure
to the property collateral is secondary. The TDSR Framework has
also helped to contain household leverage and associated stability
risks.
MAS has taken preemptive measures to curb excessive borrowing.
(i) Rules on unsecured credit facilities: Effective in June 2015, financial
institutions may not extend further credit to borrowers whose
interest-bearing unsecured debt exceeds 24 times of monthly
income. The limit will be lowered to 18 times in June 2017 and
12 times in June 2019. The industry-led Repayment Assistance
Scheme also offers a lower interest rate to help overextended
borrowers to gradually pay down debts. (ii) TDSR framework
continues to work through the system by encouraging households
to be prudent when they take up property loans. (iii) Outreach and
education: The December 2014 Financial Stability Review by MAS
warned about vulnerabilities of highly leveraged households to
interest rate or income shocks. In addition, MoneySENSE, a national
financial education program, provides financial education on
managing debt through, inter alia, talks and workshops.
MAS monitors various indicators and changes in market conditions,
including prices, transactions, and housing loans, as well as global
and domestic macroeconomic conditions. The series of propertyrelated measures taken over the past few years have dampened
momentum in the property market. Prices and transactions have
moderated and the risk profile of housing loans has improved.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MAS is on track to implement the countercyclical capital buffer
framework by January 2016, in line with the Basel III timelines.
SGX is in the process of developing its recovery and resolution
plans to be in line with the CPMI-IOSCO Recovery Report for FMIs
and the FSB Key Attributes on Effective Resolution.
SGX is reviewing the use of letter of credit (LC) and will consult CME
as appropriate. SGX is also reviewing if the clearing fund can be
used to cover losses from the Mutual Offset System (MOS) link.
The existing supervisory cooperation MOU with CFTC allows MAS to
engage with CFTC in emergency situations. MAS will consider
international standards on crisis management and include more
details on crisis coordination, where appropriate, in consultation
with CFTC.
Data collected by the consumer credit bureau have been enhanced
since June 2014, providing comprehensive information on a
borrower’s overall credit limits and aggregate outstanding debt
balances across lenders. In addition, effective in April 2015,
members of the credit bureaus have access to information on the
interest-bearing outstanding unsecured debt balances of borrowers.
MAS has issued a consultation paper in 2015Q2 on proposals to
enhance resolution regimes in Singapore. As work on resolution
funding remains at a nascent stage internationally, MAS will
continue to study and develop possible arrangements that are best
suited to Singapore’s context. MAS will also draw on evolving
international practices/standards, before finalizing the details of the
resolution funding framework.
MAS has engaged with foreign authorities to understand the
systemic importance of Singapore banks overseas, and will take this
into consideration in the resolution plans for the Singapore banks.
MAS also participates in the Crisis Management Groups of global
systemically important foreign banks. During times of crisis, MAS
will step up the level of engagement with home supervisors or
resolution authorities. In addition, MAS will issue a consultation
paper on proposals to enhance its resolution framework. Amongst
others, MAS will consult on proposed powers for MAS to impose
temporary stays on early termination rights on financial contracts.
This will contribute to orderly cross-border resolutions.
No action will be taken. In MAS’ view, MAS has legal and
institutional safeguards that protect against potential conflicts of
interest and maintains full operational independence. MAS will
review the safeguards from time to time.
MAS is in the process of reviewing the MAS Act to clarify that,
where there are safety and soundness concerns, the prudential
supervision mandate will prevail over the developmental mandate.
The recommendation is under review.

Appendix IV. Singapore―
Estimating a Monetary Policy Rule for MAS
Background. The empirical literature (Parrado (2004), McCallum (2007), IMF(2013), Mihov (2013))
has found that Singapore’s exchange rate-based monetary policy is parsimoniously characterized by
a policy rule similar to a Taylor Rule with the short-term interest rate replaced by the nominal
effective exchange rate (NEER) appreciation. This Appendix estimates a similar policy rule to address
the recent developments in NEER and the MAS policy response.
MAS reaction function. The MAS does not describe its monetary policy as following a particular
rule for NEER appreciation, rather it emphasizes the “basket-band-crawl” (BBC) nature of its policy
framework. The MAS is also not an inflation targeter but one of its principal objectives as specified
in the MAS Act is “to maintain price stability conducive to sustainable growth of the economy.” As
argued by McCallum (2006 and 2007), if the parameters of the “basket-band-crawl” framework are
adjusted to target a certain inflation and output objective, a rule based on the exchange rate can be
a reasonable characterization of the monetary policy framework. Parrado (2004) is the first paper
that has estimated a policy rule with inflation and output objectives.
∆𝑒𝑡 = (1 − 𝜌)∆𝑒𝑡∗ + 𝜌∆𝑒𝑡−1 + 𝜏𝑡
∆𝑒𝑡∗ = ∆𝑒 + 𝛽(𝐸[𝜋𝑡+𝑛 |𝜑𝑡 ] − 𝜋 ∗ ) + 𝛾(𝐸[𝑦𝑡+𝑚 |𝜑𝑡 ] − 𝑦 ∗ )
Where ∆𝑒𝑡 is the NEER appreciation which is adjusted based on the target/equilibrium NEER
appreciation (∆𝑒𝑡∗ ) while allowing for some degree of policy inertia captured by the parameter (𝜌).
The target exchange rate appreciation is a function of expected inflation n periods ahead from the
inflation target, 𝜋 ∗ , and the expected deviation of output in m periods from its target, 𝑦 ∗ . The two
equations can be combined to estimate the following reduced form equation:
∆𝑒𝑡 = (1 − 𝜌)𝛼 + (1 − 𝜌)𝛽𝜋𝑡+𝑛 + (1 − 𝜌)𝛾𝑥𝑡+𝑚 + 𝜌∆𝑒𝑡−1 + 𝜀𝑡
Where 𝛼 = ∆𝑒 − 𝛽𝜋 ∗ and 𝑥𝑡 = 𝑦𝑡 − 𝑦 ∗ . Different versions of his estimated policy rule were explored
in McCallum (2007) and IMF (2013). Previous estimates all find a high degree of policy inertia, a
strong and significant response to expected inflation and the output gap. IMF (2013) also used unit
labor costs (ULCs) as an alternative policy target instead of the standard expected inflation, finding a
more robust relationship between the NEER and the ULCs.
Updated estimates. We update estimates in previous papers by including more recent data and
using alternative inflation measures and then ask for the predicted NEER appreciation for 2015
consistent with the estimated policy rule. We use IMF staff estimates of the output gap as well as the
HP filter estimate (respectively, specifications 1 and 2).1 We also experiment with using one-year1

The IMF staff estimate of the output gap is very similar to the HP filter estimate but for the more recent period, the
staff estimate assumes a higher output gap consistent with the authorities’ estimates.

ahead inflation expectations from Consensus directly as opposed to using instruments for expected
inflation (specification 3). We also try breaking down inflation into ULC and import prices in foreign
currency in the monetary policy reaction function (specification 4). Finally we experiment with using
core inflation as opposed to headline inflation (specification 5). We use 1991Q1–2014Q4 as our
sample but also run rolling window regressions to look at the stability of estimates. Inflation, ULC
and import price inflation are the 4-quarter ahead, 4-quarter moving average of inflation, ULC
increase and import price inflation respectively. The contemporaneous value of the output gap is
used in all regressions. Finally four lags of inflation and output gap are used as instruments.

Main findings. Results indicate that the coefficient of lagged NEER is always significant and large
(around 0.65-0.7), suggesting a high degree of policy inertia. The coefficient for expected future
inflation suggests that MAS increases NEER appreciation by 1.33 percent when future inflation
increases by one percentage point. This results in a REER appreciation of 0.33 percent. The estimates
of 𝛽 using Consensus inflation expectations and core inflation are higher at 2 and 3.5 percent
respectively. In some specifications the estimate of the response to output gap is also significant at
around 0.12–0.17. The model fit is very good under all specifications. Rolling window estimates show

Appendix V. Singapore Productivity and Growth―Record and
Prospects
Singapore’s growth and development record since independence has been impressive. The
economy has grown at an average annual rate of 7.7 percent since independence, and annual
growth in living standards (per capita real GDP) has reached a stunning 5.4 percent. Growth was
even faster (8.7 percent per annum) until 2000. Capital accumulation has been the largest growth
driver (over 40 percent), followed by effective labor (about a third), and TFP (about a quarter).
Growth in effective labor was due to both increases in labor force and substantial improvements in
labor quality.1 The temporal profile of the contributions was stable, except for TFP, whose
contribution fell by about 1 percentage point in the 1980s, partly compensated by rising labor
quality. In the recent past economic growth was driven by growing capital intensity and gains in
labor quality as well as growth in labor inputs. From 1995 to 2010, growth averaged 5.7 percent per
annum. The contribution of physical capital accumulation to growth was 2.5 percentage points
(45 percent). The contribution of labor was 1.7 percent (30 percent). Improvements in the quality of
labor contributed 9 percent, and TFP’s contribution was 15 percent.

Capital accumulation. Investment has also made an important contribution to Singapore’s growth
in the period following the global financial crisis, in contrast with many Advanced Economies (AEs)
where investment has been subdued.2 Singapore’s strong investment performance could reflect its
trade and financial links with Emerging Asia which was booming during this period. Investment has
weakened most recently during the transition to Singapore’s new growth model, which relies less on
foreign workers, and amid an uncertain global recovery. In 2014, gross fixed investment contracted
for the first time in more than ten years. Going forward, investment is expected to rebound (to an

When compared with other countries, and taking investment projections in the pre crisis period into account,
Singapore is one of the few AEs in which investment surpassed projections by a large margin. See World Economic

average annual rate of growth of 3.6 percent) as firms raise their capital-labor ratios amid lower
growth in foreign labor inputs.
The role of services. Singapore has moved up in the production value chain over time and is now
exporting pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and other high end manufactures as well as modern
services, whose share in GDP, has doubled (from 16 to 32 percent) between 1965 and 2014. In
recent years, services and services exports have recorded robust growth, driven by financial and
business management, accounting, engineering, legal and other professional services, which now
account for 40 percent of services exports.3 Services exports add more value per dollar exported and
are expected to grow in importance reflecting structural shifts in the economy. A key factor will be
the increased internationalization of services, a trade category that is still subject to significant
regulation and impediments. Work now under way to reduce barriers in trade services in ASEAN and
other high quality trade agreements can provide an important additional boost to services trade and
activity. While the value added by services exports has grown, that of goods has remained constant
in relation to GDP in line with those of other regional economies.
Potential growth. Like other AEs, Singapore has experienced a moderation of its potential growth
in recent years. AE growth slowdown is

capital is expected to be 1.3 percentage points, TFP is expected to contribute 1 percentage point,
labor quality 0.6 percentage points, and labor quantity 0.3 percentage points. Growth is expected to
be increasingly driven by gains in labor productivity, projected about 2 percent per year.5 Regarding
labor force growth, the Ministry of Manpower expects resident workforce growth to slow to an
average of 20,000 per year in the second half of the 2010s, less than a third of the 66,000 of the last
five years. The labor force participation of older workers and women has been rising and has
reached about 70 and 60 percent, respectively, in 2014, providing a boost to labor input. Overall,
workforce growth is projected at 1–2 percent during 2015–20, taking into account aging, reduced
numbers of foreign workers, and the already high participation of older workers and women.

Foreign labor force growth is projected at 0.7 percent per year. Slower growth in labor input could
drive up wages and unit labor costs and the wage-rental ratio. Investment and TFP growth have
been subdued in recent years but are projected to recover over time as firms adjust to higher
desired capital-labor ratios.
Labor productivity. Growth in labor productivity slowed to 2½ percent per year in the post-crisis
period (2009–14). Employment growth for high skilled workers moderated during this period, and
that of low skilled workers rose, as the restructuring effort unfolded. Higher participation of older
workers lowered economy wide productivity. Labor productivity grew more in export oriented
sectors, including biomedical manufacturing, precision engineering and transport engineering.
These gains were partially offset by employment shifts towards less productive sectors, including
Construction and Food & Beverage Services. Higher employment in construction is in part the
consequence of increased investment in public housing and Mass Rail Transit (MRT). A reallocation
of labor toward less productive sectors during a financial boom is not an anomaly.6 Labor
productivity was boosted by gains in capital intensity related to greater availability of machinery and
equipment and of buildings and infrastructure. Recently, however, machinery and equipment
investment has slowed down weighed by uncertainties in the global economy and the ongoing
restructuring.7
Raising labor productivity. Singapore has already high labor productivity in several sectors, in
particular subsectors in manufacturing. A comparison with the United States shows that there is
room for productivity improvements in construction, services and some other sectors. This situation
is not uncommon in AEs and reforms in the services sectors of high productivity economies can
provide a benchmark.
Restructuring. Singapore is meeting the twin challenges of slower workforce growth and an aging
population amid a sluggish global growth environment. A panoply of measures is aimed at raising
labor productivity and TFP growth and achieving potential growth consistent with the physical limits
of a city state. Restructuring policies cover a wide area. Inflows of foreign labor have slowed down
following the imposition of stricter quantitative restrictions and higher levies. Since 2010, Singapore
has introduced progressive gradual increases in levies for firms hiring foreign workers. There are also
sector specific quotas, defined through the Dependency Ratio Ceilings, which affect the proportion
of foreign to domestic employees, and which have been reduced. The government is supporting
investments in human capital, most notably through the program Skills Future which finances
spending in education and training. It covers educational expenses in support of on-the-job
education and training or outside any job relationship.

Incentives. The authorities are also using grants and tax credits to support investments in
technology and improved business practices. To encourage innovation and internationalization, the
Capability Development Plan supports small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the National

With similar objectives, the Business Angels Scheme, Startup Enterprise Development Scheme and the
Venture Debt Risk-Sharing Program help secure financing of start ups. The Double Tax Deduction for
Internationalization Scheme contributes to cover salaries for Singaporeans posted to new overseas
entities. The International Growth Scheme reduces the taxes for income from international activities.
The Mergers and Acquisitions Scheme and the Internationalization Finance Scheme both encourage
the scaling up international business operations.
The transition. The restructuring involves a lengthy transition. The Transition Support Package helps
firms and households cope, with measures that will be gradually phased out. The Wage Credit
Scheme co-funds wage increases of Singaporean employees earning below S$4,000. The Corporate
Income Tax Rebate mitigates the impact of rising costs related to restructuring. The Productivity and

Appendix VI. Singapore Pension Reform―
Recent Initiatives and Issues
Introduction. In the face of rapid population aging and high income inequality, the Singapore
government has recently taken several measures to strengthen retirement income, particularly for
low income pensioners. The changes now under way in the Central Provident Fund (CPF) are helping
to recalibrate intergenerational risk-sharing in Singapore. This Appendix provides an overview of the
CPF and describes recent (2014–15) and planned changes to the CPF and their implications together
with suggestions to better achieve its core mandate of providing adequate retirement income.
Aging. Singapore is aging rapidly. According to the United Nations, its old-age dependency
ratio―the ratio of the population aged 65 years or over to the population aged 15–64―is projected
to increase from 12.2 percent in 2010 to 48.7 percent in 2050. Life expectancy at age 65 is among
the highest in the world, reaching 20.3 years between 2010 and 2015, and is expected to rise further.
As a result, according to the United Nations Singapore is projected to experience a sharp decline in
the share of its working-age population between 2010 and 2040. Informal family support for old age
is important in Singapore and has complemented the CPF. However, family ties could weaken over
time, calling for a stronger role for the CPF.

Central Provident Fund. The CPF was created in 1955, as a defined contribution, fully funded
scheme that requires Singaporeans to make contributions to individual CPF accounts. As of March
2015, the 3.6 million CPF members had total balances of S$282 billion. The CPF is administered by
its board and supervised by the Ministry of Manpower. Eligible employees can delay retirement for
three years after retirement age of 62. CPF contributions amount to 36 percent of individual
earnings and are high compared to around 8 percent in average OECD countries with defined
contribution scheme. The authorities recently raised contribution rates and the minimum sum that
must be set aside for life-long monthly payouts. Raising contributions going forward appears to be
difficult given their high level and impact on business costs. Measures to strengthen the CPF’s
redistribution function are budget-financed and are facilitated by the soundness of Singapore’s
public finances.

Accounts and Annuities. CPF members have three accounts which are ring-fenced for specific
purposes: the Ordinary Account for housing, investment and education needs; the Special Account
for retirement and investment needs; and the Medisave Account for medical needs. At 55, the
Retirement Account is created by transferring the savings from the Ordinary and Special Accounts
and stipulated minimum sum are set aside to provide an annuity (a life-long monthly payout) paid
by CPF life to pensioners starting at age 65. In July 2014 the minimum sum was raised from
S$148,000 to S$155,000; it is to be raised further to S$161,000 in July 2015 and provides about
S$1,200 per month. Starting from 2016, three different minimum sums will be made available for
CPF members to choose from depending on their economic situations and preferences, which will
provide monthly payouts ranging from S$700 to S$1,900. These minimum sums are: S$80,500 for
the Basic Retirement Sum; S$161,000 for the Full Retirement Sum; and S$241,500 for the Enhanced
Retirement Sum.
Investment and rate of return. Since the CPF’s inception in 1955 contributions have been invested
in risk-free Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGSs). CPF interest rates are pegged to returns
on investments of comparable risk and duration in the market. Hence, changes in the yields on
market instruments such as Singapore Government Bonds and fixed deposits will automatically have
an impact on CPF interest rates through the interest rate pegs. To shield members from the risk of
low market interest rates, the Singapore government has maintained a floor interest rate of
2.5 percent for the Ordinary Account and a floor interest rate of 4 percent for the Special, Medisave,
and Retirement Accounts (SMRA). In 2008, the extra interest was introduced as part of government’s
efforts to enhance CPF members’ retirement savings. Under this policy, an additional 1 percent
interest rate is paid on the first S$60,000 of a CPF members’ combined balances, with up to
S$20,000 from the Ordinary Account. From 2016, additional extra interest will be paid on the first
S$30,000 of CPF balances for CPF members aged 55 and above. In practice, since 1999, the
minimum guaranteed return ranging from 2.5 to 4 percent has been applied. In the current low
interest rate environment, the CPF’s minimum legislated interest rates are significantly higher than
computed interest rates currently of about 0.2 percent for the OA and about 3.3 percent for the
SMRA, based on the interest rate peg formula.
CPF adequacy. In Singapore, as has been noted in the literature, older generations of retirees have
lower retirement savings within the CPF. This is due to several factors: significantly lower wages in
the past and greater uses of their CPF savings for home purchases and education and health care
needs. Members can use CPF savings in down payments when purchasing house or to make regular
mortgage payments. This has resulted in significant amounts of pre-retirement withdrawals from the
CPF for housing purposes: as of 2013, around a third of CPF contributors were using their CPF
savings for housing mortgages and made some retirees asset rich but cash poor. The net
withdrawals of CPF savings for housing have also been on the rise, accounting for 32.3 percent of
total contributions and 55.5 percent of total withdrawals in 2014. The older generation of retirees
also did not benefit as much from recent policy changes such as the extra 1 percent interest on the
first S$60,000 of CPF balances. Besides housing needs, the CPF savings can be also used to pay for
medical expenses via the Medisave account. But while reducing their retirement savings, CPF savings
allowed many older Singaporeans to meet their housing needs and contributed to a very high home

enough CPF savings to meet their Basic Retirement Sum that provides monthly payouts of about
S$700. However, caution is needed in comparing income replacement rates across countries.
Replacement rates in Singapore are not readily comparable to those of other countries given that
the bulk of CPF savings are used for housing purchases, which reduce housing-related expenses in
retirement.

are not indexed to prices. Erosion of real retirement savings has made some countries with defined
contribution systems adopt price indexation. The authorities have made efforts to provide stable
and reasonable returns on top of inflation through various schemes including extra 1 percent
interest on lower balance of CPF. The compounding effect of the extra 1 percent interest, on top of
long term bond rates, should over the long run help to shore up members' CPF savings―especially
those in the lower-income groups. It should also be noted that a large proportion of CPF savings of
Singaporeans is invested in housing, which is a hedge against inflation.
CPF reform directions. Substantial reforms to the CPF are under way. These follow the creation of a
CPF Advisory Panel in Sep 2014 to review ways to strengthen the CPF system. Reforms are made in a
deliberate manner after close consultation with tripartite partners and taking into account evolving
economic conditions. The changes under way in the CPF system should help to strengthen its
redistributive functions, provide greater flexibility to CPF members and strengthen CPF adequacy
particularly for low-income pensioners.
CPF reforms under way. The Government has accepted Part One of the CPF Advisory Panel’s
recommendations. These changes and additional ones included in the 2015 budget changes should
make the CPF more flexible to the members’ needs and responsible for retirement income (Table 1).
They include the creation of three minimum sums with different payout options; an option to

receive higher payout in return for working beyond 65; higher salary ceiling for CPF contributions;
equating contribution rates for older workers with those paid by younger ones2; and higher interest
rates for CPF members aged 55 and above on the first S$30,000 of their CPF balances, which raises
the rate of return they can earn up to 6 percent risk-free on their retirement balances. Importantly,
from the first quarter of 2016, a new Silver Support Scheme will be introduced as a permanent
feature in Singapore’s social security system. It is targeted at the bottom 20 percent of Singaporeans
aged 65 and above with a lower level of support extended to cover up to 30 percent of seniors.
About 150,000 of today’s elderly are expected to receive Silver Support payouts of between S$300
and S$750 per quarter. Assessment will not require application of eligible people and to ensure that
assistance goes to those with lesser means, the Singapore Government will look at several factors
such as lifetime wages, the level of household support, and housing type.
Future CPF reforms. The CPF Advisory Panel is undertaking its second phase of study, which
includes recommendations on (i) improving a CPF LIFE plan to address increasing costs of living over
time; and (ii) providing more flexibility for members to take more risk with their CPF savings for
higher return. The study is due to be completed by end- 2015. Together with additional measures
announced in the 2015 budget, the changes are intended to provide greater flexibility to CPF
members to meet their individual retirement needs while enhancing retirement adequacy by helping
members save more while working and increasing the payouts that they can receive in retirement.
These changes have important implications for labor force participation of older workers and fiscal
costs.
Strengthening the CPF’s redistribution function. The CPF is becoming more progressive through
various devices, including the extra interest paid on lower CPF balance. Transfers from the
government budget are another means of increasing the CPF’s progressivity: these take place in the
CPF through Workfare, housing grants and Medisave top-ups and are funded from the Singapore
government budget, not through transfers from one generation to the next. This feature
underscores the strength of the CPF system, which is sustainable and avoids promises made to the
current generation that must eventually be funded by future ones.
The treatment of housing costs. Costs associated with the features of the CPF to encourage home
ownership, most prominent type of drawing down retirement income, have an important bearing on
the assessment of retirement income adequacy. In this context, further facilitating the liquidation of
houses through financial instruments such as reverse mortgage scheme can play an important role.
In Singapore, a flat provided through the Housing Development Board (HDB) is both a home
producing a stream of housing services for those who live in it and an asset―a store of value and a
hedge against inflation.

CPF contribution rates for older workers had been lowered in the past to enhance their employability. With the
economic restructuring under way, employment rates of older residents have risen significantly in recent years. The
authorities have therefore progressively raised CPF contribution rates for older workers. With the latest announced
change, the contribution rates for workers aged 50–55 will be restored to be on par with younger workers.

Tighter use of CPF funds for housing. The Singapore government is committed to providing
affordable HDB flats to Singaporeans. This has been done by increasing housing grants for the lower
to middle-income households. At the same time, mortgage financing for HDB flats has been
tightened, by reducing the maximum loan tenure for HDB loans from 30 years to 25 years, such that
households do not over-leverage themselves in their housing purchase. This will ensure that the
additional grants do not lead to greater expenditure in housing, so that Singaporeans set aside
income from the later years of their working lives for their medical and retirement needs. The
authorities have also put in place policies to ensure that CPF members buy a property within their
financial means without excessively depleting their CPF retirement savings. For instance, a member's
usage of CPF savings for housing is capped at the Valuation Limit (VL), which is the lower of the
purchase price or property value at the time of purchase. To use his CPF savings beyond the VL, he
has to first set aside the Basic Retirement Sum in his CPF accounts, and the absolute amount of CPF
savings that can be used for housing is capped at 120 percent of VL.
Monetizing housing wealth. The authorities have also introduced schemes, such as the Enhanced
Lease Buyback3 scheme and the Silver Housing Bonus, to help the elderly monetize their housing
asset for retirement needs. The recent increase in older workers’ contribution rates will also help to
boost retirement savings for older workers nearing retirement. The authorities are constantly
reviewing the CPF scheme to better help the elderly monetize housing wealth. To supplement
retirement income of asset-rich but cash-poor seniors, it would be useful to promote wider use of
market based schemes to monetize real estate, including reverse mortgage. To this end, more
efforts are needed to overcome limits in increasing the take-up rate of reverse mortgages, which are
associated with risks from the volatility of real estate price, longevity and interest rate as well as
operational, legal and reputational risks that are unique to reverse mortgage. The tilt toward
housing purchase should be reduced to make the CPF more dedicated to its core function of
providing necessary retirement income. Continuous review is needed to ensure CPF savings
allocated for the purchase of CPF annuity are adequate in light of the changes in standard of living,
life expectancy and labor market developments.
Minimum rate of return on CPF contributions. The rate of return earned on CPF contributions is
an important element in retirement adequacy. As discussed earlier, since 1999 the Singapore
government has offered CPF members a legislated minimum interest rate which shields them from
the risk of low market interest rates. In the current environment, legislated interest rates are
significantly higher than market interest rates. This could raise sustainability issue—the potential
fiscal costs involved in maintaining the minimum interest rate—even if associated risks are
circumscribed by Singapore’s strong public finances to some extent.

This is a type of reverse mortgage, a loan that allows senior homeowners to access a portion of their home’s equity
to supplement their retirement income. Under this scheme, they sell part of their flat lease to HDB and the proceeds
are used to top up their CPF Retirement Account, which provide higher monthly payout. These loans generally do not
have to be repaid until the last surviving homeowner permanently moves out of the property or passes away. At that
time, the estate can repay the balance of the loan or sell the home to pay off the balance.

Enhancing the CPF rate of return. There is scope to enhance the rate of return of CPF, including
through changes in its investment scheme. The CPF Advisory Panel is reviewing how to provide
more flexibility for members to take more risk with their CPF savings for higher return. Today, the
CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) allows members to invest some of their CPF savings in a wide range
of investments such as shares and loan stocks, unit trusts, government bonds, statutory board
bonds, bank deposits, fund management accounts, endowment insurance policies, investmentlinked insurance policies (ILPs), exchange traded funds (ETFs) and gold.
Singapore Savings Bonds (SSBs). The recent announcement to make Savings Bonds available to
local investors could enhance investment returns of CPF members. Savings Bonds is a special type of
Singapore government securities with features of easy access by individual investors, allowing them
to invest up to 10 years with as little as S$500. The SSBs aims to expand the range of simple, lowcost investment options available to individual retail investors with a long-term savings option that
offers safe returns. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) expects to launch the Savings Bonds
program in the second half of 2015. Further details, including whether the SSBs will be open to CPF
monies, will be announced later.
Diversifying asset portfolio. CPF returns could be further enhanced through its well-diversified
asset portfolio. One or two of percentage points’

Voluntary pension schemes. For the majority of Singaporeans, the CPF remains at the core of
providing for their old age security. Beyond mandatory contributions, both individuals and
employers can make voluntary contributions to the CPF accounts and enjoy tax benefits. For the less
well-off, the Government provides support through Workfare, housing grants and the enhanced
interest scheme. In addition, the Income Tax Act provides tax deductions to employers if they wish
to provide corporate retirement plans for their employees. Those who wish to save on their own
may tap on the Supplementary Retirement Scheme, or SRS operated by the private sector. They will
enjoy tax benefits on the SRS contributions they make. This scheme is subject to government review
from time to time.
Summary remarks. The Singaporean authorities are engaged in an ambitious yet affordable multiyear effort to strengthen collective responsibility while remaining true to the principle of personal
responsibility. As part of this effort, the ability of the CPF to provide adequate support for old age is

being strengthened and retirement savings in the CPF of successive cohorts are expected to
improve. Recent policy moves to enhance retirement adequacy, by providing targeted cash transfers
and raising contribution rates and the age of retirement, are welcome. There is scope for further
reviewing the income replacement rate for retirees of various age cohorts and income groups, and
facilitating the monetization of housing wealth, as well as diversifying the CPF asset portfolio.
Particularly, continuous review of the replacement rate would ensure CPF savings dedicated to the
purchase of CPF annuity are adequate in light of the changes in standard of living, life expectancy
and labor market developments.
Table. Changes to CPF, with effect from January 2016


The salary ceiling for which CPF contributions are payable will be increased from S$5,000 to
S$6,000 per month.



CPF contribution rates for older workers will be increased. Older workers aged 50–55 will have
the same contribution rates as their younger counterparts.



CPF members aged 55 and above will enjoy an additional extra interest of 1 percent on the
first S$30,000 of their CPF balances. This means that members aged 55 and above can earn up
to 6 percent risk-free interest on their retirement balances.



From the first quarter of 2016, a new Silver Support Scheme will be introduced as a permanent
feature in Singapore’s social security system.



CPF members can make additional top-ups to an “Enhanced Retirement Sum” from age 55 to
get lifelong payouts of up to about S$1,900 per month from age 65



CPF members will need to meet a lower threshold of savings (i.e. the Basic Retirement Sum)
before they can transfer their savings to their spouses’ CPF Accounts



CPF members will only need to choose their CPF LIFE annuity plans when they want to start
payouts, at age 65 or later, up to age 70, instead of the current system where they have to
choose their plans at age 55 and payouts start at 65.



The CPF Board will introduce a guided one-to-one retirement planning service to CPF
members to help them better understand the various CPF options and decide on the option
best suited for their individual needs and circumstances.



Starting from the cohort that turned 55 in 2013, CPF members will be able to withdraw up to
20 percent of their retirement savings when they reach their payout eligibility age of 65.

Exchange Arrangement
Singapore’s de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as “stabilized.” The de jure exchange
rate arrangement is “other managed.” The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) monitors its
value against an undisclosed basket of currencies and intervenes in the market to maintain this value
within an undisclosed target band. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. Singapore has
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange rate system
free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions,
except for restrictions maintained solely for the preservation of national or international security,
which have been notified to the Fund in accordance with the procedures set forth in Executive Board
decision 144-(52/51). Singapore maintains restrictions on Singapore dollar credit facilities to, and
bond and equity issuance by, nonresident financial institutions. Singapore-dollar proceeds obtained
by nonresident financial entities (such as banks, merchant banks, finance companies, and hedge
funds) from loans exceeding S$5 million, or any amount for equity listings or bond issuance to
finance activities outside Singapore must be swapped or converted into foreign currency upon
draw-down. Financial institutions are prohibited from extending Singapore-dollar credit facilities in
excess of S$5 million to nonresident financial entities if there is reason to believe that the

Singapore-dollar proceeds may be used for Singapore-dollar currency speculation. In a bid to
contain a real estate price bubble, Singapore imposed additional stamp duties on purchases by
foreigners and corporate entities of residential properties in Singapore.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. While the authorities have continued to
expand the range of publicly available data, dissemination of more disaggregated data would
enhance the basis for macroeconomic policy analysis, particularly in the external, monetary and fiscal
areas.
National accounts: The Singapore Department of Statistics (DOS) has made improvements in data
sources and methodology. The reconciliation of various national accounts estimates was conducted
in 2014, resulting in lower statistical discrepancies. DOS has completed the rebasing of Singapore’s
national accounts to reference year 2010.
Price statistics: DOS has completed the rebasing of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to base
year 2014. The CPI is rebased once every five years to reflect the latest consumption pattern and
composition of goods and services consumed by resident households.
Government finance statistics: Information on government assets held abroad is neither published
nor provided to the Fund. The government publishes annually partial information on the interest and
dividends on these assets. Debt service payments on domestic debt made from the extra budgetary
Government Securities Fund are published on an annual basis. Data on the financial position of the
consolidated public sector are not published.
Monetary statistics: The Monetary Authority of Singapore has not submitted the standardized report
forms (SRFs) for monetary statistics introduced in October 2004. The SRFs provide for accounting
data to be broken down by instrument, sector, and currency.
Balance of payments: In February 2012, the DOS concluded the migration of the balance of
payments accounts to the 6th edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position
Manual (BPM6). The main changes relative to the 5th edition include: reclassification of repairs on
goods for processing fees to services (from goods); reclassification of merchanting to goods (from
services); and treating banks’ Asian Currency Units (ACUs) as residents (previously they were regarded
as nonresidents, and hence their transactions were excluded from the balance of payments). Data on
Singapore’s international investment position (IIP) is not provided on a disaggregated sectoral basis
as suggested by the BPM6. The authorities have completed revising the IIP data to include all foreign
assets held by Singapore’s Government Investment Corporation. The associated flows were already
included in the balance of payments data.
Data Standards and Quality
Singapore provides data on a timely basis and
meets all the SDDS specifications. These
include the coverage, periodicity, and
timeliness of the data; and the dissemination of
advance release calendars; quarterly
certification of the metadata posted on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board;
and provision of information to allow users to
assess data quality.

Introduction

1.1
The Singapore economy has developed rapidly over the past five decades,
recording average real GDP growth of almost 8% p.a. Amid a lack of natural
endowments and a small domestic market, the country’s strong economic performance
reflected in large part its embrace of an outward-oriented development strategy. The
extreme openness of the economy, however, meant that Singapore has been subject to
frequent external shocks. Over the years, the domestic household, corporate and public
sectors have built up significant financial buffers and developed the flexibility needed to
deal with adverse shocks. The government has been responsive to short-term fluctuations
in economic activity, even as it has ensured the medium-term economic consistency and
sustainability of its policies.
1.2
With the maturing of the economy, Singapore’s potential growth rate has slowed
in recent years, to around 2–4%. The authorities are keenly aware of the new challenges
facing the economy at this juncture, and are firmly committed to policies to facilitate the
transition toward more skill-intensive, productivity-driven growth. This will lay the
foundation for sustainable, inclusive growth in the medium-to-long term, consistent with
shifts in Singapore’s comparative advantage.

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook

2.1
Singapore’s GDP growth decelerated slightly from 4.9% q-o-q SAAR in Q4 2014
to 4.2% in Q1 this year (2.8% in y-o-y terms), largely due to a reversal of momentum in
the sentiment-sensitive segments within the financial services industry. This drag was
partly offset by a stronger performance in the trade-related sectors, as activity recovered
in
some
oil-related industries. Over the next few quarters, the domestic economy should remain
on a moderate growth trajectory, with GDP growth forecasted to come in at 2–4% in
2015. The external-oriented industries will benefit from gradual improvements in the
global economy, as well as some pick-up in the global IT industry. Domestic-oriented
sectors should stay resilient, supported by a pipeline of public sector-driven expansions in
healthcare and education, as well as in transport infrastructure.
2.2
The impact of sharply lower global oil prices and enhanced government subsidies
for healthcare and education continued to exert downward pressure on Singapore’s
consumer prices. Cost pass-through has moderated as well. As a result, both MAS Core
Inflation and CPI-All Items Inflation eased by around 1% point from H2 2014, to an
average of 0.8% and −0.4% in Jan–May 2015, respectively. Going forward, both
external and domestic price developments are expected to stay benign given ample
supply buffers in major commodities, and a moderate domestic growth environment,
respectively. There will also be temporary disinflationary effects from budgetary
measures, and from expected increases in housing supply and quotas for motor vehicle

purchases. Consequently, both MAS Core Inflation and CPI-All Items inflation are
expected to be lower in 2015 compared with last year, and projected at 0.5–1.5% and
−0.5–0.5%, respectively.
2.3
There are, however, potential headwinds to growth. As highlighted in the Staff
Report, the Singapore economy is particularly exposed to external risks. These risks
include a sharper-than-expected deceleration in China, financial market volatility in
response to recent developments in the Eurozone and the uncertainty about the timing
and extent of the Fed’s interest rate hikes. On the inflation front, the labour market
remains tight, with strong demand for workers in specific sectors. The authorities remain
vigilant over underlying cost pressures which could feed into higher consumer prices,
although its extent will depend on the strength of the underlying economic conditions.

Monetary Policy

3.1
Singapore’s macroeconomic policy approach has been to balance the mediumterm considerations of growth and inflation, while facilitating the ongoing restructuring
of the economy. The economy has transited to a more sustainable growth path of around
2–4%, consistent with estimates in the Staff Report, alongside a narrowing of the positive
output gap. CPI-All Items inflation has also retreated from above-trend rates in 2010–13.
At the same time, credit growth and property prices have moderated.
3.2
In January 2015, MAS reduced the slope of the S$NEER policy band but kept it
on a modest and gradual appreciation path. The balance of risks had tilted towards lower
inflation for the year as a whole, as global oil prices fell sharply, while wage growth and
cost pass-through had been moderate. Nevertheless, an appreciating bias was maintained
as underlying cost and price pressures were expected to reassert themselves, albeit
modestly, once the effects of the oil price shock and budgetary measures fade.
3.3
MAS subsequently kept the policy stance unchanged in April, as economic
growth and inflation had evolved as envisaged in the January Monetary Policy Statement.
This policy stance is consistent with medium-term price stability and a level of economic
activity that is close to its potential.
3.4
The economy has faced low global interest rates for an extended period. The
risks of market volatility associated with the normalisation of rates would be mitigated by
the depth and breadth of Singapore’s financial markets, while the exchange rate policy
band would absorb the accompanying fluctuations in international currencies.

Addressing Medium-term Challenges

4.1
The Singapore economy has been undergoing important structural changes
towards productivity-driven growth. Since restructuring initiatives began in 2010
following the Economic Strategies Committee (ESC) report, broad incentive structures
have been put in place to help firms reduce their reliance on labour in favour of more
skill, technology and capital-intensive techniques. Budget 2015 recalibrated some of the

incentives and support measures to help firms cope with the short-term costs of
restructuring while sustaining efforts to improve productivity.
4.2
In addition, Budget 2015 marked a shift in the government’s approach towards
restructuring, by explicitly focusing on enhancing the stock of human capital and
ensuring that workforce capabilities are progressively raised and attuned to future needs
of employers in each industry. The SkillsFuture initiative is a national movement to
develop the skills of the future, and help every Singaporean maximise his or her potential
through working life. To encourage lifelong learning, there will be new initiatives such
as credits for work-skills related courses, awards and fellowships to deepen skills and
develop mastery in niche areas, enhanced training support for mid-career workers and
stronger industry collaboration. These initiatives are being developed in collaboration
with industry, unions and training institutes for all key sectors.
4.3
Even as the economy faces transitional headwinds in the restructuring journey, the
authorities have continued to strengthen social safety nets and enhance support for lower
and middle-income citizens. The Silver Support Scheme was introduced in the recent
Budget to provide an income supplement for the bottom 30% of elderly Singaporeans
based on their lifetime income, extent of family support and housing type. It
complements Workfare, housing grants and other government schemes1 which provide
transfers to lower- and middle-income earners and retirees. Outside of Silver Support, an
individual retiree in the bottom 30% receives on average about $640 a month today from
the government in subsidies and transfers.
4.4
The initiatives that were implemented over the past five years, taken together with
the further steps in this year’s Budget, amount to a major programme to support lowerand middle-income Singaporeans. Moreover, the tight labour market has benefited
lower-income households, who have seen a significant lift in incomes in recent years.
Real household incomes from work have also gone up significantly, with the lowest 30%
of households enjoying real income growth in the range of 3.2–3.9% per annum in 2009–
14, as compared to 0.6–2.6% in 2004–09, per household member.
4.5
At the same time, the government strives to ensure the sustainability of its Budget
commitments. The government plans ahead and prepares for future rising expenditures.
For instance, monies were set aside last year to fully fund the projected long-term cost of
the Pioneer Generation Package, so as to allow subsequent Budgets to focus on the needs
and challenges of the future. The government’s sources of revenue also remain welldiversified. The Net Investment Returns (NIR) framework, while providing a steady and
sustainable stream of revenue, ensures that our investment returns on reserves are spent in
a sustainable manner to benefit both current and future generations.
4.6
Singapore’s fiscal balances are presented in line with the rules enshrined in the
Constitution and decided upon by the Parliament—the fiscal rules allow the government
1

These include Workfare, housing grants, GST Vouchers, Community Health Assist Scheme
(CHAS), ComCare, and other government subsidies in healthcare and other areas.

to spend only the revenue it earns during its current term. However, the detailed revenue
and expenditure components are available in published Budget documents, and the
general government finance data that follows the GFSM format is made available in the
Yearbook of Statistics published by the Department of Statistics. The Ministry of
Finance has also been publishing the fiscal impulse as part of the Budget documents to
indicate the macro-economic impact of the Budget, based on a commonly accepted
methodology. A major source of difference between the fiscal balances that follow the
Constitutional rules and the GFSM is the treatment of proceeds from land sales. The
Overall Budget Balance excludes proceeds derived from the sale of land, as these are not
available for spending during the current term of Government. Under Singapore’s
Constitution, state land is protected as reserves accumulated before the current term of
Government (“Past Reserves”) and the sale of land is but a transformation of a land asset
into a financial asset.
4.7
In the Singapore case, the Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis (Appendix
VII of the Staff Report) would need to be interpreted in the context of its overall net asset
position. The Singapore government does not have any net debt. It also does not have
any external debt. Any primary deficit is financed by Net Investment Return
Contributions and not debt. Singapore Government Securities (SGS) are issued for the
purpose of developing Singapore’s debt markets, while non-tradable Special Singapore
Government Securities (SSGS) are issued solely to the CPF Board, to provide a fullyguaranteed investment class for its funds. All proceeds of securities issued by the
government are invested. The Constitution and the Government Securities Act prohibit
the government from spending the monies raised from SGS and SSGS.
4.8
Recent changes to the CPF such as the raising of the salary ceiling for CPF
contributions, higher CPF contribution rates for older workers, and an additional 1%
extra interest on the first $30,000 of CPF balances for those aged 55 and above, will help
lower and middle-income Singaporeans to build their retirement savings.2 With these
measures in place, the balances of each successive cohort of CPF members are expected
to improve further. Among the cohort of active CPF members turning 55 in 2020, about
7 in 10 are expected to be able to accumulate enough CPF savings to meet their Basic
Retirement Sum. The CPF scheme, together with various housing grants, also facilitates
the accumulation of housing assets. Retirees save on rental costs and can monetise their
housing assets to supplement retirement income if necessary. There has been good

2

The monthly salary ceiling for CPF contributions will be increased from $5,000 to $6,000 for all
workers, while the contribution rates will also be raised for older workers aged 50–65. Workers
aged 50−55 will enjoy the same level of contribution rates as their younger counterparts.
Furthermore, an additional 1% extra interest will be paid on the first $30,000 of CPF balances
from the age of 55, allowing elderly members to enjoy up to 6% per year on their Special,
Medisave, and Retirement Accounts (SMRA) savings. These changes will take effect from 1
January 2016.

progress in promoting the adoption of various monetisation options, with the latest
enhancements to the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS)3 being particularly well received.
4.9
The CPF Advisory Panel’s recommendations to provide CPF members with
choices of different payout levels and retirement sums, flexibility to defer the payout start
age to enjoy higher payouts, and to allow a lump sum withdrawal of part of a member’s
CPF savings at retirement, were announced in February 2015 and have been accepted by
the Government. To recognise the family as an important pillar of support for spouses,
the Government also lowered the sum which CPF members need to set aside before
transferring their savings to their spouses’ CPF Special/Retirement account. The CPF
Board will also introduce a guided one-to-one retirement planning service to help CPF
members make informed choices on their CPF savings. Further recommendations are
expected to be released later this year, focused on provisions enabling CPF members
more flexibility to seek higher returns by taking higher investment risks through private
investment plans and an option for members who prefer CPF payouts that are initially
lower but rise with time to help with increases in the cost of living. The measures
described above will introduce more flexibility to the CPF system to meet the diverse
needs of CPF members while ensuring that the state of retirement adequacy continues to
improve for all Singaporeans.

Financial Sector Developments

5.1
The authorities welcome the Staff’s acknowledgement of Singapore’s strong
regulatory and supervisory standards. Singapore’s financial system remains resilient
amidst volatility in global financial markets. Foreign currency liquidity risk in the
banking system has declined. Macro-prudential policies have contributed to the
moderation in credit growth, and modest and gradual price adjustments in the property
market. While debt levels in the corporate and household sectors remain elevated, their
balance sheets are strong and MAS stress tests indicate that debt servicing remains
manageable in the event of external shocks. In addition, enhanced rules on unsecured
credit and credit cards have been implemented to help individuals avoid falling deep into
debt. The authorities will continue to maintain prudent lending standards, monitor
developments in credit and asset markets, and adjust macro-prudential tools as necessary.

Final Remarks

6.1
The external economic environment is expected to be generally supportive of
modest growth in the Singapore economy for the rest of the year. The authorities will
continue to carefully assess external and domestic developments and their impact on the

On 1 April 2015, the LBS was extended to four-room Housing and Development Board (HDB)
flats, covering 75% of elderly HDB households. The qualifying income ceiling was also increased
from $3,000 to $10,000 and the households were given more flexibility in varying the length of
lease to retain. Over April–May 2015, 450 new households applied for the LBS, almost half of
the 965 households that participated in the scheme since it was launched in 2009.

economy and inflation. While Singapore’s macroeconomic fundamentals place it in a
good position to weather bouts of volatility, the authorities will remain vigilant to risks.
6.2
The Singapore authorities would like to thank the IMF team for the 2015 Article
IV Consultation, which was useful and constructive. The Staff Report, including the
detailed appendices, as well as the relevant Selected Issues paper, were testament to the
extensive work put in by the team.
6.3
The Singapore authorities are pleased to inform the Board that they are agreeable
to the publication of the Staff Report associated with the 2015 Article IV Consultation
and will be releasing the Buff Statement at the same time.
