STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 18, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Context: The strong growth has continued into 2011, but a slowdown is underway
supported by prudent macroeconomic policies. Still, the labor market is tight, wages are
rising rapidly, and inflation remains above target.
Perspectives: The highly uncertain international outlook presents substantial downside
risks. Uruguay’s economic and financial vulnerabilities are modest, and the government
has reduced debt vulnerabilities significantly and built important financial buffers; still the
spillovers of a deteriorating global outlook could be significant.
Near-term challenges: The immediate challenge is to support an orderly moderation in
growth and inflation while reinforcing the economy’s resilience to spillovers from abroad.
Staff agrees with the authorities on the key aspects of their macroeconomic framework.
Maintaining the flexible exchange rate as a shock absorber is crucial. The broadly neutral
fiscal stance in 2011 and also planned for 2012 is appropriate. Monetary policy has
rightly been on pause since September until the outlook becomes clearer. If the economy
takes a turn for the worse, monetary policy could be relaxed provided inflation
expectations become reasonably anchored, while fiscal automatic stabilizers should be
allowed to operate so long as prudent debt dynamics are maintained. While it would be
important to accommodate a real exchange rate depreciation, if needed, part of the
ample reserves could be used to contain overshooting.
Longer-term challenges: A long-term challenge is to sustain high growth with less
volatility than in the past, which will require tackling infrastructure gaps, raising labor
skills, and increasing further the economy’s resilience to shocks.

Box 2. The Output Gap1

Is the economy still at risk of

overheating? The 2010 Article IV staff report
warned about overheating risks and
recommended more restrictive monetary and
fiscal policies. Although recent indicators—a
positive output gap, core inflation and inflation
expectations above target, the widening
current account deficit, the tight labor
market—suggest such risks persist, they are
being mitigated by the slowdown underway,
supported by the monetary and fiscal policy
tightening in 2011 (Box 2). Still, inflation is

Following the strong economic growth in recent years,
Uruguay’s output gap is now positive. Output gaps are
notoriously difficult to estimate, so the results should be
interpreted with caution. For Uruguay, potential output
was estimated with a battery of techniques—including the
Hodrick-Prescott filter, which rely on GDP time series,
economic models using the Kalman filter, the standard
growth accounting technique, a Vector-Error Correction
model, and a structural Vector Autoregression (VAR). All
approaches point to a small positive output gap in 2010
and 2011 averaging about 1 percent of potential GDP.
The reduced gap may reflect that the methods used
capture a large part of the fall in actual GDP in the 2002
crisis as a fall in potential output, followed by a strong
recovery in actual and potential output. Using a long-term
trend output as potential output would produce a larger
positive output gap in 2010-11.

and to 4 percent over the medium term but
subject to episodic volatility related to external
developments. Private consumption, which will
remain the principal driver of GDP growth in
2012-13, will cool further as household income
growth continues to moderate. Large FDI
inflows in the pipeline, in particular in the pulp
sector, will also bolster growth and widen the
current account deficit temporarily in 2012-13.
The demand for Uruguay’s exports has held up
well—reflecting the diversification to dynamic
emerging markets; still, export growth will be
less buoyant than in recent years because of
the anemic growth outlook in advanced
economies and slowdown in other key partner
countries.

Although there are upside risks to

this outlook, they are dwarfed (at this time)
by the severe downside risks in the major
advanced economies. The immediate
downside risk is that the global economy tips
into a downward spiral of increased
uncertainty and risk aversion with falling
demand—e.g., by further turmoil in Europe.
Even in a less severe scenario, major advanced
economies could face protracted low growth.

Uruguay’s economic and financial

vulnerabilities are modest, and somewhat
lower than pre-Lehman; still the effects of a
deteriorating global outlook could be
significant. Uruguay does not have major
macroeconomic imbalances, the external
position is robust, the floating exchange rate is
not overvalued, households are not heavily
leveraged, and there is no credit or property
price boom that would amplify an external
shock. Also, Uruguay’s relatively lower
integration into global capital markets should
dampen direct effects from international
financial volatility as in 2009. Nonetheless, a
shock involving sharply lower export earnings
(terms of trade and volume) and FDI inflows
could inflict an economic downturn and hurt
medium-term growth prospects.

Box 4. Real Links and Spillovers from Argentina and Brazil
Argentina and Brazil are Uruguay’s two most
important partner countries. About one third of
Uruguay’s exports go to Argentina and Brazil,
and over half of tourism receipts and one third of
FDI come from Argentina. The correlation
between GDP growth in Uruguay and Argentina
is 0.94 and between Uruguay and Brazil it is 0.83.
These two countries affect Uruguay directly and
indirectly by amplifying shocks from the rest of
the world. This box quantifies some spillover
effects using simple trade elasticities and a
Vector Auto Regression (VAR) model.
Trade elasticities. A simple elasticity calculation
shows that a decrease of 10 percent in Argentina
imports will reduce Uruguay’s GDP by 2.7
percent; the response from Brazil is similar.1 The
Brazil effect is roughly similar to those found in
the Regional Economic Outlook—Western
Hemisphere, Fall 2010 (Box 2.6).
VAR. The standard VAR model builds on Sosa
(2010) and includes real GDP in Uruguay,
Argentina, Brazil, and the rest of the world, as
well as some external factors such as world real
interest rates, oil prices, and non-fuel commodity
prices.2 It is estimated using quarterly data for
1980Q1–2011Q2. Impulse responses show that
the impact of a 1 percentage point increase in
Argentina’s GDP growth leads to an increase in
Uruguay’s GDP of 0.6 percentage points after
three quarters. The impact from Brazil is similar,
but lasts only for two quarters.

In case of negative spillovers via the

extensive exports and FDI links, the
macroeconomic policy response should be
prudent and flexible as it has been so far.
Sharply weaker global growth and surges in
risk aversion could hit Uruguay by the trifecta
of weaker terms-of-trade, lower external
demand (volumes), and tighter global financial
conditions (as after Lehman)—amplified with
knock-on effects from Argentina and Brazil.
The staff and the authorities agreed on the
importance of accommodating a real
exchange rate depreciation, if needed, but also
that using part of the ample reserves could be
appropriate to limit overshooting—given the
high degree of bank and debt dollarization. A
monetary policy easing should proceed so
long as prospects for disinflation increase and
inflation expectations become reasonably
aligned with the target. The authorities broadly

preserve prudent debt dynamics, which are
sensitive to growth and the exchange rate
(Annex II). The risk to government funding is
contained by the modest government’s
financing need (2 percent of GDP in 2012) and
the buffers that the government has built.
19.

A specific financial risk relates to

how funding or deleveraging pressures in
Europe could affect Uruguay via the two
large Spanish bank subsidiaries. Santander
and BBVA account for about one-fifth of all
bank credit in Uruguay. In the tail risk event of
a large and sudden scaling down of their
activities, the macro-economic impact could
be significant though less severe than in other
countries in the region with similar links (see
Regional Economic Outlook—Western
Hemisphere; October 2011, IMF). The staff and
the authorities agreed that the risk of
contagion through this channel is moderated
not only by these banks’ strong liquidity
positions and balance sheets, and their (like all
banks in Uruguay) reliance on local deposit
funding, but also because all foreign
subsidiaries are subject to BCU’s limits on net
placements with parent banks. For the banking

participation and increasing real wages. There has also
been significant reform. Notably, since 2005, the
minimum wage has been increased substantially,
though it does not appear to be binding for wage
dynamics and it is not excessive in a cross-country
comparison. Collective bargaining was restored in
2005 and amended by a new wage negotiation law in
2009. In this context, wage indexation with respect to
inflation has increased. Wage Philips curve estimates

The baseline outlook is positive but

with considerable downside risk stemming
from the highly uncertain global outlook.
Although the overheating concerns mentioned
in the 2010 Article IV Consultation have
diminished with the slowdown underway,
private consumption remains buoyant and
inflation is above target. At the same time, the
risks are tilted considerably to the downside
and relate to potential fallout from advanced
economies and developments in the region.
28.

The uncertain external outlook

warrants continued implementation of
prudent economic policies. Staff welcomes
the monetary tightening in the first half of the
year, and the pause since September until the
outlook becomes clearer. It seems premature
to start relaxing monetary policy given core
inflation, inflation expectations, and the
relatively high degree of wage indexation.
Indeed, absent a worsening in the baseline
scenario, a resumption of tightening may be
needed eventually to bring inflation closer to
target, though any rate adjustment should be
tailored to the growth and inflation outlook.
Staff also welcomes the shift to a broadly

substantial appreciation pressures resume,
staff would favor some more fiscal restraint
with a focus on current expenditures and taxes
to help ease the pressure on monetary policy.
Finally, the active debt management has
helped reduce public debt vulnerabilities
significantly. Staff welcomes the building of
large deposits at the BCU and the contingent
credit lines arranged with international
financial institutions.

In the case of external shocks, the

macroeconomic policy response should be
prudent and flexible as has been the case so
far. A monetary policy easing could proceed

D. Supply Response
8.

The strong real estate demand has led

120

to an important response in construction.1The

100

sector expanded rapidly during 2005-08, as
measured by housing construction in square
meters, but has been stable since then (Figure 6).
Looking at construction activity as measured in
the national accounts gives a relatively similar
picture: construction sector GDP growth
averaged 7 percent a year in 2005–10.
31

The international evidence is that the long-run elasticity of
house prices with respect to disposable income is about one,
abstracting from quality improvements. See e.g., Andrews, D.,
A. Caldera Sanchez and Å. Johansson (2011), “Housing
Markets and Structural Policies in OECD Countries”, OECD
Working Paper No. 836.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

ANNEX 3. RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of October 31, 2011)
11.
The Inter-American Development
Bank’s Board of Executive Directors
approved in August 2011 the new Country
Strategy with Uruguay (2010-2015).
Sovereign-guaranteed lending under the new
program is expected to reach approximately
US$1.8 billion, which is considered to be
consistent with Uruguay’s five year budget.
The program includes additional non
reimbursable financing for technical assistance
and analytical work. Lending under the
previous Country Strategy (2005-09) reached
approximately US$1.3 billion.
12.
Under the new Strategy, the
national authorities and the Bank identified
the following priority sectors in which the
IDB Group would focus both its financial
and non-financial products and services:
(i) transport; (ii) energy; (iii) water, sanitation,
and solid waste; (iv) science and technology;
(v) social protection; (vi) education and job
training; (vii) agribusiness; (viii) services
exports; (ix) public management and finances;
and (x) urban development and citizen
security. It is also expected that all four of the
Bank’s private sector windows will approve
loans and technical assistance in the energy,
transport, agribusiness and global services
sectors. The strategic areas were selected
taking into account: (i) a context of strong
economic growth, which imposes heavy
investment requirements on a number of
sectors; (ii) business opportunities, which in
turn contribute to the Bank’s institutional goals
within the framework of the 9th General Capital
Increase; (iii) greater complementarity between

the multilateral financial institutions working in
Uruguay; (iv) the Bank’s accumulated
operational experience and technical
knowledge from having worked for several
decades in the country; and (v) the
government’s interest for continued IDB
engagement.
13.
As of September 30th 2011, the
Bank’s portfolio in Uruguay includes loans
for the financing of 35 projects; two of
which are to the private sector without
sovereign guarantee. The lending portfolio
amounts to US$1,000.4 MM, of which
US$455.0 MM are pending disbursement.
Disbursements in 2011 are expected to total
US$150 MM. The portfolio includes lending to
support the Government in the following
sectors: infrastructure and environment
(12 loans adding US$516.4 MM and
representing 52% of the approved amounts);
social sector (5 loans adding US$172.2 MM,
representing 17% of the approved amounts);
institutional capacity and finance (14 loans
adding US$266.8 MM and representing 27% of
the approved amounts) and integration and
trade (2 loans, adding US$17.0 MM; 2% of the
approved amounts). The portfolio also includes
two loans to the private sector for US$28 MM
(3% of the approved amounts).
14.
The 2010 lending program included
the approval of US$40 MM investment loan
to support the implementation of the
National Strategy for Childhood and
Adolescence and an investment loan in
support of secondary education

(US$48 MM). In 2011, the Bank approved
loans to the public sector in the areas of
agricultural productivity (US$28.4 MM),
e-Government (US$10.9 MM) and off-shoring
(US$ 10 MM) as well as a (US$200 MM) nonsovereign guaranteed loan for a pulp mill. By
the end of 2011, the Bank expects to approve

loans in the areas of transportation
(US$80 MM), local development and municipal
management (US$70 MM), water and
sanitation (US$63.3 MM) and tourism
(US$5 MM) as well as a non-sovereign
guaranteed loan of US$65MM loan to an
agribusiness company.

ANNEX 4. STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of November 1, 2010)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected area is national accounts.
National Accounts: In 2009, the Uruguayan authorities completed a revision of national
accounts statistics, in which they updated the benchmark year (from 1983 to 1997 and 2005) and
adopted the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA93). However, national accounts statistics still
have a number of shortcomings, limited coverage of the enterprise survey, long publication lags,
inadequate information on the informal economy, and incomplete quarterly accounts. The
central bank (BCU) compiles and disseminates annual GDP estimates in current and at previous
year prices by the production and expenditure approaches, as well as quarterly constant price
GDP estimates by the production and expenditure approaches. Gross national income, gross
disposable income and gross savings are also available annually.
Consumer prices: Both the consumer and wholesale price indices are reported on a regular and
timely basis for publication in the IFS. The new base period for the consumer price index is
December 2010 = 100; coverage of the CPI, which was previously limited to the capital city, CPI
now has national coverage and a more detailed basket with nearly fifty thousand price
quotations included in the index. The base of the wholesale price index has been updated
to 2001. Producer price indices (March 2010 =100) for national products have been recently
disseminated. The authorities do not provide trade price and volume indices for publication in
the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Government finance statistics: Official data on the central administration, the state enterprises
and the social security system are complete and current, but there are problems with the
timeliness of the data on local governments. There are also problems with the timeliness of
financing and debt data reported for inclusion in the Fund’s statistical publications. Information
on a monthly and quarterly basis for financing and debt data respectively, are disseminated on
the BCU website from 1999 onwards for the central government and total public sector, but no
information is reported for publication in the International Financial Statistics. The information
reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook covers transactions on
revenue and expense for the consolidated central government (data on revenue and expense for
local governments have not been reported since 1994), and the general government’s operations
on financial assets and liabilities, both in terms of flows (financing) and stocks (debt).

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

URUGUAY

Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary and financial statistics are prepared in accordance
with the IMF's Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (2000). Authorities report monetary data
for the central bank, other depository corporations, and other financial corporations (OFCs) using
the standardized reporting forms (SRFs). However, data for the OFCs are limited to off-shore
financial institutions. A mission could be fielded in FY 2012 to expand the institutional coverage
of the OFCs and compile the SRF for OFCs with full institutional coverage. Authorities reported
annual Financial Soundness Indicators (FSI) for 2008, 2009, and 2010, but the historical series and
updates have not been submitted.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments statements are compiled and published on a
quarterly basis. Data are compiled following the recommendations of the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. Uruguay compiles and reports to STA quarterly data on balance of
payments and annual data on the international investment position (IIP) for publication in the IFS
and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. New surveys are allowing for improved

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation
with Uruguay
On December 5, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2011 Article IV consultation with Uruguay.110
Background
Uruguay’s strong economic growth in recent years has produced significant welfare gains.
Per capita income in purchasing power terms has doubled from its pre-2002 crisis levels,
unemployment has fallen to record lows, and social indicators have improved further. The
key factors behind this performance include important policy reforms, prudent
macroeconomic policies, social policies and a favorable external environment.
The growth momentum has continued into 2011 but a slowdown is underway led by weaker
exports and slower public investment. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is
projected at 6 percent in 2011 and 4.25 percent in 2012. Inflation at 7.9 percent in October
remains above the target range (4-6 percent). The central bank tightened monetary policy in
the first half of 2011 but it has left the tightening cycle in pause since late September to
allow the global outlook to become clearer. The fiscal deficit has narrowed, and the gross
public debt has continued to fall (to 55 percent of GDP in June).
The baseline outlook is positive but with downside risks stemming from the highly uncertain
global outlook. Uruguay’s economic and financial vulnerabilities are modest, and the
government has reduced debt vulnerabilities significantly and built important financial
buffers; still the spillovers of a deteriorating global outlook could be significant. A long-term
policy challenge is to sustain strong and balanced growth with less volatility than in the past.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms
the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ skillful macroeconomic management that
has underpinned Uruguay’s excellent economic performance, lowered public indebtedness,
and strengthened buffers against shocks. Uruguay’s economic outlook is positive, although
with downside risks stemming from the uncertain outlook for advanced economies.
Directors agreed that the main near term challenge will be to frame domestic policies to
address both the cyclical requirements and the risk of negative spillovers from abroad. A
flexible approach to policymaking will be crucial in the period ahead. For the longer term,
Directors stressed that further fiscal and structural reforms are needed to secure a stable
high growth path.
Directors welcomed the monetary tightening in the first half of 2011 to bring inflation toward
the target range. They agreed that a “wait and see” approach is appropriate at present,
given lack of clarity about the general direction of the global economy. A resumption of the
tightening cycle will be warranted if global risks recede. Directors agreed that the central
bank could explore ways to better anchor inflation expectations by communicating more
clearly its inflation forecast and its responses to shocks. Directors considered that the
flexible exchange rate regime has served Uruguay well, and encouraged the authorities to
limit market intervention to smoothing operations.
Directors generally agreed that maintaining a broadly neutral fiscal stance is appropriate,
although automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate as developments warrant, so
long as debt dynamics remain favorable. Directors commended the authorities’ public debt
management, and supported their goal to further reduce the public debt ratio over the
medium term. They also welcomed progress on the public private partnership framework to
tackle infrastructure gaps.
Directors saw merit in ongoing initiatives to upgrade workers’ skills, but noted that other
recent reforms may have reduced the flexibility of the labor market. They stressed the
importance of reforms that support a dynamic economy while fostering equity. A few
Directors cautioned that widespread indexation in wage agreements would complicate
inflation targeting and could undermine competitiveness.
Directors welcomed the announced reforms to strengthen banks’ capital and improve
dynamic provisioning. They supported closer monitoring of credit card companies, and
encouraged more extensive information requirements for non banks. Directors encouraged
the authorities to continue their efforts to promote de dollarization.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Alfredo Mac Laughlin, Executive Director for Uruguay and David Vogel
Advisor to Executive Director
December 5, 2011
I.

Background

Uruguay has exhibited critical transformations in recent years. The country went through
some complicated episodes in its economic history. While these episodes had some
differences among them, we can also find common patterns. In a considerable part of these
episodes, crises in neighboring countries severely affected Uruguay’s economic situation due
to its high level of trade and financial exposure to the region; rigid exchange rate systems
turned unsustainable and were abandoned, generating, together with significant slowdowns in
economic activity, huge distortions on the financial system—also frequently weakened due to
its own vulnerabilities—and on public and private debt indicators. Public finances came
under stress, requiring fiscal adjustments, which further aggravated growth outlooks and
social conditions.
Even in regular times since the mid-fifties, investment was scarce and growth was
anemic or stagnant. We recall that less than a decade ago, some IMF staff reports
expressed serious concerns about Uruguay’s lack of sources of investment and growth.
Nevertheless, the current situation is substantially different. GDP is expanding robustly
and soundly; foreign direct investment is in abundance; unemployment is at historical lows;
inflation is under control; credit remains at moderated levels; and social indicators are
displaying noticeable improvements.
More importantly, looking ahead, Uruguay’s outlook is promising, though the new
virulent phase of the global crisis brings about substantial challenges and risks
worldwide and, Uruguay, as a small country with an open economy, is of course not
immune. At the same time, the country demonstrates a number of conditions, stemming
from the authorities’ policies and reforms, and founded on the country’s sound institutions,
which allow us to conclude that Uruguay is facing the difficult external circumstances from a
position of strength. Nonetheless, satisfactory results do not generate complacency. It just
prompts further impulse to keep working and dealing with the outstanding challenges.
II.

The Firm Pillars of Sound Institutions

Uruguay possesses critical intangible assets, and is committed to keep reinforcing them.
It is a very respectable democracy around the world, with solid political parties, which have
fully demonstrated responsibility and accountability, especially at times when the country
must face difficult circumstances.
Uruguay’s institutions have exhibited important progress over time. Among other things
that may reflect the above-referred comment, the last report of Transparency International on
corruption perceptions placed Uruguay in 24th position (with a score of 6.9) out of
178 countries, while the World Bank’s Governance Indicators are going in the same

2

direction, showing Uruguay at very high percentile ranks, for instance, in terms of control of
corruption, political stability, voice and accountability and rule of law. Furthermore,
according to the last annual survey of Latinobarometro, most of the Uruguayan people
consider that Uruguay’s citizens act following the law. Moreover, the country’s long
tradition of honoring commitments and debts signifies another factor that helps us to
understand Uruguay’s developments over time.
III.

Mitigating Vulnerabilities and Reinforcing Strengths

III.1

Lower Exposure to the Region

In the context of a comprehensive trade strategy pursued over the last decade, which has
constantly looked for expanding exports to markets outside the region, Uruguay is presenting
a considerable diversification. Reflecting that, exports of goods to Mercosur countries
currently comprise 29 percent of Uruguay’s total external sales, while they used to be above
50 percent during the nineties.
In particular, there has been a critical decrease in exposure to Argentina, considering that
currently exports of goods to that country represent just 7 percent of total external sales.
More importantly, deposits from non-residents (particularly from Argentina) have undergone
a substantial decline, which makes Uruguay much less exposed to regional circumstances.
Box 4 of the staff report presents some references on the links and spillover from Argentina
and Brazil, but these results are based on information between 1980 and 2010, and, as noted
above, many developments and transformations have occurred during that period, thus these
results do not reflect the current situation and outlook. The same applies to the staff’s
comments on fluctuations in output and employment and, in this regard, the mild impact
observed in Uruguay’s economy after the Lehman crisis may constitute relevant proof of the
country’s greater resilience to shocks.
III.2

Sound Fiscal Balance

Bold reforms have been waged in recent years on the tax system and revenue administration,
which have not only aimed to increase revenues, but also, and especially, to further improve
the system’s transparency and efficiency, as well as diminish vertical and horizontal
inequality. Among other results, Uruguay is exhibiting a huge reduction in tax evasion
(according to the revenue administration’s estimates, VAT evasion was at 15 percent in
2010, compared with 16.7 percent in 2009, and 40 percent in 2002). Meanwhile, as a
virtuous cycle, the taxpayer’s perception of the system’s transparency and fairness (for
instance, among other things that could be underscored in this regard, the country does not
discriminate between residents and non-residents) tends to reinforce the country’s culture of
tax compliance. Mirroring the above-referred developments, public sector revenue-to-GDP
ratio, at 28.3 percent, shows an elevated indicator relative to Uruguay’s peers in the region.
On the expenditure side, the authorities maintain a prudent approach, focusing on some key
areas, mainly education, infrastructure, housing, and health, which are crucial to critically

3

boost Uruguay’s medium-term economic and social prospects. The authorities are fully
aware that public infrastructure imperiously requires a further impulse from the private
sector. It is worth mentioning that the PPP framework has already been established, and will
start operating following the best international practices and, in this regard, the authorities
would like to thank the IMF for the excellent technical assistance received on this matter.
III.3

Declining Public Debt; Less Dollarized and Longer Maturity

Consistent with the previous paragraph, the government is on the way to attaining the debt
targets established in its five-year budget, which forecasts a declining debt-to-GDP ratio, set
to reach 40 percent in 2015. Other objectives, such as that related to the de-dollarization of
the public debt has almost been attained to the extent that the current share of debt in local
currency is about 41 percent (the target for 2014 is 45 percent), while it was less than
5 percent six years ago. Furthermore, a debt maturity increase to an average of 12 years and
the size of the debt at a fixed interest rate is 93 percent, underlining a significant reduction of
risks in all of the debt dimensions. The Uruguayan authorities appreciate the staff’s
comment that debt management constitutes “an area where Uruguay can be a model for other
countries”.
Chapter II of the Selected Issues Paper underscores that “the findings suggest that Uruguay is
well placed to reach investment grade, and could benefit from such an upgrade in terms of
further spread reductions”. Actually, many local and global analysts and investors believe
that the upgrade to the investment grade for Uruguay could be imminent, although, as usual,
rating agencies seem to react with some delay. In any case, as noted in the staff report,
Uruguay is trading at investment grade levels (on November 29, EMBIG Sovereign Spreads
for EMBIG Latam was 479 bps, for Brazil 239, Chile 160, Colombia 209, Mexico 234, Peru
238 and for Uruguay 229).
III.4

Inflation under Control; Flexible Exchange Rate System

As in many developing countries, inflationary pressures have been considerable in Uruguay
during the last years, to a large extent as a result of the increasing trend of commodity prices
and a vigorous domestic demand. Therefore, inflation rates have been above the central
bank’s target range, which required a tightening of the monetary policy in the first half of
2011. Meanwhile, considering that inflation remains under control, and especially the
expected slowdown of the economic activity driving growth for the coming years to be closer
to Uruguay’s potential growth, the authorities have decided on a pause in their monetary
policy stance, while waiting to see how the regional and global economy evolves. In any
case, the authorities have expressed their strong commitment to return inflation to the target
range as soon as possible.
The authorities consider that a flexible exchange rate system constitutes an effective buffer to
cushion external shocks. Under the current scenario characterized by outstanding global
uncertainties, the authorities are of the view that intervention in the exchange market should
be circumscribed to contain eventual overshooting. Meanwhile, they have been urging firms
to hedge their positions through a more active participation in the forward market.

4

III.5

A Comfortable Level of International Reserves; More Contingent Loans

The authorities have taken advantage of the global liquidity and built an important buffer by
accumulating a considerable amount of international reserves, which represents almost
9 months of imports, or 683 percent of short-term debt. The authorities consider that this
may be a comfortable level of reserves (according to the new reserve adequacy metric range
it could be somewhat high), although they are also of the view that global conditions do not
allow for a conclusive assessment on this issue.
Furthermore, Uruguay has attained some important contingent credit lines from a number of
regional and international financial institutions. In sum, the government’s financing needs
for the coming years are small, and the coverage remains proper.
III.6

The Financial System

One of the most relevant structural changes in Uruguay has occurred in the financial system.
Eminently, the regulation and supervision of the sector has been substantially strengthened,
while developments and results in public banks reflect a dramatic transformation in their
governance and incentives.
Although showing an increasing trend—which, according to the latest information, has been
moderating over the last two months—the credit-to-GDP ratio is low compared with peer
countries’ indicators and even with historical levels in Uruguay. The real estate market has
presented a reasonable increase in dollar terms, but, as noted in Annex 1 of the staff report,
prices do not seem overvalued, and, more importantly, the financial system is not
significantly exposed to that market, taking into account that “banking credit has not been a
main source of financing for the housing activity”.
Moreover, non-performing loans exhibit a negligible level. Some might argue about the
level of provisioning entailed in Uruguay’s dynamic provisioning system. Notwithstanding,
the authorities consider that during uncertain times it is appropriate to follow cautious
policies. At the same time, indicators related to banks’ capital adequacy and liquidity point
to a solid situation of the financial system, and, as stressed in the staff report, the authorities
continue undertaking structural reforms in the system to further reinforce it.
III.7

Social Stability

As often stressed by the Uruguayan authorities, economic stability and social achievements
are fully compatible and synergetic. Prudent macroeconomic policies have been successful
in keeping inflation under control—a vital factor to protect the most vulnerable groups of the
society—and making room for devoting a higher amount of resources to transparent, efficient
and well-targeted social plans. As illustrated in Box 1 of the staff report, Uruguay has made
important progress in terms of mitigating poverty conditions and reducing income inequality,
which, as a virtuous cycle, increases social and political ownership of prudent policies and
structural reforms.

5

Likewise, social stability is also related to establishing fair conditions for both, employers
and workers. It is possible that Uruguay’s labor market framework has produced some
normal tensions—which are not frequent at all. At the same time, it is important to take into
account that labor changes could have been useful to contribute to rebalancing market forces
in the labor market. In any case, it is worth mentioning that these normal tensions are tackled
in the civilized and democratic manner deeply enrooted in Uruguay’s sound traditions.
Meanwhile, significant changes are needed in the labor market in order to reinforce “one of
the great success stories in the Uruguayan economy”, as noted in the staff report. In this
regard, the authorities consider that meeting Uruguay’s productivity challenges necessarily
requires, among other things: closer links between salaries and productivity; a further
reduction of informal employment (Uruguay shows one of the lowest rates of informality in
the region); more training and capacity building programs; and significantly more efforts to
increase competitiveness in the public sector, which entail further transformations in the
sector.
IV.

Uruguay’s Future Challenges

As noted, Uruguay’s performance has been robust. However, the global economic situation
poses key challenges for the coming years, and, of course, prudent policies and structural
changes will continue to be the authorities’ means to further strengthen the considerable
buffers Uruguay displays in the fiscal, monetary, financial, and social sectors. Nonetheless,
the expected slowdown and the financial distress in the world’s economy are not the only
risks. Global and regional protectionism risks often emerge in times of crisis, and Uruguay,
as a loyal member of the international community, hopes that detrimental policies in this
regard are refrained.
At the outset we underscored that Uruguay has undertaken substantial transformations in
recent years. In the past, amidst an anemic economic situation, characterized by an underutilization of resources, productivity did not seem to be a high priority. Currently, the
country is growing robustly, even above its potential; the unemployment rate is very low,
which also means that many sectors do not easily find skilled labor; the vitality of the
economic activity also produces infrastructure gaps; and, innovation and entrepreneurship are
needed to support and reinforce the country’s new stage. Therefore, Uruguay has to face a
new situation, referred to by the authorities as “the productivity challenge”, and, in this
regard, they reaffirm their efforts and commitments towards critically heightening
productivity in all of its dimensions, which constitutes an imperious step for the country in
order to keep improving the welfare of Uruguay’s population.
