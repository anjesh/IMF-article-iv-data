UNION OF THE COMOROS
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation and Fourth Staff Review and
Extension of the Staff-Monitored Program
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Thomas Krueger and Anthony Boote
September 27, 2006

Objectives: A mission visited Comoros July 12-26, 2006, to conduct the 2006 Article IV
discussions and review performance under the Staff-Monitored Program (SMP).
Country representatives: A new administration took office in late May 2006, after President Sambi
was elected in the first democratic power transfer in over a decade. The mission met with finance
minister Hamadi, central bank governor Abdoulbastoi, and representatives from the Union and
island governments, parliament, the private sector, trade associations, the international community,
and the media. The mission was received by President Sambi and the three island presidents.
Mission team: The mission team comprised Mr. Mumssen (head), Ms. Al-Zein, Mr. Baldini,
Mr. Lopes, and Ms. Ocampos (all AFR). It was joined by a representative of the African
Development Bank. The IMF Resident Representative for Madagascar, Mr. van den Boogaerde,
assisted the mission.
Article IV consultation: The Article IV discussions focused on medium-term challenges: external
sustainability, fiscal institutions, and private sector development. Previous consultations have
emphasized the need to strengthen interisland fiscal cooperation, develop the financial sector, and
accelerate structural reforms. Implementation of past advice has been hampered by political
tensions, weak capacity, and low technical assistance.
Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix Paper: Two chapters examine (i) the role of remittances
and (ii) the experience with fiscal decentralization.
Staff-Monitored Program: Fiscal performance under the SMP went off track in the pre-election
period. The SMP was extended through December 2006 (see Letter of Intent, Attachment I), with
the aim of restoring revenue collection and unwinding arrears.
Article VIII: Comoros has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and has
no restrictions on payments for current international transactions.
Data: Lack of reliable statistical data continues to hamper surveillance (see Statistical Issues
Annex). The mission helped the authorities to improve the historical series for national accounts
and the balance of payments. The authorities have requested technical assistance on statistics.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The May 2006 presidential elections were a milestone in the national reconciliation
process. After decades of political turmoil and interisland tensions, Comoros has gradually
stabilized since a new constitution was introduced in 2001. The elections resulted in the first
democratic power transfer in over a decade; President Ahmed Sambi scored a landslide
victory with his message of political change, commitment to the rule of law, and a promise of
higher living standards.
The Article IV discussions focused on medium-term policy challenges. There was broad
agreement on policy priorities, based on the Interim Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy
Paper’s (I-PRSP, EBD/06/51) vision for raising economic growth and improving social
conditions. Its implementation will require higher foreign aid and policy measures to:
•

move toward external sustainability through arrears clearance, HIPC and MDRI debt
relief, higher external assistance, and domestic policy adjustments to improve
external competitiveness;

•

support private sector growth and economic diversification, through structural
reforms aimed at developing the financial sector, improving the investment climate,
simplifying tax laws, liberalizing trade, and enhancing competition and private sector
involvement in energy, telecommunications, and transportation; and

•

enhance the capacity of fiscal institutions, by intensifying interisland coordination
and by strengthening revenue administration, budget execution monitoring, and
economic statistics.

SMP discussions focused on steps to remedy the sharp deterioration in public finances
that occurred in the pre-election period. The new government has moved quickly to
investigate pre-election corruption, strengthen governance in public administration and
enterprises, and restore interisland cooperation in fiscal matters. Near-term policy
objectives—to be monitored under an extension of the SMP through December 2006—are to
restore fiscal revenue collection, curtail spending, unwind wage arrears, and restart structural
reforms. Measures to boost revenues and contain spending were incorporated into a
supplementary budget approved by Parliament in August.
The authorities attach high priority to a PRGF arrangement, which they see as critical
for anchoring their reform program, unlocking donor support, and obtaining debt relief under
the enhanced HIPC initiative and MDRI. They expressed their hope to conclude negotiations
on such an arrangement as soon as possible. This will require satisfactory performance under
the extended SMP and understandings with official creditors on mechanisms to clear the
country’s substantial external arrears.

I. ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
A. Economic Retrospective
A poor growth record
1.
Economic growth has been weak and narrowly based for decades. The economic
upturn recorded in most of sub-Saharan Africa since the mid-1990s has been much less
pronounced in Comoros. Real GDP growth averaged 2¾ percent for 2001-05, well below the
regional average. Per capita, real GDP has declined by an estimated ½-percentage point per
year over the past two decades. Economic activity is largely confined to subsistence
agriculture, production of three export crops
Real GDP growth has lagged behind

Manufacturing is almost nonexistent.

2.
The poor growth record partly reflects
the country’s inherent disadvantages,
including (i) the small size of the local market,
which limits economies of scale and
competition; (ii) very high transport costs and
few air links, constraining trade and tourism; and
(iii) environmental factors, including high
population density, deforestation, scarcity of
fresh water, and occasional volcanic eruptions.

3.
Political instability and external shocks have also played a detrimental role.
Years of interisland tensions, culminating in the 1997-2001 secessionist crisis, have
undermined institutional capacity and led to a sharp reduction in donor assistance. The
narrow export base has exposed the economy to international price swings, as underscored
by the recent plunge in vanilla prices.
4.
Private sector development has been held back by a poor business environment,
inadequate infrastructure, and an underdeveloped financial sector. In the World Bank’s
2006 Doing Business Survey, Comoros ranked 144th worldwide and 22nd out of 45 subSaharan African countries. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has been deterred by weak
contract enforcement, high transport costs, the small local market, and poor
telecommunication and utility services. The lack of foreign investors has in turn limited
competition, innovation, transfer of know-how, and linkages to export markets. The largest
employers are the government and the public infrastructure monopolies. Access to credit
from the only commercial bank is largely limited to short-term trade financing.

Macroeconomic stability but a lack of flexibility
6.
Membership in the franc zone arrangement has been the economy’s anchor of
stability. Comoros has maintained an exchange rate peg with France, its largest trading
partner, since the colonial era. The Comorian franc was devalued once, by 33 percent in
1994, when other franc zone countries devalued by 50 percent. The hard peg and the

6
safeguards of the franc zone arrangement have kept annual inflation since 1995 in the range
of 1-6 percent and international reserves at comfortable levels. The arrangement has also
provided some discipline for fiscal policy, capping the stock of central bank credit to
government at 20 percent of fiscal revenues. Monetary policy is mostly passive, constrained
by the franc zone framework and the underdeveloped local financial sector.

7.
Fiscal policy has been severely constrained by a large wage bill and lack of
access to domestic financing. While the revenue-to-GDP ratio is broadly in line with the
regional average, weak expenditure control in the context of fiscal decentralization has
pushed up the public wage bill. Lack of domestic and external financing have kept fiscal
deficits low, but it has also limited social spending and public investment. The tight fiscal
envelope and inadequate institutional capacity have contributed to chronic arrears
accumulation.
Excessive debt and limited external assistance
8.
External debt has been well above the HIPC threshold for over two decades.
With large-scale borrowing from official creditors after independence, external debt
accumulated rapidly, reaching 100 percent of GDP by the mid-1980s. At end-2005, the net
present value (NPV) of debt amounted to an estimated 419 percent of exports of goods and
services, and arrears accounted for almost half of it. In recent years, debt service has been
paid in full to the World Bank, whereas arrears have continued to accumulate to other official
creditors. Comoros does not have debt to the IMF.
9.
External assistance collapsed during the 1997-2001 secessionist crisis, and has
not yet recovered. Low levels of aid also reflect unresolved external arrears and lack of
adequate monitoring and control of budget execution. The low level of technical assistance
has in turn prevented progress in rehabilitating institutional capacity.

10.
Comoros’ terms of trade have fluctuated widely and are now about 10 percent
below their ten-year average. International vanilla prices skyrocketed during 2001-03 and
collapsed thereafter, reflecting supply conditions in Madagascar and fluctuating global
demand. Rising oil prices have further weakened the terms of trade. The real effective
exchange rate in 2005 was about 12 percent above its ten-year average, partly because the
euro has been gradually appreciating against the U.S. dollar since 2000.

Remittances have offset a large trade deficit and provided a buffer against
external shocks (see Selected Issues, Chapter I). Emigrant remittances to Comoros are
among the highest in the world, averaging 15½ percent of GDP and 49 percent of all current

8
account receipts during 2001-05. They have mainly been used for imports of consumer
products, resulting in a large structural trade deficit. They also helped offset the 2004/05
terms of trade shock and the associated deterioration in the trade balance, keeping the current
account deficit relatively modest.
Recent developments and short-term outlook
12.
The May 2006 presidential elections were a milestone in the national
reconciliation process. They resulted in the first democratic power transfers in over a
decade and rotation of the Union presidency to a native of Anjouan island. The new
president, Ahmed Sambi, scored a landslide victory with his message of political change,
commitment to the rule of law, and a promise of higher living standards. He appointed a new
Union government in late May. The three islands of Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Moheli
will hold island presidential elections in the spring of 2007.
13.
After stabilization gains in 2005, economic performance worsened in 2006.
Higher tourism and services in 2005 helped speed economic growth, and fiscal performance
improved, with a sharply higher primary fiscal balance and a net reduction in domestic
expenditure arrears. For 2006, real GDP growth is projected to decline to 1¼ percent, due to
the continued weakening of agriculture, resulting from low international vanilla prices, and
sharply lower tourism, resulting from the closure of a major hotel. The economic slowdown
is mirrored in declines in broad money and credit to the private sector. Given low demand for
domestic goods, inflation is expected to remain moderate despite higher fuel prices. A further
decline in exports and strong import growth (due to fiscal loosening and higher remittances)
are likely to widen the current account deficit and reduce international reserves. Public
finances deteriorated sharply during the pre-election period, and the new government has
since taken steps to boost revenue and cut expenditure (see SMP discussions, Section II).

B. Medium-term Macroeconomic Framework
14.
The recently issued I-PRSP sets out a clear vision for combining private sectorled economic growth with improved social services. As noted in the Joint Staff Advisory
Note (EBD/06/52), the I-PRSP was prepared in what was for Comoros an unprecedented
participatory process and served as the reference framework for the December 2005 donor
roundtable. It focuses on improvements to public finances, infrastructure, conditions for
private sector development, governance, health, and education.
15.
The mission discussed with the authorities a medium-term macroeconomic
framework (Table 2). The reference point was a baseline scenario with unchanged policies
and aid, and real GDP growth of 2 percent per year, in line with the ten-year historical
average. Fiscal revenues and wages would remain broadly unchanged, preventing a pick-up
in public investment and social spending. Domestic and external arrears would accumulate
steadily and external debt would remain unsustainably high.
16.
An adjustment scenario was prepared to anchor the authorities’ medium-term
economic reform program. The authorities believed that their program could help raise real
GDP growth to 4 percent on average for 2007-09, supported by a pick-up in public and
private investment. As in the I-PRSP, growth sectors are assumed to include tourism,
agriculture, fishing, finance, infrastructure, and communication. A rebound in exports would
limit the increase in the trade deficit caused by higher aid-related imports (Table 2).
17.
The adjustment scenario allows for higher social spending and public investment
while minimizing new debt and reducing arrears. A primary surplus of about 1 percent of
GDP would be targeted each year to allow for a modest amount of debt service and a gradual
reduction in domestic arrears. Public investment and social spending could be raised by
about 6 percentage points of GDP between 2006 and 2009, based on a gradual rise in
domestic revenue, a modest reduction in the wage bill, and higher external assistance in line
with pledges announced during the 2005 donor conference.
18.
The adjustment scenario assumes comprehensive debt relief under the HIPC
Initiative and MDRI. The staff estimates that the NPV of debt would decline to about
64 percent of exports by 2010, assuming: (i) arrears clearance and rescheduling on
concessional terms in 2007, (ii) bilateral debt rescheduling for 2007–09, (iii) interim debt
relief in 2008-09, and (iv) HIPC and MDRI debt relief in 2009. In 2007, debt service would
be somewhat higher than in the baseline scenario, reflecting rescheduled arrears.

C. Medium-term Challenges
19.
Article IV discussions focused on three medium-term challenges critical for
raising economic growth and improving social conditions:
•

Moving toward external sustainability, through regularization of arrears, HIPC and
MDRI debt relief, higher external assistance, and domestic policy adjustments to
improve external competitiveness.

•

Supporting private sector growth and economic diversification, by developing the
financial sector, improving the investment climate, simplifying the tax system,
liberalizing trade, and enhancing competition and private sector involvement in
infrastructure.

•

Enhancing the capacity of fiscal institutions, by improving interisland cooperation,
budget execution monitoring, expenditure management, and revenue administration.

Moving toward external sustainability
20.
A high priority for the authorities is bringing debt to a sustainable level through
comprehensive debt relief. A debt sustainability analysis (Appendix I), conducted jointly
with World Bank staff, shows that debt would remain unsustainably high in the baseline
scenario even without economic shocks. By contrast, in the adjustment scenario, based on an
economic reform program and HIPC/MDRI debt relief, debt would come down to the point
where it would be sustainable under a range of stress tests.
21.
The mission urged the authorities to build on recent momentum in arrears
clearance discussions with official creditors (see Section II.C for details). Reaching
understandings with official creditors on clearing Comoros’ large external arrears (25 percent
of GDP) is a precondition for a PRGF arrangement, which in turn is required to make
Comoros eligible for HIPC and MDRI debt relief. The specifics of arrears clearance and
rescheduling will have implications for near-term debt service.
22.
The authorities called for more external assistance to support urgently needed
institution-building and the reforms envisaged in the I-PRSP. The 2005 donor conference
generated about $200 million in external assistance pledges for 2006-09. Annualized, this
would be triple the amount received in 2004-05, although it is only about half of what was
envisaged in the I-PRSP. Additional assistance will likely be needed to clear arrears and
achieve the MDGs. Authorities and staff agreed that new projects should be mostly grantfinanced and that expenditure-tracking mechanisms need to be put in place to ensure that aid
is used effectively.
The mission discussed the causes of Comoros’s apparent lack of external
competitiveness, evidenced by poor export performance and growing external
23.

12
imbalances (Box 1). The authorities noted that structural constraints—in particular very high
transport costs, the underdeveloped financial sector, and emigration—were the main reasons
for low exports and the lack of sectoral diversification. They considered that the current level
of private sector wages was not a major constraint on competitiveness, as exports are mainly
produced from self-employment in agriculture.
Box 1: External Competitiveness and the Exchange Rate
The discussions highlighted linkages between export performance, external balances, the terms of
trade, and the real exchange rate:
●
The size of the goods and services deficit (18 percent of GDP) is mostly explained by
remittances and foreign aid. About three-quarters of remittances and project aid are spent on imports,
thus not directly affecting the real exchange rate. Such imports averaged an estimated 15 percent of
GDP during 2001-05, which explains much of the goods and services deficit.
●
Exports are low mainly because of structural constraints and low vanilla prices. Structural
constraints include emigration, an underdeveloped financial sector, low institutional capacity, and
high international transport costs.
●
Dollar wages are in line with comparable countries. Wages and other local costs play a
relatively minor role in agricultural production, which is family-based, though they are more
important in tourism. At about €60–90 a month, private wages are not out of line with wages in other
low-income countries. Government wages, which average €140 a month, are also not high by regional
standards, but the public sector tends to siphon off skilled labor from the private sector.
●
Past movements in the real exchange rate have had little discernible impact on exports. The
33 percent devaluation in 1994 caused a lasting real exchange rate depreciation that averaged
17 percent against the ECU and 13 percent in real effective terms for the next five years but, in
contrast to what happened in many other franc zone countries, exports did not pick up and the trade
deficit increased. The episode highlighted the structural rigidities in Comoros, such as the limited
capacity of the tradables sector and its high dependence on international export prices, which declined
during 1995-98).
●
External imbalances have widened in recent years, reflecting real exchange rate appreciation
and terms of trade shocks. From 2002 to 2005, the goods and services balance deteriorated by more
than 7 percentage points of GDP, partly reflecting rapid import growth caused by a surge in
remittances. Excluding imports financed by remittances and foreign aid, the goods and services deficit
deteriorated to an estimated 4½ percent of GDP in 2005, from near zero in 2002, mainly reflecting
real exchange rate appreciation, rising oil prices, and the collapse in international vanilla prices.
Given poor data quality, especially for longer historical series, it is not possible to quantify the degree
of potential exchange rate misalignment. On balance, the exchange rate seems to have become
moderately overvalued, with recent terms of trade shocks and real exchange rate appreciation
contributing to a growing but still moderate aid- and remittances-adjusted goods and services deficit.

24.
The large and growing goods and services deficit can be explained partly by the
direct effect of remittances on imports and partly by relative price movements. Because

13
remittances to Comoros are mainly spent on imports, they do not appear to have created a
significant Dutch disease problem, notwithstanding short-term fluctuations in monetary
aggregates and prices (Selected Issues, Chapter I). Strong import growth in recent years has
been mainly driven by surging remittances. The current account deficit has widened
moderately, reflecting rising oil prices, falling vanilla prices, and real exchange rate
appreciation caused by the appreciation of the euro against other currencies.
The 1994 devaluation did not boost exports.

The recent rise in the trade deficit is partly,
but not fully, explained by higher remittances.

25.
The authorities stressed that the hard exchange rate peg and safeguards under
the franc zone arrangement have provided the country’s main anchor of stability. In
their opinion, any short-term competitiveness gains from a devaluation would be limited by
the narrow economic base, capacity constraints in agriculture and tourism, and possible
negative feedback effects through increased emigration. Any potential benefits from an
exchange rate realignment were likely to be outweighed by the adverse effects on domestic
confidence in the currency, with a risk of further eurorization and higher lending rates. The
authorities stressed that the fixed exchange rate regime, franc zone lending limits, and central
bank independence had been critical for keeping inflation low. Staff agreed. Given the
apparent moderate overvaluation of the currency (Box 1), staff emphasized the need to
tighten fiscal policy and accelerate structural reforms aimed at promoting private sector
development (see below), so as to enhance external competitiveness and prevent a continued
widening of external imbalances.
Private sector development
26.
Policymakers and private sector representatives stressed that private sector
growth will require a significant expansion of financial intermediation. Lending rates are
high and credit to the private sector, at 6 percent of GDP, is low even by regional standards
and largely limited to short-term trade financing, partly reflecting credit risk, but also lack of

14
competition. The mission discussed medium-term reform priorities with the central bank,
with a focus on preparing the supervisory framework for the prospective entry of several
foreign banks and strengthening the supervision of microfinance institutions.
27.
There was consensus that higher FDI will be critical for raising GDP growth and
improving external competitiveness. In addition to capital, FDI would provide knowledge
transfer and linkages to international markets. It could also enhance competition in the
service industry and diversify the economy. The authorities stressed that their commitment to
good governance would help improve the investment climate and noted their recent efforts to
attract investors to the tourism and banking sectors. The mission pointed out that contract
enforcement had been perceived as a problem by several foreign investors. The authorities
noted their efforts to prepare a new investment code that would introduce a one-stop shop for
investors and give them legal recourse to the courts.
28.
There was agreement on the need to further liberalize trade policy and simplify
the tax system. Important steps this year were the conversion of high specific import duties
on key commodities into domestic excise taxes and the reduction in ad valorem tariff rates,
with a new maximum rate of 30 percent. As a result, the average weighted import tariff
declined to less than 20 percent in 2006. There was agreement that simplifying and further
reducing import duties, eliminating exemptions, and overhauling the tax code would help
improve the investment climate. One option under consideration is to introduce a low
uniform ad valorem import tariff, a uniform domestic consumption tax, and excise taxes on a
few commodities with high revenue potential. The mission advocated termination of the
forfait regime (fixed charges on containers involving about a quarter of the value of all
imports), which has depressed customs collection. The authorities thought the regime was
useful in the short term to alleviate existing capacity constraints but agreed that it should be
reviewed as part of a wider revenue reform. They reiterated their commitment to regional
trade integration and implementing the COMESA free trade area.
29.
The mission emphasized the urgency of reforming public infrastructure
companies, whose poor performance has impeded private sector growth. It urged the
authorities to accelerate their discussions with the World Bank/IFC on preparing a sector
reform strategy for the telecommunications and hydrocarbons monopolies, including possible
introduction of competition and privatization. Given the critical importance of these two
companies for the fiscal revenue base, such reforms should accompany tax reform and
improvement of revenue administration. The staff noted that greater competition would also
be important in transportation, where high costs have impeded foreign trade and economic
growth. The authorities agreed that these sectors need reform and that the precarious
financial situation of Grande Comore’s electricity and water utility (Mamwe) affected the
cash flow of its suppliers and reduced fiscal revenues. The government intends to become
current on its utility bills and improve governance at Mamwe.

15
Improving fiscal institutions in a decentralized system
30.
Lack of interisland cooperation in the context of fiscal decentralization has
undermined the country’s institutional capacity (see Selected Issues, Chapter II). Fiscal
decentralization has been a cornerstone of the national reconciliation process but, as the
authorities acknowledged, it has also created an excessively large civil service. Many
functions are replicated at each level of government. Without effective interisland
information-sharing and policy coordination, decentralization has also undermined
transparency and administrative capacity. The mission stressed that the resulting weakness in
fiscal institutions, including the lack of timely consolidated data, has contributed to chronic
arrears, poor expenditure targeting, volatile revenues, and low levels of aid. The revenuesharing mechanism, with a large share of each government’s revenue designated for
distribution, has created free-rider incentives that impair revenue collection. The collapse in
revenues ahead of the presidential power transfer highlighted these problems.
31.
The new government has centered its reform strategy on improved governance
and transparency, with a near-term focus on strengthening fiscal institutions. It has
already moved to reinforce the management of revenue agencies and public enterprises. The
mission stressed the importance of further improvements to fiscal transparency and
intergovernmental coordination. It was agreed that customs procedures should be
strengthened, including through external import valuation on all islands, following the recent
suspension of operations by the existing pre-shipment agent on Grande Comore due to
contractual disputes. There was also agreement that accounting of consolidated budget
execution and large taxpayers administration should be unified this year, and that economic
statistics need to be strengthened significantly for both Union and island-level data.
Policymakers agreed that the civil service must be streamlined and downsized to make
operations more effective, reduce the public wage bill, and create an opportunity to redeploy
skilled labor to the private sector. As a short-term measure, they aim to reduce the wage bill
through new budget ceilings for all ministries except education and health, to be followed by
broader civil service reforms.
II. PROGRAM DISCUSSIONS
A. Performance Under the SMP Through June 2006
32.
After improving in 2005, public finances deteriorated sharply in the run-up to
the May 2006 presidential elections, and most SMP targets were missed by wide
margins. The primary surplus increased sharply in 2005 and domestic arrears were reduced
for the first time in years, but several important quantitative and structural targets under the

2005 SMP were not met (Country Report No.
06/193). In the first half of 2006, revenues fell
17 percent short of the SMP target (10 percent
below the same period last year), in large part
due to governance problems in customs and
public enterprises during the pre-election
period. Moreover, some revenues were diverted
away from treasury accounts and the interisland
revenue-sharing mechanism was disrupted.
Primary current spending exceeded the target by
1 percent of GDP, salary arrears and borrowing
from the central bank increased drastically, and
the domestic primary balance turned sharply

The new government moved quickly to investigate pre-election corruption and
restore interisland cooperation, in line with President Sambi’s emphasis on good
governance. Four inspection commissions have reviewed the management of revenue
agencies and public enterprises, and several senior officials have been arrested. To restore
interisland cooperation in fiscal matters, the four ministers of finance of the Union and island
governments agreed in late June to meet monthly, ensure that all revenues are channeled
through a single account, and enhance transparency and controls in revenue administration
by placing Union officials in key positions at the island level.
B. Extension of the SMP Through December 2006
34.
The SMP was extended through December 2006 to bring fiscal performance into
line with original program objectives for the second half of the year (see Letter of Intent,
Attachment I). The quantitative targets for the extended SMP were set with a view to
restoring revenue collection and sharply reducing primary current expenditure compared to
the original flow targets for the second half of the year, in order to make up for part of the
deviations that occurred in the first half (Attachment I, Table 1). This would limit the fullyear primary fiscal deficit to ¼ percent of GDP for the year as a whole and keep net domestic
arrears and borrowing from the central bank close to zero. Specific objectives for the second
half of 2006 are to:
•

Restore fiscal revenue collection, aiming for nominal revenues in line with the original
flow target for the second half of 2006, despite lower GDP. Here the mission helped the
authorities to identify near-term administrative measures to restore revenue collection at
customs (see Attachment I).

17
•

Curtail expenditure. Parliament approved a supplementary budget in August with
spending cuts of just over ¾ percent of GDP for the second half of the year; these would
effectively reverse the spending overrun in the first half.

•

Pay down wage arrears accumulated in the first half of the year to keep net domestic
arrears accumulation near zero for the year as a whole. This objective can only be met
with substantial donor support. France has already provided €1.5 million in grants and
the EU is considering additional support.

•

Accelerate structural reforms. In addition to the comprehensive fiscal reforms carried out
by the new government this summer (Attachment I), the SMP is aimed at implementing
the structural reforms that were planned earlier but delayed by the elections. Among them
are improving the monitoring of budget execution, reinforcing revenue administration for
large taxpayers, preparing reforms for the telecommunication and hydrocarbons
monopolies, and finalizing a draft new investment code.
First-half 2006 SMP targets were missed by
wide margins.

The 2007 budget is expected to target a domestic primary surplus of close to
1 percent of GDP. This would allow for some clearance of domestic arrears and external
debt service. Revenues should increase by about 1½ percentage points of GDP, although the
specific revenue target will depend on tax and customs code reforms. The mission discussed
with the authorities options for a further shift from trade-based to domestic taxation. The
authorities requested technical assistance from the IMF to prepare such reforms. Meanwhile,
the government intends to reduce the public wage bill and reallocate spending to social
sectors and public investment, which will require a significant increase in external assistance.

18
C. PRGF Prospects
36.
The authorities stressed that entering a PRGF arrangement is a strategic
priority for them. They consider a PRGF arrangement to be critical for achieving the
I-PRSP’s key objectives by anchoring their medium-term economic reform program,
ensuring sound public finances, unlocking donor support, and paving the way for
comprehensive debt relief. The government expressed regret that fiscal mismanagement in
the months before the May elections had delayed a PRGF arrangement and urged staff to
conclude negotiations as soon as possible. The staff noted that, ahead of a PRGF
arrangement, Comoros would need to establish a satisfactory track record relative to
quantitative and structural SMP targets through end-December 2006, and reach
understandings with official creditors on mechanisms to clear its large stock of external
arrears.
37.
Much progress has been made on external arrears clearance discussions, but
arrears to the AfDB remain a significant hurdle. Comoros is $93 million in arrears to
official creditors, equivalent to about 160 percent of revenues and 106 percent of reserves
(Table 6). After an informal creditors meeting at the IMF in April 2006, the Arab Bank for
Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) offered a long-term rescheduling of arrears, and
the authorities have discussed similar mechanisms with the Kuwait and Saudi Funds. The
Paris Club has indicated the possibility of a rescheduling of bilateral debt. Comoros is
currently not eligible for the AfDB Group’s post-conflict country facility and no financing
mechanism for the $30 million in arrears to the Group has been identified.
D. Program Risks
38.
Program implementation is subject to substantial risks. Political instability and
interisland conflict remain key concerns. Because the new administration represents a major
break with the old political order, new tensions could well emerge, including during the runup to the island presidential elections in the spring of 2007. There is also a high risk that slow
progress on enhancing institutional capacity and interisland cooperation could prevent the
government from meeting its ambitious revenue and expenditure targets for the remainder of
2006, further delaying a prospective PRGF arrangement. Other potential risks are external
shocks, such as a further worsening of the terms of trade or a decline in remittances, and
natural disasters, such as a major volcanic eruption. Finally, poor data quality will continue
to hamper economic analysis and policy formulation.

19
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Comoros faces significant economic and political challenges. The most urgent
macroeconomic tasks are to remedy the recent deterioration in public finances and reach
understandings on clearing external arrears, which could open the way for enhanced donor
support and a PRGF arrangement. For the medium term, the authorities are rightly focused
on raising economic growth and improving social conditions, in line with I-PRSP objectives.
This will require continued political normalization and steps to address the country’s lack of
institutional capacity, its unsustainable debt position, and its narrow economic base.
40.
The fiscal priorities are to restore revenues and curtail spending so that
domestic arrears can be reduced and the SMP brought back on track. Following the
severe slippages in SMP implementation in the first half of 2006, the new Union government
acted quickly to restore interisland cooperation and strengthen governance in revenue
agencies and public enterprises. It then took steps to bolster revenue administration and
contain spending, with key measures approved by parliament in a supplementary budget.
These measures should help Comoros return to a broadly balanced primary fiscal position for
the year as a whole. To maintain stability, it will be important to respect the independence of
the central bank and the franc zone borrowing ceiling.
41.
Clearing external arrears is a key hurdle on the path to debt sustainability.
Comoros has been running arrears to official creditors for two decades and does not have the
capacity to service its external debt obligations. Understandings on clearing arrears clearance
are required ahead of a PRGF arrangement, which in turn is a prerequisite for eventual HIPC
and MDRI debt relief. In the near term, the authorities should make every effort to reach
arrears clearance agreements while avoiding a significant increase in near-term debt service
commitments. In this regard, the arrears rescheduling schemes recently offered by key
creditors are welcome steps in this direction.
42.
Weak interisland coordination of economic policy, in the context of fiscal
decentralization, has been at the core of governance problems in Comoros.
Decentralization is an important element of the national reconciliation process, but it requires
greater efforts to avoid the pitfalls that have become apparent in recent years, such as an
excessively large civil service, lack of transparency in government operations, inadequate
incentives to collect revenue and curtail spending, and the absence of timely consolidated
data. It is now critical to intensify interisland cooperation and unify certain government
functions, including revenue administration of large taxpayers, monitoring of budget
execution, and economic statistics. The authorities should also consider further
improvements to the revenue-sharing mechanism to reinforce incentives for subnational
revenue collection and expenditure management.
43.
Comoros will need substantial external assistance for the critical task of
institution building, particularly technical assistance to enhance the capacity of fiscal

20
institutions. Additional aid will be required to finance external arrears clearance and the
social spending and public investment programs the I-PRSP identified as necessary to make
progress toward the MDGs.
44.
While external competitiveness is constrained primarily by structural factors,
the recent real exchange rate appreciation and terms of trade shocks have exacerbated
the situation. Although the Comorian franc appears moderately overvalued, the current
account deficit is not excessively large and a devaluation is unlikely to boost exports
significantly in the short term. The authorities are rightly committed to maintaining the
exchange rate peg under the franc zone arrangement, which has been the country’s main
anchor of macroeconomic stability. Structural reforms to improve the investment climate,
develop the financial sector, overhaul the tax system, further liberalize trade, and introduce
competition and private sector involvement in infrastructure offer the most promising avenue
for enhancing external competitiveness.
45.
Improvements to the investment climate will be critical for attracting FDI and
raising the country’s economic growth potential. Large inflows of remittances have
sustained consumption and provided a buffer against external shocks. To help redirect some
of these resources toward growth-oriented investment and attract foreign investors, it will be
important to improve the investment climate by improving governance and overhauling the
tax, customs, and investment codes. Following recent reductions in import tariffs, a
promising reform option under consideration is the introduction of a low uniform import
tariff, a uniform domestic consumption tax, and excise taxes on a few commodities with high
revenue potential. However, without structural reforms and external assistance to improve
local transport and communication infrastructure, there is little prospect of significantly
higher foreign investment.
46.
Financial sector development is needed to support private sector growth and
economic diversification. The prospective entry of foreign banks could help reduce the cost
of credit and make services available beyond short-term trade financing. It would also
present the central bank with new regulatory challenges, in addition to its efforts to
strengthen supervision of microfinance institutions.
47.
After continued delays, it is increasingly urgent to introduce greater competition
and private ownership in sectors currently dominated by inefficient public monopolies.
The authorities should accelerate their work with the IFC and World Bank on a reform
strategy for the telecom and hydrocarbons companies, including possible privatization.
Greater competition in transportation and financial rehabilitation of the energy and water
utility are also urgently needed.
48.
There is considerable risk that economic performance and policy
implementation will fall short of the authorities’ objectives. Institutional capacity
problems and lack of interisland cooperation have been key reasons behind SMP slippages in

21
2005 and the sharp deterioration in public finances in early 2006. Unless remedied, these
problems could prevent the rebound in fiscal revenues and cut in expenditures needed to
bring the SMP back on track. Political tensions could reemerge if the new government is not
able to solidify national reconciliation and improve living standards. Severe capacity in
economic statistics will remain a significant obstacle to sound policy formulation for the
foreseeable future.
49.
If implemented successfully, the authorities’ policies could be the basis for a
PRGF arrangement. The new government has made a positive start in restoring interisland
cooperation, improving governance, and restoring prudent fiscal management after the severe
pre-election slippages earlier this year. The extended SMP focuses on restoring a balanced
fiscal position and reforming fiscal institutions. Successful implementation would help
establish a track record for entering into a PRGF arrangement, possibly in early 2007, in
support of the authorities’ medium-term economic reform program aimed at higher economic
growth and poverty reduction.
50.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

UNION OF THE COMOROS: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

1.
This assessment of Comoros’s external public debt dynamics was prepared jointly
with Bank staff based on the IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for lowincome countries. It makes clear that in a baseline scenario of unchanged policies, Comoros
would remain in debt distress even in the absence of shocks. In an adjustment scenario,
which assumes improved economic performance and HIPC/MDRI debt relief at end-2009,
debt would become sustainable even under a variety of stress tests. Comoros’s external
arrears are a major near-term hurdle for achieving debt sustainability, and the specifics of
arrears clearance mechanisms will have important implications for near-term debt service.
I. BACKGROUND
2.
External debt has been unsustainable for over two decades. Large-scale
borrowing from official creditors after independence led to rapid accumulation of external
debt, which had reached 100 percent of GDP by the mid-1980s. The debt burden became
quickly unsustainable and arrears as a proportion of total debt increased from 9 percent in
1984 to 35 percent in 2005. At yearend 2005, the net present value (NPV) of total debt
amounted to 419 percent of exports of goods and services. Though debt service to the World
Bank has been paid in full, arrears to most other official creditors have accumulated.
3.
At end-2005, Comoros’s public external debt was estimated to be $266 million
(72 percent of GDP). Multilateral creditors accounted for 82 percent of this and the two
largest creditors were the World Bank and the AfDB Group. Comoros has no loans from the
IMF. With 69 percent of its total debt stock in SDRs, 14 percent in U.S. dollars, and
14 percent in currencies that are linked to the U.S. dollar, Comoros’s external position is
highly exposed to fluctuations of the euro (to which the Comorian franc is pegged) against
the U.S. dollar. Since 2001, Comoros has benefited from the depreciation of the U.S. dollar
against the euro, which has contributed to a gradual reduction in its debt-to-GDP ratio.
Most of the debt stock is affected by
the Euro/U.S. dollar rate.

More than 80 percent of Comoros's debt
is owed to multilateral creditors.

Comoros has accumulated a large stock of arrears. Arrears to official creditors
amounted to $93 million at the end of 2005 (160 percent of government revenues and
106 percent of gross international reserves), of which two-thirds was owed to multilateral
creditors, mainly the AfDB Group and the Arab

5.
Debt indicators for Comoros are well above HIPC and Low-Income DSA
thresholds. The Bank-Fund low-income DSA framework classifies Comoros as a “poor
performer,” reflecting the low quality of its policies and institutions.1 At the end of 2005, the
NPV of external debt was well above all policy-dependent thresholds, in particular in relation
to exports of goods and services, with debt more than four times above the threshold. Debt
service due slightly exceeds the DSA threshold for exports but is below the threshold for
revenues.

6.
Comoros’s external debt is well above regional averages. In relation to GDP, debt
was on a par with African HIPC countries but its debt-to-exports ratio was far higher than
most. Debt service due is somewhat below regional averages, but its near-term liquidity
problems are more severe than in most other countries, given the amount of its arrears.

II. DIAGNOSIS, ARREARS CLEARANCE, AND HIPC AND MDRI ASSISTANCE
7.
Comoros is to be grandfathered under the Enhanced HIPC initiative. According
to IMF and World Bank Board meetings on September 6 and 7, 2006, Comoros is one of the
countries to be grandfathered under the HIPC initiative based on meeting the income and
indebtedness criteria at end-2004. Comoros has therefore more time to start an IMFsupported program than envisaged under the previous HIPC sunset clause.
8.
Comoros needs to clear a large stock of arrears before it can benefit from future
debt relief. Before a PRGF arrangement with the IMF, Comoros would need to reach
understandings with its creditors on clearing arrears. Clearance might take four forms: (i) a
payment by Comoros, using its international reserves, (ii) an arrears rescheduling agreement
with the creditor, (iii) debt relief from the creditor, or (iv) third-party donor assistance to help
with arrears clearance. While Comoros has a relatively comfortable level of international
reserves of about 8 months of imports of goods and services, it can use only a minimal
amount of them given the franc zone ceiling on government borrowing from the central bank.
9.
An informal meeting between the authorities and key creditors and donors was
held at the IMF during the Spring Meetings in 2006. Most creditors have since proposed a
multiyear rescheduling of arrears, which would keep open the possibility of including part of
the arrears in future debt relief. A special case is the AfDB Group, where assistance with
arrears clearance is constrained given that the AfDB does not currently classify Comoros as
eligible for its post-conflict country facility.2

2

In the AfDB’s arrears clearance mechanism, for countries classified as postconflict, one-third of the debt is
paid by the country, one-third is paid by a donor, and one-third is cancelled by the AfDB.

APPENDIX I

10.
The staff performed a debt sustainability analysis for both the baseline and the
adjustment scenarios. The baseline scenario assumes that economic growth stays in line
with historical averages (2 percent), economic reform is limited, and inflows of aid are
minimal. Comoros would continue to service IDA while arrears with other creditors build.3
11.
The adjustment scenario assumes accelerated economic reforms and debt relief.
It allows for higher growth (4 percent over the long term), higher exports, fiscal adjustment,
higher external assistance, arrears clearance in 2007, and HIPC and MDRI debt relief in
2009, with interim relief in 2008-09 (Table 1a). It is assumed that there will be no new
nonconcessional debt, while concessional borrowing will be relatively low, with most
assistance coming in the form of grants.4
12.
The specifics of arrears rescheduling can have an important impact on liquidity.
A relatively short arrears rescheduling without a grace period would imply relatively high
near-term debt service. For the DSA in the adjustment scenario, it is assumed that arrears are
rescheduled over fifteen years for all bilateral and multilateral creditors except the AfDB,
where arrears are assumed to be cleared through a combination of own payments and
external assistance.5

13.
Since two-thirds of Comoros’s external debt is owed to the AfDB group and the
World Bank, the country could benefit substantially from the MDRI. Under the MDRI,
it is assumed for 2009 that almost all debt to IDA is cancelled, as is debt to the African
Development Fund, which is about 71 percent of all debt to the AfDB group.

For further details on assumptions underlying the baseline scenario, see Table 2 and paragraph 15 of the staff
report.

4

For further details on assumptions underlying the adjustment scenario, see Table 2 and paragraph 16-18 of the
staff report.

5

In line with standard practice, all arrears clearance agreements would be explicitly linked to the HIPC initiative
to ensure that Comoros’s contribution to arrears clearance does not reduce future debt relief and that creditors
providing debt relief before the decision point are credited under the initiative.

III. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
14.
In the baseline scenario, Comoros’s external debt situation remains
unsustainable. With continuous accumulation of arrears and low economic growth, 20 years
from now the NPV would still be close to 250 percent of exports—more than twice the
policy-dependent low-income DSA threshold and still well above the HIPC threshold.
Comoros would effectively remain in default, given its large stock of arrears. Any stress test
would worsen the situation further. In the most extreme stress test, defined as a shock to
exports in 2007–08, the NPV of external debt would reach almost 800 percent of exports of
goods and services (Figure 1).
15.
In the adjustment scenario, with HIPC and MDRI debt relief in 2009, external
debt indicators would improve substantially (Table 1a). Arrears clearance in 2007 would
sharply reduce the NPV-to-exports ratio, to 311 percent. At the completion point, the NPV of
external debt would fall further, to 74 percent of exports, well below the HIPC threshold and
also below the policy-dependent low-income DSA threshold. Interim assistance would help
decrease the debt service-to-exports ratio to 14 percent in 2008. In 2010, the debt service
ratio would become 5 percent of exports.
16.
The debt dynamics in the adjustment scenario would be sustainable in a variety
of stress tests (Table 1b). To see whether HIPC and MDRI debt relief can bring debt to
sustainable levels, shocks are applied to the post-debt relief period of 2010 and 2011. Given
Comoros’s low level of exports, the NPV-to-export ratio is the indicator that is most
vulnerable to shocks. For instance, a cumulative decline in exports of 40 percent over the two
years, would raise the NPV of debt to 163 percent of exports in 2011 (from 57 percent in the
adjustment scenario), and it would take 8 years to reduce the NPV to the policy-dependent
threshold of 100 percent of exports (Figure 2). By contrast, the NPV-to-GDP ratio and debt
service-to-export ratio would remain well below policy-dependent thresholds.

35

APPENDIX I

IV. CONCLUSION
17.
Comoros would remain in debt distress under unchanged policies, but could
achieve sustainable debt indicators in an adjustment scenario with higher growth and
arrears clearance and HIPC and MDRI debt relief. The analysis shows that after the
completion point debt would be sustainable even under a variety of shocks. A near-term
challenge will be to agree on arrears clearance schemes that do not jeopardize the country’s
liquidity position yet open the way for a PRGF-supported arrangement and HIPC and MDRI
debt relief.

ATTACHMENT I

UNION DES COMORES
Unité – Solidarité – Développement

September 19, 2006
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato,
The Union of the Comoros held its presidential elections in April and May 2006, leading to
the first democratic power transfer in over a decade and bringing to an end the long process
of national reconciliation started in 2001. The overwhelming support for President Sambi
and his message of change mean that the new Union government finds itself with a strong
popular mandate across all islands, but also has the heavy responsibility of meeting the
aspirations of peace and prosperity of all Comorians. Accordingly, we attach the highest
priority to improving economic and social conditions as envisioned in Comoros’s 2005
Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP), which the new government fully
endorses and will strive to implement.
We view the support of Comoros’s international partners as crucial to the success of our
social and economic policies. The IMF in particular has supported the authorities’ efforts to
conduct sound economic policies through an intensive policy dialogue and technical
assistance. Comoros embarked in 2005 on a Staff-Monitored Program (SMP), which helped
preserve economic stability in the face of severe external shocks, although several important
program objectives were not achieved. The SMP was extended through June 2006 to build a
track record of policy implementation that would allow Comoros to enter a three-year
arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), which in turn could
pave the way for eventual debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and MDRI.
Unfortunately, budget execution in the first half of this year derailed in the electoral context.
Government revenues fell well short of the program target, reflecting governance problems
in customs administration and state enterprises. Revenues were diverted away from the
established treasury accounts and the interisland revenue-sharing mechanism broke down in
a climate of mistrust. In addition, spending significantly exceeded program targets. As a
result, salary and external arrears increased sharply, government borrowing increased more
than envisaged, and the financial position of public enterprises deteriorated markedly.
Structural reforms were put on hold as it became clear that political change was imminent.

41

ATTACHMENT I

The new government moved quickly to redress the situation. The first priority was to
reestablish trust and cooperation between the Union and the three island governments in the
conduct of public finances. To that effect, the mechanism for sharing fiscal revenues was
revised in June with a view to ensuring full transparency and self-compliance.
Simultaneously, the government appointed four special enquiry commissions (on customs
and tax administration and on the fuel and rice parastatals) to assess the full extent of revenue
underperformance and address the underlying causes. To make clear that corrupt practices
and political interference will no longer be tolerated, legal action has been taken in cases
where misconduct is suspected, including the detention of former officials and state
enterprise managers.
Starting in July, we have implemented a package of emergency measures in close
coordination between the Union and island governments:
•

A supplementary budget for the Union and three island governments was approved by
parliament on August 23. It aims to bring public finances back in line with the thrust of
the original 2006 budget and SMP objectives by introducing measures to boost revenues
and achieve the flow targets for the second half of the year. It also significantly curtails
expenditures in the second half of the year. A key objective is to fully reverse the
domestic arrears accumulation of the first half of the year, although this will require
additional donor support.

•

To restore revenue collections, the government has (i) replaced most senior managers of
the customs administration in the port of Moroni; (ii) begun implementing a new
structure for tax and customs administration that ensures transparency and accountability;
(iii) strictly prohibited customs clearance without full payment of assessed taxes and
duties; (iv) increased the specific rate of the forfeit regime for imported containers;
(v) enforced the elimination of customs exemptions not included in the customs code;
(vi) restricted the use of offsets for customs payments; and (vii) begun enforcing customs
registration and tax settlement of imports by public enterprises, in line with procedures
for all other imports.

•

To curtail spending, we have consolidated several ministries, eliminated many high-level
advisor positions, and curtailed foreign travel for public officials. We also plan to keep
discretionary spending to a minimum and reduce administrative positions in all ministries
except health and education by 2 percent by yearend, to start reducing the wage bill in
order to safeguard resources for health and education.

•

To restore the financial viability of public enterprises, we have replaced senior managers
and taken steps to ensure that (i) the Union and island governments remain current on
their utility bills, (ii) rice imports are based on competitive tenders, and (iii) retail prices
for rice and fuel reflect international prices. We are seeking donor support to finance
external audits in preparation for wider-ranging reforms.

42

ATTACHMENT I

Looking ahead, the Comorian authorities request a further extension of the SMP through
December 2006 to establish the policy implementation record that would allow entering into
discussions on a PRGF arrangement before end-2006. The policies set forth in the March 31,
2006, Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies and the objectives of the 2006
program remain broadly consistent and adequate, and we believe that the corrective actions
taken by the new government have laid the foundation for safeguarding the fiscal situation
and macroeconomic stability this year. We have updated fiscal targets for the second half of
2006 (Table 1), in line with the revised 2006 budget, and will accelerate efforts to reach
understandings with external creditors on arrears clearance. We are also following through
on key structural reforms aimed at boosting the capacity of fiscal institutions that had been
delayed in the election context (Table 2). Much more needs to be done to strengthen public
institutions and boost economic growth, and we intend to intensify structural reforms in
2007, with the support of our international development partners.
Throughout the duration of the program, the government will consult with the IMF
Managing Director, on its own initiative or at your request, to discuss the economic and
financial policies of the Union of the Comoros. We will provide the staff with information it
requests for monitoring progress in program implementation.
Sincerely yours,

/s/

ANNEX 2: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
1. Since the World Bank became active in the country in 1976, the Bank Executive Board
has approved 19 IDA credits totaling US$132.5 million to support Comoros. The only
currently active project became effective on September 29, 2004. This community-based
Social Services Project (SSP) seeks to maintain basic service delivery and address the
most urgent health and water needs. The SSP is a four-year operation in the amount of
US$13.3 million. Current Bank support strategy as presented to the Board of Directors in
March 2004 has two objectives: (i) maintaining basic social services, and (ii) supporting
the process of national reconciliation and facilitating the transition to viable institutions.
2. The Bank is preparing an update of this strategy that is scheduled to go to the Board in
December 2006. The new strategy will align with the current one but put more emphasis
on strengthening public sector capabilities. The strategy will propose two lending
operations totaling USD6.8 million for the period FY07-09: (i) a supplement to the SSP;
and (ii) a Public Sector Capacity Building and Governance Project.
3. Since the national reconciliation agreement was signed in December 2003, the Bank has
worked closely with the Fund to support the transition in Comoros, concentrating notably
on improving economic management and strengthening the institutions responsible for
revenue collection and budget execution. The Bank will continue to work closely with the
Fund in these areas, and in monitoring and facilitating I-PRSP implementation.
4. The IFC does not have any activities in Comoros, and the country has not yet joined the
MIGA. The Government of Comoros requested technical advice from the IFC on
possible privatization of the oil and telecom companies. The IFC Advisory Services
conducted a mission to Comoros on March 24-29, 2006. The mission met with
stakeholders and agreed it could support the authorities in defining their strategy for these
two companies; it submitted an offer for advisory services, which requires a financial
contribution from the Comoros authorities to demonstrate their readiness to move the
process forward. The World Bank Institute (WBI) is planning a leadership seminar late in
2006 for Comorian authorities as part of a LICUS grant. If the seminar proves successful,
WBI will consider followup activities.

ANNEX 3: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Existing data are insufficient for effective surveillance due to severe capacity constraints.
The statistical database is deficient in all sectors because of inadequate staffing and funding,
as well as lack of integration of island-based data. Comoros does not participate in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). A Statistics Department GDDS metadata
development mission is schedule for January 2007.
National accounts data and prices
Data shortcomings are particularly severe in the area of national accounts. Since basic data
are not available in a number of areas, the aggregate GDP estimate are mostly based on crude
assumptions and extrapolations of partial coverage. The estimates of GDP at current prices
are compiled using outdated benchmark data. Due to lack of funding and staffing, there have
been no survey-based national accounts since 1995, when one was prepared with UNDP
assistance, and to date there has been no survey at all on manufacturing. In 2004, with the
support of donors, a new population census and surveys on subsistence agriculture and
households were completed. These surveys have neither been fully processed or updated. An
AFR mission in July 2006 helped the authorities improve GDP estimates for 2001–05.
The weights used to compile the consumer price index (CPI) are based on an outdated survey
from the late 1980s and is compiled irregularly across the islands. Most price data are
collected only for Moroni, the country’s capital. Price compilation and quality control are
conducted mainly by only one person.
Fiscal data
Classification of budgetary data is often not consistent over time or across the islands. In
particular, problems arise in data on domestic arrears, external debt, and external support
including its investment spending components. The latest data published in the Government
Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook for Comoros are for 1987; the International Financial
Statistics (IFS) country page does not show any government finance data.
In August/September 2005, a GFS technical assistance mission found that the public chart of
accounts is inadequate to accurately record the execution of the budget. Also, a standardized
table on outstanding public debt has not yet been compiled. In order to address existing
problems, the mission recommended the creation of a committee to reform the public chart of
accounts and strengthening of the coordination of accounting methods used by the various
islands. The mission encouraged the authorities to set up a harmonized information system
for budgetary and accounting operations. The mission’s report also proposes various
methodological improvements as well as an enhancement of the dissemination of central
government operations and public debt data.

7
External sector statistics
The Central Bank of Comoros (BCC) compiles balance of payments data. With technical
assistance from an STA expert who visited Comoros in April 2005, the BCC was able to get
ready to adopt the IMF Balance of Payments Manual, 5th edition (BPM5). The STA expert
also helped the authorities to prepare a work plan to improve compilation of data on the
balance of payments and international investments. As a result, preliminary annual estimates
are now available, though not yet published, for 2003–05. However, the latest data on the
balance of payments are available to STA only through 1995.
Despite some improvement, balance of payments data remain inadequate, mainly due to lack
of adequate staff and financial resources to do the compiling. A single economist is
responsible for compiling balance of payments information. Improvement is needed in data
validation and data coverage, particularly for trade, nonregistered trade, services, and foreign
direct investment data. Data on trade are also deficient because of poor practices in Customs
data transmission. An AFR mission in July 2006 helped the authorities strengthen balance of
payments data for 2001–05, based on more information on goods and services trade and a
more advanced methodology for estimating inflows of emigrants’ remittances.
Monetary data
The BCC produces adequate monetary statistics on its own accounts, for the only commercial
bank active in Comoros, and for two microcredit operators. The CFA franc zone arrangement
has established accounting and prudential standards that prevent data disruptions. A major
shortcoming is the absence of data on the large amount of euro cash in circulation.
In May 2006, the BCC reported monetary data to STA by using the Standardized Report
Forms (SRFs) for the assets and liabilities of the central bank (1SR), other depository
corporations (2SR), other financial corporations (4SR), as well as for monetary aggregates
(5SR). Monthly monetary data in the SRF format are available for the period December
2005–April 2006.
Income distribution data and social indicators
Some progress was made with collecting income-distribution statistics and social welfare
indicators when the I-PRSP was being prepared in 2003–04. However, since then coverage
has remained limited and there has been no monitoring of progress towards the MDGs.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
The Union of the Comoros
On October 13, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with The Union of the Comoros.1
Background
Economic growth has been weak and narrowly based, with average annual real GDP
growth of 2¾ percent for 2001-05, well below the regional average. The poor growth record
reflects some of the country's inherent disadvantages, such as the small size of the local
market and the very high transport costs, but also a poor investment climate. Economic
activity remains largely confined to subsistence agriculture, production of three export
crops, import-related commerce, and government services. Fishing and tourism are well
below potential; manufacturing is almost nonexistent.
Although almost half the population lives in poverty, other social indicators are more
favorable than in most of sub-Saharan Africa mainly because of the low prevalence of
HIV/AIDS.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and
policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing
Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
With a very narrow export base, the economy is highly dependent on emigrants'
remittances, which have financed consumer imports and provided a buffer against terms of
trade shocks. Political instability and frequent interisland tensions that undermined
institutional capacity led to a sharp reduction in donor assistance over the last decade.
External debt is far above the threshold for the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative
(HIPC).
Membership in the franc zone arrangement has contributed to low inflation and limited fiscal
deficits. Fiscal policy has been constrained by the large public wage bill, which limits the
scope for social expenditure and public investment. Weak fiscal institutions have
contributed to the chronic accumulation of expenditure arrears.
In 2005 macroeconomic stability was maintained despite a sharp deterioration in Comoros’s
terms of trade. Real GDP growth picked up thanks to services and tourism. Inflation was
modest and rapid growth in remittances partly offset the sharp deterioration in the external
trade balance. Fiscal performance improved in 2005, with an increase in the domestic
primary surplus and a net reduction in domestic arrears.
Economic performance worsened in 2006, with a sharp economic slowdown and widening
external imbalances. Public finances deteriorated significantly during the run-up to the May
2006 presidential elections. Fiscal revenues declined sharply, in large part due to preelection governance problems in customs administration and public enterprises. Interisland
coordination of fiscal policy was disrupted and expenditures were higher than expected.
As a result, budgetary arrears and borrowing from the central bank increased substantially,
and the domestic primary balance turned sharply negative.
The new government has taken steps to remedy the deterioration in public finances and
restore interisland cooperation. The revenue-sharing mechanism was reinforced by
ensuring that all revenues are channeled through a single account. The supplementary
budget parliament approved in August contained a range of measures to boost revenues
and curtail expenditures. The objective is to limit the full-year primary fiscal deficit to
¼ percent of GDP for the year as a whole while paying down the domestic arrears
accumulated in the first half of the year.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. Directors welcomed the
peaceful presidential elections in May 2006 as a milestone in the national reconciliation
process. They saw the new government’s most urgent economic task as correcting the
recent deterioration in public finances, while launching a broader medium-term economic
reform program to set the conditions for higher economic growth and poverty reduction.
Directors regretted the sharp deterioration in fiscal performance in the months leading up to
the presidential elections, which resulted in large deviations from the first-half 2006 targets
under the Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). They noted that weak inter-island cooperation

3
and governance problems contributed to significant revenue shortfalls and expenditure
overruns, resulting in a sharp accumulation of domestic arrears and debt.
Directors were encouraged by recent actions of the new government to restore inter-island
fiscal cooperation, improve governance, curtail spending, and bolster revenue collection.
They commended the authorities for making their policies transparent in a supplementary
budget for 2006. This package of measures, in conjunction with financial support from
donors, should help reduce domestic debt and arrears in the second half of 2006 and
achieve a broadly balanced primary fiscal position for the year as a whole. A prudent 2007
budget should avoid new arrears and reallocate expenditure toward social sectors and
public investment.
Directors noted that Comoros faces a daunting task of lifting economic growth after decades
of stagnation. They welcomed the recent Interim Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy
Paper (I-PRSP), and supported its focus on fostering private-sector led economic growth
and improving the provision of public services in the social sectors. To implement the
strategy, Directors highlighted the need to enhance the capacity of public institutions,
address the unsustainable debt burden, improve external competitiveness, and garner
additional donor assistance, in line with pledges made during the December 2005 donor
conference.
Directors cited Comoros’s weak institutional capacity as a fundamental constraint on its
growth and stabilization prospects. Insufficient cooperation between the Union and island
governments, in the context of a decentralized fiscal system, had contributed to an
excessively large civil service and weak fiscal policy implementation and statistical base.
Directors also highlighted the adverse impact of institutional weaknesses on donor support
and private sector investment. Going forward, they stressed that intensified inter-island
cooperation and technical assistance, in particular in the fiscal area, will be essential for
building institutions that can promote macroeconomic stability and growth.
Directors expressed concern about Comoros’s lack of external competitiveness, and
stressed the need for wide-ranging structural reforms. The recent real exchange rate
appreciation and terms of trade shocks had contributed to widening external imbalances,
although this mainly reflected structural factors. Directors noted that large inflows of
remittances had so far kept the current account deficit in the moderate range, but stressed
the need for vigilance and fiscal restraint. Directors recommended reforms to improve the
investment climate, develop the financial sector, and reform public monopolies. In particular,
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to strengthen governance and introduce a new
investment code. Improvements to transport and communications infrastructure will be
critical for attracting foreign investors. Directors urged the authorities to accelerate efforts to
prepare for greater competition and private ownership in sectors currently dominated by
inefficient public monopolies, coordinating closely with the World Bank and other donors.
They also underscored the importance of financial sector development for private sector
growth and economic diversification, including the prospective entry of new banks.

4
Directors noted that successful implementation of the SMP in the second half of 2006 could
open the way for a possible consideration of a PRGF arrangement as soon as practicable.
To this end, they stressed the importance of focusing current policy efforts on restoring
revenue collection, containing non-priority spending, and strengthening fiscal institutions to
ensure that any PRGF-supported economic program would be rooted in sound fiscal
policies. Directors acknowledged that the authorities have set ambitious program targets
and that implementation risks will remain high. Directors welcomed the recent progress
made by Comoros in reaching understandings with official creditors on clearing its large
external arrears ahead of any PRGF arrangement, which in turn is a prerequisite for the
eventual HIPC and MDRI debt relief necessary to reduce debt to a manageable level.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with the Union of the Comoros will be held
on the standard 12-month cycle.

Statement by Damian Mañe on Union of the Comoros
October 13, 2006

The Union of the Comoros, comprising of three small islands, has continuously
suffered from weak economic and financial performance. The country has
•
•
•
•

inadequate infrastructure,
high transportation costs,
a very narrow production base, and
an underdeveloped financial sector.

The economy has unique characteristics which make it difficult by itself to support
the development or the maintenance of critical infrastructure. It is in desperate need of
external assistance. Harbors, airports and telecommunications which are vital importance to
the economy are inadequate and inefficient, and the economy has relied to a large extent on
subsistence agriculture and workers’ remittances. Political instability in the recent past has
also been a factor. However, the country occupies a pivotal position in the maritime safety
and security of the Mozambique channel. All these specificities make the Comoros a case
for special assistance from the international community.
After several years of political and social unrests which brought the 3 islands forming
the Comoros to the brink of secession, a reconciliation process was started with the help of
the international community. In December 2001, the inhabitants of the three islands voted for
a new Constitution that keeps the three islands together as an Union, but gave each one more
autonomy. Following the approval of the new Constitution, cooperation among the three
islands intensified, through the introduction of a consolidated budget, the implementation of
a new revenue sharing mechanism and the introduction of regular intergovernmental budget
meetings. As agreed, presidential elections, under international supervision, were held in
May 2006, and resulted in the overwhelming victory of the new president,
Mr. Ahmed Sambi, who proceeded quickly to appoint a new government.
The new government attaches the highest priority to improving economic and social
conditions as envisioned in the I-PRSP which the government has fully endorsed. It
appreciates the support received from the Fund through an intensive policy dialogue and
technical assistance, and the SMP.
Under the SMP notable progress has been made in reforming tax and customs
policies and consolidating the budget process. Nevertheless, there were slippages in public
finances in the pre-election period. As a result the interisland revenue-sharing mechanism
broke down; spending increased and salary and external arrears further accumulated.

2
The new government has moved quickly to correct the situation. Inspection
commissions were set up and senior officials, at revenue agencies and public enterprises,
suspected of wrong doing have been questioned. A strengthened system of consultation
among the islands ministries of finance and the central government have been put in place
and all revenues are now channeled through a single account. Transparency and control in
revenue administration have improved.
The authorities have also implemented a number of measures to bring the program
back on track. A supplementary budget for the Union and the three island governments was
approved by parliament in August, and is aimed at bringing public finances back in line with
the thrust of the original 2006 budget and SMP objectives. The authorities also strengthened
custom administration in the port of Moroni. Expenditures have also been significantly
reduced in the second half of the year. In the public enterprise sector, the authorities have
replaced senior managers, and taken steps to ensure that the Union and island governments
remain current on their utility bills, that rice imports are based on competitive tenders, and
that retail prices for rice ad fuel reflect international prices.
My Comorian authorities are confident that these strong measures have laid the
foundation for safeguarding the fiscal situation, and will help to bring the program back on
track. Preliminary data indicate that the objectives under the revised program are likely to be
met.
Moving into a PRGF arrangement is of critical importance to the country’s efforts to
raise economic growth and improve social conditions. It will enable the country to benefit
from external support to implement the development strategy spelled out in its I-PRSP, and
obtain debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and the MDRI. Moreover, a PRGF arrangement
will help to unblock donor pledges, made at the Donors’ Conference held in 2005, and that
are linked to a Fund-supported arrangement. My authorities would, therefore, like to request
that a Fund mission come as early as possible to Moroni to start discussions on a PRGF
arrangement.
Performance in 2005 and 2006, including Under the SMP
An SMP was put in place in February 2005. Its main objectives were to restore the
credibility of economic management, improve public finances and accelerate structural
reforms. Although not all structural targets were achieved, important progress was made.
Real GDP grew by more than 4 percent, in 2005, and real per capita GDP increased by over
2 percent. Inflation was kept under control at about 3.5 percent. Fiscal performance improved
as revenue increased and outlays were reduced. As a result, the primary surplus increased,
and the government was able to reduce domestic arrears. The terms of trade worsened in
2005 due in large part to low vanilla export prices and higher imports, especially the high oil
import bill, although remittances have also been at the base of the increase in import.

3
However, it should be noted that the large remittances have played a very important role in
the economy of the Comoros: they have offset a large trade deficit, contributed to
government revenue, provided a buffer against shock, but more importantly has prevented a
worsening of poverty.
As noted above, the period leading to the presidential elections caused slippages in
the public finances, and disrupted the decentralization system that had been put in place not
so long ago. Consequently, interisland tensions over revenue-sharing increased. One of the
first acts of the new Union Government was to restore cooperation and enhance the
decentralization arrangements. It took steps to strengthen the revenue-sharing arrangement
and to regain the endorsement of the island governments. All revenues are now channeled
into a single special account at the central bank. Daily reports on balances are made available
and island representatives have access to central bank information at all times. The new
arrangement also stipulates how much is to pay out for salaries thus ensuring that wages are
paid regularly.
The new system has improved control over public finances. However, experience has
shown that the revenue-sharing mechanism suffers from free rider and moral hazard
problems. The system needs to be improved so that there are incentives for each island
government to maximize revenue collection and to fully declare those revenues to the central
government. The Comoros will require Fund technical assistance in this area so as to make
the revenue-sharing system work efficiently.
In the meantime, the Comorian authorities are determined to achieve the specific
objectives for the period June – December 2006, which are:
•

Restore fiscal revenue collection to the level originally targeted for the second half of
2006, through strengthened tax and customs administrations as well as additional
revenue measures.

•

Reduce expenditure for the second half of the year. In this regard, several ministries
have been consolidated, many high-level advisor positions have been eliminated,
foreign official travel has been reduced to the strict minimum, and other discretionary
spending is being curtailed.

•

Pay down wage arrears accumulated during the first half of the year to keep net
domestic arrears accumulation near zero for the year as a whole. In this regard, the
authorities are thankful for the grants provided by France, and are looking forward to
additional support from the EU.

•

Implement a number of structural reforms that were delayed by the election, namely
in the area of budge execution, revenue administration, and the preparation of reforms

4
for the telecommunication and hydrocarbons monopolies, and finalizing the draft of
the new investment code.
Good progress is being made in all these areas, and many of the measures
have already been implemented. My authorities are confident that the objectives under the
SMP are being met. Progress has also been achieved as regards discussions on the clearance
of external arrears, and efforts are underway to try to find a solution to the arrears to the
AfDB.
In spite of low vanilla export price and high energy bill, the external current account
deficit has remained relatively low at about 3.5 percent of GDP, mainly due to the large
contribution of remittances to the economy. In recent years, remittances have accounted for
almost 50 percent of current account receipts, and have allowed for the imports of consumer
goods, and provide a buffer against external shocks. In 2004/05, as vanilla prices collapsed,
remittances increased and helped to reduce the shock on household income and the balance
of payments. Nevertheless, the external position remains fragile, as arrears have
accumulated, and external assistance has almost disappeared. At end-2005, the net present
value of debt amounted to an estimated 419 percent of exports of goods and services.
However, in recent years, the authorities have been able to clear the arrear to the World
Bank, but arrears to other creditors have accumulated. Efforts are ongoing to reach
agreements with other creditors. In this context, an informal meeting between the authorities
and key creditors and donors was held at the IMF during the Spring Meetings this year, and
most creditors have since proposed a multiyear rescheduling of arrears. Comoros does not
have debt to the IMF.
The Comoros is a member of the franc zone and the Comoros franc is pegged to the
euro. This arrangement has served the country well. The authorities view the safeguards
under the franc zone arrangement as having provided the country’s main anchor of stability
and enabled the central bank to follow policies that have helped to keep inflation low.
Despite the difficult external position, the Comoros franc is not overvalued.
However, improvement in competitiveness in the Comoros can only be achieved
through a tight fiscal policy and comprehensive structural reforms. Dollar wages are in line
with comparable countries and are not a factor in the low level of exports. This is due mainly
to the narrow export base and structural constraints. The country relies mainly on vanilla for
its export earnings. However, with the fall in the world price of vanilla and the increasing
competition in this market due to new entrants, Comoros’ small production has no influence
on vanilla prices. The country also produces small amount of ylang-ylang which is used in
perfume production, but earnings are low. The major constraints faced by Comoros
regarding exports is the lack of infrastructure, high energy and transport costs, and an
underdeveloped financial sector. The limited budget of the Comoros and a lack of donor

5
support have made it impossible for the authorities to deal up to now with these structural
constraints, which they intend to address under a PRGF.
Request for PRGF
The Comorian authorities are determined to reverse past trend and address directly
the challenges facing the country so as to place the economy on the path of sustainable
growth. Capitalizing on the important political changes, the authorities are committed to
embark on a comprehensive program of reforms aimed at raising the growth rate, maintained
macroeconomic stability, while taking steps to support private sector growth and economic
diversification. The strategy the authorities intend to implement has been clearly spelled out
in the I-PRSP, prepared with the participation of all main stake holders. The authorities’
efforts will focus on improving governance and transparency, strengthening interisland
cooperation, reducing poverty, liberalizing trade, reforming public enterprises and creating
an environment conducive to the development of a strong private sector.
However, the implementation of such a strategy will require extensive external
support. In this context, Fund support under a PRGF arrangement is of critical importance, as
it will enable the authorities to obtain additional financial and technical assistance form other
donors. At the same time, successful implementation of the PRGF will enable the country to
obtain debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI. The country has been under SMP
since 2005 and good progress was made. However, the new authorities have moved quickly
to take all needed remedial measures, even ones that were politically difficult. Preliminary
indications are that the program is back on track, and my authorities are, therefore, requesting
that negotiations on a PRGF arrangement begin as soon as possible. In view of the measures
taken and the strong commitment of the authorities to the adjustment process, as well as the
efforts to address the external arrears issue, I would appreciate Directors’ support to my
Comorian authorities’ request.
