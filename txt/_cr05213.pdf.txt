Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for
the 2005 Consultation with Hungary
Approved by Susan Schadler and Liam P. Ebrill
May 20, 2005
Discussions for the 2005 Article IV consultation concluded in Budapest on March 11, 2005. The
staff team comprised Mr. Mody (Head), Ms. Fabrizio, and Messrs. Abiad and Leigh (all EUR).
Mr. Abel (Advisor to the Executive Director) joined the discussions. The mission met with the then
Finance Minister Draskovics, President Járai of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB), other senior
officials, and representatives of the private sector and the academic community.
The staff report for the 2004 Article IV consultation was discussed by the Board on May 10,
2004 and was subsequently published as IMF Country Report No. 04/145. Executive Directors
viewed Hungary’s entry into the European Union (EU) as a fitting culmination of its successful
transition to a market economy. Directors were concerned about the emergence of large fiscal and
current account deficits and also about continued inflationary pressures. They saw important benefits
to strengthening policy credibility.
Hungary has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange rate system
free of restrictions. In accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, Hungary maintains
restrictions on and imposes sanctions against individuals, groups, and organizations associated with
terrorism.
Hungary subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. Data provision is timely
and facilitates effective surveillance.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: GDP growth was 4 percent in 2004, and was especially brisk in the first half,
helped by a bounce in the euro area economy. Inflation fell through much of the year. Some
fiscal consolidation was achieved. The current account deficit stabilized, albeit at about
9 percent of GDP. Financial markets maintained a generally optimistic view of Hungary.
Outlook: The economic slowdown in the second half of 2004 appears to have persisted in
early 2005. Real GDP growth is expected to slow to 3.4 percent in 2005. Disinflation is
expected to continue. The current account deficit is projected to decline in 2004 and in the
medium term, but the trajectory of the external deficit and debt remain crucially linked to the
extent of fiscal consolidation. In the medium term, growth is expected to be in range of 3½ to
4 percent a year, with movements reflecting euro area growth.
Policy Discussions
Euro adoption: The authorities’ goal of adopting the euro by 2010 has so far not been
supported by an active structural reform agenda. Meeting the fiscal Maastricht limits for euro
adoption will require substantial effort. Staff emphasized that sustainable structural reforms,
particularly fiscal reforms, would not only ensure successful adoption of the euro, but also
vibrant economic performance thereafter.
Public finances: Meeting the 2005 fiscal deficit target will require strong discipline,
exercised through the use of reserves and expenditure controls. In the medium term, adhering
to the fiscal consolidation path in the Convergence Program is critical, and needs to be
supported by structural expenditure measures. The authorities recognized the durable benefits
of structural measures, including raising households’ incentive to save and modernization of
public services. They also agreed that increased checks and balances in the budget process
would increase accountability and discipline.
Monetary policy: Following the rapid decline in the policy interest rate, further reductions
must be cautiously undertaken, based on the market’s inflation expectations. Staff also
suggested, and the authorities agreed, that markets must learn to interpret changes in the
policy interest rate as being motivated primarily by inflation-targeting considerations. This
implies a move to a constant inflation goal, targeted over a moving horizon and a smaller role
for exchange rate considerations in setting interest rates.
Financial sector: The financial system is generally sound and well supervised. The growing
share of foreign currency debt held especially by households and SMEs, which likely are not
hedged, could become a source of vulnerability and should be monitored closely.
Structural reforms: Raising the country’s low labor force participation rate and increasing
labor market flexibility are priorities. The authorities also recognized that further efforts were
needed to raise productivity. The appropriate use of EU funds will be crucial for fostering the
knowledge economy, promoting small business, and improving infrastructure.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Against the background of weakening growth and declining policy credibility in
previous years, Hungary made valuable gains in 2004. A star performer in the late 1990s,
Hungary lost ground starting in mid-2001: growth slowed and large budget and current
account deficits emerged. Between January 2001 and September 2003, minimum and public
sector wages were raised. In combination with housing subsidies and higher pensions, the
larger wage bill put upward pressure on the budget deficit. Public sector wages pulled up
private wages, which, together with rapid credit growth, induced a surge in consumption. An
appreciating real exchange rate and the spillover of consumption into import growth
contributed to worsening trade and current account balances. In 2004, real wages stayed
relatively flat, growth recovered, its composition improved, inflation was lower, and the
current account balance stabilized. Efforts to contain the fiscal deficit and procedures to
control government expenditures were steps in the right direction. Although burdened by the
memories of large policy swings, monetary policy achieved greater predictability.
2.
Regaining sustainable control over fiscal policy remains the key challenge. The
legacy of repeatedly missed budget deficit targets and the decline in fiscal transparency—
including in 2004—continue to generate

reform and consolidation (Text Figure 1).
The relatively benign current international environment and Hungary’s catch-up potential
argue for taking decisive steps—delays will only make the task harder.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Brisk growth in the first half of 2004 was helped by a bounce in the euro area
economy. Following growth of 3–3.5 percent in 2002–03, GDP rose in 2004 by 4 percent
(Figure 1 and Table 1). Growth was especially buoyant in the first half of the year, based on
strong export and investment performance, but slowed in the second half. These
developments were influenced by Hungary’s close ties to the euro area. A weaker labor
market moderated consumption growth. The unemployment rate increased from 5.5 percent
in the last quarter of 2003 to 6.3 percent in October-December 2004; labor force participation
remained low, at 60.5 percent in 2004, compared with 68 percent in the euro area. A slowing
of public sector wage growth dampened private wages.

Box 1. Response to Fund Advice
The authorities have generally concurred with the thrust of Fund advice, including the need
for fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. However, domestic political considerations
have limited the implementation of the Fund’s recommendations.
Fiscal policy. Public wages were restrained in 2004. But only modest steps were taken to
implement measures on government employment, pensions, social benefits, subsidies,
education, and health care, as recommended by the Fund’s previous technical assistance.
Staff’s suggestion to establish a three-year rolling fiscal framework has also not been
adopted.
Interest rate policy. After the sizable interest rate hikes in 2003 to defend a depreciating
forint, the policy rate was gradually lowered in 2004 following the faster-than-expected
decline in inflation, broadly in line with the Fund’s recommendations. The authorities
continue, however, to indicate to markets the appropriate range of the exchange rate, despite
being in an inflation-targeting framework.
Financial sector. The recent Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update
concluded that the regulatory and supervisory framework had significantly improved over the
last four years, as recommended in the 2000 FSAP.
An encouraging fall in the rate of inflation started in June 2004 (Text Figure 2).
The 2004 average inflation rate—just under 7 percent—reflected one-off effects of
value-added tax (VAT) and excise tax rate hikes in early 2004 and higher oil prices;
excluding the direct effect of the tax rate increase, average inflation was 4.8 percent. Inflation
fell through much of the year—indicating that the tax adjustments did not have persistent
effects—and on a month-on-month basis was down to an annualized rate of 3.5 percent by
year’s end. The prices of traded goods are now rising at about the same rate as those of
imported goods (Text Figure 3). From a regional perspective, Hungary’s inflation remains
relatively high, reflecting the slower decline in the inflation of nontraded goods and services
prices.

5.
Still preliminary data suggest that the general government deficit fell in accrual
(European System of Accounts (ESA) 1995) terms in 2004. When the contributions to the
second pillar of the pension scheme are added to government revenues, the general
government deficit fell from 6.2 percent in 2003 to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2004 (Table 2).
Excluding these notional revenues, the budget deficit declined from 7.2 percent to 5.4 percent
of GDP. The deficit targets were revised upward twice during the year, in large part due to
overspending and lower-than-projected VAT revenues. Moreover, the trends in VAT refunds
remain unclear, and their accounting conventions have not been finalized; the deficits for
2003 and 2004 may, therefore, be revised further.
6.
The extent of the underlying fiscal consolidation, however, was less than
suggested by the decline in the fiscal deficit. As one indication of this, the cash deficit
(Government Finance Statistics (GFS) 1986 definition) actually rose (Text Table 1).
Consolidation was helped by restraint in the wage bill and capital expenditures. The wage
bill was reduced by 1 percent of
Text Table 1. Hungary: Cash-Based and Accrual Fiscal Deficit

contributing to the larger cash
deficit was another one-off
effect: about one month of VAT receipts due in 2004 but delayed following procedural
changes related to EU accession will be recorded in 2004 on an accrual basis.
7.
The current account deficit stabilized at about 9 percent of GDP in 2004. The
size of the deficit reflects the relatively low savings rate (15 percent of GDP)—the result of
the public deficit and declining private savings rates—and a stable investment rate
(24 percent of GDP) (Text Figure 4). Foreign direct investment (FDI), which averaged
8 percent of GDP in the late 1990s (more than 100 percent of the current account deficit), fell
in 2003 to 2.6 percent of GDP before recovering to 4.2 percent in 2004 (Text Figure 5 and
Table 3). Despite higher FDI in 2004, the large current account deficit required significant
debt-creating financing.

Financial markets remain generally optimistic about Hungarian prospects. In
2004, the forint strengthened by 7 percent against the euro (Figure 2) despite a sharp decline
in policy interest rates. Even following the currency’s recent weakening, the exchange rate
has been close to the strong edge of its

III. REPORT ON THE POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
The authorities have anchored their policy program to the goal of adopting the
euro by 2010, but this goal has not yet been supported by an active agenda of broad
structural reforms. Meeting the fiscal deficit and public debt Maastricht targets will require
substantial effort, despite the revisions to the Stability and Growth Pact (Box 2). Staff urged
that the Maastricht criteria be achieved with a more forceful agenda of sustainable reforms.
This would not only ensure successful euro adoption but also vibrant economic performance

thereafter. If euro adoption is achieved largely by ad hoc measures, the scope for future
policy maneuver will be reduced, and long-term growth will likely be anemic. In this context,
the discussions centered on the economic outlook, the state of public finances, the
strengthening of monetary policy, financial sector stability, and structural policies for
increasing employment and productivity.
Box 2. Revisions to the Stability and Growth Pact: Implications for Hungary
In its report of March 21, 2005, the ECOFIN Council presented proposals for
“strengthening and clarifying the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).”
When assessing whether the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) applies and whether a country
complies with the Maastricht criteria, “other relevant factors” (e.g., the adjustment costs of
mandatory, fully funded pension pillars) will be taken into account on a case-by-case basis.
However, the overarching principles will remain: compliance with the deficit criterion
requires that the deficit be close to the reference value (3 percent of GDP) and that the excess
be temporary. In practice, the allowance seems unlikely to be greater than 0.5 percent of
GDP. Against this background, the table below reports Hungary’s current position relative to
the pre-revision Maastricht ceilings.

- 12 -

as the trade balance stabilizes in GDP terms and net current transfers through EU funds
increase.
11.
The decline in inflation can be expected to continue. Average inflation in 2005 is
projected at 4 percent. The authorities assessed that the recent disinflation had been helped
by intensified import competition following EU accession and by an appreciating exchange
rate. They noted that the indirect tax hikes in early 2004 had not produced second-round
effects on inflation. This observation is consistent with staff findings of low inflation
persistence associated with forward-looking behavior of price setters and consumers
(documented in an accompanying selected issues paper). Upside risks to inflation arise from
movements in oil, other commodity, and unprocessed food prices; a reacceleration of wage
growth; and a hike in the tobacco excise duty in 2006 (which is expected to affect the core
consumer price index (CPI)).
12.
The authorities acknowledged significant risks exist to meeting the 2005 budget
deficit target of 3.6 percent of GDP (or 4.7 percent of GDP excluding the second-pillar
pension contributions). The 2005 budget assumed GDP growth and inflation at 4 and
4½ percent, respectively, higher than the currently projected outcomes. Staff estimates that
the slower growth and lower inflation could cause a revenue shortfall of about 0.6 percent of
GDP. While recognizing this possibility, the authorities remain more concerned that
shortfalls in projected VAT revenues could continue on account of administrative problems.
In addition, the risks of overspending are serious. The traditional risk of municipal
overspending is aggravated by the political cycle. Of concern also are possible overruns in
open-ended spending obligations (including transfers to institutions under ministries’
purview) and pharmaceutical and housing subsidies. Past commitments (such as the
thirteenth-month pension) have added to budgetary pressures and rigidities, further reducing
budgetary flexibility and the ability to deal with unexpected revenue shortfalls or urgent
expenditure requirements.
13.
The evident risks to the deficit target will require careful use of budgeted
reserves and expenditure controls. Between January and April, the cash deficit reached
about 70 percent of the annual target. While some part of this deficit (that relating to delayed
VAT refunds) would be recorded in 2004 on an accrual basis and the early part of the year is
usually associated with large expenditures, the task for the rest of the year is a difficult one.
Thus, staff emphasized that meeting the budget deficit target would require the careful
release of reserves (overall 1.3 percent of GDP), based on timely identification of priority
spending. There is also a need to strictly enforce the measures to limit overspending and the
carryover of unused funds introduced in the 2005 budget law. If these restraints prove
infeasible, staff project a deficit overshoot of 0.6 percent of GDP, which will raise the risks
of a larger current account deficit, increased debt and slower growth in the medium-term.
B. Medium-Term Trends
14.
Seen from a regional perspective, Hungary’s growth advantage has faded. In the
late 1990s, Hungary’s reputation as a star performer was based on its rapid and consistent
growth record (Figure 3). As its growth rate slowed (from an average of 4.7 percent between

1997 and 2000 to 3.6 percent a year between 2001 and 2004), so did its position relative to
the other new EU member states. The short elapsed period precludes a firm assessment, but
moderation in total factor productivity (TFP) growth (Figure 3) appears to have accounted
for Hungary’s slower recent growth.
15.
The authorities were concerned that medium-term growth may be constrained
by the apparent trend decline in potential growth. In line with the authorities’ view, staff
estimates show that potential growth (based on a production function approach) declined
from just under 5 percent a year in the late 1990s to about 3½ percent in 2004 (Figure 3),
possibly reflecting the winding down of the privatization process. Cross-country benchmarks
suggest that Hungary’s potential growth rate could be considerably higher than the current
3½ percent. A staff analysis of the European growth experience—taking into account the
catch-up potential due to lower initial per capita income and access to foreign capital—shows
Hungary’s long-run growth potential to be in the 3.8–5.8 percent range (Box 3). If potential
growth remains unchanged at the lower end of this range, growth beyond 2005 will stay in
the range of 3½ to 4 percent a year, with movements reflecting euro area growth. As the
authorities recognized, raising potential growth will require structural reforms to achieve
higher productivity growth and greater labor force participation.
16.
In the medium-term, the projected decline in the current account is crucially
dependent on fiscal consolidation. With the effective real interest rate on external debt
expected to be lower than the growth rate, at the current exchange rate the external
debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline from 63 percent in 2004 to 56 percent in 2010.
Increased EU resources will also reduce reliance on external borrowing. A setback to fiscal
tightening and a variety of shocks, including to growth and FDI, could reverse the projected
decline in the external debt ratio (Figure 4 and Table 5).
17.
The authorities do not regard the exchange rate as the main mechanism for
maintaining competitive exports and reducing the current account deficit. CPI- and unit
labor cost (ULC)-based real exchange rates have appreciated in recent years (Figure 5). Since
significant uncertainties surround the estimates of the equilibrium exchange rate, several
considerations were discussed. The authorities judged that Hungary’s high-tech export
structure had, in part, insulated its exports from the real wage increases. However, staff
cautioned that the technological upgrading of the economy may have slowed and Hungary
faced increasing competition from other industrializing countries (Figure 5). Moreover, at
least in the short run, an appreciation of the real exchange rate appears weakly associated
with slower domestic production of traded goods (Figure 6). While the relative productivity
of Hungary’s tradable and nontradable sectors has recently moved in line with that of its
trading partners, the accumulation of net external liabilities raises questions about real
exchange rate misalignments. Given the uncertainties, however, staff agreed with the
authorities that the focus should be on measures to raise productivity growth and the savings
rate, which are crucial for long-term external sustainability.

Box 3. Growth and the Current Account
Hungary’s GDP growth rate averaged about 3½ percent a year between 2002 and
2004, while its current account deficit was around 9 percent of GDP. A country with the
potential to catch up to the technology and income levels of advanced economies can be
expected to grow relatively rapidly, while also spending more than its current income—that
is, borrowing capital from the rest of the world and, hence, running current account deficits.
How much of Hungary’s growth and current account deficit can be explained by this
catch-up—or income convergence—process?
A cross-country analysis of European economies suggests that, in general, larger
current account deficits (capital inflows) are associated with faster income convergence.
However, the model’s benchmark for Hungary suggests that its current account deficit has
been larger than would be expected based on the income convergence process. Hungary’s
current account deficit of 9 percent of GDP was about 2½ percent of GDP larger than the
central prediction of the model, though just within the statistical confidence band (Figure 1).
Growth of 4 percent in 2004 was about 1 percentage point less than the central prediction
(Figure 2).

18.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to the targets set out in the
government’s Convergence Program (CP). A fiscal consolidation relative to GDP of
0.6 percentage point per year is targeted over the next three years. In achieving consolidation,
the authorities recognized that the recent divergence in accrual and cash deficit trends cannot
be allowed to persist, and staff urged that changes in accounting conventions be minimized.
Staff emphasized that lowering the deficit below the Maastricht limit was important, not only
for euro adoption, but also because fiscal tightening, if achieved with high-quality sustainable
measures, would improve macroeconomic stability, address debt sustainability issues, and
contribute to higher growth. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is at 60 percent, and stress tests
show that a slowdown in real growth could raise the debt ratio well above the Maastricht
ceiling by 2010 (Figure 4 and Table 6). Staff, therefore, pointed out that as long as debt

- 19 -

remained at this level the authorities would need to be prepared to respond quickly with more
ambitious fiscal consolidation should debt dynamics turn adverse. Further consolidation was
also desirable to make room for automatic stabilizers.
Box 4. Fiscal Stimulus in 2005
PPP-based investment spending for
highways is to be stepped up. Though possibly
based on funding from private sources, much of
the new investment will be under the operational
supervision of a public company (the motorway
operator AAK). The expenditures for these
projects, which are estimated at 1.2 percent of
GDP in 2005, contribute to a fiscal stimulus.
Also, as the 2001 IMF Report of the Observance
of Standard and Codes notes, discretionary
spending of privatization receipts should form
part of the government’s consolidated budget.
Spending based on these receipts is expected to
reach 0.5 percent of GDP in 2005, as estimated
by the MNB in the underlying calculations of its
February 2005 Quarterly Report on Inflation,
adding to the stimulus.

19.
Staff cautioned against the use of extrabudgetary mechanisms primarily to
achieve consolidation of the on-budget balance. The authorities noted that off-budget
financing through public-private partnerships (PPPs) can accelerate needed infrastructure
development. But staff cautioned that the Hungarian experience and that of other countries
suggested that PPPs did not have a good track record of producing value for money.
Moreover, they provide a fiscal stimulus (Box 4) and represent a burden for future fiscal
budgets, reducing fiscal flexibility. Absent careful disclosure and accounting, PPPs also
render difficult the interpretation of public debt, as well as of budget trends and their
macroeconomic impact.
20.
The authorities acknowledged that specific structural measures to limit and
rationalize public expenditures had yet to be formulated. In line with previous Fund
advice, staff urged bolder steps, which, while politically difficult, were crucial to achieve
durable and credible consolidation. The authorities recognized that structural measures would
also increase household incentives to save and modernize the delivery of public services.
They acknowledged that recent modest reforms in the health and education sectors needed to
proceed further, with reduced direct government involvement in the provision of these
services. Costs of the first-pillar pension and social support systems should be contained.
Further reductions in, or, preferably, removal of, the current housing subsidy scheme could,

- 20 -

the authorities agreed, help raise household savings. Phasing out subsidies to state-owned
enterprises and completing the privatization process would enhance economic efficiency.

Tax and social security revenue (in percent of GDP)

21.
Expenditure-based consolidation was critical to create space for the needed tax
reform, the authorities agreed. Hungary’s heavy tax burden creates disincentives for
employment and investment (Text

The authorities also recognized that sustainable consolidation would require
strengthening the rules and procedures for budget formulation and implementation.
Though some fiscal consolidation has been achieved in accrual terms in recent years, there
has been a persistent overshooting of the deficit targets, which have been gradually revised
upward (Text Figure 9). In international comparisons, Hungary ranks low in the quality of its
rules and budgetary procedures (see the accompanying selected issues paper). This is
particularly so for containing overruns of expenditures that are not nominally anchored. To
restore credibility to policy targets, staff emphasized the strengthening of fiscal institutions in
providing the necessary checks and balances.

23.
In this context, staff welcomed the measures in the recently approved Public
Finances Law but cautioned that much remained to be done. Stricter rules for the
carryover of unused funds from the previous fiscal year will help in 2005. Limiting
additional budgetary spending without supplementary appropriations and parliamentary
approval was also a step in the right direction; however, staff suggested that the practice be
discontinued altogether. The authorities recognized the importance of creating a
medium-term fiscal budget framework to impose fiscal discipline while also achieving
greater budgetary transparency and predictability. In this context, staff urged the authorities
to adopt the three-year rolling framework under consideration in 2003 (which included
ceilings on overall expenditure and subceilings on key components), further checks and
balances in the expenditure management system, and more extensive oversight by the State
Audit Office to enhance transparency and credibility.
D. Monetary Policy
24.
The authorities acknowledged that inflation was still relatively high and the
recent gains could be reversed. At 3.9 percent year on year as of April 2005, inflation is
high relative to a number of benchmarks: (i) the Maastricht limits, (ii) inflation rates in most
new member states, and (iii) the MNB’s own estimated optimal inflation rate of 3 percent.
Risks to inflation arise from possible supply shocks and a reversal of recent wage trends.

appropriate. Staff suggested, and the authorities agreed, that markets must learn to interpret
changes in the policy interest rate as being motivated primarily by inflation-targeting
considerations. A cautious reduction in rates, communicated appropriately, will facilitate the
necessary learning.

26.
To further anchor inflation expectations, the authorities plan to strengthen the
inflation-targeting framework. The authorities estimate a 3 percent inflation rate as optimal
for Hungary, though they recognized that a lower rate may be necessary to meet the
Maastricht inflation criterion. The significant forward-looking component in Hungary’s
inflation dynamics should facilitate moving toward a lower target rate if necessary (Box 5).
In line with international best practice, the authorities expect to replace the current system of
setting targets for December inflation with a constant inflation objective, targeted over a
rolling horizon.
27.
The importance of exchange rates for forecasting inflation has declined with
time. Staff suggested, and the authorities agreed, that, with short-term movements in
exchange rates mainly reflecting market sentiments and volatile capital movements, and with
evidence of reduced pass-through from exchange rates to domestic prices, exchange rate
considerations should play a smaller role in setting interest rates. The authorities noted that,
in setting policy interest rates, the Monetary Council had appropriately considered the
implications of exchange rate movements for inflation. However, in 2002 and 2003, the
commitment to the exchange rate band had guided interest rate policy decisions beyond
inflation-targeting considerations (Box 5). While acknowledging that policy interest rates had
recently moved more consistently with inflation-targeting objectives, staff reiterated
recommendations from previous consultations that greater flexibility within the exchange
rate band was desirable, emphasizing the dangers of pursuing exchange rate targets in an
inflation-targeting framework, including the confusion that this could create in the markets
about the central bank’s objectives.

Box 5. Inflation Persistence and Inflation Targeting

Since year-end inflation targets have not been consistently met, the credibility of inflation targeting
has yet to be strongly established. Yet, the basis for achieving credibility exists in Hungary’s low
inflation persistence. Analysis in an accompanying selected issues paper reveals a substantial
forward-looking component in Hungarian inflation, a finding that explains why the recent inflation
shocks did not have second-round effects.

Achieving credibility will require a more consistent focus on inflation targeting. On occasion,
changes in policy interest rates have been greater than can be rationalized based on
inflation-targeting considerations alone. The selected issues paper decomposes the MNB’s policy
rate changes into inflation-targeting and exchange rate-targeting responses. In late 2002 and early
2003, inflation had been expected to meet or slightly overshoot its target, but the exchange rate
approached the strong edge of the band. As Figure 2 suggests, the MNB responded by cutting rates
below the level that could be rationalized based on inflation targeting. In late 2003 and early 2004,
the interest rate was raised partly in response to rising inflation expectations but also because of
exchange rate and inflation uncertainties.
28.
Following changes to the Central Bank Act, vigilance is required to ensure
effective functioning of the Monetary Council, necessary for central bank
independence. In February 2004, the Central Bank Act was amended to allow nominations
to the Monetary Council by the Prime Minister. With the appointment of four new members,
the Council was temporarily expanded to thirteen members, making it one of the largest in
the world. Even with its scaling back to eleven members in September 2006, the Council will
remain large.

E. Financial Sector
29.
Financial sector performance, as well as regulation and supervision, has
continued to improve. An FSAP update confirmed that the well-capitalized financial system
had recently also been exceptionally profitable (Text Table 3). The authorities observed that
profitability had been boosted by temporary factors and may moderate somewhat. The update
recommended that the

markets. As described in the accompanying Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA),
the update cautioned that the regulatory framework for the pension payout phase was
deficient and could lead to future vulnerabilities. The authorities welcomed the suggestions
for improvements in these and other areas.
30.
A source of concern is the increase in foreign currency borrowing that appears
not to be hedged. Reflecting low international interest rates and a relatively stable exchange
rate, household borrowing in foreign currencies (mainly in the euro and the Swiss franc)
increased from about 10 percent of total

potential vulnerabilities, staff reiterated the recommendation of the FSAP update to better
inform borrowers of their foreign exchange risk. The authorities agreed that lenders should
be required to provide detailed information to customers regarding the effect of exchange and
interest rate movements on their debt-servicing expenses. Regarding the possibility of
additional provisioning for foreign currency borrowing, the MNB cautioned that any such
measures should not distort competition and must be in line with EU prudential directives.

- 25 -

F. Structural Issues
31.
Raising Hungary’s low labor participation rate and increasing labor market
flexibility are priorities. The recently published National Action Plan for Employment
identified reforms needed to improve labor market participation and flexibility. The
retirement age is gradually being increased to 62 years, and income replacement benefits are
being better targeted (currently, almost 60 percent of the inactive population not in school
receive some form of pension). Vocational training is being overhauled with the greater
involvement of employers. Geographic mobility is to be improved by addressing deficiencies
in transport infrastructure (the upgrading of bypass roads, and development of suburban
community transportation and intermodal transport connection centers) and rigidities in the
housing market. Also, the authorities intend to phase out by 2006 the fixed component of
employers’ contributions to health care, which creates a disincentive to hiring part-time
workers (only 5 percent of total employment, compared with almost 20 percent in the euro
area). Finally, the authorities acknowledged that the large minimum wage hikes of 2001–02
had hurt employment, with small and medium-sized enterprises and low-skilled workers
especially affected, and that future wage developments should be well balanced, predictable,
and in line with productivity growth.
32.
Hungary has made considerable progress in improving its business climate, but
further efforts are needed to reach the higher standards of more advanced economies.
In international competitiveness rankings, Hungary ranks about in the middle of the new EU
members (Text Table 4). The World Bank’s Doing Business survey points to specific
strengths (e.g., efficient contract

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Hungary’s economy has shown resilience in its first year as an EU member.
Accession to the EU created administrative challenges in tax collection, and tax rate
increases generated temporary inflationary pressures. These challenges were successfully
navigated. Hungarian exporters largely held their own against increased competition.
Macroeconomic imbalances were contained. Foreign investors—both direct investors and
creditors—remained confident about Hungarian prospects.
34.
A commitment is needed to raising potential growth, not least to dampen
vulnerabilities and retain the confidence of financial markets. The slowdown in 2005 is a
reminder that Hungary’s short-term economic developments remain tied to the fortunes of its
main European trading partners. Productivity enhancements remain crucial to achieve higher
growth and to compete in international markets. Policies designed to raise employment are
needed to ensure that the benefits of growth are widespread. Under current baseline
projections of interest and growth rates, public and external debt as a proportion of GDP will
decline modestly, but remain susceptible to shocks. To guard against these shocks—and in
light of the large appreciation of the real exchange rate in recent years—growth-enhancing
policies are necessary, as are policies to increase the savings rate.
35.
To raise growth in the short term—and, more seriously, to prevent its erosion in
the medium term—the authorities now need to reestablish a track record of consistent
and predictable policies. Policy efforts are needed in four broad areas:
•

achieving fiscal consolidation, at least as ambitious as that spelled out in the
authorities’ Convergence Program;

•

strengthening the inflation-targeting framework;

•

reducing financial sector vulnerabilities; and

•

undertaking a more ambitious agenda of structural reforms.

36.
Fiscal consolidation is central. The risks to achieving the government’s 2005 fiscal
deficit target are evident, as the early trends highlight. To meet the target, it will be necessary
to enforce the system of reserves and expenditure controls, which, in turn, will require timely
identification of spending priorities. Another missed target would set back debt reduction and
further damage policy credibility. Beyond 2005, adherence to at least the fiscal targets in the
Convergence Program is essential not only for euro adoption by 2010 but also because
slippages will undermine macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. A more ambitious
consolidation trajectory would reduce the risk from shocks to public debt and create space for
automatic stabilizers.
37.
Ad hoc fiscal measures obscure budgetary trends and will likely damage
long-term growth. Recent differences in accrual and cash deficits not only reflect one-off
VAT effects due to EU accession but also changes in accounting practices, which have

- 27 -

increased the difficulty of interpreting budgetary trends. In 2005, off-budget PPPs will
finance needed infrastructure expenditures. International experience cautions that PPPs do
not always produce value for money and further obscure budgetary trends. Ad hoc
accounting and expenditure reduction measures may help meet the Maastricht criteria, but
with reduced economic flexibility and structural distortions, long-term growth prospects will
likely suffer.
38.
A focus on structural improvements in expenditures—and in the budget
process—will bring durable fiscal consolidation. Fundamental expenditure reforms—in
the pension, health, and education sectors—and the phasing out of interest rate subsidies
would not only reduce the budget deficit but also improve the delivery of public services and
help raise private savings. A wide-ranging tax reform—based on lower rates and a broader
base—is necessary, along with improvements in tax administration. However, tax reform
without structural measures to reduce spending would endanger fiscal consolidation plans.
To restrain the various claims on fiscal resources—and, hence, to overcome the tendency to
miss targets—stronger checks and balances are needed in budgetary processes.
39.
The inflation outlook improved in late 2004 and early 2005, and monetary policy
responded appropriately by reducing interest rates. Current market expectations suggest
that inflation will meet the 2005 and 2006 targets of 4 and 3.5 percent (±1 percent),
respectively. However, given the risks of a reversal of the recent disinflation, a cautious
approach to future interest rate changes is warranted.
40.
A stronger inflation-targeting framework will help further lower and stabilize
inflation expectations. The authorities’ intention of lowering the inflation target to 3 percent
a year in the medium term is welcome, though meeting the Maastricht inflation criterion may
require an even lower target. The introduction of a constant target, to be achieved over a
rolling targeting horizon, would make monetary policy more predictable, help to anchor
inflation expectations, and bring policies closer in line with international best practice. Also,
within the scope provided by the authorities’ desire to maintain the exchange rate band, the
focus of monetary policy on containing domestic inflationary pressures—rather than on
stabilizing the exchange rate—should be reemphasized.
41.
Although the financial sector remains sound, the growing share of foreign
currency debt held by the private sector could become a source of vulnerability. The
expansion of foreign currency-denominated borrowing—especially by households and small
and medium-sized firms that likely are not naturally hedged—should be closely monitored to
prevent it from becoming a source of macroeconomic vulnerability. Stronger disclosure
requirements and appropriately formulated additional provisioning for foreign currency loans
could help. Adoption of regulatory initiatives in the pension and insurance sectors, as
recommended by the recent FSAP update, should also be pursued.
42.
Further structural reforms are needed to promote employment and productivity
growth. Labor market flexibility can be increased by facilitating geographic and
occupational mobility, reducing the impediments to part-time employment, and
implementing vocational educational reforms that decrease the extent of skills mismatches.

- 28 -

Since the sizable increases in the minimum wage in 2001–02 ill served the goal of
employment generation, further increases should be contained. The authorities’ strategy for
using EU funds to build a knowledge economy, raise the productivity of small and
medium-sized firms, and develop infrastructure is welcome. However, fiscal structural
reforms are necessary to ensure that EU funds are used to achieve long-lasting gains.
43.
The next Article IV consultation with Hungary is expected to be conducted under the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as non interest current account deficit, plus interest and amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

Sources: Magyar Nemzeti Bank; International Financial Statistics , IM; and IMF staff estimates.

Current account deficit, excluding interest payments
Net non debt creating capital inflows
Nominal interest rate (in percent)
Real GDP growth (in percent)
GDP deflator in U.S. dollars (change in percent)

Alternative Scenarios
1. Real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator, non interest current account, and non debt inflows at historical avg. 2005-10.
2. Nominal interest rate is at baseline level plus a two standard deviation shock in 2005 and 2006.
3. Real GDP growth is at baseline level minus a two standard deviation shock in 2005 and 2006.
4. Change in U.S. dollar GDP deflator is at baseline level minus a two standard deviation shock in 2005 and 2006.
5. Non interest current account is at baseline level minus a two standard deviation shock in 2005 and 2006.
6. Combination of 2-5 using one standard deviation shocks
7. One time 30 percent nominal depreciation in 2005.

1/ Consolidated general government debt, gross debt, ESA-95 basis.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium- and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ This scenario is discussed in the text.
9/ The macroeconomic variables in the baseline scenario are broadly in line with market consensus. Thus, this scenario is similar to the baseline.
10/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

1. Key variables are at their historical averages in 2005-10 7/
2. Real interest rate is at baseline level plus a two standard deviation shock in 2005 and 2006.
3. Real GDP growth is at baseline level minus a two standard deviation shock in 2005 and 2006.
4. Primary balance is at baseline level plus a two standard deviation shock in 2005 and 2006.
5. Combination of 2-3 using one standard deviation shocks.
6. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2005. 10/
7. Combination of 2 and 6: a two standard deviation interest rate shock and a one time 30 percent depreciation.

Alternative scenarios

Real GDP growth (in percent)
Average nominal interest rate on public debt (in percent) 6/
Average real interest rate (nominal rate minus change in GDP deflator, in percent)
Nominal appreciation (increase in U.S. dollar value of local currency, in percent)
Inflation rate (GDP deflator, in percent)
Growth of real primary spending (deflated by GDP deflator, in percent)

HUNGARY—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Significant progress has been made in improving the coverage, periodicity, and other
aspects of quality related to Hungarian economic and financial statistics. Most data quality
issues noted in the data module of the 2001 Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) have been satisfactorily addressed, but some still remain.1
2.
Hungary subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and its
metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(http://dsbb.imf.org). Hungary meets the SDDS specifications for the coverage, periodicity,
and timeliness of the data, and for the dissemination of advance release calendars.
A. Real Sector Issues
National accounts
3.
A statistical discrepancy between the final version of GDP by production activities
and GDP by expenditure components emerged in 1997, and has persisted. From 2000, the
Hungarian Central Statistical Office (HCSO) has been regularly publishing an estimate of
this discrepancy for final annual data. Subsequent methodological refinements and a change
in the base year have trimmed the magnitude of the discrepancy to about 1 percent of GDP,
based on 2001 current price data, and ½ percent in 2002. From June 2002, the HCSO began
publishing seasonally adjusted estimates of quarterly GDP by type of economic activity and
by expenditure components beginning with the first quarter of 2002, with retrospective
coverage from 1995. The benchmarking of the quarterly estimates to the annual estimates has
been applied from 2000. Beginning with the annual data for 2000, the methodology for
estimation of imputed owner-occupied rent, which had been based on 1993 benchmarks, was
changed in line with recommendations of Eurostat.
4.
There were some methodological changes in the 2001–2002 annual national accounts
calculations and all of these were also calculated going back some years. There was a change
in the accounting method of re-export and the net base accounting was calculated for 1998
going backwards. The full set of non-financial accounts of the general government sector was
compiled for the period of 2001–02. There was a leap forward in the transition to calculating
the data on accrual basis. Revision of the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) data mainly
related to the improvement of the data quality, based on the development of the data
collection system, to the estimation of the previously missing items of GFCF, and the
application of the methodology of ESA95. All the important GFCF items were estimated by
applying the same methodology for the breakdown of sectors, industries, and regions for
2000–02.
1

The original 2001 ROSC Data Module and its annual updates are available on the IMF
internet web site. The latest update is Hungary: Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes—Data Module, 2004 Update (July 2004).

- 43 -

APPENDIX II

B. Balance of Payments
5.
A work plan, with clear time tables, has been implemented to replace the cash-based
balance of payments statistics, compiled by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB), with the
accrual-based accounting principles of the fifth edition of IMF’s Balance of Payments
Manual (BPM5). The following improvements have been implemented: customs data are
used to derive trade in goods; and balance of payments statistics record goods under
processing and repair on goods, and financial lease arrangements according to the BPM5
methodology. Moreover, in 2004, estimates of reinvested earnings were included in the
balance of payments statistics, raising the current account deficit with an offsetting impact on
the financial accounts. Further improvements were implemented in 2004, with the recording
of investment income on an accrual basis. These modifications completed the process of
shifting Hungary’s balance of payments statistics to accrual-based accounting consistent with
the BPM5. The release of revised quarterly series by the MNB in 2004 covered the period
1995–2003.
6.
The MNB and the HCSO have reconciled their data sources and methodologies with
regard to travel receipts and payments, eliminating a discrepancy which had existed in this
area between the balance of payments statistics and the national accounts.
7.
Since 2002, the cooperation between the HCSO and the MNB has been formalized
through memoranda of understanding signed each year between the two institutions,
identifying areas to improve statistics and harmonizing data sources and methodologies.
C. Monetary Sector
8.
The International Financial Statistics (IFS) country page for Hungary now provides
timely data for the monetary authorities, banking institutions, and the banking survey. The
coverage of the MNB’s analytical accounts has been extended, and Hungary now complies
with the strengthened reserves standard. The framework for the compilation of monetary
statistics in Hungary conforms, with three exceptions, to international standards for monetary
statistics. Moreover, progress made recently in one of the areas in which national practice
differs from international standards ( i.e., valuation of instruments), is described in
paragraph 9.
9.
In the course of two missions,2 the Statistics Department (STA) suggested excluding
deposit liabilities of credit institutions under liquidation from the monetary aggregates by
reclassifying them as “restricted deposits.” Instead of reclassifying these deposit liabilities as
“restricted deposits” until such time as the nonoperating units continue to exist as legal
entities, the MNB undertook to reclassify these credit institutions from Monetary Financial
2

STA staff visit on monetary and financial statistics (October 2000) and the ROSC data
module (May 2001). The ROSC updates of 2002–04 do not indicate any further
developments on the restricted deposits issue.

- 44 -

APPENDIX II

Institutions (depository corporations) to “nonfinancial enterprises.” Hence, deposits of these
credit institutions held with the MNB and with other credit institutions are excluded from the
monetary aggregates, as of January 2003. However, it should be noted that, in line with the
IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and consistent with the advice of the
European Central Bank (ECB), such institutions should be reclassified as other financial
intermediaries.
10.
STA had also recommended that securities on the balance sheets of depository
corporations be valued at market prices; these securities are currently based on partial market
valuation. Work is in progress in this area. From 2004, depository corporations are
encouraged to use market valuation for securities in their trading portfolio. From 2005, this
requirement is compulsory for those depository corporations that are listed on the stock
exchange. Also, securities of all companies that are listed on the stock exchange and are held
by depository corporations in their trading portfolio should be based on market valuation.3
Depository corporations are required to revalue their securities at least quarterly, and more
frequently if possible.
11.
Starting with the release of data for January 2003, the MNB has been compiling and
publishing the monetary aggregates by adopting a new methodology consistent with that used
by the ECB. In addition to the central bank and credit institutions, monetary financial
institutions now also comprise money market funds (MMFs), as the investment units issued
by MMFs show characteristics similar to those of bank deposits. Accordingly, the MMFs’
balance sheet data are included in the consolidated balance sheet of the banking system
(depository corporations survey). Other classifications that are already in conformity with
ECB guidelines include: classification of credit extended on a gross basis (excluding interest
accrued); fixed assets at acquisition cost; deposits at face value (without interest accrued);
and debt securities not reported at market value are recorded at face value and zero coupon
bonds at discounted value.
12.
The ROSC mission of 2001 also noted that the MNB’s statistical practices are not
guided by revisions studies.

3

The securities of those companies not listed on the stock exchange will be priced on the
basis of secondary market values. In the absence of a secondary market, the valuation will
be: (i) on the basis of company profitability using the last two annual company reports, or
(ii) by calculating the present value of securities using acquisition prices. If no other
information is available, acquisition prices could be used for the valuation.

- 45 -

APPENDIX II

D. Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
13.
In January 2004, STA conducted a substantive update of the GFS dataset using the
July 2003 Data Quality Assessment Framework that it had developed for assessing the
quality of five macroeconomic datasets. The mission reported that, overall, significant
progress has been made in addressing the shortcomings of budget execution data and GFS
identified in the original ROSC Data Module. These improvements relate mainly to
institutional coverage of general government, consolidation of data and reconciliation of
deficit and financing. However, plans to report monthly expenditures classified on an
economic basis have yet to come to fruition.
14.
The latest data reported for publication in the 2004 GFS Yearbook are for 2003.
These data now cover the operations of the consolidated central government and consolidated
general government sectors, as well as their corresponding subsectors. The data for 2000
onwards have been compiled on an accrual basis and reported in the Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 format.

HUNGARY: TABLE OF COMMON INDICATORS REQUIRED FOR SURVEILLANCE
AS OF MAY 5, 2005

- 46 APPENDIX II

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
June 15, 2005
This staff statement presents recent developments that have occurred after the issuance of
the Staff Report. The overall thrust of the staff appraisal has not changed, but the case for
fiscal restraint has been strengthened by recent information suggesting that the risks of
revenue shortfalls and expenditure overruns, anticipated by the staff, are now more
imminent. In order to achieve the authorities’ fiscal target for 2005, staff considers that it
is important to freeze all remaining reserves and take additional measures consistent
with durable fiscal consolidation.
1.
The authorities are revising their 2005 GDP growth forecasts downwards,
close to the staff’s projection of 3.4 percent. After increasing at a revised 4.2 percent in
2004, GDP growth was 2.9 percent in the first quarter of 2005, while unemployment rose
to 7.2 percent. As a result, in its latest Inflation Report, issued on May 23, the Central
Bank lowered its 2005 forecast to 3.3 percent, from 3.8 percent. The Finance Ministry
maintains a projection band between 3.5 and 4.0 percent, but recent announcements
suggest that they expect growth to be closer to the lower end of this band. Staff
projections had already incorporated these developments, as well as an anticipated pick
up in the second half of the year, paralleling an expected recovery in euro area growth.
Downward risks to the 2005 projections can arise should the recovery in euro area growth
fail to materialize.
2.
Standard and Poor’s (S&P) has followed Fitch in downgrading Hungary’s
long-term local currency debt from A to A- and the short-term debt from A1 to A2.
This action reflects continuing concerns about the ability of the government to meet its
fiscal targets. S&P emphasizes the lack of flexibility in Hungary’s fiscal accounts, as
highlighted in the staff report. S&P also notes risks to debt dynamics arising from sharply
higher interest rates and a significant depreciation of the forint.
3.
The authorities have now recognized fiscal slippages, but maintain that the
deficit target for this year will be achieved, if necessary, with additional measures.
On this basis, staff’s projection of a revenue shortfall (amounting to about 0.6 percent of
GDP) looks increasingly likely. Expenditure overshooting, by about half a percent of
GDP, is also likely. In staff’s view, the authorities’ commitment to maintaining the fiscal
target now requires freezing all remaining reserves (estimated by the authorities at around
0.6–0.7 percent of GDP out of the original 1.3 percent of GDP). Additional measures will
also be necessary to meet the target. In line with the staff appraisal, the authorities should
seek durable consolidation through expenditure reduction, eschewing one-off measures
that lower the reported deficit but do not reduce the fiscal stimulus (such as sales of assets
to public sector companies).
4.
In May the government began rolling out its “100 Steps” program. Consisting
of various measures to reform the labor market, healthcare, pensions, education and the
tax system, the measures are being announced incrementally. The revenue and cost
implications of these measures are not known, but the bulk of the changes will enter into
force only in 2006, with little impact on the 2005 fiscal outcome.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Hungary
On June 15, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Hungary.1
Background
Hungary’s entry into the European Union on May 1, 2004 was a tribute to its successful
transition to a market economy. The country’s willingness and ability to undertake structural
reforms in the middle of the 1990s laid the groundwork for the subsequent macroeconomic
successes. However, Hungary lost ground starting in mid-2001: growth slowed and large
budget and current account deficits emerged.
In 2004, valuable gains were achieved. Real GDP growth recovered to 4 percent, supported by
strong investment and robust export growth, in turn, helped by a bounce in the euro area
economy in the first half of the year. Consumption slowed in response to rising unemployment,
a moderation in wage growth and a tightening of the housing subsidy scheme.
Wage deceleration also helped support disinflation, with inflation declining to an annualized
3.5 percent by year-end. The current account deficit stabilized, albeit at a still high level of
9 percent of GDP. Financial markets retained an optimistic view of Hungary. Despite a sharp
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

decline in policy interest rates, the forint appreciated modestly against the euro and risk
premiums fell.
Despite these favorable developments, risks associated with the twin deficits remained.
Although some fiscal consolidation has taken place (in European Standards of Accounts’ 95
terms), the twice upward-revised fiscal deficit target was not met. While Foreign Direct
Investment recovered in 2004 to 4.2 percent of GDP from its 2003 trough, more than half of the
current account deficit still had to be financed by debt-creating flows. A new vulnerability is
emerging, as households and small businesses are borrowing in foreign currencies, likely
without adequate hedging. Forward spreads on local currency bonds have not narrowed,
reflecting uncertainty regarding the timing of euro adoption.
Moreover, growth slowed in the second half of 2004 and in the first months of 2005, with a
slowdown in industrial production and a continued increase in unemployment. Business and
consumer confidence indices have also deteriorated.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities on Hungary’s robust performance in its first
year as an European Union (EU) member. Administrative challenges generated by EU
accession were overcome successfully, the export sector responded positively to increased
competition, and macroeconomic imbalances were contained.
At the same time, Directors noted that vulnerabilities exist, including the high current account
and fiscal deficits, and that Hungary’s growth potential and performance have declined.
They urged the authorities to maintain a track record of consistent and predictable policies in
order to raise productivity and growth in the short run and prevent their erosion in the medium
term. This will be necessary to secure a satisfactory rate of income convergence with other EU
members. Growth- and savings-enhancing policies will also help reduce domestic and external
vulnerabilities and retain the confidence of financial markets, especially in the context of the
large appreciation of the real exchange rate in recent years. Directors also stressed that policies
for raising employment will be vital to ensuring that the benefits of growth are widely spread.
Directors considered regaining control over fiscal policy to be the key challenge facing Hungary.
They emphasized that fiscal consolidation is crucial, noting that missing the 2005 fiscal deficit
target would set back debt reduction and further damage policy credibility. Beyond 2005,
Directors felt that adherence to at least the fiscal targets in the Convergence Program is
essential not only for euro adoption by 2010, but also because slippages would undermine
macroeconomic stability, debt sustainability, and medium-term growth prospects.
For 2005, Directors noted that the anticipated risks of overspending and revenue shortfalls are
now materializing. At the same time, available budgetary reserves are substantially lower than
originally budgeted. Directors therefore welcomed the authorities’ commitment not to use the
remaining budgetary reserves, and urged the authorities to take prompt additional deficitreducing measures. They cautioned against actions that lower the reported deficit while

-3-

maintaining fiscal stimulus. They felt, instead, that expenditure-reducing reforms—particularly in
the health and education sectors—and the phasing out of interest rate subsidies would not only
reduce the budget deficit, but also improve the delivery of public services and help raise private
savings. They underscored also the need for a wide-ranging tax reform, with a focus on lower
rates and a broader base. Such a reform needs to be taken alongside structural measures to
reduce spending, so as not to endanger fiscal consolidation. Directors welcomed the authorities’
intention to request a fiscal Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) in
2006.
In order to improve fiscal performance and restore credibility to policy targets, Directors
recommended the strengthening of fiscal institutions and the budgetary process.
They welcomed the recently approved Public Finances Law, while cautioning that much
remains to be done. In particular, they stressed the importance of creating a medium-term fiscal
framework to improve fiscal discipline, while also achieving greater budgetary transparency and
predictability. In this context, they urged the adoption of a three-year rolling framework,
further checks and balances in the expenditure management system, and more extensive
budgetary oversight by the State Audit Office.
Directors advised against frequent changes in fiscal accounting practices, and urged caution
and transparent reporting on the use of private-public partnerships. They warned that if ad hoc
accounting and expenditure reduction measures are relied upon to meet the Maastricht criteria,
Hungary would risk entering the euro area with a large underlying deficit, which would
undermine long-term growth prospects.
Directors welcomed the disinflation in late 2004 and early 2005, and viewed the reduction in
interest rates as an appropriate response. With the 2005 and 2006 inflation targets projected to
be on track, Directors recommended that future interest rate policy be cautious and guided by
the market’s inflation expectations. In this regard, most Directors also emphasized the
importance of focusing monetary policy on containing domestic inflationary pressures, rather
than on stabilizing the exchange rate, and of communicating this clearly to markets.
Most Directors commended the authorities’ intention to strengthen the inflation-targeting
framework. They supported the planned reduction in the inflation target to 3 percent a year in
the medium term, to be achieved over a rolling horizon, noting that this would bring policies
closer in line with international best practice.
Directors commended the continuing soundness and increased profitability of the financial
sector, but were concerned that the growing share of foreign currency debt held by the private
sector could become a source of vulnerability. In this context, they urged authorities to closely
monitor the expansion of foreign currency-denominated borrowing—especially by households
and small- and medium-sized firms that likely are not naturally hedged. In this regard, they
encouraged stronger disclosure requirements, appropriately formulated additional provisioning
for foreign currency loans, and the development of market-oriented risk-hedging instruments.
They also urged adoption of regulatory initiatives in the pension funds and insurance sectors,

-4-

and changes to safeguard the independence of the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority,
as recommended by the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update.
Regarding structural measures, Directors considered that raising Hungary’s low labor
participation rate, enhancing labor market flexibility, and increasing productivity are priorities.
They therefore welcomed the recently-published National Action Plan for Employment, which
aims at facilitating geographic and occupational mobility, reducing the impediments to part-time
employment, and implementing vocational educational reforms. Moreover, they recommended
that further increases in the minimum wage be limited to productivity growth. They welcomed
the authorities’ strategy for using EU funds to raise the productivity of small- and medium-sized
firms and improve the business environment, but stressed the importance of fiscal structural
reforms to ensure that EU funds are used to achieve long-lasting gains.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
