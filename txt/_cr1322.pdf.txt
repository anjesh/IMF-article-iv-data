STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 20, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Denmark’s recovery from the global financial crisis is faltering and risks are
weighted to the downside given the close trade and financial links to the euro
area and its peg to the euro. However, growth is expected to resume in late 2012
and gain momentum in 2013. In this context, the authorities should:


Manage the domestic impact of international capital flows arising from the peg
to the euro by taking the necessary foreign exchange market intervention and
policy interest rate adjustments;



Allow automatic stabilizers to operate fully and prepare contingency plans to
support the economy through discretionary fiscal policy in the event of a weakerthan-expected economy or slower-than-expected spending on investment or
spending by municipal governments;



Undertake reforms to raise potential growth including through further measures
to boost competition, contain the size of government, and limit tax disincentives
to work and the accumulation of human capital;



Strengthen the financial sector through more robust capital and liquidity buffers,
risk-based deposit insurance premia, and gradually phase-out deferred
amortization mortgage loans; and



Remain engaged in the development of the euro area banking union given that a
well-functioning banking union would enhance the EU single market.

Denmark is well-positioned to address these policy challenges. Gross public debt is
about 50 percent of GDP and its triple-A credit rating supports market access on
favorable terms.

INTRODUCTION
1.
A new center-left government took office in October 2011, but economic policy is
little changed. There is a broad political consensus on maintaining the peg to the euro and sticking
to the fiscal targets needed to meet Denmark’s Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) commitments to
the EU. The new government also approved a pension reform with a phased increase in the
retirement age that had been negotiated by its predecessor.
2.
Despite a faltering recovery, growth is expected to resume and gain momentum in
2013. Output has fallen in three of the most recent five quarters, GDP remains well below pre-crisis
levels, and headline inflation remains under 3 percent. However, output returned to slight positive
growth in 2012 Q3.
3.
Fiscal policy has been supportive in the downturn and the recovery. The authorities
have allowed the large automatic stabilizers to operate fully and supplemented them by
discretionary fiscal policy actions as the recovery began to falter in late 2011.
4.
The exchange rate peg to the euro guides monetary policy. Monetary policy has faced a
significant challenge in defending the peg with large inflows seeking a financial safe haven in
Denmark. Interest rate reductions by Danmarks Nationalbank (DN) culminated in a negative interest
rate on marginal reserve deposits with the central bank in July 2012. This had the desired effect thus
far, of discouraging further inflows and reducing the pressure on the DN to purchase foreign
exchange reserves.
5.
Risks are substantial and clearly tilted to the downside. Further slowdown or renewed
recession in major trade partners, especially in the euro area, could weigh heavily on Danish exports.
Renewed financial turmoil could raise funding costs for banks reliant on wholesale funding; a further
decline in housing prices could put pressure on banks and households and depress still-weak
private consumption.
6.
Nevertheless, Denmark is well-positioned to address its macroeconomic policy
challenges. Gross public debt is about 50 percent of GDP and partially offset by substantial
government deposits at the DN, the current account surplus is about 5 percent of GDP, and its
triple-A credit rating supports market access on favorable terms.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. The Economic and Financial Context
7.
The global financial crisis hit Denmark hard, and the recovery has been slow and
unsteady. Output fell by nearly six percent in 2009 and recovered only about one third of this loss
by mid-2012. Output has fallen in three of the five quarters through 2012 Q3.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DENMARK

8.
Denmark’s slow growth predates the recent economic crisis, and the economy has
underperformed its regional peers during the past two decades. Despite a sound
macroeconomic framework, a highly-skilled labor force, high participation rates, and an
improvement in the terms of trade over the past decade, productivity growth has been sluggish and
average income growth has been less than in other northern European countries. Over the same
period, wage increases have been high relative to European peers and productivity growth has been
slow, leading to a large increase in unit labor costs (Figure 5 and Selected Issues, Chapter 3).
9.
The 2012 budget deficit is expected to widen to 4.2 percent of GDP from 2.0 percent
in 2011, reflecting one-off stimulus measures, repayment of early retirement contributions
and slower than expected growth. The stimulus measures included an acceleration of capital
spending into 2012 and 2013, “balanced budget” stimulus through off-budget public enterprise
infrastructure to be funded by higher prices and tariffs, and various other budgetary measures (Box
1). The authorities have also introduced a ceiling on public spending at the national, regional and
municipal levels from 2014 to address longstanding problems of controlling spending at subnational levels (Box 2) and a tax policy reform to foster employment and output growth.
10.
The current account remains in surplus, largely reflecting weak domestic demand since
the crisis and strong net income. Denmark’s current account remains positive at around 5 percent
of GDP thanks to an upward trend in service exports and net income flows reflecting a strong net
international investment position (Table 5). Capital inflows have been concentrated in portfolio
investment, offsetting large but falling outflows of FDI and other investments. International reserves
have more than doubled since end-2008, and inflows continued into the first half of 2012.
11.
Monetary policy is based on maintaining a tight peg to the euro. Safe-haven inflows
over the last year have pushed short-term Treasury bill yields to negative levels since late 2011. The
continuing inflows and upward pressure on the exchange rate led the central bank to a series of
interest rate reductions culminating in July 2012 with a shift to a negative interest rate (-0.2 percent)
on banks’ marginal reserves with the central bank. Together with actions taken by the ECB at around
the same time, this seems to have had the desired effect of discouraging the safe-haven inflows that
have led to the substantial reserve buildup. Some of the costs and benefits of these safe-haven
inflows are examined in Chapter 2 of the Selected Issues paper.
12.
The exchange rate valuation appears broadly appropriate. Evidence from specific
indicators is mixed. The macro balance and external sustainability approaches under the External
Balance Assessment (EBA) point to a moderate currency undervaluation, based on a calculation that
Denmark’s current account position is stronger than its estimated norm; by contrast, the real
equilibrium exchange rate results point to a moderate currency overvaluation (with a
correspondingly opposite view on the current account balance). Despite upward pressures from the
onset of the European debt crisis, the krone has been maintained within a narrow band of half a
percentage point or less relative to the euro in nominal terms.

norm in the EBA estimates.

13.
Households and corporates are still in the process of repairing their balance sheets.
Household savings rates have risen following the bursting of a housing price bubble and the
consequent decline in household net wealth (Box 3). While household net wealth is strong, gross
household debt was 315 percent of disposable income in 2012 Q2, many households are net
debtors, and most household assets are in the form of illiquid pension balances and real estate. The
stock market rebounded to pre-crisis levels in the first half of 2012. Corporate leverage ratios have
fallen with reduced borrowing from banks and increases in retained earnings.
14.
Denmark’s financial system has rebuilt capital but still has substantial vulnerabilities.
Banking system assets are roughly 400 percent of GDP. Profitability and asset quality are lower than
in northern and central European peer countries. Loan-to-deposit ratio and reliance on wholesale
funding are high. Loan impairments are rising, especially among small- and medium-sized banks
(Table 6). Chapters 3 of the Selected Issues paper assesses recent reforms and the scope for further
action, and Chapter 4 considers the potential contingent liabilities to the government that are
implied by current spreads and bank equity prices.

B. Outlook and Risks
15.
Staff projects 2013 growth at 0.9 percent of GDP, lifted mostly by private
consumption and moderate business investment growth. This is broadly in line with third party
forecasts but somewhat below the authorities’ projections. Inflation is expected to remain below
3 percent throughout the projection period thanks to a slowly-closing output gap (Table 2).
16.
Potential growth is expected to recover gradually to nearly 1½ percent over the
medium-term. Staff estimates that the combined effect of the fallout of Denmark’s property market
collapse and the global financial crisis shaved ½ percentage points from the trend level of
Denmark’s GDP. The upward trend in potential growth over the medium term largely reflects the
expected recovery in investment spending. Staff’s estimates and projections imply an output gap of

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DENMARK

about 2.1 percent in 2012 that would largely close by 2017 as confidence is only gradually restored
and credit conditions return to more normal levels.
17.
Most risks to growth are tilted to the downside. A weaker outlook in Europe and
worsening global financial conditions pose the largest downside external risks; a 1 percentage point
drop in EU growth would reduce Denmark’s growth by about 1 percentage point. External assets are
dominated by claims on core euro area and the Nordic-Baltic region, both of which are vulnerable
to tail risks in the euro area. The banking system is exposed to liquidity shocks in global financial
markets due to its high reliance on wholesale funding. Negative interest rates on banks’ marginal
deposits with the DN could hurt bank profitability and induce disintermediation if maintained over
the longer run. A sudden reversal of safe-haven capital flows to Denmark could require monetary
tightening, which would hurt the recovery and make private sector deleveraging more difficult.
18.
Stretched household balance sheets and domestic demand are the main domestic
risks. A further decline in housing prices could have sizeable spillovers to the rest of the economy
(Box 4).1 Acceleration of bank deleveraging could also pose risks if write-downs in the Danish
banking sector are higher than implied by current NPL ratios and banks reduce domestic lending to
meet capital requirements.
The Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities largely agree on the nature and direction of the risks. However, they do
not see as much risk from household debt levels as staff, and note that households with higher debt
also tend to be those with higher and more stable income.

1

A 10-percent house price correction would deduct by about 3 percent of GDP from household balance sheets and
would imply a reduction in annual consumption of 0.5–0.9 percent of GDP based on a marginal propensity to
consume from wealth of 0.03 to 0.06.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
20.

Discussions focused on four areas:



Balancing fiscal consolidation with the use of near-term fiscal policies to support of the recovery;



Managing the domestic impact of international capital flows resulting from the peg to the euro;



Further adapting micro- and macro-prudential policies to existing risks and the evolving EU
regulatory framework; and



Continuing measures to increase private and public sector productivity to foster longer-term
growth.

A. Fiscal Policy
21.
Medium-term consolidation plans are appropriate, but the authorities should stand
ready to take additional action to support the economy and consider a less rapid adjustment
if growth falls significantly below current projections. There is a risk that the consolidation could
undercut the still weak economy, particularly if it is compounded by a repeat of under-spending by
municipal governments or slower-than expected implementation of investment projects. As in the
past, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully. Should additional fiscal support for
the economy be needed, tax measures should be considered, in particular those that further reduce
the tax wedge on labor income or increase incentives for work. On the other hand, further tax
incentives for housing would be less desirable given the tax preferences for housing already in place.
Further acceleration of public investment seems less promising given that public investment projects
are slow to implement and the pool of good candidates for investment has been depleted by the
earlier stimulus. However, the authorities should be prepared to take actions within the space under
current EU limits if conditions dictate.
22.
The authorities’ medium- and long-term fiscal plans set out a prudent and strong
fiscal path through 2020 provided productivity growth can be strengthened. The authorities
have relatively detailed fiscal plans through 2020 and less detailed scenarios that capture the
implications of trends such as demographic shifts through 2100. However, the projections would
benefit from additional sensitivity analysis that could take into account a divergence between
growth in real wages, spending, and productivity. In particular, the assumption of an above-trend
productivity growth rate might be revisited or contingency measures could be considered in the
event that the assumed increase in productivity growth does not materialize in the 2012–20 period.
Staff acknowledge that specific measures to be implemented beyond 2020 would best be developed
in subsequent plans; however, more sensitivity analysis in the government’s very long-term
scenarios could better inform those future decisions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DENMARK

The Authorities’ Views
23.
The authorities agree on the possible downside risks, but they stress that they attach a
very high priority to meeting their 2013 targets under the EDP and exiting from it in early
2014. In addition to complying with their EU agreements, the authorities believe that failing to meet
the targets would undermine financial market confidence in Denmark’s continued willingness to
take the measures necessary to maintain fiscal sustainability. They observed that tax-based stimulus
measures would be likely to have relatively low multipliers but agreed that it would be difficult to
identify and implement additional good-quality capital projects. They did not plan any phase-out of
existing tax preferences for housing over the medium term.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
24.
The longstanding peg to the euro has served Denmark well in anchoring inflation and
minimizing exchange rate volatility vis-à-vis major trade partners. Recent safe-haven inflows
have complicated the management of monetary policy in support of the exchange rate peg. The
authorities’ interest rate reductions, including the move to a negative policy rate, have been
successful thus far in containing these inflows and reducing the pressure to accumulate reserves.
However, the impact of negative rates on bank profitability and lending should be kept under
review, particularly if the rate is set at a still lower level. The benefits and potential risks from
negative interest rates and possible means of mitigating the impact on bank profitability by
targeting the negative rates at large depositors are discussed in Chapter 2 of the Selected Issues
paper.
The Authorities’ Views
25.
The authorities strongly reiterated their commitment to the peg to the euro, and
noted that they would take whatever actions were needed in terms of interest rate measures
and foreign exchange market interventions to defend it. On the negative interest rate, they
agree that this is an unusual move, but they observed that the shift from a zero to a negative policy
rate implies a cost to banks of only 0.02 percent of GDP for a banking system with assets of roughly
400 percent of GDP, and that such a shift in policy rates had no more adverse impact on bank
earnings than a 20 basis point reduction between two positive policy rates. On the level of reserves,
they noted that their commitment to the peg required them to adjust reserves and interest rates to
market conditions; thus they saw no scope for a target level of reserves under the current monetary
framework.

C. Financial Sector Policy
26.
The staff noted the progress made in strengthening the banking sector and reducing
banks’ dependency on state guarantees. Three-year loans to banks are helping to replace expiring
state guarantees, prudential regulations have been strengthened through the “supervisory diamond”
indicators, and the activation of the new resolution procedures applying haircuts to senior bank
debt has reduced the perception of an implicit government guarantee on banks. However, bank

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DENMARK

profits remain weak and estimated default probabilities have risen (Figures 8 and 9). Also, capital
buffers may not be as robust as regulatory measures indicate and risk weights may understate
actual risk (see Selected Issues, Chapter 4) and market prices for bank equity and credit default
swaps imply significant potential fiscal risk from the banking sector (see Selected Issues, Chapter 5).
In this context, the authorities should continue to monitor bank performance and funding costs
closely.
27.
The staff welcomed the planned creation of the interagency Systemic Risk Council to
be charged with making recommendations on macroprudential policy. The Council and the
entities responsible for implementing its recommendations (e.g., the economic ministries and the
Financial Supervisory Authority) should have clear roles and responsibilities, consistent with their
institutional mandates, and information-sharing and coordination arrangements.
28.
The creation of an interagency committee to develop prudential arrangements for
systemically-important financial institutions (SIFIs) is also a positive step. This could keep
Denmark at the forefront of bank resolution regimes in the EU. The potential inclusion of a bail-in
framework would be appropriate, but reducing the risk posed by large institutions will take time,
and the pace of implementation of higher capital requirements will need to take into account the
possible contractionary impact of deleveraging.
29.
The staff recommended using any flexibility embedded in EU regulations to design
strong macroprudential and micro-prudential policies, treating Basel III and the CRD IV
regulations as floors. Banks have made progress in shoring up regulatory capital ratios, but they
should continue to retain earnings, raise new equity, and improve capital ratios through an orderly
deleveraging. Large banks might also be required to report capital and risk-weighted assets on the
Basel III definitions in addition to the current regulatory definitions to demonstrate their ability to
meet more stringent future requirements.
30.
The staff also suggested measures to strengthen crisis prevention. The strengthening of
ex ante deposit insurance has been an important step, but risk-based deposit insurance premiums
could further encourage sound risk management and discourage risky behavior. Also, deferredamortization mortgage loans should be limited for macro-prudential reasons and the decoupling of
taxes from real-estate values should be reconsidered as both appear to have contributed to
excessive volatility in housing markets.
31.
Finally, the mission welcomed the authorities’ openness to the creation of a banking
union in Europe. By enhancing stability, a well-functioning euro area banking union would
generate positive spillovers to other EU members, and especially to Denmark with its tight financial
links with the euro area and peg to the euro. A well-functioning banking union would also enhance
the EU single market for financial services benefiting the Danish banking system over the medium
term, including through improved coordination of supervision. However, the mission team
recognized the authorities’ legitimate concerns about having material representation on supervisory
issues, on which steps are being considered to strengthen the governance of the European Banking
Authority and enhance the voice of those that opt in within the ECB. The mission also recognized

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

DENMARK

the authorities’ views that a resolution mechanism and deposit insurance are critical for a wellfunctioning banking union. Pending a clear road map and timetable on these matters, the team
urged the authorities to continue supporting the process of developing the banking union.
The Authorities’ Views
32.
The authorities agreed in principle with the staff on financial sector reform, but
emphasized the need for a level playing field among banks from different countries. On riskbased deposit insurance, they noted that they would wait to see the forthcoming EU regulations
before taking action. Similarly, on treating the CRD IV standards as a floor, they would need to be
guided by the final form of the CRD IV directive. Finally, they noted that the current draft of the
Basel III regulations would have a severe impact on Danish financial markets through its preferential
treatment of government securities relative to covered bonds, regardless of the potentially better
liquidity and risk profile of the latter. Denmark has a large covered bond market but a small
government bond market, reflecting the important role of Danish mortgage banks, which provide
approximately two-thirds of total credit to Danish borrowers and are almost fully funded through
covered bonds. They hope that this would be revised in future versions of the Basel III regulations.
33.
On the proposed banking union, they largely agreed with staff and emphasized the
importance of having an effective voice within the supervisory framework. Moreover, they
expressed the concern that a resolution and deposit insurance mechanism could be applied in other
countries to place a smaller burden on bank creditors and a correspondingly larger burden on the
public sector, which would be shared across members of the union to the disadvantage of Danish
taxpayers.

D. Productivity and Competitiveness
34.
The mission was encouraged by the authorities’ actions to address the challenges of
improving competitiveness and productivity growth. In the private sector, Denmark’s overall
business environment is judged to be among the best in the world in international rankings. Further,
the package of competition reforms announced on October 26 addresses many of the known
impediments to competition in specific sectors (e.g., reducing barriers to competition in
construction and pharmacies, although not restrictions on large retail stores, and measures to make
public procurement more transparent and competitive). In the public sector, several measures taken
in recent years to reduce the tax wedge on labor income have increased incentives for work and
human capital accumulation. Also, the new system of sanctions for overspending by municipal
governments has contained unplanned expansion of public spending thus far, and this should help
to limit crowding out of the private sector. The work of Statistics Denmark on efficiency of public
spending may provide the basis for further reforms in specific areas. (Chapter 1 of the Selected
Issues paper compares expenditures with social outcome in health, education, and other areas to
those in other OECD countries to identify areas for possible efficiency gains.) The report of the
Productivity Commission expected in late 2013 could set out a roadmap for productivity-enhancing
reforms to improve unit labor costs and competitiveness more generally.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DENMARK

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Despite a faltering recovery, growth is expected to resume and gain momentum in
2013. Nevertheless, Denmark is well-positioned to address its macroeconomic policy challenges
with its low public debt and strong credit rating.
36.
To support the recovery, the authorities should stand ready to take additional action
to support the economy and consider a less rapid fiscal adjustment if growth falls below
current projections or sub-national government and investment spending falls below
budgetary projections.
37.
The longstanding and tight peg to the euro has served Denmark well in anchoring
inflation and minimizing exchange rate volatility vis-à-vis major trade partners and remains
appropriate.
38.
The planned creation of an interagency council charged with making
recommendations on macroprudential policy and the committee charged with identifying and
proposing prudential arrangements for systemic institutions are both welcome. However, crisis
prevention could be strengthened through risk-based deposit insurance premiums, limitations on
deferred amortization mortgage loans, and a reversal of the decoupling of taxes from real-estate
values to limit excess volatility in housing markets. The authorities should also use any flexibility in
forthcoming EU directives on banking sector capital and liquidity to strengthen the resilience of the
banking system, treating these directives as floors rather than targets where appropriate.
39.
The authorities’ openness to the proposed EU banking union is welcome, and they
should continue supporting the process of developing such a union in light of the potential
benefits in terms of financial stability within the euro area. However, more work is needed on
developing an effective voice within the supervisory mechanism for non-euro-area countries and on
a resolution mechanism and deposit insurance that are critical for a well-functioning banking union.
40.
The ongoing work of the Productivity Commission is welcome and the staff
encourages it to lay out a set of productivity-enhancing reforms to improve unit labor costs
and competitiveness throughout the Danish economy in the report planned for late 2013.
41.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Denmark be held on the
current 24-month consultation cycle.

Box 1: Recent Fiscal Measures
In the past three years Danish governments have introduced policies to promote fiscal adjustment
and long term sustainability, while, at the same time, supporting the economy.
Consolidation measures for 2011–13 in the 2009 “Spring Package” included higher energy
taxes and a broader corporate tax base.
The 2010 Consolidation Agreement included a reduction in public consumption growth in
2011–13, a shortening of the unemployment benefit period from four to two years, and better
controls on sub-national expenditures and taxes.
The 2011 retirement reforms increased the in the standard age for old-age pension from
65 to 67 over 2019–22 (previously schedules to take place over 2024–27), shortened the
Voluntary Early Retirement Pension (VERP) scheme by increasing the early retirement age from
60 to 62 years over 2014–17 and further to 64 years by 2023 and allowed existing VERP
contributors to exit and withdraw their contributions.
The authorities responded to the deterioration in the economic outlook for 2012 with a
“Kick-start” package that frontloaded 1 percent of GDP in budgetary and public enterprise
investment in 2012–13 that was originally planned for 2014–20, offsetting part of the cost by
raising some excise taxes and abolishing some tax exemptions.
A June 2012 tax reform included: a gradual increase in the top tax bracket and an increase in
the tax deduction for labor income from 2013 to 2022; an extra employment allowance for single
parents from 2014; and an increased deduction for investment equipment through end-2013.
The Budget Act adopted in Spring 2012 and expected to be fully implemented in 2014
incorporates the Fiscal Compact’s structural balanced budget rule into national legislation, and
introduces expenditure ceilings at the national and sub-national levels on a four-year rolling
basis with the Danish Economic Councils in charge of assessing if the ceilings are respected. In
the case of the central government, budget overruns in one year must be compensated by
reducing expenditure in the following year so that the level of debt is not affected. Collectively,
the retirement reform and the reforms in the Budget Act are expect to control spending in the
near-term and reduce spending in the longer term by around 2 to 4 percent of GDP.

Box 2: Municipal Government Spending Overruns: Policy Measures
After nearly two decades during which growth in public consumption almost always exceeded
planned levels, often by large margins, a further tightening of the sanction mechanism for
municipalities was enacted in 2010 in connection with the Fiscal Consolidation Agreement.
This appears to have established effective control over such overspending for the first time in 2011.
Municipalities account for almost half of public consumption expenditure, and they used to be
responsible for a large share of total budget overruns.
In the period 2009–10, sanctions on municipalities for overruns relative to framework
agreements led municipalities to budget their expenditure at lower level than the agreed
frameworks. A further tightening of the sanction mechanism enacted in 2010––taking effect from
2011––extended the implementation of sanctions to overruns in the accounts relative to the agreed
level of service expenditure (and not only budgets as previously). Sanctions are reductions in block
grants to municipalities that apply both collectively and individually to municipalities.

Box 3: How Vulnerable is Denmark’s Housing Market?
The Danish housing market continued its
decline through 2011 and the first half of
2012, despite a short respite in 2010. Real
house prices have fallen by 26 percent since
their peak in 2007Q1, after a two-year
period in which prices rose by over
60 percent. Housing starts declined by
17 percent in 2011, and by 28 percent in the
first half of 2012 relative to the first six
months of 2011. Year-on-year prices for the
residential properties fell by 5–6 percent in
2012 Q2.

Indicators of house price misalignment are mixed. The price-to-income ratio and price-to-rent
ratio remain above their 1970–2010 historical averages but by less than one standard deviation
(0.7 and 0.9 respectively).
The housing market remains vulnerable. Mortgage loans with variable rates and deferred
amortization loans (interest-only for 10 years) account for 74 and 56 percent of the mortgages
respectively. Given the high debt levels of Danish households, this creates a threat of higher
delinquencies should rates rise or incomes fall.

Box 4. Financial Sector Policy Initiatives
The authorities have launched a series of financial policy initiatives to bolster the banking
system:


Introduced the “supervisory diamond”, which is to be phased in by end-2012 and sets limit
values for banks in five special risk areas: large exposures, lending growth, a funding ratio,
concentration on commercial property and liquidity ratios.



Expanded in 2011 the collateral basis to include the banks' credit claims of good quality and
introduced 6-month monetary policy loans offered monthly and offered banks the option of
taking out loans with a three-year term based on DNB's collateral base in March and
September 2012.



Reformed the Deposit Insurance System in 2012 to be consistent with the revised EU Deposit
Insurance Directive. In 2012, the Danish Parliament adopted a legislative amendment requiring
that the bank department of the Guarantee Fund for Depositors and Investors to be funded
via a fixed annual rate of 2.5 per thousand of the net deposits.



Established a resolution framework including bail-in for banking institutions through Bank
rescue package 3.



Reform of macroprudential policy by proposing to set up a Systemic Risk Council, chaired by
a Danmarks Nationalbank governor and consisting of representatives from Danmarks
Nationalbank, the FSA, three economic ministries, and independent experts, to identify and
address the build-up of systemic risk by recommending to competent authorities or
government on a comply-or-explain basis. The Council is expected to begin operations in
early 2013.

Set up a SIFI committee to clarify SIFI criteria, requirements, and crisis management
framework. The committee is expected to issue its recommendations before the end of 2012.

Box 5. Implementation of Past Fund Advice
The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board in December 2010.
Since then, action has been taken in several important areas covered by past Fund advice.


Fiscal policy: The authorities have embraced a credible consolidation strategy to reduce the
general government deficit to below 3 percent of GDP in 2013, in line with past Fund advice.
A combination of discretionary fiscal measures and freely-operating ample automatic
stabilizers supported weaker-than-expected economic growth during 2010–12. The
authorities have also stepped up reforms that addressed persistent overruns in local
spending, including through a reinforcement of sanctions.



Financial sector: Progress has been made in reducing banks’ dependency on state
guarantees; prudential regulations have been strengthened through implementation of the
“supervisory diamond” indicators, and the activation of the new resolution procedures
applying haircuts to senior bank debt has reduced the perception of an implicit government
guarantee on banks.



Labor markets: Fund advice including steps towards phasing out early retirement schemes
and reforming sickness and disability leave benefits was echoed by reforms undertaken by
the authorities. The reform of the Voluntary Early Retirement Program (VERP) cut the
maximum period to receive early retirement pensions in the VERP from five to three years.
Also, the period of receiving unemployment benefits was reduced from four to two years and
the required number of months in work to be eligible for unemployment benefits was
increased.



Competitiveness: The Competition Authority has issued in October 2012 a package aimed at
strengthening competition. Also, a Productivity Commission was set up in 2012 by the new
government and its independent report is expected by the end of 2013.

Exchange Arrangements: Denmark participates in the European Exchange Rate mechanism II
(ERMII) with a central rate at DKr 746.038 per €100. The standard width of the fluctuation band
in ERM II is +/-15 percent. However, due to its high degree of convergence, Denmark has
entered into an agreement with the European Central Bank (ECB) and the euro area member
states on a narrower fluctuation band of +/- 2.25 percent. This means that the krone can only
fluctuate between DKr 762.824 per 100 euro and DKr 729.252 per €100.
Denmark has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4, and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions, apart from those imposed solely for the preservation of national or international
security, as notified to the Fund by the National Bank of Denmark in accordance with Executive
Board Decision No. 144-(52/51). Currently, in accordance with relevant UN resolutions and EU
regulations, Denmark maintains measures to regulate the freezing of funds, other financial
assets, and economic resources of certain persons and entities associated with Osama bin Laden,
the Taliban, the Al-Qaida network, Slobodan Milosevic and persons associated with him, and
persons indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. There are
restrictive measures against Uzbekistan and Lebanon. Certain restrictive measures, including the
freezing of funds of certain individuals and entities, are maintained against Afghanistan, Belarus,
the Democratic Republic of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and
Zimbabwe. Measures have been taken against Egypt concerning the freezing of funds of certain
individuals and entities. Measures have been taken to prohibit the payment of certain claims by
Iraq, Libya, and the Haitian authorities.

Article IV Consultation: Denmark is on the 24-month consultation cycle. The staff report for
the last Article IV consultation (IMF Country Report No. 10/365) was discussed by the Executive
Board on December 13, 2010, and released under Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 10/160
(December 16, 2010). A staff team comprised of Mr. Dorsey (head) and Mmes. Batini, Mordonu,
Xiao, and Zoli (all EUR) visited Copenhagen during October 25–November 5, 2012 to hold
discussions for the 2012 Article IV consultation. Ms. Pedersen and Mr. Andersen (both OED)
joined the mission.
Outreach: The team met with representatives of the private sector, labor unions, the largest

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Denmark
On January 16, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Denmark. 1
Background
Denmark’s near-term economic outlook is expected to improve as the economy is on the road
to recovery from the global financial crisis. Output is projected to have declined by 0.4 percent
in 2012, but modest growth is expected to resume in 2013, lifted mostly by private consumption
and moderate business investment growth.
A combination of discretionary fiscal measures and freely-operating generous automatic
stabilizers supported weaker than expected economic growth during 2010–12. The monetary
policy response to safe-haven inflows has helped to reduce the need for foreign exchange
purchases to maintain the peg to the euro. In the financial sector, prudential regulation has been
strengthened through implementation of the ‘supervisory diamond’ initiative as well as through
the reduction of banks’ dependency on state guarantees.
Risks are weighted to the downside given the close trade and financial links to the euro area,
worsening global financial conditions as well as domestic vulnerabilities stemming from house
price developments and adverse developments in the domestic financial sector. Fiscal

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

consolidation efforts may weigh on future growth unless the deleveraging process that is
ongoing in the private sector does not reverse on the back of resuming confidence.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Denmark’s recovery from the global financial crisis is faltering,
notwithstanding the authorities’ strong policy response, which has included a mix of
expansionary fiscal policy and labor market reforms. While growth is expected to resume
in 2013, downside risks persist, stemming mainly from a further slowdown in major trade
partners or a worsening of the outlook for financial and real estate markets. Directors agreed
that Denmark is well positioned to address its macroeconomic policy challenges, with its low
public debt, net creditor status, and strong credit rating.
Directors supported Denmark’s medium-term fiscal consolidation plans. They welcomed recent
fiscal measures and the reforms addressing overruns in local spending, including a
reinforcement of sanctions. They broadly agreed that, if growth falls significantly below current
projections, the authorities should allow automatic stabilizers to operate fully and consider
additional support to the economy within the space permitted by EU commitments. In this
context, a number of Directors underscored the importance of meeting the 2013 targets under
the EU Excessive Deficit Procedure and exiting from it in early 2014 for maintaining market
confidence.
Directors agreed that the longstanding peg to the euro has served Denmark well and remains
appropriate. They noted, however, that the recent shift to negative policy rates—to contain
capital inflows and support the peg—poses challenges for monetary policy and carries risks if
maintained for a prolonged period. They encouraged careful monitoring of these issues.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ initiatives on macro-prudential and crisis resolution policies,
including the creation of the interagency Systemic Risk Council. Banks’ dependency on state
guarantees has been reduced, and prudential regulation has been strengthened. However,
continued vigilance is warranted and there is scope for additional strengthening of the financial
sector through more robust capital and liquidity buffers, risk-based deposit insurance premia,
limits on deferred amortization mortgage loans, and a reversal of the decoupling of taxes from
real estate values to limit excess volatility in housing markets. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ engagement in the development of a European banking union.
Directors commended the authorities’ actions to address the challenges of improving
competitiveness and productivity growth. Additional reforms to raise potential growth would
include further measures to boost competition and limit tax disincentives to work and to the
accumulation of human capital. In this context, Directors looked forward to the findings of the
Productivity Commission on productivity enhancements, including in the public sector.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by Benny Andersen, Executive Director for Denmark and
Gitte Wallin Pedersen, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
January 16, 2013
On behalf of the Danish authorities, I would like to thank the staff for the candid and
constructive policy discussions in Copenhagen during the Article IV mission. My authorities
appreciate the high quality papers and broadly concur with staff’s analysis and assessment.
They will carefully consider the recommendations.
Economic Outlook
The recovery of the Danish economy was discontinued last year. GDP looks to have
contracted by nearly ½ percent, despite large stimulus to private demand from economic
policy and despite home owners having benefited from Denmark’s status as a “safe haven”,
which has driven down interest rates to extraordinary low levels. However, both consumers
and businesses have been very cautious in their spending, probably reflecting, to a large
extent, the uncertainties in the international economy, in particular those emanating from the
sovereign debt crisis. Not much support has come from external demand, either.
Despite the decline in production last year, the unemployment rate has only increased slightly
and is still considerably lower than in previous periods of weak economic cycles. That points
to a well-functioning labor market characterized by many new job openings and relatively
low long-term unemployment, when compared to both historical and international levels.
The situation is expected to improve in 2013 and 2014. Overall, the Danish authorities expect
GDP to grow by 1.2 percent in 2013 and 1.6 percent in 2014 – one quarter of a percentage
point above IMF staff’s estimates for both years. While this is a relatively modest growth, it
will be sufficient to bring about a gradual improvement in the labor market, with rising
employment and a reduction in unemployment from mid-2013.
Growth this year is mainly driven by economic policy stimulating private domestic demand.
However, private consumption growth is expected to be moderate, as some households still
need to consolidate their balance sheet. From 2014, growth is expected to become more self-

2
sustaining; with exports taking over as the main driver of growth as Danish export markets
gain momentum.
Export growth is helped by a significant slowdown in wage growth in the private sector,
which has remained well below wage growth abroad over the last 1½ years. However, the
ability of companies to benefit from growth in export markets is still hampered by past years’
loss of competitiveness. Since 1995, the Danish wage growth has been out of sync with
productivity growth for extended periods of time and, as also noted by IMF staff, the very
large current account surplus of around 5 percent of GDP is mainly related to net income
flows and weak imports due to weak domestic demand, not to strong exports.
Net income from abroad has risen substantially over the past 10 years along with Denmark’s
transition from a debtor to a creditor nation. The net income flows have stimulated domestic
demand and thereby contributed to an upward pressure on wages and deteriorating wage
competitiveness. While this may hold back income generated from exports, the high net
income flows expand the potential for higher spending of households and companies.
The short-term outlook is, of course, associated with considerable uncertainty. The risks are
very much related to developments abroad. The Danish authorities’ forecast assumes that
Denmark maintains its status as a “safe haven” until conditions in the financial markets have
been normalized. Rising interest rates could have adverse effects on the whole economy, in
particular for the housing market where the on-going stabilization remains fragile.
As in many other countries, normalization of the business cycle following the set-back in
2008-09 is likely to take time. In Denmark’s most recent Convergence Programme,
submitted to the EU in April 2012, the cyclical situation is projected to normalize with a
closing of the output gap by 2018. Prior to the crisis, the Danish economy was characterized
by very high capacity utilization and gauging by the output gap, the current slack in the
economy is estimated by the Danish authorities at around 2¾ percent of GDP.

3
The stretched-out period of recovery partly reflects the expansion of household and corporate
balances throughout the 2000s, in particular related to the housing market bubble, and the
loss of wealth in private and financial institutions following the downturn. Consequently, the
need to consolidate private sector balances has dampened demand from households and
companies. Experience from previous financial crises shows that the recovery from such
crises takes longer compared to other downturns.
There are several indications that some realignment of the imbalances built up during the
boom years has taken place, and that the size of the imbalances built up in the Danish
economy up until 2007 has been reduced. This is a precondition for normalization of the
cyclical position to take place. Incomes are high and considerable saving is taking place,
especially in the corporate sector, and the interest rates are very low, which has stabilized the
housing market. However, the exact timing and path of a normalization of the business cycle
is difficult to predict.
The report addresses the growth rate in the standard of living in Denmark. However, the
conclusion is a bit too gloomy. Adjusted for gains in the terms-of-trade and net income from
abroad, the growth in the Danish standard of living has been in line with comparable
countries over the past 15 years. Net foreign wealth is now 30 percent of GDP and net
income from abroad has gone from an outlay of 3-4 percent of GDP to a net income of
4 percent of GDP.
Fiscal Policy
Economic policy is planned to support growth and employment within the framework of a
healthy and responsible fiscal policy that meets the requirements in the EU recommendation
and the new Danish Budget Law. A sound and credible fiscal policy is important to maintain
confidence in Danish economic policies and to keep low interest rates that support growth
and employment.
Based on the Danish government’s most recent Economic Survey from December 2012,
developments in public finances are expected to be in line with the EU recommendation,

4
according to which the structural budget balance must be improved by 1½ percent of GDP
from 2010 to 2013 and the actual budget deficit must be reduced to below 3 percent of GDP
by 2013.
The dampening effect on activity from fiscal consolidation is, however, offset by a number of
stimulus measures that do not directly affect public finances, or which have only a limited
impact. This includes, among other things, an investment window, according to which
companies can write off 115 percent of (certain) investments in 2013.
Overall, economic policy is estimated to provide a significant contribution to growth and
employment in 2013. Fiscal policy and other economic policy measures from 2012 onwards
are thus estimated to increase the GDP level by 0.8 percent in 2013 (measured by the
multiannual effects), while the effect on employment is estimated at around ½ percent
(15,000 persons).
Fiscal policy for 2014 will not be set and finalized until the 2014 budget is put forward and
adopted. Based on technical assumptions, economic policy is estimated to have a neutral
effect on activity in 2014, while the public deficit in 2014 is estimated to be close to the
3 percent of GDP limit set forth in the Stability and Growth Pact. This implies that the fiscal
room for manoeuvre is very limited since the correction of the excessive deficit in 2013 in
line with the EU recommendation has to be sustainable, implying that the deficit has to stay
below 3 percent of GDP going forward.
The Budget Law, which was adopted in the Danish Parliament in 2012, introduces binding
expenditure ceilings for state, regions and municipalities from 2014. In order to allow
automatic stabilizers to operate freely, the highly cyclical unemployment-related expenditure
is not covered by the expenditure ceilings. Also, public investments are outside the ceilings.
Under the Budget Law, the annual structural deficit must not exceed ½ percent of GDP, in
accordance with the requirement in the European Fiscal Compact, except in extraordinary
circumstances.

5
The medium-term fiscal strategy is embodied in the government’s 2020-Plan from
May 2012. The 2020-Plan presents the government’s reform program and determines the
possible annual growth rate of public consumption given that fiscal policy must fulfill the
targets of obtaining structural budget balance in 2020, ensuring fiscal sustainability and
keeping a debt level safely below the EU limit of 60 percent of GDP. The Danish
government has announced a precautionary principle, implying that the actual growth rate in
public consumption must comply with these fiscal targets, given the projected revenues only
including policies and reforms that have already been adopted by Parliament. Additional
growth in public consumption, based on future reform plans, cannot be implemented before
the reform is adopted by Parliament. The precautionary principle and the 2020-Plan thus
contribute to ensure the credibility of Danish fiscal policy.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
The Danish authorities share the view that the longstanding peg to the euro has served
Denmark well in anchoring inflation and minimizing exchange rate volatility vis-à-vis major
trade partners. The inflation rate is low and stable and inflation expectations are well
anchored, thus representing a key component of the Danish stability-oriented macroeconomic
policy.
The intensified government debt crisis in some European countries in the second half of 2011
resulted in safe haven flows from domestic and foreign investors and a strengthened upward
pressure on the krone. To counter this, Danmarks Nationalbank conducted intervention
purchases in the foreign-exchange market for considerable amounts – 91 billion kroner
(approximately 5 percent of GDP) from August 2011 to June 2012. In the same span of time,
Danmarks Nationalbank shadowed the two downward reductions in ECB policy rates and
furthermore lowered rates unilaterally 5 times.
At the end of May, with effect from the beginning of June 2012, Danmarks Nationalbank
lowered the rate on the current account, which is used for settlement of payments, to
0 percent, and the rate on certificates of deposits was lowered to 0.05 percent. When the ECB
lowered its rates by 0.25 percentage points on 5 July 2012, Danmarks Nationalbank was

6
bound to introduce negative monetary-policy rates to keep the interest-rate spread
unchanged. Negative rates were implemented by lowering the rate on certificates of deposits
to -0.20 percent while leaving the rate at 0 percent on the current account. The limits for
current-account deposits were expanded in order to reduce the strain of a negative interest
rate on certificates of deposits on the banks. In order to ensure a simple and transparent
implementation, the principle that the limits are determined on the basis of the banks'
activities in the money market has not been changed.
Transmission to market rates and the krone rate has been clear since the introduction of the
negative interest rate on certificates of deposit. Danmarks Nationalbank has not conducted
intervention purchases of foreign exchange since July 2012, and the krone has weakened
around 0.3 percent to a level close to the central rate against the euro in the ERMII. In the
period following the rate reductions, confidence in the handling of the government debt crisis
in some European countries has increased, which lead to a general strengthening of the euro.
Today, the banks hold certificates of deposit amounting to approximately 150 billion kroner.
On an annual basis, this entails limited interest expenses in the range of 300 million kroner
corresponding to 0.02 percent of GDP. So far the banks have not introduced negative retail
rates on deposits for the private and corporate sectors. In a few instances, firms have had
negative interest rates on deposits, primarily special short-term time deposits. The banks'
lending margins have by and large remained unchanged since the introduction of negative
interest rate on certificates of deposits.
The turnover for overnight money-market loans has declined after the introduction of
negative monetary policy rates, but not to unprecedented levels. The decline should be seen
in light of the expansion of the limit on current-account deposits, which has improved the
banks' ability to manage liquidity fluctuations via the current account. On the other hand, the
turnover has been supported by the fact that the banks have an incentive to lend in the market
rather than to buy certificates of deposits at negative rates.

7
The circulation of large bank notes has remained stable since the introduction of negative
monetary-policy rates.
Danmarks Nationalbank considered the possibility of negative monetary-policy rates before
the actual introduction. In February 2012, Danmarks Nationalbank posted a technical
description of the handling of potentially negative monetary-policy interest rates on its
website, while the financial sector was directly informed.
Danmarks Nationalbank carefully monitors developments on an on-going basis and is
prepared to implement further measures if needed, including adjustments to the monetarypolicy instruments.
Likewise, Danmarks Nationalbank is prepared for a reversal of capital flows, and has
previously been able to manage the exchange rate of the krone in times with substantial
outflows, as it was the case during the financial crisis in the autumn of 2008.
Financial Sector Issues
The Danish authorities overall find the staff report and the related material balanced in
relation to issues on the Danish financial sector.
There are, however, some issues which my authorities would like to clarify further.
Staff concludes that the government guarantee schemes and the state funded capital
injections have enhanced the perception of the existence of an implicit government guarantee
on the financial sector. Staff concludes that after bank rescue packages 1 and 2, Denmark has
enacted and implemented bank rescue package 3 allowing for haircuts on senior debt.
Haircuts have been imposed on creditors when ailing banking institutions have wound up
using bank rescue package 3. (Banking institutions wound up using bank rescue package 3,
which constitutes 1 percent of total assets of the Danish banking sector.) However, Denmark
is one of very few EU member states – if not the only one – that has imposed haircuts on
creditors. Consequently, it is the perception among e.g. rating agencies that the probability

8
for future bailouts in Denmark is lower. This is reflected in the low systemic support uplift
included in the rating of Danish institutions compared to institutions in other countries. This
is also noted in the Staff Report (p.10).
In relation to the treatment of covered bonds in the Basel III proposal on the LCR, staff states
that the Danish authorities’ concerns have been addressed. However, this conclusion seems
premature. The LCR as defined in the final Basel III still gives preferential treatment to
government debt. This poses a challenge for jurisdictions with low public debt. More
importantly, the current euro debt crisis has revealed the inappropriateness of this approach.
Furthermore, it does not reflect the actual performance of government and covered bonds.
Hence, in a joint working paper by Danmarks Nationalbank and the BIS, it was concluded
that Danish covered bonds were as liquid as Danish government bonds during the crisis. At
this stage, the CRDIV/CRR is still being negotiated in Europe. It is very important that the
calibration of the LCR is based on a thorough analysis of the different assets liquidity
characteristics and a range of assets are to be tested by the European Banking Authority
according to different objective liquidity criteria. By a delegated act, starting from 2015, the
Commission can regulate where different assets should be placed in the different levels of the
liquidity buffer according to the results of these tests. Final agreement between the Council
and the European Parliament is pending.
On the European banking union, staff is correct in assessing that the Danish government is
positive regarding the creation of a banking union in Europe. However, it is important to note
that the Danish government has not yet decided on the issue of Danish participation in the
single supervisory mechanism and the banking union. This decision would depend on a
cost/benefit analysis of the complete banking union, thus depending on its remaining
elements, notably the coming proposal on a common resolution mechanism for member
states participating in the single supervisory mechanism.
Productivity
In the medium-term projection, productivity is assumed to grow by 1.2 percent per year in
2014-2020, corresponding to the average productivity growth in 1991-2013.

9

Denmark has experienced a significantly lower productivity growth since the mid-1990s than
most other OECD-countries. As pointed out by Staff, an important explanation is a relatively
low level of competition, especially in the service sector, and several measures addressing
this issue have been taken in the competition reforms announced in October 2012.
The Government has set up a Productivity Commission to look into the reasons for the slow
productivity growth and put forward recommendations to enhance productivity. The
Productivity Commission will present their work and proposals by the end of 2013. Among
the Commission’s tasks is to analyze the productivity in the public sector.
