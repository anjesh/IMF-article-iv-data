Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the African Department
Approved by Hugh Bredenkamp and Adnan Mazarei
June 13, 2008
Recent Developments: Growth has risen and the fiscal stance has been tightened, reflecting the
impact of reforms of taxation and improvements in the business climate. Foreign direct investment
is growing quickly to unprecedented levels. Inflation, though declining, remains high, reflecting
international commodity price rises and excess liquidity in the financial system. Growth is
expected to remain strong over the medium term, supported by rising investment inflows.
However, the economy is facing growing supply constraints.
Policy Discussions focused on:
¾ Fiscal consolidation to reduce public debt; counter demand pressures; and create fiscal
space for much needed spending on public infrastructure and education/retraining. The
mission recommended better targeting of social outlays.
¾ Strengthening monetary policy to reduce inflation, buttress financial sector supervision,
and maintain the managed float exchange regime.
¾ Enhance structural competitiveness to alleviate growing supply constraints, notably
labor market reforms, new competition law, reform of the parastatal sector and further
liberalization of administered prices and trade controls.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s assessment and policy recommendations.
Participants. A staff team comprising Paul Mathieu (Head), Alfredo Baldini, Patrick Imam,
Camelia Minoiu (all AFR) visited Port Louis during February 27-March 11, 2008. Discussions
were concluded April 25 at headquarters. The staff team met with Prime Minister Navinchandra
Ramgoolam; the Minister of Finance and Economic Development Rama Sithanen; the leader of the
opposition Paul Béranger; Central Bank Governor Rundheersing Bheenick; senior government
officials; and representatives of the private sector; labor unions; and donors.
Mauritius has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions. The capital account is open, with few restrictions. The statistical database is adequate
for surveillance purposes. Mauritius participates in the General Data Dissemination Standards and
is planning to adopt the Special Data Dissemination System by early 2009.
Two selected issues papers, on external competitiveness and inflation, accompany this report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Economic growth is responding to structural reform efforts. Tax reform, together
with improvements in the business environment and investment initiatives, has spurred
foreign investment to unprecedented levels and accelerated growth to 6½-7 percent
in 2007/08. Growth is broad based but especially strong in tourism, banking,
construction, and services. Rising fiscal receipts and expenditure containment have cut
the deficit and public sector debt is continuing to decline. The external current account
deficit has eased but remains high on investment-driven import growth. The exchange
rate appreciated 17 percent in real effective terms in the 12 months ending February 2008
from an overly depreciated level in 2005-06. However, the economy is facing rising
labor, infrastructure, and other bottlenecks. The authorities are also facing strong head
winds from international commodity prices and inflation, although declining, remains
high.

•

The key macroeconomic challenges are to reduce the fiscal deficit to counter
demand pressures, to strengthen monetary policy, and to pursue structural reform
to spur economic efficiency. Growth is expected to remain strong over the medium
term, supported by rising investment inflows.

•

A window of opportunity exists to extend fiscal reforms to the expenditure side and
create fiscal space for much needed spending on public infrastructure and
education/retraining. Replacing the system of universal indirect subsidies with better
targeted social assistance to vulnerable groups is vital.

•

Monetary policy needs to be strengthened further to raise effectiveness and focus on
reducing inflation. Greater attention to the liquidity impact of public funds management
is needed to support monetary policy in the face of the large capital inflows. The
financial system remains sound, and vulnerability indicators have improved.

•

The managed float exchange rate regime continues to provide an appropriate
framework for macroeconomic management, and the rupee appears to be broadly
in line with fundamentals. The exchange rate will need to remain flexible to support
monetary policy.

•

Structural reform should be pursued to improve labor market flexibility, liberalize
trade and competition in goods markets, and reform the public enterprise sector to
stimulate a supply response to the foreign investment stimulus.

•

The authorities were in broad agreement with staff’s assessment and policy
recommendations.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Mauritius’ economy suffered at the turn of the millennium as longstanding
trade preferences, on which its growth strategy had relied, were phased out. In
the 1990s, Mauritius achieved real annual GDP growth of over 5 percent, contributing to
one of the highest levels of social
Text Figure 1: Mauritius: Changes in real GDP and Terms of Trade
welfare in Africa (Information
Annex, Appendix V), but growth
fell to about 3 percent in the
early 2000s, reflecting the
dismantling of the Multi-Fiber
Agreement, lower guaranteed sugar
prices from the European Union,
and higher costs for imported
commodities, especially petroleum,
and, more recently, food (Text
Figure 1). In 2005, the government
launched a wide ranging reform
strategy that has begun to bear fruit. Trade and investment were liberalized, some price
controls were lifted, taxes were reduced, a fiscal consolidation strategy was initiated, and
monetary policy was strengthened. According to the most recent Doing Business report
(2008), Mauritius is now the lead country in Africa.

While growth is recovering, the economy is facing rising labor, infrastructure,
and other bottlenecks. The authorities are also facing strong head winds from international
commodity price rises and inflation remains a concern. Strong foreign investment inflows
are putting pressure on the nominal exchange rate.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Macroeconomic imbalances continue to be reduced as the fiscal consolidation
effort progresses and growth accelerates (Tables 1 and 2). Fiscal policy has been put on a
contractionary path in recent years and a significant primary surplus is expected in 2007/08
for the first time in more than a decade (Text Figure 2). Real GDP growth is projected to
accelerate to 6½-7 percent in 2007/08—driven by foreign investment especially in tourism,
banking, construction, and services, and structural reforms, including a major revamping of
the tax system. Emerging sectors, notably the Global Business License (GBL) and the
information, communication, and technology (ICT) sectors are growing strongly and have

boosted demand for business, accounting, and investment services. 1 The textile sector is
reviving after years of restructuring.

The stance of fiscal policy in Mauritius has been
tightened since 1999/00...

Note: The fiscal impulse is the annual change in structural primary balance in percent of GDP, computed as the trend component of primary balance by applying an HP filter.

4.
Inflation has eased somewhat in the past year but remains in the upper single
digits. A significant portion (nearly 60 percent) of consumer price inflation is imported,
especially with respect to food and energy (Text Figure 3). Large capital inflows have also
added to demand pressures, compounded by supply-side constraints and inefficiencies,
including from underinvestment in public infrastructure, lack of skilled workers in some
sectors, and import and distribution monopolies run by parastatals. An appreciation of the
exchange rate, especially in late 2007/early 2008, has dampened some of the inflationary
pressures. The real effective exchange rate appreciated sharply—by 17 percent in the 12
months ending February 2008 from an overly depreciated level in 2005-06.
5.
The overall fiscal position has improved as revenues have risen strongly (by
about 1 percent of GDP) in response to tax reforms and expenditure has been
contained (Table 3). The overall deficit is projected to decline to about 3.0 percent of GDP
in 2007/08, with a primary surplus of about 1.7 percent, and public sector debt falling to
about 59 percent of GDP. Tax reform has made the tax regime more progressive, easier to
administer, and broadened the base (Box 1). On the expenditure side, debt service has
declined in line with falling interest rates, but capital expenditure is under-target owing to
implementation difficulties. The authorities have introduced fiscal management laws – on
program based budgeting (PBB), public sector debt management, and on public audit –
which will contribute to better fiscal performance. The debt sustainability outlook has
improved. 2

The GBLs are offshore investment vehicles resident in Mauritius. The GBLs were created to take advantage of
double taxation avoidance treaties with a number of countries (notably India and South Africa) and Mauritius’
low tax environment. Flows through the GBLs have risen sharply to about US$80-100 billion per year and they
hold large deposits in the domestic banking system.

Mauritius began to experience significant capital inflows starting in 2006/07
(Table 4). Financial account inflows comprise FDI, particularly into tourism, but also
portfolio investment attracted by the high relative interest rates. The import bill has
increased about 17 percent, driven by higher international petroleum and food prices, which
was not compensated fully by rising service exports. The BOM has accumulated reserves,
which are projected to reach 6½ months of imports by end 2007/08. However, the large and
rising errors and omissions items in the balance of payments are problematic and cloud the
external sector analysis. 3

3

A STA technical assistance report in 2007 found that the large and rising errors and omissions component of
the balance of payments reflected incomplete surveys of GBLs activities.

7
Box 1: Tax Reform
Mauritius has implemented a major tax reform aimed at broadening the base and shifting tax
incidence to higher income earners. A key measure of the reform was the introduction of a single
flat tax rate on personal and corporate income. The introduction of a National Resident Property
Tax (NPRT) on high-income earners has also improved progressivity (Text Table 1).

7.
A monetary policy committee (MPC) was established in March 2007 to improve
transparency and effectiveness, and the policy rate was switched from the Lombard to
the repo rate. However, liquidity has grown rapidly and excess liquidity has persisted in

8
the financial system since early 2007 (Table 5). 4 Interest rates declined markedly, in part as
the government borrowing requirement dropped. The BoM was of the view that stronger
intervention to mop-up liquidity would be counterproductive in the face of significant
portfolio inflows. As a result, no repo transactions took place under the new policy rules
and rates in the interbank market remained outside the repo rate corridor, which undermined
credibility of the new monetary policy framework (Text Figure 5). In April 2008 the BoM
introduced new instruments, extended a special deposit facility, and widened the repo
corridor to 125 basis points to strengthen liquidity management. The BoM conducted
sterilized intervention in the foreign exchange market especially in late 2007 and
early 2008.

The financial system remains sound, and vulnerability indicators have
improved (Table 6 and 7). Financial soundness indicators point to a further improvement in
the quality of assets. The banking system has two broad segments—the domestic market
and the offshore/GBL sector, with the latter market dominated by the affiliates of large
international banking groups. 5 Starting in January 2008, Pillars I and II of Basel II are being
implemented, and the BoM is planning to implement a risk-based supervision model
in 2008/09. The stock exchange rose to record levels, supported by strong fundamentals.

4

The excess liquidity in part reflects the impact of an average 7-10 day settlement float for transactions
conducted through the GBL sector.
5

While GBL deposits are large (78 percent of broad money at end 2007), they are predominantly on deposit
with the “offshore” segment of the banking system. Domestic segment banks have little exposure to the GBLs.

9
Aggregate profits of listed companies increased by about 35 percent. Valuations are
consistent with international averages for emerging markets (an average P/E ratio of 14).
9.
An AML/CFT assessment, undertaken September/October 2007, found that
Mauritius had taken a number of measures to strengthen its AML/CFT system; this is
timely given the strong growth in its banking sector. The BoM supervision is relatively
advanced and has undertaken onsite AML/CFT inspections of all institutions for which it
has supervisory responsibility. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is also
developing its AML/CFT supervisory capabilities but is not as advanced as the BoM in this
regard.
10.
The authorities have continued efforts to liberalize international trade and
secure market access. An economic partnership agreement with the EU, covering goods
only, has been initialed. A free trade agreement with Pakistan was signed and an agreement
with India is under discussion. However, several parastatals have preserved import and
distribution monopolies on basic goods, and an administered price regime remains in place
for many basic goods. The system may be having a deleterious effect on inflation. 6
III. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
11.
Mauritius’s medium-term outlook has turned more favorable with the effects
of the reform effort. Economic growth is projected to remain at 5 percent through the
medium term, reflecting continued growth in tourism, services, and investment in large
projects. This may be a cautious projection given the sizable investment inflows which are
expected but implementation and absorptive capacity will be constraints. The outlook is
clouded by large errors and omissions in the balance of payments, significant structural and
policy changes in the economy, and uncertainties on the time frame and feasibility of a
number of large public and private projects (Box 2). Fiscal consolidation is expected to
proceed with moderate primary surpluses and a declining overall deficit and public debt
burden. The external current account deficit is expected to decline only moderately as large
foreign investment inflows draw in imports.
12.
The key macroeconomic challenge is to manage the recent economic success
through a broadening of structural reforms to spur economic efficiency and
consolidate and refocus fiscal policy. The large foreign investment inflows, projected to
rise to about US$1 billion per year (12 percent of 2007/08 GDP), risk overheating the
economy, especially if the fiscal deficit is not reduced further and structural reforms are not
pursued to improve the supply response. Fiscal policy should also aim to create fiscal space
for education/retraining and much needed investment in infrastructure. Monetary policy
6

Staff analysis, as explained in the selected issues paper on inflation, suggest the administered price regime has
raised the variance and skewness of the CPI and contributed to inflationary pressures.

10
needs to be strengthened further and focused on reducing inflation. Structural reforms
aimed at improving efficiency take time to bear fruit, implying that challenges posed by
large investment flows will need to be faced with fiscal and monetary policy tools.
Box 2: Impact of Large Projects on the External Current Account
A number of large public and private projects, totaling some US$12.4 billion (147.5 percent
of 2007/08 GDP), have been launched or proposed over the medium-term (Text Table 2). These
mega-projects, predominantly in the form of foreign investment, are primarily in the tourism sector
(66 percent); but also industrial parks (47 percent); infrastructure (23 percent); and other industrial
projects (11 percent).

Note: Converted at an exchange rate of Rm 30/US$.

The impact of these projects on the external current account is not easily quantifiable for lack of data,
but the magnitude will stretch the implementation and absorption capacity of the economy.
Regression analysis suggests that a 1 percentage point increase in FDI leads to a 0.34 percent increase
in imports. For every US$1 billion of investment the external current account would worsen by about
4.9 percent of GDP.

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
Policy discussions centered on the macroeconomic and structural polices that
were needed to sustain resurgent growth and enhance competitiveness. A window of
opportunity now exists to build on the recent economic success to implement a second
generation of reforms that are needed to sustain noninflationary growth.
A. Fiscal Consolidation and Refocusing
14.
The mission recommended that, building on the success of the tax reform, a
tighter fiscal policy stance be pursued over the medium term to further reduce public
debt and counterbalance the strong demand impulse from the rising foreign
investment. In particular, efforts should focus on raising expenditure efficiency and
converting the system of indirect universal subsidies on basic goods into a well targeted

11
social assistance program. The authorities indicated that they shared this assessment and
were working to implement such a strategy, starting with the introduction of fiscal
management laws on public debt management and public finance and audit, including the
implementation of program-based budgeting (PBB). The mission broadly endorsed the
authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy, as reflected in the staff projections.
15.

The mission encouraged the authorities to focus attention on:

•

Improving the efficiency of social assistance programs by consolidating and
targeting. To reduce poverty more effectively, social assistance should be aimed at
helping the working poor and the unemployed re-enter the job market. Targeting would
also introduce a countercyclical component to fiscal policy which will be increasingly
needed as Mauritius develops. The authorities indicated that work to create a social
registry, which would form the basis for targeted assistance, is underway.

•

More generally, raising the efficiency
of budgetary operations over the
medium term through the PBB
framework, supported by IMF
technical assistance, starting with
the 2008/09 budget. The mission
welcomed the public debt management
strategy which targeted a public debt
reduction from 61.3 percent of GDP to
50 percent in the medium term. The
staff noted that empirical evidence
suggested that overall public debt levels
in emerging markets should be on the
order of 30-35 percent of GDP. 7 Efforts
to reinforce the debt management unit
in the MOFED and coordination with
the BoM should be pursued. The
authorities explained that the proposed
public debt ceiling was a first step in a
longer-term debt sustainability strategy.

parastatal sector. A disengagement and divestment strategy for parastatals in the import
and distribution of basic goods would help improve economic efficiency and reduce the
size of the public sector. While some reduction in central government employment has
begun, this has been largely offset by a rise in parastatal employment, and overall public
sector employment is up some 12 percent from early in the decade (Text Figure 6). Staff
suggested the state trading firms be progressively withdrawn from commercial activities
to allow these functions to be taken over by the private sector. Initial steps could include
requirements for strict commercial cost recovery operations and the budgetization of
subsidies. The authorities agreed that parastatal reform was needed, notwithstanding the
difficulties involved. The World Bank is providing some technical support in this area.
The appointment of a commissioner to implement the new competition law would
facilitate this reform.
•

Areas requiring vigilance: A large upward adjustment of public sector wages will
follow the Pay Review Commission (PRC) decision in late May 2008. This, along with a
planned phasing out of remaining trade taxes will be a challenge to the fiscal balance.
The duty-free island initiative is intended to make Mauritius a more attractive business
destination and to encourage tourism spending. The timetable to duty free status was
suspended in 2007, but the authorities indicated their intention to implement this
initiative over the medium-term. Staff encouraged the authorities to announce a new
timetable and in the interim to further simplify the tariff structure, and consider how the
loss of import duty revenues (1.0 percent of GDP) would be offset.
B. Strengthening Monetary Policy

16.
While underlying inflation is broadly under control, staff expressed concern
that the new monetary intervention policy was not being implemented as announced
(Text Figure 7). Staff noted that while more needs to be done to reduce liquidity, rising
capital mobility has made this more difficult without support from fiscal and structural
policies. In this context, the recent appreciation of the nominal exchange rate has played a
useful role. The authorities explained that the absence of repo operations reflected concerns
not to encourage additional foreign portfolio inflows. They have attempted to address
systemic liquidity by the special deposit
facility, and efforts to make the repo rate
operational by lowering the rate, in line
with rate decreases abroad, and by
broadening the intervention corridor. The
BoM indicated that it would also rely on
the effect of declining portfolio inflows
and government steps to reduce its own
liquidity injections to bring rates back
into the corridor. The inflow of short
term portfolio investment appears to have
diminished in late 2007, following recent

turmoil in international financial markets. The mission suggested that public pension and
other funds be removed from the domestic banking system over the coming months. Staff
urged reinforced coordination between the MOFED and BoM on liquidity management,
which the authorities agreed was necessary.
17.
Staff recommended the BoM be more active in shaping public expectations of
inflation through communication of an inflation target range for monetary policy (a
soft inflation target) and actively work to achieve it. The monetary authorities indicated
that this was in process through the forthcoming semi-annual inflation and financial
stability reports.
18.
Staff welcomed the initiative to raise BoM capitalization to provide the needed
resources for an active monetary policy that could involve higher sterilization costs in
the period ahead. The BoM has also initiated steps to reinforce its governance structures,
including a revision to the central bank law to reform the membership of its board and of
the MPC and to include regular reporting to a select committee of parliament. The
responsiveness of monetary policy to rapidly changing conditions would be enhanced if the
MPC met more often. The BoM is also in the process of bolstering its analytical framework,
as recommended by the 2007 FSAP update, with IMF technical assistance.
19.
Regulations to allow for the development of a swap market are needed to help
manage inflows, develop capital markets, and support a reduction in spreads. The
large inflows of foreign exchange are becoming difficult to manage. The authorities
indicated that they were actively working with market participants on swap market
regulations.
20.
The mission’s assessment is that the current level of the rupee is broadly in line
with fundamentals (Box 3). Different econometric estimates of exchange rate alignment
suggest that the rupee was not far from equilibrium at end-2007. Should large capital
inflows persist as projected, the REER would be expected to appreciate over the medium
term, preferably through an appreciation of the nominal rate. The impact of appreciation
could be offset by further fiscal consolidation and the implementation of structural reforms
aimed at improving the supply response and reducing inflationary pressures. The authorities
reaffirmed their policy to allow the nominal exchange rate to adjust to macroeconomic
conditions and limit BoM intervention to smoothing operations.
21.
The authorities should ensure that financial institutions not currently covered
by the AML/CFT framework, such as cooperative credit unions, are brought within
the regime, and further strengthen the FSC. While the financial intelligence unit in
Mauritius has developed its operational capabilities, its overall effectiveness is hampered by
the modest number of suspicious transactions reports filed by financial institutions.

14
Box 3: External Stability and Competitiveness
An assessment of external competitiveness suggests that the Mauritian rupee is broadly in line with
economic fundamentals at end-2007. The full analysis is available in the accompanying selected
issues paper.
• Several price-based REER indices suggest that Mauritius’ competitiveness has been on an
improving trend since 1980, with particularly large gains in the last few years.
• The single-equation approach to estimating the equilibrium exchange rate reveals a negligible
gap between the Mauritian rupee and
Text Figure 8. Single Equation Approach:
its equilibrium value since 2003 (Text
Actual vs. Equilibrium REER
Figure 8). The macroeconomic
balance approach suggests that the
level of the real effective exchange
rate is broadly appropriate, as the
projected underlying current account
deficit over the medium-term is
broadly in line with a current account
norm obtained from panel regressions
for a large sample of comparator
countries. Finally, the capital
enhanced equilibrium exchange rate approach, which adds uncovered interest rate parity to
the analysis, suggests that since July 1995 the nominal exchange rate has been broadly in line
with its equilibrium rate as indicated by inflation and interest rate differentials with the US.
• An analysis of structural competitiveness indicators suggests that Mauritius ranks highly in
Africa and fares well against other comparator countries. On the 2007 Global Competitiveness
Index, Mauritius did better than other small-island economies, but was outperformed by highgrowth Asian economies. According to the 2008 World Bank Doing Business Report, Mauritius
mostly outranked comparator nations on the quality of the business environment, especially in
areas such as commerce and entrepreneurship. However, progress is needed in improving
broadband internet access and reducing telephone faults.

C. Structural Competitiveness
22.
The mission encouraged the authorities to sustain their efforts on making the
business environment conducive to private sector growth, by focusing on public
infrastructure, human capital development and trade liberalization. Structural reforms
will play a key role in the transition to a new economic structure and in ensuring sustained
competitiveness. Greater efficiency in infrastructure, notably in transportation and
communications, will be needed for Mauritius to realize its ambitions as a regional banking
and services hub. Efforts to liberalize domestic trade, where several parastatals have import
and distribution monopolies, need to be pursued along with scaling back the administered
price regime.

15
23.
Some labor market reforms have been initiated, but staff encouraged the
authorities to take further steps to upgrade the skills of the work force and increase
labor market flexibility. Every effort

D. National Statistics
24.
Staff welcomed the authorities' efforts to bring Mauritius into line with
international best practice in statistics. Coverage lacunae in the financial account of the
balance of payments and international investment position (IIP) are of particular concern as
errors and omissions continue to rise (Box 4). Staff expressed concern at delays in
conducting the surveys needed to improve the coverage of the balance of payments,
especially as regards the GBLs, in line with the 2007 Data ROSC and STA technical
assistance reports. Better data on the financial account, especially on GBL activity, will be
needed to meet the Special Data Dissemination Standard. Mauritius has good first
generation data for surveillance (national accounts, inflation), but efforts are needed on
second generation data (asset prices such as housing, capital inflows) to better assess
potential vulnerabilities of the economy. The authorities indicated that efforts on improving
national statistics would move ahead.

16
Box 4: The Financial Account and Errors and Omissions in the Balance of Payments
Rapidly growing financial flows into and through Mauritius in recent years pose a challenge for
statistical systems. Rising errors and omissions (5.2 percent of GDP in 2006/07) are largely
linked to the activities of the GBL sector. The BOM collects partial GBL data, but these are
excluded from the official balance of payments data. Official statistics capture only the foreign
assets of the commercial banks, primarily sourced from the deposits made by the GBLs from
funds raised abroad (in transition to investment destinations in third countries). To overcome
this problem and obtain a more accurate picture of Mauritius' external position, the GBL's
transactions in their assets and liabilities (with appropriate instrument detail) are needed. This
can be achieved by conducting a quarterly survey on transactions data of the GBLs.
Similarly, the IIP omits the GBLs' assets and liabilities but includes the foreign assets of the
commercial banks that are sourced from the GBLs. To address this problem, an annual survey of
positions data is needed to improve the IIP statistics. As part of this exercise, the IIP should
incorporate the results of the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), the
overwhelming part of which is assets held by GBLs. As illustrated in Text Table 4, which draws
on the CPIS, there has been a substantial run up in foreign assets since 2001. There is no similar
increase in liabilities as they are presently not captured.

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Staff commends the authorities for the reforms that have led to a revival in
growth. Investors are responding to the important tax and business environment reforms
instituted since 2006. Foreign investment is rising strongly and is projected to grow further.
However, some supply constraints are already apparent, particularly for infrastructure, but
also in the labor market, where skills shortages have emerged. The authorities need to
proceed with further fiscal consolidation and structural reform to alleviate bottlenecks and
ensure that the new growth is noninflationary and sustained. Staff welcomes the authorities’
intentions to further reduce the fiscal deficit over the medium term and the specific
measures being implemented to that effect.

17
26.
The recent tax reforms have made the system more progressive and easier to
administer, broadened the base, and are leveraging other efforts to attract foreign
investment and transform the economy. These efforts have also produced a boost in fiscal
receipts which has lowered the deficit. Staff encourages the authorities to build on recent
successes and extend the reform effort to the fiscal expenditure side and to the parastatal
sector. Improving the efficiency of social assistance programs by consolidating and
targeting are vital to this effort. Targeting would also introduce a beneficial countercyclical
component to fiscal policy. The introduction of program based budgeting is an important
component to raise spending efficiency over the medium term.
27.
Efforts to strengthen the monetary framework should be continued. While
underlying inflation is broadly under control and a significant component is imported, staff
encourages the BoM to be more active in shaping public expectations of inflation through
communication of an inflation target range for monetary policy. Greater efforts to manage
liquidity, in closer coordination with the fiscal authorities, would pay dividends. Steps to
strengthen further the BoM’s governance practices and capital base are important.
28.
Mauritius’ managed floating exchange rate regime continues to provide an
appropriate framework for macroeconomic management. The rate of the rupee appears
to be broadly in line with fundamentals. The recent appreciation reflects the increased
capital inflows into the productive sectors of the economy. While the appreciation has
presented a challenge for the exportable good sectors, it has helped dampen imported
inflation. Looking ahead, should capital inflows rise as projected, further nominal exchange
rate appreciation may be unavoidable and should be accompanied by additional fiscal
consolidation as well as structural reforms aimed at improving economic efficiency and
competitiveness.
29.
Staff underscores the important contribution that structural reform of the
parastatal sector can bring to economic efficiency and competitiveness. A
disengagement and divestment strategy for parastatals in the import and distribution of basic
goods should be pursued as should further steps to liberalize domestic trade, reduce import
duties, and phase out administered prices.
30.
Staff urges the authorities to give high priority to improving the coverage and
reliability of national statistics, especially as concerns the financial account of the
balance of payments and the IIP, in line with the 2007 Data ROSC and STA technical
assistance reports.
31.
The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Mauritius risk from external debt distress is low. While the level of public debt remains high,
it has been declining steadily in recent years and the maturity structure has improved.
The macroeconomic projection assumes sustained fiscal consolidation, with higher
growth, driven by rising foreign and domestic investment, supported by structural
reforms to improve competitiveness. Assuming no major negative shocks, GDP growth is
assumed on a long-term trend of 5.1 percent. Overall fiscal deficits will continue to decline,
driven by a broadened tax base and a rationalization of current spending. The primary
balance, which rose to a significant surplus in 2007/08 is projected to decline but remain
positive. Public investment is projected to rise to support higher growth.
A. Public Sector Debt
Under fiscal consolidation begun in 2005, public debt levels have been reduced from
their peak of over 80 percent in 2003 to 61 percent at end-2007 and to a projected 59
percent and end-June 2008. Public sector debt is projected to further decline to 47 percent
of GDP by 2012/13 (Table 1). The main contributor to debt reduction is buoyant tax revenue
driven by the major reform of 2006-07 and a rationalization of current spending. The revenue
effort is projected to recover in the medium term from the expected elimination of most
import duties in the next few year under the duty-free island initiative. Nominal interest rates
have also declined significantly. Moderate primary surpluses, averaging 0.5 percent of GDP,
are projected throughout the medium term. This fiscal profile aims at creating the fiscal space
needed for higher outlays on public infrastructure and education/retraining. The mediumterm scenario is quite resilient to stress-testing and macroeconomic shocks: if growth were 1
percent lower than projected, the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 54 percent of GDP
(Figure 1). A two standard deviation negative shock to real growth, however, would cause
public debt to increase to 78 percent of GDP by June 2013.
The maturity structure of public debt in Mauritius has improved significantly since
2000/01 (Text Figure 1). The government has been extending the maturity structure so the
share of medium and long-term debt has risen to over 50 percent of total debt. Total foreign
debt is low and has been falling in recent years, as growth recovers and, especially is
2007/08, reflecting a significant exchange rate appreciation. External debt is largely
concessional and predominantly on medium and long term maturities, and as such, is not
very vulnerable to a reduction in global liquidity and investor risk appetite.

The medium-term projection assumes that Mauritius’ external debt, which is relatively
low as a share of GDP, rises by about 1 percentage point by 2012/13 as the authorities
intend to make greater use of available multilateral financing (Table 2). The external
current account balance is expected to improve only moderately in the medium-term as large
and rising foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, notably into tourism and construction,
draw in imports. The overall balance of payments is projected to remain in surplus and
official reserves coverage is projected to rise steadily reflecting sustained capital investment
inflows. Some of the worsening of the current account in recent years reflects large one-off
items, such as purchases of aircraft (3.3 percent of GDP in 2006/07). Service exports,
especially tourism, are expected to grow strongly, reflecting the investment profile. The
textile sector has recently seen a moderate revival as it moves into higher added-value
products. Non-traditional exports, notably seafood, financial services, and information,
communication and technology have grown rapidly and are expected to continue on an
upward trajectory. The external debt exposure therefore poses limited risk.
The most important risk to this picture stems from the current size of the external
current account deficit should fiscal consolidation not materialize (Figure 2). Similarly,
adverse external developments impinging on tourism arrivals, FDI and portfolio inflows, and
service exports could materially worsen the external debt outlook, but from a low level.

X. Exchange Rate Arrangement
The currency of Mauritius is the Mauritian rupee, and the exchange rate regime is a managed
float with no pre-announced path for the exchange rate. The exchange rate is currently
determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The exchange arrangement is free of
multiple currency practices and restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions. Mauritius accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section
2(a), 3, and 4 on September 29, 1993. Mauritius also maintains a liberal capital account. On
April 29, 2008, the US$1 was equivalent to MUR 25.45.
XI. Article IV Consultation
Mauritius is on the standard 12-month cycle. The last Article IV consultation discussions

Appendix II. Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of January 29, 2008)
The Bank Group strategy and lending operations
A member of the World Bank since its independence in 1968, Mauritius is a development
success story. In 1968, the country was poor, with a nominal per capita income of about
US$260. Today, nominal income per capita is US$5,250. The country graduated from the
International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's soft-lending arm for the
poorest countries), in FY1975, and the last IDA credit was made in July 1974. In the 1980s,
the World Bank supported macroeconomic and sectoral policy reforms through quickdisbursing loans. After the success of the structural adjustment effort, the country turned to
more traditional project lending.
The World Bank's role in Mauritius is evolving, reflecting the country's past success in
gaining access to capital markets and Middle Income Country status. Because of its relatively
high income, Mauritius is one of only a few African countries eligible for International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development loans (most African countries borrow from the IDA).
The World Bank currently has one active operation – the Development Policy Lending
(DPL) series. The second DPL totaling $30 million will be considered by the Bank’s Board
in February and will support measures in the country’s economic restructuring and reform
efforts. It has been agreed with the Government that in total the DPL series will comprise six
annual loans, the focus of each being agreed annual the DPL series will total six annual
loans the focus of each being agreed annual to reflect the country’s evolving development
priorities.
The World Bank is also preparing two other project loans – one for the transport sector and
the other to support parastatal sector and investment climate reforms. The Government has
been explicit in its request for a careful balance between general budget support, which does
not provide technical assistance, and investment lending which provides technical assistance
to help maintain the momentum for reform and build capacity to implement reforms in key
areas.
The Bank also supports the government of Mauritius through analytical and advisory
assistance. The Bank carried out an Investment Climate Assessment in 2005/2006 which the
country put to good use by incorporating most of the recommendations in a new Business
Facilitation Act. Currently the Bank is engaged in a policy dialogue on Doing Business
reforms and is providing technical assistance in the preparation of several sector strategies
for the program based budget.
The World Bank’s current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) runs from FY07–13. The CPS
is based on three guiding principles: (i) alignment with the Government Program; (ii)

6
flexibility; and (iii) harmonization. It has been developed in close collaboration with the
Government of Mauritius and the European Union to ensure that it responds to the country’s
emerging needs, and reflects a coherent approach by Mauritius’ major development partners.
The CPS builds on lessons learned from previous Bank experience in Mauritius and on the
flexible approaches developed elsewhere in the Bank for Middle-Income Countries. It is
grounded in the Bank’s recognition that it needs to adapt its business model to Mauritius’
development agenda, and the Government’s recognition that the Bank brings much more
than financial resources to the table.
The International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) main focus for future activity in Mauritius is
support for advisory work and investments in private infrastructure. IFC is also actively
seeking projects with Mauritian sponsors investing elsewhere in Africa. In 2007, IFC
negotiated an advisory mandate for structuring private participation in the ports sector. IFC
has committed no new investments since 1996; the portfolio has steadily decreased as
investments have been repaid and/or exited and now consists of two equity positions for a
total of US$1 million.
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has been actively supporting
Mauritian investors venturing abroad, particularly into sub-Saharan Africa. The agency is
working to further strengthen relations with the local business community, creating synergies
that will continue to support development into the Southern African Development
Community region and other regions of Africa. For the second year running, the Board of
Investment (BoI) office has supported and facilitated MIGA’s missions to Mauritius. These
missions have firmly put MIGA as a value adding institution to cross-border investors to and
from Mauritius. The BoI continues to identify investors with the potential to use MIGA
services. Mauritian investors have benefited substantially in recent years from MIGA
guarantees for their investments in continental Africa and elsewhere, with total gross
exposure currently greater than US$53.1 million for projects in Africa and South Asia.
Mauritius is not an active participant in World Bank Institute programs, but discussions are
under way to help position the country as a global knowledge hub.

IMF-World Bank collaboration in specific areas
IMF and World Bank staffs have traditionally collaborated closely and this has been
reinforced by the Government’s request that all Development Partners harmonize and
coordinate their support. Since 2001 the Bank had been involved with budget modernization
and implementation of a Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Program Based
Budgeting (METF/PBB), but more recently the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department has taken
the lead. However, MTEF/PBB implementation remains a focus area of the DPL. In
addition, the World Bank and IMF jointly prepared a Financial Sector Assessment Program

7
(FSAP) update in 2007 and are now collaborating on a follow-on Financial Sector Action
Plan.
Areas in which the World Bank leads
World Bank support is demand driven. Areas where it has taken the lead are related to
specific sector advice, such as the tourism, lands and housing, infrastructure, and investment
climate and parastatal sector reforms and through a number of analytical studies as described
above, including an ongoing investment climate assessment.
Areas in which the IMF leads
Areas where the IMF takes the lead role relate to policy advice and reforms with respect to
(i) overall economic policy advice and targets for macroeconomic targets; (ii) tax policy and
administration; (iii) budgetary procedures (MTEF/PBB); (iv) treasury procedures; (v) public
sector wage policy; and (vi) monetary management and exchange rate policy. The Bank team
actively participates in discussions between the IMF and the government in these areas,
however, especially with respect to the setting of overall macroeconomic targets.

Appendix III. Relations with the African Development Bank Group
(As of January 1, 2008)

Assistance from the African Development Bank (ADB) to Mauritius combines lending and
non-lending activities. Lending has focused on infrastructure development in agriculture and
transportation and non-lending on economic and sector work (ESW) in health, poverty
reduction, and debt management. Under the NEPAD Program, ADB has collaborated with
the UNDP, AU, and ECA on the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), for which
Mauritius is one of the four pilot cases. An ADB study on poverty, gender, and social
exclusion is also under preparation and is being coordinated with the EU and the UNDP. Past
collaboration with the World Bank (and other partners) includes water, sewerage, and
sanitation (the Plaines Wilhems Sewerage Project) and transport (Southeastern Highway). A
close working relationship has developed between the two institutions during the preparation
and appraisal of the first and second Development Policy Loans.

Appendix IV. Statistical Issues
Data provided to the Fund are, in general, adequate for surveillance. Efforts are under way to
improve the frequency and quality of fiscal data, particularly their consistency with monetary
data. The authorities publish economic data including in a monthly bulletin published by the
Bank of Mauritius (BOM) and a number of reports published by the Central Statistics Office
(CSO), which are accessible on the Internet. The country started participating in the IMF’s
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in September 2000. As one of 22 countries
participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) Project for
Anglophone African Countries, it has undertaken to use the GDDS as a framework for the
development of its national statistical system. The country is participating in the SDDS and
the external sector modules of the Anglophone Africa project (funded by the U.K.
Department for International Development (DFID)). This project aims to assist participating
countries to implement plans for improvement identified in the metadata. In December 2007,
a Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was prepared, to assess the
quality of macroeconomic statistics based on the Data Quality Assessment Framework
(DQAF). The report found that the quality of the macroeconomic statistics in Mauritius has
improved significantly since the previous assessment, conducted in 2001. It is expected that
Mauritius will be in a position to subscribe to the SDDS towards the end of 2008.
Real sector
National accounts are based on the concepts and definitions recommended by the System of
National Accounts 1993. Data are prepared by the CSO on a calendar-year basis and cover
all transactions categories except financial transactions. Estimates of GDP on the basis of
production use the ratios from the Census of Economic Activities (CEA). Following the 2002
CEA, a major revision of the national accounts was undertaken and completed in September
2005. Some government operations and transactions with the rest of the world are recorded
on a cash basis rather than on an accrual basis. Different accounting years of units and
insufficient data on changes in inventories hamper accuracy. Other deviations from
international standards include outdated coefficients in agriculture, single deflation of value
added in some activities, no volume measures for changes in inventories, a base year for
QNA more than five years old and direct deflation of VAT and import duties. Expenditure
GDP aggregates are compiled independently, except for changes in inventories.
The consumer price index is regularly rebased (every five years) as consumption patterns and
relative prices change. A new series of the consumer price index with July 2006-June 2007
as base period, and weights derived from the 2006/07 household budget survey was released
in October 2007. The index broadly follows international practices. Producer price indices
(PPI) of agriculture and manufacturing, input costs of construction, the wage rate, and
employment have been developed, but are not reported to the IMF for publication in its

10
International Financial Statistics (IFS). The PPIs are monthly indices but are disseminated
on a quarterly basis following a quarterly price collection. The current PPIs have 2003 as the
base year, which is planned for update on a five-year basis.
Government finance
The definition, scope, and classification/sectorization of general government agencies and
their transactions are in line with international standards.. Source data for the compilation of
statistics for the general government are not timely enough to meet SDDS timelines
requirements. Although the authorities produce quarterly GFS data for budgetary central
government, they do not report these for publication in IFS. However, they report data on the
consolidated general government and its sub-sectors for publication in the Government
Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook. The authorities will soon finalize a revised chart of
account that is based on the classifications used in the GFSM 2001 framework. This
improvement will significantly enhance the availability of detailed fiscal data.
Monetary accounts
The authorities report money and banking statistics on a timely and regular basis. The
analytical framework used for compiling monetary and financial statistics is based on the
2000 Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The Depository Corporations Survey (DCS)
is a consolidation of the accounts of the BOM and other depository corporations, which
comprise banks and nonbank deposit taking institutions. In addition to the monthly
depository corporations survey, its two component surveys, the Central Bank Survey and the
Other Depository Corporations Survey are also disseminated, along with the underlying
sectoral balance sheets for the central bank and for the other depository corporations. The
M1 and M2 monetary aggregates are derived from the Depository Corporations Survey,
adjusted for the deposits of Global Business Licence Holders, but some nonbank depository
corporations are excluded. The November 2007 data ROSC mission recommended that the
authorities conduct a survey of the mutual funds to ascertain whether they issue close
substitutes for deposits and, therefore, qualify for the inclusion in monetary statistics as
depository corporations. Also, the mission noted that the National Pension Fund is
incorrectly sectorized as financial corporation rather than as part of the central government.

Balance of payments
The country provides quarterly balance of payments (BOP) and international investment
position (IIP) data to the IMF's Statistics Department on the basis of the classification system
of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. The quality of balance of payments
statistics has deteriorated somewhat as a consequence of the liberalization of the economy,
and the growth of global business license holders (GBLs). Notably, there has been a sharp

11
increase in net errors and omissions in the BOP, and the IIP has a major undercount of
liabilities, giving an unreliable indication of a net asset position. Transactions of offshore
financial institutions with the rest of the world are only partially covered. Recent technical
assistance and data ROSC missions have recommended that more emphasis be placed on
surveys, rather than the relying on the bank report forms of transactions between residents
and nonresidents. The authorities launched an enterprise survey at the end of 2007, the
results of which are not yet available. This survey does not cover GBLs, and the authorities
have yet to make a decision on how to collect data on GBLs’ assets and liabilities. The IIP
and external debt data are not fully consistent with the balance of payments statistics.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 2, 2008
1. The following information has become available since the issuance of the staff report.
The thrust of the staff appraisal remains broadly unchanged.
2. The proposed 2008-09 budget is more expansionary than anticipated. The large
(37 percent) wage increase for public sector employees recommended by the
independent Pay Review Board will be fully implemented from July 1, 2008 rather
than phased-in over two years as assumed in the profile presented in the staff report.
The wage bill and overall fiscal stance are correspondingly about 0.4 percent of GDP
higher for 2008/09. As expected, import tariffs were further reduced, largely on food,
household items, and clothing. Notwithstanding a looser than expected fiscal stance
for 2008/09, the fiscal impulse remains contractionary. The budget includes a strong
emphasis on public infrastructure investment and on education. The medium-term
outlook remains broadly unchanged.
3. In the context of strong private sector demand staff expects greater inflationary
pressures and higher imports in 2008/09 than described in the staff report. The
Bank of Mauritius will need to remain vigilant in the period ahead as inflation crept
up to 9.9 percent at end May and the nominal exchange rate reversed its strong
appreciating trend against the US dollar. The unemployment rate dropped further to
8.2 percent in the first quarter of 2008.
4. The above indicates that the authorities will need to remain vigilant against
inflationary pressures. The higher-than-expected wage bill in the 2008/09 budget
will place a greater burden on monetary policy to contain demand pressures.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 15, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Mauritius
On July 2, 2008 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Mauritius.1
Background
Economic growth is responding to structural reform efforts. Tax reform, together with
improvements in the business environment and investment initiatives, has spurred foreign
investment to unprecedented levels and accelerated growth. Growth, projected at 6½7 percent in 2007/08 (fiscal year ending June 2008), is broad based but especially strong in
tourism, banking, construction, and services. Rising fiscal receipts and expenditure
containment have cut the deficit and public sector debt is continuing to decline. The external
current account deficit has eased but remains high on investment-driven import growth. The
exchange rate appreciated 17 percent in real effective terms in the 12 months ending
February 2008 from an overly depreciated level in 2005-06. However, the economy is facing
rising labor, infrastructure, and other bottlenecks, as well as strong head winds from
international commodity price rises. Although an appreciation of the exchange rate has
dampened some of the inflationary pressures, inflation remains a concern. The central bank
(BoM) has accumulated reserves, which are projected to reach 6½ months of imports by
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
end 2007/08. However, the large and rising errors and omissions items in the balance of
payments cloud the external sector analysis.
The overall fiscal position has improved as revenues have risen strongly in response to tax
reforms and expenditure has been contained. Tax reform has made the tax regime more
progressive, easier to administer, and broadened the base. On the expenditure side, debt
service has declined in line with falling interest rates, but capital expenditure is under-target
owing to implementation difficulties. The authorities have introduced fiscal management laws
which will contribute to better fiscal performance.
Monetary policy is being strengthened to improve transparency and effectiveness. However,
liquidity has been growing rapidly and excess liquidity has persisted in the financial system
since early 2007. Interest rates have declined markedly as the government borrowing
requirement has dropped. In April 2008 the BoM introduced new instruments, extended a
special deposit facility, and widened the repo corridor in an attempt to strengthen liquidity
management. The BoM has conducted sterilized intervention in the foreign exchange market
to limit the nominal appreciation of the rupee.
The banking sector and financial system remain relatively sound and vulnerability indicators
have improved. Financial soundness indicators point to a further improvement in the quality of
assets as evidenced by the decline in the nonperforming loans ratio. The banking system is
well capitalized. The stock exchange outperformed most emerging markets in 2007, pushing
the index to record levels, supported by strong fundamentals.
The authorities have continued efforts to liberalize international trade and secure market
access. A partnership agreement with the EU has been initiated. A free trade agreement with
Pakistan was signed and an agreement with India is under discussion. However, several
parastatals maintain import and distribution monopolies on basic goods, and an administered
price regime remains in place for many basic goods.
Mauritius’ medium-term outlook has turned more favorable with the effects of the reform effort.
Economic growth is projected to remain at about 5 percent through the medium-term,
reflecting continued growth in tourism, services, and investment in large projects. Fiscal
consolidation is expected to proceed with moderate primary surpluses and a declining overall
deficit and public debt burden. The external current account deficit is expected to decline only
moderately as large foreign investment inflows draw in imports. The key macroeconomic
challenge is to manage the recent economic success through a broadening of structural
reforms to spur economic efficiency and consolidate and refocus fiscal policy.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed the revived
performance of the Mauritius economy, spurred by the important tax and business
environment reforms adopted since 2006 that have contributed to reduced fiscal deficits and

3
rising foreign direct investment. Directors noted, however, that the large capital inflows have
added to demand pressures, and inflation remains high, reflecting also rising international
commodity prices and emerging supply constraints. Against this background, Directors
encouraged the authorities to proceed with their plans for further fiscal consolidation and
deeper structural reforms in order to alleviate bottlenecks and ensure sustained noninflationary
growth.
Directors underscored the importance of continued fiscal consolidation to underpin
macroeconomic stability. They noted that the recent tax reforms have made the tax system
more progressive and easier to administer, while boosting fiscal receipts. Directors
encouraged the authorities to build on these successes, and to extend the reform effort to the
expenditure side of the budget and to the parastatal sector. Improving the efficiency of social
assistance programs by consolidating and targeting will be vital to further strengthening the
fiscal position. More generally, Directors considered that the introduction of program-based
budgeting in the 2008/09 (July/June) budget will serve to strengthen spending efficiency over
the medium term. They also welcomed the authorities’ plans to introduce fiscal management
laws on public debt management and public finance and audit. Directors expressed concern,
however, that the sizable public sector wage increase in the 2008/09 budget, in the context of
strong private sector demand, would contribute to further inflationary pressures.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to strengthen the monetary
framework. While underlying inflation remains broadly under control and a significant
component is imported, Directors advised the authorities to remain vigilant against inflation, in
light of increasing demand pressures. Communication by the Bank of Mauritius (BoM) of an
inflation target range for monetary policy would help shape inflation expectations more
actively. Greater efforts to manage liquidity, in closer coordination with the fiscal authorities,
will also pay dividends. Directors welcomed steps to strengthen further the BoM’s capital base
and governance structures.
Directors were of the view that Mauritius’s managed floating exchange rate regime provides an
appropriate framework for macroeconomic management. They noted the staff assessment that
the real effective exchange rate of the rupee appears broadly in line with fundamentals. The
nominal appreciation of the rupee in 2007–08, from a depreciated level in 2005–06, reflected
increased capital inflows and was helpful in dampening inflation. Directors noted that the staff’s
view that, should capital inflows rise as projected, further real exchange rate appreciation may
be unavoidable, and should occur preferably through nominal appreciation. This should be
accompanied by additional fiscal consolidation as well as structural reforms aimed at
improving economic efficiency and competitiveness.
In the area of structural reform, Directors supported a disengagement and divestment strategy
for parastatals in the importation and distribution of basic goods. Further steps are also

4
needed to upgrade workforce skills and enhance labor market flexibility, liberalize domestic
trade, reduce import duties, and phase out administered prices.
Improving the coverage and reliability of national statistics is a high priority, especially with
regard to the financial account of the balance of payments and the international investment
position, in line with previous recommendations.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Mauritius will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Mauritius
July 2, 2008
I – Introduction
At the outset I would like to express my Mauritian authorities’ appreciation to the staff for
the constructive discussions held during the Article IV consultation reflected in the staff
report and for the comprehensive selected issues papers on external competitiveness and
inflation. My authorities also appreciate the policy advice and technical assistance they
continue to benefit from the Fund and the constant support received from Management and
the Executive Board. They are in broad agreement with staff’ analysis and recommendations
and remain determined to address the challenges facing the country including by further
strengthening the implementation of structural reforms meant to sustain higher and durable
economic growth.
In a context of loss of preferential access to the European market for the textile and sugar
industries, Mauritius has embarked on broad-based reforms since 2006 with a view to
diversify the economy and create a business environment conducive to private sector
development. These reforms have led to the liberalization of trade and investment, reduction
of taxes, lifting of some price controls and to the strengthening of the fiscal consolidation
strategy as well as the monetary policy. My Mauritian authorities are cognizant of the need to
pursue their efforts in order to further improve flexibility in the labor market, enhance
reforms in the public enterprise sector, develop infrastructure and reduce inflationary
pressures. The authorities’ commitment to address these challenges was reiterated by the
Deputy Prime Minister during the discussions he had with Management and Staff during his
visit to the Fund last May.
II – Recent Macroeconomic Developments
In 2007/08, macroeconomic performance has been impressive despite the increase in the
world prices of oil and food. Economic growth has positively responded to improvements in
the business climate and investment initiatives. Economic growth accelerated to 6.5-7.0
percent boosted by strong developments in the tourism, banking, construction sectors and
services. Newly emerging service sectors in particular the Global Business License (GBL)
information, communication and technology (ITC) sectors, as well as the newly restructured
textile sector have also significantly contributed to this growth. In order to further accelerate
the growth rate, the authorities are aware of the need to speed up their efforts to address the
supply-side constraints and inefficiencies through the increase of investments in
infrastructure and training of the labor force. The fiscal deficit and the public debt have
declined while inflation although high due to the surge in world prices of food and energy is
on the declining trend.
In response to reforms implemented in the tax area notably the strengthening of the tax
administration, the broadening of the tax base and the introduction of a single flat tax rate on

2
personal and corporate income, revenue has strongly increased. Public expenditure has been
contained though capital spending could not meet the targets due to implementation
difficulties. As a result, not only a primary surplus estimated at 1.7 percent was recorded but
also the public sector debt fell significantly. The overall deficit is projected to decline to
about 3.0 percent of GDP. In addition, the debt sustainability outlook for Mauritius has
improved as well documented by staff in the debt sustainability paper.
Mauritius is attracting significant capital inflows notably foreign direct investments and
portfolio investment. The authorities are mindful that these inflows may add pressures on the
nominal exchange rate. In this regard, they are actively working with all concerned
stakeholders to put in place appropriate regulations with a view to strengthen the
development of the capital markets and the management of the large inflows of foreign
exchange. The accumulation of international reserves by the Bank of Mauritius is projected
to reach more than 6 months of imports by end-2007/08 despite the high increase of the
import bill due to the sharp surge in the world petroleum products and food prices which was
not fully compensated by the increase of services exports.
In their efforts to pursue the implementation of more market-oriented policies, my Mauritian
authorities have established in March 2007 a monetary policy committee to improve
transparency and effectiveness in the monetary area. As for the financial sector which
remains sound and profitable, pillars I and II of Basle II principles have been also
implemented. Furthermore, following the assessment of an AML/CFT in 2007, the
authorities have taken a number of measures to further enhance the AML/CFT system.
Going forward, the authorities remain fully committed to fiscal consolidation and sound
budgetary process. They will speed up their efforts in addressing the key macroeconomic
challenges through broadening and deepening structural reforms in order to consolidate the
recent economic success and, improve the supply response and further sustain higher
economic growth.
III – Policies and Reforms for 2008/09
The Mauritian authorities intend to take full advantage of the great opportunity created by
their recent economic success in order to continue their reform agenda and achieve a durable
non inflationary growth. To this end, fiscal consolidation, strengthening monetary policy and
improving competitiveness remain at the center of their efforts over the period ahead.
Fiscal Consolidation
In this area, authorities’ strategy will continue to be focused on reducing public sector debt,
raising expenditure efficiency and converting the system of indirect universal subsidies into a
well-targeted social assistance program. Efficiency of budgetary operations will be raised
through the implementation of the 2008/09 program-based budgeting with the support from
the IMF. Efforts to reinforce the debt management unit will be pursued through an adoption
of ceiling on public debt and an enhanced coordination between the ministry of finance and
the central bank. The social assistance program aims at helping the working poor and the

3
unemployed to meet the job market requirements. With regard to the parastatal sector, the
authorities agreed on the need to reform the sector with the technical support from the World
Bank. In order to identify potential difficulties and implement the newly adopted competition
law, they have appointed a commissioner. In addition, it is important to note that the
authorities intend to adjust the wages in the public sector following the decision of the Pay
Review Commission.
Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Issues
The Bank of Mauritius will continue to strengthen its monetary policy framework with a
view to address inflationary pressures while improving transparency and effectiveness. The
authorities concur with staff that the current level of the rupee is in line with fundamentals.
While the underlining inflation is broadly under control the authorities are cognizant that the
liquidity management needs to be further enhanced in a close coordinated manner between
the ministry of finance and the Bank of Mauritius. In this regard, they have introduced the
special deposit facility and made the repo rate operational by lowering its rate and by
broadening the intervention corridor. In addition they have raised the capitalization of the
Bank of Mauritius to provide needed resources for an active monetary policy.
In order to reinforce the governance of the central bank, important steps have been initiated
covering the membership of its board and the monetary policy committee and introducing a
regular reporting to a selected committee of parliament. The bank’s communication strategy
on its monetary policy will be improved by publishing semi-annual inflation and financial
stability reports. With regard to the exchange rate, the authorities are committed to allow the
nominal exchange rate to adjust to macroeconomic conditions and limit the Bank of
Mauritius’ interventions to smoothing operations. The financial sector remains sound in spite
of the macroeconomic shocks to the economy over the recent years. The authorities are
determined to implement the 2007 FSAP update recommendations with the Fund technical
assistance. They are also determined to develop the operational capabilities of the financial
intelligence unit and the financial services commission in order to ensure that all financial
institutions are covered by the AML/CFT framework given the importance of capital inflows
directed to the country.
Structural Reforms and Competitiveness
In order to further improve the business environment conducive to private sector growth and
realize Mauritius’ objectives as a regional banking and services hub, the authorities are
committed to focus on public infrastructure development, human resources promotion and
trade liberalization including the phase out of administrated prices. Structural reforms will be
pursued through domestic trade liberalization, upgrading the skills of the labor force and
increasing the flexibility of the labor market as well as deregulating further the
telecommunication sector. Mauritius’ ranks in the 2007 Global Competitiveness Index and
the 2008 World Bank Doing Business Report are encouraging. The authorities will enhance
this achievement and speed up their efforts to further improve the economic efficiency and
the quality of the business environment.

4
Debt Sustainability Analysis
My Mauritian authorities welcome the analysis and recommendations made by the staff
under the DSA. It is worth noting that the risk from external debt distress is low and in recent
years the level of public debt has declined and its maturity structure has also been improving.
The authorities are committed to pursue their fiscal consolidation strategy and make greater
use of available multilateral financing in order to further improve the external current
account and preserve the debt sustainability. Efforts towards increasing non-traditional
exports together with rising of foreign direct investments and the revival of textile exports
will be pursued to help increase official reserves and maintain the overall balance of
payments in surplus.
Statistics Issues
Efforts to bring Mauritius in line with international best practices in statistics will be pursued.
The authorities welcome the 2007 Data ROSC and highly value the technical assistance
provided by IMF Statistics Department. In this regard, IMF recommendations made by IMF
technical assistance will be fully implemented with a view to improve national statistics
including data and coverage related to balance of payments and also meet the Special Data
Dissemination Standard.
IV – Conclusion
My Mauritian authorities highly appreciate the quality of their continued policy dialogue and
cooperation with the Fund. They are determined to continue to work closely with the Fund
and the international community in their ongoing efforts to deepen and broaden the
implementation of their structural reforms in order to diversify the source of economic
growth and alleviate poverty.
