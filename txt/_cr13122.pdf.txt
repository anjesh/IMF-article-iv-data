STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 18, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: The global financial crisis has put an end to the tax and bank secrecy model
around which San Marino built its substantial wealth, bringing about a large outflow of
non-resident deposits and a sharp (and ongoing) economic contraction. While San
Marino managed to avoid a full blown crisis thanks to buffers accumulated during good
times, it is confronting sizable financial and fiscal challenges while trying to reinvent
itself on a more open and transparent basis.
Financial Sector: System-wide deposit outflows have abated and liquidity buffers are
being rebuilt. However, the largest bank, CRSM, remains undercapitalized. If the State
has to shoulder sizable additional recapitalization costs, it should dilute shareholders
commensurately and take control of the bank’s management and board.
Fiscal Policy: San Marino’s inherent vulnerabilities and potentially large contingent
liabilities from the banking system call for a rebuilding of fiscal buffers, which will
require significant fiscal consolidation over the medium term. In this context, the
planned tax reform and expenditure review need to target more ambitious savings.
Structural Issues: The key structural challenge is to develop new growth sectors. Fully
normalizing relations with Italy will be an important pre-condition, but replacing lost
activities will also require the acquisition of new skills and, outside of banking, a
significant improvement in cost competitiveness. Planned labor market reforms should
help in this regard.
Previous IMF advice: The authorities have followed Fund advice to recapitalize CRSM,
but they did not impose strong conditionality on existing shareholders as had been
counseled. In line with past Fund recommendations: (i) measures are planned to
strengthen the tax revenue base; (ii) further steps have been taken to improve openness
and transparency; and (iii) forthcoming reforms aim to make the labor market more
flexible and efficient.

GENERAL CONTEXT
1.
The global financial crisis put an end to San Marino’s growth model. San Marino had,
for many years, built its substantial wealth on the premise of bank and tax secrecy. In the process, it
acquired the typical characteristics of small tax havens, notably a very high GDP per capita of some
€60,000 and an outsized financial sector, with assets over nine times GDP in 2008. But the global
financial crisis put an end to this model, notably via actions taken by Italy:

Italy included San Marino on its tax black list, effectively imposing stringent reporting
requirements on Italian companies doing business with San Marino. The Bank of Italy also increased
reporting requirements on financial institutions dealing with San Marino.


In 2009–10, Italy introduced tax amnesties aimed at repatriating capital hidden abroad.

2.
These developments, coupled

transparent. The balance sheet
compression in the financial sector has significantly exceeded that of other countries undergoing
deleveraging. Outside of banking, the manufacturing sector, already coping with low demand from
abroad, began to cave under the de facto isolation imposed by Italy’s black list. These combined
shocks led to a deep economic contraction, with GDP falling by a cumulative 28 percent since 2007.
3.
Adding to these problems, the largest bank made serious losses on its investments
abroad. Cassa di Risparmio della Repubblica di San Marino (CRSM), whose assets accounted for
37 percent of total system assets and for 240 percent of GDP in 2008, bought into the Italian Delta
group about a decade ago, and subsequently extended loans to Delta and its affiliates both directly
and through complex arrangements involving third parties. In 2009, Delta was intervened by the
Italian authorities due to unauthorized activities carried out by CRSM in Italy via Delta, and then
placed under a debt restructuring plan. The full extent of CRSM’s losses is yet to be ascertained, as
the Delta special administrator only reached agreement with the bank’s many creditors in
December. But, as discussed below, the losses have left CRSM severely undercapitalized even in an

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

optimistic loss scenario. CRSM also had to be lent over €300 million in emergency liquidity support
by the central bank and other Sammarinese banks in 2010.
4.
Despite these massive shocks, San Marino managed to avoid a crisis thanks to the
buffers built during good times. CRSM’s involvement in Delta notwithstanding, Sammarinese
banks had prudently invested their non-resident deposits in relatively safe and liquid Italian
securities. This allowed them to meet the large deposit outflows despite the central bank’s limited
lender-of-last-resort capabilities.1 The central bank also played a key role in preserving financial
stability, notably by quickly and effectively intervening some small institutions in difficulty. On the
fiscal front, the country’s long history of budget surpluses meant that the large decline in tax
revenues only translated into relatively modest deficits (about 3 percent of GDP in 2012); also, San
Marino had accumulated some 15 percent of GDP in fiscal reserves before the crisis, which allowed
the country to finance these deficits without borrowing much.
5.
Recent indicators suggest the economy continues to contract. GDP is expected to have
fallen by 4 percent in 2012, with the decline led by tourism, banking, and construction.
Manufacturing activity fared a bit better, though it still contracted by about 1─2 percent. The
unemployment rate is now at 8.1 percent versus 6.8 percent at end 2011, but this understates the
sharp decline in employment over the last year notably among qualified non-residents, with the
largest declines in financial services (-7.1 percent) and manufacturing (-3.8 percent). Staff expect a
GDP decline of similar magnitude (3½ percent) for 2013. This is because external demand, including
tourism, will be weak as long as Italy remains in recession, while more Sammarinese businesses will
face difficulties as a result of the black list.
6.
Risks to the short-term outlook are clearly on the downside (see Appendix I). San
Marino’s economy would suffer if financial turbulence were to again grip the eurozone, notably via
lower demand for Sammarinese products and lower tourism revenues. This would be particularly
true if financial market pressures were acute in Italy. Looking at domestic risks, prompt and effective
recapitalization of CRSM (see below) will be important to preserve confidence in the financial
system.
7.
The medium-term outlook is very
uncertain, as San Marino is in search of new
growth engines. There is a recognition across all
key stakeholders that San Marino needs to turn the
page on its past, embracing greater transparency
and openness. There have been, in fact, good
strides made in this regard. But what will be the
country’s comparative advantage in the absence of
tax and bank secrecy? This remains very much an

open question, related to which is the viable size of the banking sector (see section C). The timing of
full normalization of relations with Italy, a necessary but not sufficient condition for robust growth,
represents an additional unknown. In this context, significant two-sided uncertainty surrounds staff
forecasts of 1─1½ percent medium-term growth. Regardless, much of the 30 percent GDP loss in
recent years appears to be permanent, largely representing activities related to tax and bank secrecy
which are unlikely to return.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Financial Sector
CRSM
8.
The process of CRSM recapitalization is ongoing. Over the last year, the bank’s
shareholders─a charitable foundation with roots dating to the 19th century─contributed
€20 million of new equity capital by converting deposits they had at the bank, and obtained
€60 million via a loan from the government which they proceeded to inject as their own capital.
More recently, the bank issued €40 million in subordinated debt to institutional investors,
€35 million of which were subscribed by the (public) social security fund, which converted deposits
to finance the operation.
9.
The State has contributed most of the recapitalization funds so far, but without
diluting existing shareholders. Given the bank’s systemic importance within the financial system
and the economy at large, and considering the shareholders’ limited means, it was crucial that the
State step in to recapitalize the bank. However, staff observed that the modalities followed have not
respected best practice. The government has directly or indirectly contributed €95 million out of the
€120 million in recapitalization funds so far, yet existing shareholders have not been diluted at all,
and they retain majority control of the bank’s board of directors. As things stand, shareholders have
full claim to any potential future profit, but the State has assumed most of the downside risk of the
operation. The current governance also does not provide strong incentives for a proper
restructuring of the bank, so as to return it to profitability expeditiously.
10.
Despite the recent injections, more capital will be needed. The full extent of CRSM’s
losses on its Delta investment is yet to be ascertained. The bank has so far written off some
€600 million in equity and loan losses related to Delta, but more is expected. Following the
agreement reached between the Delta special commissioner and Delta’s creditors in December,
CRSM should start receiving in May the remaining assets currently immobilized in Italy. It is only
then that CRSM will be able to assess the full extent of losses. Still, loss estimates prepared by
CRSM’s auditors and the Delta special commissioner―the latter with direct knowledge of the
underlying assets―indicate that the bank will require additional capital in order to comply with
minimum prudential requirements. Early recapitalization would help safeguard financial stability and
support confidence and overall economic prospects.

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

11.
The State should stand ready to provide this additional capital. Ideally, the additional
capital would be provided by reputable private investors, but this looks unlikely at this stage: the
existing shareholders have provided very little fresh capital so far, while other private investors
would likely be deterred because of uncertainty over the scale of the losses. Other avenues currently
being considered to recapitalize the bank have important shortcomings: (i) a recent law allowing
banks to claim tax credits for past losses carried forward, while reasonable on principle, would not
provide CRSM with real capital at a time when the bank is not making any profits and hence not
paying any taxes; (ii) plans to issue subordinated debt to retail investors would not be desirable, as
they could make the State the ultimate bearer of risk without giving it a claim on the upside risk.
Given these considerations, the State will likely need to assume the brunt of future recapitalization,
but staff advised that it do so imposing stronger conditionality than in the past. In particular, the
State should obtain a share in the bank’s equity commensurate to its participation in the
recapitalization; it should also nominate the bank’s top management as well as a majority of
executive board directors, given that it will have contributed the bulk of the recapitalization funds.
Legal provisions that protect the foundation’s majority stake in the bank should be overturned.
12.
The State has the fiscal space to take on the recapitalization. This is because debt is
currently low at 20 percent of GDP, although it could rise to 40 percent over the medium term
excluding recapitalization costs unless fiscal consolidation is enacted. Moreover, staff proposed that
part or all of the recapitalization could happen via a government bond directly subscribed by CRSM
in exchange for common equity, obviating the need to actually borrow the funds. Given that San
Marino lacks bonds that can be used as a benchmark or a market to trade government securities,
recapitalization via bond issuance to the bank would have to pay close attention to the following
parameters: (i) setting the right interest rate, ideally mimicking the current cost of funding of the
banks; (ii) setting the right maturity, to avoid immobilizing a large part of CRSM’s balance sheet with
a security that cannot be redeemed for a long period; (iii) and deciding whether this bond can be
repoed at the central bank, should CRSM need liquidity.
13.
Design and implementation of a comprehensive restructuring plan will be needed to
return CRSM to profitability. As it stands, the current restructuring plan consists mostly of a set of
cash flow and balance sheet projections for a variety of scenarios. In addition to these projections,
staff noted that the plan needs to lay out in detail the operational measures that will be undertaken
to turn CRSM around, based on realistic assumptions about what can and cannot be implemented
given available resources. Proper benchmarking of the bank with relevant competitors should also
be part of the plan. It is imperative to return CRSM to profitability expeditiously, for the ultimate
goal of any State investment in the bank should be to resell the restructured operation to the
private sector within a reasonable period of time.
14.
The authorities agreed that the bank needs more capital, and emphasized that all
efforts will continue to be made to preserve CRSM, protect its depositors, and return the bank
to profitability expeditiously. They stated that any estimate of losses is speculative at this stage,
given that only the Delta commissioner has detailed knowledge of the assets. Still, they
acknowledged that, under realistic assumptions, the bank will need more capital which they stand

ready to provide, aided by the low level of public debt. They will consider the possibility of
recapitalizing the bank via direct issuance of bonds, emphasizing the importance of a market based
approach when setting the bond’s parameters. Regarding the modalities of the recapitalization, the
authorities acknowledged that while the steps they have taken so far may not have been fully in line
with best practice, their priority was to preserve confidence, which has been achieved. Going
forward, they concurred that legal provisions protecting the foundation’s majority stake should be
removed, and will consider the possibility of diluting existing shareholders as well as taking control
of the bank’s management and board. Finally, the authorities have requested that the bank shore up
its restructuring plan, so that it maps out in detail the operational changes to be taken to return the
bank to profitability.

construction sector is particularly affected.
The severe correction in residential and commercial real estate is also causing losses in some nonbank financial firms. Assets in these firms are only slightly more than 10 percent of financial system
assets, but they still account for more than 50 percent of GDP.
16.
Low profitability could hamper provisioning against losses. Profits before provisions
were about €20 million in the first half of 2012 (no full 2012 data yet), compared with some
€60 million in the first half of 2010 and €165 million in (full year) 2007. The provisioning ratio
currently stands at some 52 percent for bad loans, and 33 percent for the wider definition of NPLs. It
should be noted that, in San Marino, banks provision on the basis of expected losses. Furthermore,
there are no prudential requirements on provisioning, just indicative guidelines, supported by
conservative definitions of expected losses on the basis of which banks are expected to provision.
17.
Outside of CRSM banks have respectable capital buffers to absorb losses, but
recapitalization needs in these banks cannot be excluded. According to stress tests performed
by staff, the banking system ex. CRSM has enough buffers to absorb a 5–7 percentage points further
increase in the NPL ratio while still complying with prudential capital requirements. Beyond that,
capital needs would materialize, but they would remain manageable as long as the increase in the
NPL ratio relative to current values does not exceed ten percentage points. This would be quite an
extreme jump, but one that cannot be excluded in the current recessionary context. Supervisors
welcomed staff’s assessment that capital buffers outside of CRSM should be sufficient in all but tail
scenarios, an assessment which is in line with theirs.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

18.
The central bank is taking appropriate action to preserve financial stability. It has
commendably started an intensified regime of on and off-site supervision to ensure that banks and
non-bank financial entities are provisioning adequately against losses, as well as to detect budding
problems as early as possible. In addition, staff noted that the central bank has, by and large,
effective tools to take remedial action where needed, as their actions to resolve banks in the past
demonstrated. Still, while the banking law is generally effective, it can be improved upon by
establishing the central bank as the sole resolution authority and implementing a special bank
resolution regime, as opposed to resolving banks via the corporate insolvency law. At present, the
banking law does set forth special rules for bank insolvency, but the provisions of the bankruptcy
law continue to apply insofar as they are compatible with respect to matters not expressly provided
for in the banking law. At a minimum, bankruptcy court judges should not have the authority to
reverse or suspend the decisions of the supervisory/resolution authority, and challenges to the
latter’s decisions should be limited to monetary compensation. In the face of mounting NPLs, the
authorities emphasized that no forbearance will be granted to banks, and that they remain
committed to intensive on and off-site supervision for the foreseeable future. Should remedial
action be needed, they stated that they will not hesitate to impose it expeditiously as was done in
the past.

Liquidity
19.
Deposit drains in the banking system have halted, while the Delta resolution is
boosting liquidity at CRSM. Banks lost less than €50 million in deposits in 2012, after losing close
to €600 million in 2011 and €2.5 billion in 2009–10. The most recent data point to an actual increase
in deposits in some banks in the last few months, albeit modest. Regarding CRSM specifically, the
Delta resolution is boosting liquidity as more assets that were immobilized in Italy are slowly
released to the creditors. This has allowed CRSM to recently repay most of the emergency liquidity
support it received in 2010 in amounts exceeding €300 million. CRSM should receive further assets
down the road as part of the ongoing resolution, and while they will likely imply significant losses
relative to book value, receipt of these currently immobilized assets will allow the bank to generate
needed cash flow.
20.
Overall, banks’ liquidity buffers are
comfortable. The stabilization in deposits has given
banks breathing room to replenish their liquid assets,
which have increased by about 50 percent in the last
year. As a result, the coverage of liquid liabilities has
improved as well, and is now over 35 percent for the
banking system as a whole.2 Perhaps more relevant
given that resident deposits have proved very stable,
the coverage ratio of liquid non-resident deposits is
above 100 percent in most banks, and above
50 percent in all the systemic ones. In

addition, some banks have arranged contingent credit lines with private counterparties abroad. The
banks’ own buffers thus appear sufficient to cover all but the most extreme deposit outflow
scenario.
21.
These buffers are complemented by those of the central bank and deposit insurance
fund. The central bank has recently negotiated a contingent credit line that allows it to repo ECBacceptable securities for cash with a foreign private counterpart on a three to twelve month
maturity. Moreover, a deposit insurance fund has recently been established with coverage of
deposits up to €50,000 per account, though the authorities should gradually move from the current
ex-post scheme to an ex-ante one, in line with the 2010 proposed EU directive on deposit insurance.
In the central bank’s view, total buffers in the system are sufficient to cope with any plausible
eventuality, as they believe further deposit outflows of the scale seen in 2009 and 2010 are
extremely unlikely.
22.
Prudential liquidity requirements, now minimal, are set to increase. Currently, the
central bank does not impose any prudential liquidity measure other than the standard 8 percent
reserve requirement. This is an important gap considering San Marino’s lack of a lender of last resort
and the large size of the banking system. Going forward, the monetary agreement between San
Marino and the European Union contemplates San Marino adopting Basel III core principles by 2016,
among which are enhanced liquidity rules, an important element for San Marino. The central bank
agreed that these liquidity rules will be an important addition to the prudential toolkit.

2 percent of GDP) in additional revenue,
total central government revenues have fallen by about €100 million since 2007 because of the deep
economic contraction. Efforts have also been carried out to contain expenditures. Increases in
nominal public sector wages have been kept below inflation, which together with attrition in
employment has kept the public wage bill flat in nominal terms. In addition, capital spending has
been reduced from €60 million in 2008-09 to €30 million in 2012. As a result of these efforts, total
central government spending has fallen by about €30 million since 2007 (after increasing by
€70 million during 2004-07). These combined revenue and expenditure efforts have helped limit the
deterioration in the state balance, which has moved from a surplus of about 1½─3 percent of GDP

in the years before the crisis to a projected deficit of 2.9 percent in 2012. A new tax on insurance
premia should help the deficit stay at this level in 2013 despite the continued economic contraction,
a view that is in line with the authorities’ own forecasts.

rates and the extension in the contributory period, are now falling because of depressed
employment and incomes. The decline in contributions is occurring much earlier than demographic
trends alone would have suggested. On the other hand, nominal pension outlays continue to
increase. The end result is that the balance of the system has fallen from 4½ percent of GDP in 2009
to about 2 percent in 2012, too small a surplus considering that the brunt of population aging is still
to be felt. The surplus is also significantly smaller than had been projected at the time of the reform.
The authorities concurred with this analysis, but took existing reserves in the pension system as
assurance that no budget support will be needed in the short and medium-term.
25.
Significant additional budgetary savings will need to be found over the medium term.
As recent experience shows, San Marino’s inherent vulnerabilities as a very small and open economy
argue in favor of having ample fiscal buffers. True, public debt is currently low, but it could increase
significantly going forward due to bank recapitalization needs. Moreover, with much of the output
recently lost unlikely to return, which in turn renders a significant rebound in taxes unlikely, staff
project sizeable deficits in the 3―3½ percent of GDP range in the absence of new
measures─deficits which would, in turn, add to any increase in debt brought about by
recapitalization. Anchoring debt in the context of significant contingent liabilities will thus require
additional budgetary savings of about 4─5 percent of GDP costs (see Appendix II−public debt
sustainability analysis). The pain of fiscal consolidation in a recessionary context cannot be
understated, yet despite the lack of offsetting monetary policy fiscal multipliers are likely small in
San Marino, with imports accounting for some 150 percent of GDP.
26.
The planned tax reform would provide a great opportunity to find savings. The
authorities plan to soon resubmit to parliament a tax reform that was shelved last year (see box 1).
In its broad outlines, the tax reform focuses on income taxation, and aims to lower marginal tax
rates for both corporate and personal income tax while broadening tax bases. Staff recommended
that the authorities seize the opportunity offered by the reform to make the tax system more
transparent and less distortive, but also to generate whatever additional revenue is needed.

Box 1. The Planned Tax Reform
The authorities plan to submit to parliament a reform of income taxation that has been under
consideration since 2011. The focus of the reform is on income taxation; indirect taxes, in
particular the possible introduction of a VAT, is not being contemplated at this stage. A common
feature of the changes being proposed for personal and corporate income taxation is the
broadening of tax bases through elimination of tax credits and deductions, and the simultaneous
lowering of tax rates. The reform also introduces administratively burdensome features, a
particularly relevant factor in a micro state with naturally limited administrative capacity. The
overall yield of the tax reform as it stands may be around 1.0 percent of GDP. Details of the
proposed changes for corporate entities and employees, which are responsible for the bulk of
direct tax receipts, follow:1

For corporates, tax credits amounting to about 20 percent of gross tax liabilities are to be
eliminated, and the tax rate lowered from 17.2 percent to 16 percent. In addition, a minimum tax
applied in recent years is to be institutionalized (except for new businesses). It is also proposed
that higher-income corporates pay a reduced tax rate of 13 percent if they satisfy particular
conditions intended to promote domestic value-added creation—conditions that will need to be
verified by the tax office.

For employees, standard deductions are to be reduced sharply (by nearly 60 percent), but
at the same time deductions allowed for individual expenses are to be quadrupled—these are
aimed at promoting domestic purchasing, the documentation for which will need to be checked
by the tax office. These two elements balance each other out, leaving the taxable income of
employees little changed. In addition, the plan contemplates a sharp reduction in the average tax
rate from 16.8 percent to 7 percent, compensated by the virtual elimination of tax credits (which
currently amount to a substantial 9 percent of gross income). Finally, taxable income will now be
defined on a worldwide basis.

27.
The planned tax reform follows good principles, but it does not generate sufficient
additional savings. Lower nominal rates coupled with the elimination of deductions and tax credits
should make the tax system less distortive, although verification costs are set to increase. Moreover,
preliminary estimates suggest that base broadening will more than compensate for the lower rates.
The problem is that the projected revenue gains from the reform are modest at 1 percent of
GDP─assuming all elements of the plan pass through parliament─which is not enough if San Marino
is to find 4─5 percent of GDP in budgetary savings over the next few years balanced across
revenues and expenditures. There is room to increase effective personal income tax rates further,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

which at 6 percent post reform will remain very low by international standards. For efficiency
reasons, the first step should be to reconsider the introduction of new deductions, particularly those
that impose significant verification costs, but the reduction in marginal tax rates could be made less
drastic as well. The tax reform should also make permanent the real estate tax, which is set to expire
in 2013. Real estate taxes are a good source of revenue, in that they are relatively undistortive and
can be made quite progressive and fair.
28.
Similarly, the upcoming expenditure review will need to consider cuts in the big
expenditure items, namely public wages and social benefits. The government intends the
expenditure review to be broad enough to encompass all categories of public spending, including
bank recapitalization. As commendable as this is, the review should start from the premise that the
spending envelope needs to be reduced further, as recent efforts have not been sufficient. Despite
limits on nominal wage increases and the imposition of attrition, the public sector wage bill is still
two percentage points of GDP higher than it was before the crisis. Similarly, efforts to contain health
expenditures––via the repatriation of medical services from Italy to San Marino, the purchase of
medical drugs directly from manufacturers, and limits on which doctors are allowed to prescribe
highly costly drugs,––have not prevented these expenditures from increasing by 2 percentage
points of GDP as well. And, as discussed previously, the sustainability of the pension system is in
doubt. Nevertheless, while cuts appear unavoidable in order to put public finances back on a sound
footing, the government should ensure that any cuts be made in a progressive fashion, so as to
spare the most vulnerable in society.
29.
The authorities concurred with the need to consolidate, but warned that this will not
be easy in the current context. They emphasized the crucial role that pre-crisis fiscal surpluses and
large fiscal reserves had played in avoiding a crisis, and agreed with the need to rebuild fiscal buffers
in light of contingent liabilities. On this, they noted that the 2012 budget law includes a target of a
balanced budget by 2014. Although they acknowledged that this will be hard to achieve on the
basis of current and planned measures, they saw value in maintaining the target to manage
expectations. This being said, the authorities cautioned against the difficulty of increasing taxes and
cutting expenditure in a recessionary context, and worried that there might not be enough political
consensus to do so. They also warned that revising the parameters of the tax reform would require
renewed consultations with social partners. Finally, the authorities saw little scope for a third pension
reform in less than ten years.

recapitalization can be implemented via bond
issuance that does not require actual borrowing. This being said, it would be prudent to diversify
financing sources going forward, and to start exploring such possibilities soon given San Marino’s
almost non-existent borrowing history and hence the need to build borrowing relationships from
scratch. The authorities agreed that there is enough liquidity in the domestic banking system as long
as financing needs are not excessive. They said they prefer this option to borrowing abroad given
the high costs of the latter for a small economy like San Marino.

C. Structural Issues
31.
The key structural challenge facing San Marino is to develop new growth sectors that
make up for the loss of the traditional economic model. Some stakeholders in the financial
industry see a future centered on asset management, an activity that in principle carries fewer risks
to the sovereign than traditional banking. However, positioning San Marino as an asset
management hub will take time and considerable resources as the needed expertise is not fully
developed yet, and nor is the legal, administrative, or IT infrastructure.3 Extending traditional
banking activities to surrounding regions and even further afield is also being considered, in which
case it will be important to ensure that cross-border banking activities do not overstretch the
country’s supervisory capacity, and that balance sheets do not grow unduly from their already high
levels. Outside of banking, the country enjoys a long standing manufacturing tradition, with the
sector presently accounting for a third of GDP and about 25 percent of total employment. Still, for
manufacturing to pick up the slack of lost banking activities would require improved cost
competitiveness.
32.
A necessary but not sufficient condition for robust growth will be to normalize
relations with other countries, notably Italy. Sammarinese companies, be they financial or not,
need a level playing field if they are to survive and compete. To achieve this goal, San Marino needs

3

Association of Sammarinese Banks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

to continue shedding the legacy of its past as a tax haven, something that the authorities are
committed to doing.
33.
San Marino has made important progress towards openness and transparency.
International, peer-reviewed assessments have confirmed this progress: for instance, the latest
MONEYVAL assessment on AML/CFT issues in 2011 indicates significant improvements in formal
compliance with the FATF standards. Exchange of information with other jurisdictions on tax and
money laundering matters has also been stepped up, with the legislative framework now giving the
Sammarinese authorities greater powers to collect and transmit information. Not only are banks
subjected to tighter controls by the authorities, but many leasing and fiduciary companies that
provided a vehicle for non-residents to evade taxes have been shut down. This being said, progress
is still needed in some areas, which include extending and implementing effective due diligence to
legacy customers, criminalizing self-laundering, making all serious tax crimes predicate offense to
money laundering, and ensuring operational independence of the AML supervisor.
34.
New bilateral and multilateral agreements should help entrench this progress. In
particular, San Marino has ratified three key bilateral agreements with Italy, the double taxation,
financial cooperation, and economic cooperation agreements (see box 2). These agreements now
await ratification by the Italian parliament. Among other things, the treaties will define the principles
and modalities for the exchange of tax information, and for supervisory cooperation between the
two central banks on cross-border banking activities. Other initiatives, such as the Monetary
Agreement between the European Union and San Marino which entered in force in September 2012,
also point to a desire to engage and integrate more fully with the international community.
35.
Despite progress on the ground, normalizing relations with the international
community will take time. After the Monti cabinet approved the double taxation treaty in
December, many had hoped for a prompt ratification of the treaty in the Italian parliament. This
would, in turn, pave the way for the ratification of the other two agreements, and facilitate the
eventual removal of San Marino from Italy’s tax black list. However, the political situation in Italy has
now significantly delayed this process, and it remains unclear at this stage when ratification might
happen. Beyond these setbacks, which are unrelated to actions or lack thereof on San Marino’s part,
the process of regaining the trust of the international community will likely be gradual.
36.
San Marino also needs to improve its cost competitiveness. While recent wage data are
not available, recent labor agreements point to nominal wage growth in the range of 0−1½ percent,
representing only a small decline in real terms. In fact, the cumulative decline in real wages so far
has been modest considering the depth of the GDP fall, with much of the adjustment happening via
quantities. This decline may be enough to keep wage differentials with Italy manageable, but it is
not enough of a competitiveness boost for new sectors to make up for the loss of traditional
economic activities. This loss is akin, de facto, to a significant appreciation of the real exchange rate,
one which will not be easy to absorb in the context of a fixed exchange rate.
37.
Labor market reforms being put in place should help facilitate this process. The
government is planning to replace the 1961 labor code this year, building on recent reforms that

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

decentralized the employment system. Specifically, firms will no longer be obliged to hire their
workers from the state’s employment list, and employment procedures have been simplified for
cross-border workers especially in sectors or professions in which skilled resident workers are scarce.
Finally, a voucher system will be put in place to allow firms to easily trade employee working
days, and hiring through apprenticeships will be institutionalized. An important measure that
remains to be considered is the reduction in the number of national holidays, which is high hence
negatively impacting Sammarinese productivity. Of note, procedures for firing workers are not
particularly cumbersome or costly.
Box 2. International Cooperation Agreements
Three key bilateral agreements with Italy in the economic and financial spheres are pending:

A double taxation agreement (DTA). Other than avoiding the double taxation of nationals,
a key goal of the agreement is the prevention of tax fraud. The agreement is comprehensive and
follows best OECD practice. Of note, San Marino already has in place more than thirty bilateral
DTAs.

Financial cooperation agreement. The aim of the agreement is to promote the
development and integration of the respective financial systems. Cross-border supervisory
cooperation is an important component of the agreement, with emphasis on cooperation without
any confidentiality constraints. As part of the agreement, San Marino commits to continue to
transpose best international standards into its law on such matters as AML/CFT.

Economic cooperation agreement¸focused on the promotion of economic activities of
value to both countries, including the development of cargo infrastructure within the Rimini
airport, a science and technology park, and joint tourism ventures.
The agreements need to be ratified by both parliaments. San Marino has already ratified the three
treaties, and they now await ratification in the Italian parliament (the double taxation treaty was
approved by the Monti cabinet last year and sent to parliament). By design, entry into force of the
treaties will be sequential, in the order listed above.
Separately, San Marino signed a new monetary agreement with the European Union (EU) in
March 2012 that allows it to continue to use the euro as its official currency. On its part, San
Marino commits to transpose into its law within four years EU requirements in the fields of
banking and financial supervision (including Basel III core principles) as well as the prevention of
money laundering.
Finally, San Marino is at present pursuing bilateral DTAs with five additional countries, and is
negotiating memoranda of understanding for cross-border supervisory cooperation with two
jurisdictions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

38.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to shedding the legacy of bank and tax
secrecy. They view continued inclusion in Italy’s tax black list as the main obstacle to growth, and
believe San Marino has done enough progress in the areas of tax fraud avoidance and the exchange
of tax information to merit removal from the list. In addition, the authorities hope that the three
major bilateral treaties will soon be ratifitied by the Italian parliament. At the same time, they stated
that the current state of affairs should not mask the very strong and growing cooperation between
the two countries in many areas. The authorities are also keen to build bridges with countries
beyond Italy, as they see economic diversification as key for the future of the economy. In order to
support growth, the authorities emphasized their efforts on several strategic projects, including a
science and technology park and the development of the Rimini airport as a regional cargo hub,
both joint with Italy.

D. Data Issues
39.
There are some data gaps which are not uncommon for a small country like San
Marino. In particular, national account and fiscal statistics lack the detail required by international
standards, and are produced with significant delay. Balance of payments data are not currently
available, but the challenges of producing such data for a micro state with fully open borders cannot
be underestimated. San Marino is set to receive Fund technical assistance on BOP data, just as it
received technical assistance on national accounts, fiscal, and monetary and financial statistics in the
past. Of note, banking sector data are quite comprehensive, a key consideration given the
importance of the sector within the economy. On balance, the data are of sufficient quality for
surveillance purposes.

E. Staff Appraisal
40.
The economic situation remains very challenging. Staff forecast an economic contraction
of 3 percent for this year, after an estimated 4 percent GDP decline in 2012. This is because of the
weak economic outlook for Italy and other European countries, and the impact on Sammarinese
businesses of the country’s continued inclusion in Italy’s tax black list. Risks to this difficult outlook
remain on the downside, particularly if financial turbulence were to again affect Europe.
41.
In this context, the financial system continues to face challenges. While the extent of
CRSM’s total losses on its Delta investment remains uncertain at this stage, the bank will need more
capital to comply with regulatory requirements and serve the economy from a position of strength.
The State should stand ready to provide this additional capital, and to do so within a reasonably
quick timeframe. This being said, public recapitalization going forward should, in line with
international best practice, ensure that the State is entitled to a share in future profits that is
commensurate with its share in the bank’s capital; it should also require meaningful restructuring of
the bank to return it to profitability expeditiously, with a view of reselling the State’s equity to the
private sector within a reasonable timeframe. Legal provisions that protect the Fondazione San
Marino Cassa di Risparmio’s majority stake must be removed.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

42.
While the economic crisis is leading to mounting losses on credit portfolios of other
banks, their capital and liquidity buffers appear sufficient. Capital buffers outside of CRSM
should be able to withstand additional further losses in a variety of scenarios. This being said,
recapitalization needs cannot be excluded in these banks in a tail scenario. Liquid assets are also
being rebuilt to sound levels, allowing for proper coverage of liquid liabilities. The central bank has
commendably intensified supervision aimed at ensuring that banks are provisioning adequate
amounts and that they remain liquid and well capitalized. Moreover, the central bank has the tools
and stands ready to put in place preventive remedial actions should these be needed, though the
banking law could be improved upon for more effective resolution.
43.
A key lesson from the global crisis is the importance for San Marino to rebuild strong
fiscal reserves, particularly in a context of significant contingent liabilities from the banks. To
do so, the fiscal balance will need to gradually return to the surpluses enjoyed in the past. In this
context, the government appropriately took extraordinary fiscal measures, such as the real estate
tax, the surtax on general income, and restraint on public wages and capital spending. Yet these
measures only helped contain the state fiscal deficit at a still high level (by San Marino’s standards)
of some 3 percent of GDP. With much of the GDP decline permanent thus ruling out a rapid
rebound in tax revenues, some 4―5 percent of GDP in additional budgetary savings will have to be
found over the medium term.
44.
The planned tax reform and expenditure review constitute a great opportunity to
achieve this objective. The government’s tax reform plans, if enacted, will lead to a more modern,
efficient, and equitable tax system, but the reform will only yield modest additional revenue:
effective tax rates, which remain very low by European standards, need to be raised further than
contemplated in the plan; in addition, the real estate tax needs to be made permanent, as this tax is
relatively non-distortionary and a good source of revenue. Similarly, the upcoming expenditure
review should start from the premise that recent efforts to contain spending have not been
sufficient; outlays on public wages and health benefits are 4 percentage points of GDP higher than
before the crisis, while the sustainability of the pension system is no longer assured. Returning
public finances to a sound footing will require cuts in these large expenditure items, though care will
have to be expended to ensure the cuts are equitable and spare the most vulnerable in society.
45.
San Marino needs full normalization of relations with Italy to return to robust growth.
In this regard, there has been significant progress in recent years to unwind laws protecting bank
and tax secrecy. Anti money laundering laws have also been significantly tightened and the
exchange of information on tax and money laundering matters has been stepped up. Continued
commitment to this more open and transparent path will be the best way for San Marino to
strengthen its relations with the international community.
46.
In addition, the economy faces the challenge of developing new growth sectors. A shift
towards asset management services will require a significant upgrade of existing know-how and
infrastructure. Outside of banking, significant cost competitiveness gains—supported by recent and
prospective labor market reforms—will be needed for the manufacturing sector to make up for lost
activity elsewhere.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment
of the risks surrounding the baseline. The RAM reflects staff views on the source of the risks and overall level of
concern as of the time of the discussion with the authorities.

Appendix II: Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
In the baseline excluding recapitalization costs, public debt would increase
substantially but remain manageable. In this scenario, debt would go from 20 percent of GDP
in 2012 to slightly less than 40 percent in 2018. The reason is that, in the absence of further
consolidation measures, primary deficits will remain in the 2½─3 percent of GDP range, while the
economy is expected to grow very little in cumulative terms over 2013-2018 period. Nevertheless, it
should be noted that about 13 percent of GDP in starting debt are actually unclaimed tax refunds
that do not carry interest and are typically rolled over from one year to the next. Hence, the “actual”
debt in the baseline at the end of the projection period is closer to 26 percent of GDP. This is
significantly higher than the 7 percent of GDP now, but still manageable.
2.
Bank recapitalization costs could severely complicate the debt situation. As mentioned
in the main text, the largest bank in the system will need more capital, and this capital might have to
be injected by the State. To estimate the impact on public debt, staff follow two assumptions: a
lower-bound estimate of recapitalization needs of about 10 percent of GDP, and an upper-bound
estimate of 25 percent of GDP. Recapitalization is assumed to occur in 2013. In both scenarios,
public debt would rise sharply, going from 20 percent of GDP in 2012 to about 50 and 70 percent of
GDP, respectively (or 37 and 58 percent of GDP in “actual” debt adjusting for the unclaimed tax
refunds). This being said, the State would acquire an asset such as equity in the bank in exchange for
recapitalization funds. This asset could help unwind debt if sold back to the market at a later stage.
3.
Still, contingent liabilities highlight the need to consolidate public finances. While bank
recapitalization triggers a jump in debt in 2013, the significant increase in debt thereafter is due to
ongoing fiscal deficits. Thus, stabilizing debt post-recapitalization would require fiscal consolidation.
As an example, if the government were to tighten the budget by one percentage point of GDP per
year for each of the next four years, then in the mild recapitalization scenario public debt would start
falling from 2015 onwards and end at 33 percent of GDP in 2018, versus 50 percent without
consolidation; in the severe recapitalization scenario, debt would stabilize post-recapitalization
jump, and end at 55 percent versus 71 percent without consolidation.
4.
Under plausible scenarios, the impact from weaker growth would be not as severe as
that from recapitalization. Assuming that growth is 1½ percentage points of GDP weaker each
year would bring debt at the end of the period to 47 percent of GDP (or 34 percent in “actual”
debt).1 This would be similar to the lower bound recapitalization scenario, but significantly less
burdensome than the severe recapitalization scenario.

1

The standard DSA growth shock of half a standard deviation decline would be implausibly harsh, as it would imply
that growth would be 3½ percentage points lower every year than in the baseline. The assumed shock is still quite
severe.

Key macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions

Sources: Sammarinese authorities, UPECEDS; and IMF staff calculations, estimates and projections.
1/ Based on central government liabilities which includes about 13 percent of GDP in unclaimed tax refunds.
2/ Derive as [r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)] / (1+g+π+gπ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; π = change in GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth; α = share of foreign-currency debt;
and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation.
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as r - π(1+g), and the real GDP growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as budget deficit, plus amortization of medium- and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt (not being rolled over automatically) at end of previous period, plus extraordinary items
(e.g. recognition of contigent or implicit liabilities, and bank recapitalization).
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by the average of previous and current period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Exchange Arrangements
Prior to 1999 the currency of San Marino was the Italian lira. Since January 1, 1999, San Marino uses
the euro as its official currency. The central monetary institution is the Central Bank of San Marino
(CBSM). Foreign exchange transactions are conducted through commercial banks without restriction
at rates quoted in Italian markets. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign
exchange. San Marino's exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for those maintained solely for the
preservation of national or international security and which have been notified to the Fund pursuant
to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).1

EU Regulations are not directly applicable to San Marino as a result of Article 249 of the Treaty Establishing the
European Community, but they may well be applied as a result of the legal relationship between San Marino and
Italy, acting on behalf of the European Union.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 28, 2013)
Data Provision
Progress has been made since San Marino’s participation in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) on May 16, 2008 but important weaknesses in the statistical database remain mainly
due to resource constraints. In January 2007, in view of their intention to participate in the GDDS,
the authorities named two national GDDS coordinators and announced their objective to increase
the frequency of website updates in order to improve data dissemination. As of March 2012,
national and fiscal accounts, as well as monetary and financial sector data are compiled according to
international standards but some key statistics (such as real and fiscal data) are available only with
delay and, in many cases, are at a lower than standard frequency and detail.
Real Sector Statistics
National accounts data for 1995 onward have been calculated in accordance with ESA95 and data
are compiled annually based on the income approach with about ten months delay. The authorities
have also calculated sectoral contribution. However, as part of ongoing STA technical assistance on
national accounts statistics, the production and expenditure approaches are adopted instead.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

Consumer prices and employment data are available monthly with short delay. An industrial
production index based on electricity consumption, launched in 2000, became available monthly in
2009. Consumption and business sentiment indexes have been compiled starting 2007 based on
annual household and business surveys.
Government Finance Statistics
The authorities have provided data for the central government, state owned enterprises, and social
security fund for 2004–12, as well as the budget for 2013–15. However, the data have not been
compiled in accordance with IMF standards. Financing items, such as amortization, are included as
expenditures while “borrowing requirement” is included among the revenues.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Since 1997, the authorities have provided balance sheet data on the commercial banks and the
monetary authorities to STA database. These data are provided on a quarterly basis, with
approximately a six-week reporting lag. The authorities have introduced laws and took some
measures to improve coverage and timeliness of banks’ reporting. The CBSM has improved
sectorization and expanded data collection to cover the offshore asset management activities of
banks. The breakdown of deposits (and other assets and liabilities) between residents and
nonresidents and the breakdown of short-term credit by public and private sector components are
also available. However, there is no broad money survey. Data on non-bank financial intermediaries
are also lacking.
External Sector Statistics
San Marino does not compile balance of payments accounts. Given the currency union with Italy and
the subsequent introduction of the euro, the authorities had not considered this a high priority. This
will change, however, as the authorities are set to receive Fund technical assistance on BOP statistics.
Starting in 2008, trade statistics have been released quarterly with a lag of about six months.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of San Marino
On May 3, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with San Marino. 1
Background
San Marino is experiencing a deep and prolonged recession, with the decline in GDP since
2007 amounting to a cumulative 28 percent. The global financial crisis put an end to the
traditional business model built around bank and tax secrecy, bringing about a large outflow of
non-resident deposits and an associated compression of banks’ balance sheets. Weak external
demand and the difficulties faced by many Sammarinese firms due to the country’s continued
inclusion in Italy’s tax black list have also contributed to the recession.
System-wide deposit outflows have now abated, and preliminary indications point to an increase
in deposits in some institutions in recent months. This is allowing banks to gradually rebuild their
liquidity buffers. However, Cassa di Risparmio della Repubblica di San Marino, the largest bank,
remains undercapitalized following heavy losses from its investment in the Italian Delta group.
Moreover, the economic recession is leading to mounting non-performing loans across all

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

banks, with the gross non-performing loan ratio now close to 25 percent for the system as a
whole.
The global crisis has led to a significant decline in budget revenues. However, San Marino’s
sizable pre-2008 budget surplus, combined with recent tax measures and efforts to restrain
expenditures, have helped contain the deficit at some 3 percent of GDP. Fiscal reserves
accumulated before the crisis have been used to finance recent budget deficits thereby keeping
public debt low, but these reserves are now largely exhausted.
International assessments have recognized the progress made by San Marino in unwinding
laws protecting bank and tax secrecy, while the exchange of information with other jurisdictions
has also been stepped up. San Marino has recently ratified key agreements with Italy on double
taxation and prevention of tax fraud, financial cooperation, and economic cooperation, which
now await ratification by the Italian parliament.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that San Marino’s economy is facing financial and fiscal challenges in
the near term, as well as uncertain medium-term prospects. Accordingly, Directors emphasized
the need to preserve financial stability, rebuild fiscal buffers, and push ahead with structural
reforms to develop new sources of growth.
Directors considered that, notwithstanding the recent recapitalization, the largest bank will need
more capital to meet prudential requirements. They agreed that, if public capital is injected, the
state should acquire equity in the bank commensurate with its share in the recapitalization, and
take control of its management and board. A credible restructuring plan will also be needed to
bring the bank back to profitability.
Directors noted with satisfaction that the banks’ large liquidity buffers should accommodate
further potential deposit outflows, and that their capital positions are generally strong—the
largest bank excepted. Nonetheless, they cautioned against complacency given rising nonperforming loans, and welcomed the authorities’ heightened oversight of the banking system.
Although bank resolution tools are generally effective, Directors stressed the importance of
establishing the central bank as the sole authority for bank resolution.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to rebuild fiscal buffers, in view of the economic
uncertainties and large contingent liabilities from the banking system. Although the planned tax
reform would make the tax system more efficient, Directors felt that fiscal adjustment in the
period ahead would be more effective if some tax exemptions in the plan are reversed or the
decline in personal income tax rates is more limited. Directors also noted that the current level

3
of public wages, pensions, and health spending is unsustainable, and recommended cutting
back outlays in these areas, while protecting the most disadvantaged.
Directors welcomed the steps taken to dismantle tax and bank secrecy, and the increased
exchange of information with other jurisdictions. Recent cooperation agreements with Italy, once
ratified, will further entrench San Marino’s commitment toward openness and transparency.
Directors agreed that further improvement of relations with Italy is a necessary condition for a
revival of the Sammarinese economy and its growth drivers.
Directors noted the critical challenge of finding new growth sectors to replace lost activities in
San Marino. They stressed the need to improve cost competitiveness and looked forward to
implementation of planned labor market reforms.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2013 Article IV Consultation with The Republic of San Marino is also
available.

Statement by Andrea Montanino, Executive Director for San Marino
And Ms. Daniela Marchettini, Advisor to Executive Director
May 3, 2013
The authorities thank the staff for the helpful discussions held in San Marino and for their
thorough analysis, which they broadly share. They are keen to continue the reform
process started since the beginning of the financial crisis and will remain in close contact
with the staff so as to keep them abreast of the impact of the reforms on the economy,
including, if compatible with the IMF resources envelope, in the context of technical
assistance.
Introduction
Over the past few years, San Marino’s economy has been hit by a confluence of shocks,
mostly connected to the global financial crisis and the international pressures to embrace
greater transparency standards and rethink the tax-haven status. The crisis has triggered a
cumulative 28 percent contraction of San Marino’s GDP since 2007, of which a large part
is estimated to be permanent, as well as a significant consolidation of its large banking
sector. However, the large fiscal buffers accumulated before the crisis and the bold
actions undertaken by the authorities helped prevent an outright meltdown of the
financial sector and mitigated the negative impact on output.
San Marino is now at a critical juncture. Reforming the economic model and identifying
new and sustainable sources of growth are fundamental steps to offset the abrupt
contraction of potential output. The authorities are fully aware of this situation and, in
addition to the efforts to manage the crisis, are focusing on the medium-term challenges,
including restoring fiscal sustainability, completing the overhaul of the banking system,
and laying the foundations for a new and sustainable business model.
In order to facilitate a successful repositioning of the economy, the authorities consider
fundamental the normalization of the economic and financial relations with Italy. To
achieve this goal, San Marino is working actively to shedding the legacy of its past as a
tax haven. In this context, the authorities have made important progress towards openness
and transparency. International, peer-reviewed assessments have confirmed this progress.
In particular, the latest MONEYVAL1 assessment on Anti Money Laundering and
Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) issues in 2011 indicates significant
improvements in formal compliance with the FATF standards. In addition, exchange of
information with other jurisdictions on tax and money laundering matters has also been
stepped up, with the legislative framework now giving the Sammarinese authorities
greater powers to collect and transmit information.

Outlook
The short-term economic outlook remains weak. Under the baseline scenario staff
projects that real GDP will decline by 3.5 percent in 2013, mainly due to a weakening
demand for exports and continued adjustments in the financial sector. The recovery is
expected to be gradual and likely tepid, in line with output development in Italy.
Downside risks still dominate, mainly stemming from a lower than expected external
demand. On the upside, a prompt ratification of the double taxation treaty by the Italian
parliament would normalize the relations between the two countries and would pave the
way for the ratification of other two arrangements (the Financial Cooperation Agreement
and the Economic Cooperation Agreement) with positive effects on San Marino’s
economic and financial activity.
Fiscal Policy
Despite the deep economic contraction since the blow of the crisis, a combination of
revenue and expenditure measures have helped to limit the deterioration of the fiscal
balance, which has moved from a surplus of about 1½─3 percent of GDP in the years
before the crisis to a projected deficit of 2.9 percent in 2012. Even if public debt has
increased, it remains low at about 20 percent of GDP in 2012.
This notwithstanding, lingering uncertainty about future economic developments and the
recapitalization needs of the main domestic bank (Cassa di Risparmio della Repubblica
di San Marino) calls for the need to rebuild fiscal buffers in order to bolster the resilience
of the economy to adverse shocks. The staff’s Public Debt Sustainability Analysis shows
that under the baseline scenario, which excludes additional bank recapitalization costs,
debt would increase substantially, reaching slightly less than 40 percent of GDP in 2018.
In order to anchor debt staff estimates that an additional correction of about 4-5 percent
of GDP is needed.
The government is fully aware of the need to proceed with an ambitious fiscal
consolidation plan and it is intentioned to front-load the adjustment. Backed by a broad
consensus across the political spectrum, the government aims to reach a balance budget
by 2014. This would imply a fiscal effort of about 3 percent of GDP. While the measures
to be included in the fiscal consolidation package have yet to be decided, it is broadly
recognized that there is ample room to achieve savings both on the expenditure and
revenue side. The findings of the spending review to be concluded in the coming days
will guide the choice of the appropriate spending cuts, while the tax reform offers a
unique opportunity to broaden the narrow tax base.
Financial Sector
The process of recapitalization of the Cassa di Risparmio della Repubblica di San
Marino (CRSM), biggest bank in the system whose assets accounted for 37 percent of the
total in 2008, is ongoing. The state has directly or indirectly contributed €95 million (or
6.5 percent of the 2012 nominal GDP) out of €120 million in the recapitalization funds so

far. While the extent of Cassa di Risparmio’s total losses on its Delta investment remains
uncertain at this stage, more capital will be needed in order to comply with the prudential
requirements and to serve the Sammarinese community from a position of strength.
The state is ready to cover the additional recapitalization need but it will impose stronger
conditionality than in the past. In particular, the legal provision that protects the majority
stake of the current bank’s shareholders, a charitable foundation with roots dating to the
19th century, will be abrogated. With this reform the state will become the majority
shareholder while the foundation will only retain a small (symbolic) share. Additional
reforms will include a replacement of the bank’s top management and of the board of
directors. Regarding the modalities of the recapitalization, the government is working on
a solution that would secure the liquidity of the CRSM and the stability of the banking
system at large.
As regards the rest of the banking sector, over the past months pressures have eased.
Deposits have stabilized or have increased modestly in some cases, contributing to
improve bank liquidity positions. Also Delta resolution is boosting liquidity as CRSM’s
assets that were immobilized are slowly released and the bank has been able to repay
loans outstanding to other banks. Nonetheless, there is not room for complacency; the
recession is leading to mounting non-performing loans across all banks. Against this
background, the central bank has intensified supervision in order to ensure that banks are
provisioning adequate amounts against expected losses, and that they remain liquid and
well capitalized.
Structural Reforms
Together with the spending review activities and the tax reform, San Marino is adopting a
development plan aimed at reshaping its economic context in the near future. The
decision to adopt a multifaceted economic structure has been confirmed, where tourism,
trade, high value-added production, banking and financial sector are the key elements,
together with the creation of a scientific and technological park connected with
businesses and the university to develop research activities and promote innovative
entrepreneurial initiatives.
The recovery plan is based on the internationalization of the country as a whole, a
considerable reduction of the degree of discretion, the simplification and harmonization
of laws, also by adopting single texts for specific sectors in order to provide a system
more understandable from the outside. This plan also aims at attracting foreign
investments on the basis of precise access criteria, reshaping public administration,
adopting GRECO2 legislation, reducing bureaucracy and computerizing public services.
Moreover, an infrastructural plan has been identified, which includes a new connection to
the coast, the development of the international airport Rimini - San Marino focused on
cargo, maintenance and business activities, water self-sufficiency and waste management,
as well as strengthening of telecommunications as a key infrastructure supporting

economic development. The disposal of non-strategic public corporations is also
envisaged. Moreover, important infrastructural interventions are envisaged in favor of
tourism, including the restructuring of many areas located in the historic centre and the
creation of a museum centre.
Taxation will be used to attract investments and to enhance the competitiveness of
existing businesses. This will not imply any scatter gun measures but rather a more
favorable tax regime provided that investments in research, training and recapitalization
are made. A package of incentives will be destined to new San Marino enterprises, in
order to favor access by young and unemployed people to the labor market. From 2014,
the VAT regime will be introduced according to different modalities based on the
characteristics of each sector, in order to treat San Marino businesses operating on
foreign markets on an equal footing. Also the labor market will be subject to
interventions, in particular social safety nets and the professional training system will be
reviewed. The banking and financial system is an important element supporting
businesses.
The development plan includes interventions aimed at re-establishing mutual relations
with Italy, access to the payment system in 2014, as urgent objectives, and the building of
a legal framework, while respecting international rules, for the development of an
international financial centre. A considerable strengthening of the university is envisaged
and bilingualism has been identified as one of the objectives.
