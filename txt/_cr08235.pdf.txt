EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions with Uzbekistan focused on the appropriate
policy mix to reduce inflation, medium-term reforms to sustain high economic growth, and
efforts to improve economic statistics.
Background
The economy continued to perform well in 2007. Growth accelerated, the external position
strengthened further, the augmented fiscal surplus remained large, and the debt burden
continued to decline. Despite the tightening of monetary conditions late in the year, inflation
continued to be high, as the sharp increase in net foreign assets was only partially sterilized.
Economic prospects remain broadly favorable with limited risks.
Authorities’ policies
The authorities intend to reduce inflationary pressures by tightening monetary conditions
significantly and maintaining a prudent fiscal stance by saving high commodity revenues.
Further significant increases in public sector wages and salaries are envisaged.
The policy of gradual nominal depreciation of the sum will continue. The authorities believe
that this policy has served them well and that the sum is not undervalued. However, if
inflation remains high, they would consider slowing the rate of nominal depreciation.
On the structural front, the authorities plan to continue with tax reforms, improvements in
treasury operations, and financial sector reforms.
Staff recommendations
The envisaged tightening in monetary policy and the continued prudent fiscal stance are
essential in the short term to reduce inflationary pressures. However, the current policy
mix— involving nominal depreciation and very tight fiscal policy—is not sustainable.
The sum real exchange rate appears to be significantly undervalued and will need to adjust
toward equilibrium. Allowing real appreciation to take place through nominal appreciation
rather than inflation would create less economic distortions, give the central bank control of
money supply, and lower the sterilization burden on fiscal policy.
Strong reforms will be needed to sustain high growth rates. These include enhancing
financial intermediation, liberalizing the trade system, phasing out price controls, and
improving the business environment. There is also an urgent need to improve the quality of
economic statistics.

4
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Uzbekistan is a resource rich country with a gradualist approach to reforms. It
has abundant natural resources, including hydrocarbons, gold, copper, and uranium, a strong
agricultural base, and a young and educated labor force. Since independence, the authorities
have implemented a strategy of achieving self sufficiency through the “localization program”,
extensive intervention, and state-led industrialization, while cautiously introducing features
of an open and market economy.
2.
The Uzbek economy has performed well in recent years. The favorable external
environment and improved macroeconomic policies resulted in high growth rates, large
current account surpluses, a significant decline in the debt burden, and a more than
quadrupling of foreign exchange reserves from 2003 to 2007 (Table 1). Poverty declined
from 27.5 percent in 2001 to 25.8 percent in 2005.1
3.
The main policy issues have not changed since the last Article IV consultation.
The key short-term policy challenge is to reduce inflation. For the medium term, the most
important challenge is to sustain high economic growth. Accordingly, the discussions focused
on the appropriate mix of monetary, exchange rate, and fiscal policies to reduce inflationary
pressures, and medium-term reform plans to enhance economic performance, focusing on the
financial sector. Data shortcomings and efforts to address them were also discussed.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Growth accelerated in 2007. Official statistics indicate that GDP grew by
9.5 percent (up from 7.3 percent in 2006), driven by trade, transport and communications,
industry, and services. Detailed national accounts data from the expenditure side are
unreliable, but available evidence suggests private investment rose as enterprises benefited
from lower taxes and moderate improvements in the business environment. Consumption
was supported by higher wages and salaries and increased remittance inflows.

5.
The external position strengthened further. The current account surplus rose from
17 percent of GDP in 2006 to 19 percent in 2007, aided by fast-growing remittance inflows,
booming prices of commodities (gold, copper, and energy), and buoyant partner demand for
Uzbek exports (Table 2). 2 Non-commodity exports grew by more than 40 percent two years
in a row. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows—mainly for hydrocarbons, textiles, and
food processing—picked up, but from a low base. As the central bank continued to intervene
to steadily depreciate the sum, the import cover of gross official reserves rose to 10 months
by end-2007. External debt (mostly public) fell further to 17½ percent of GDP.
6.
Inflation continued to be high in 2007. Increases in administered prices pushed up
the price index, while the large external surplus and sharp increases in wages and salaries
contributed to inflationary pressures. The authorities responded by adopting a tighter-thanbudgeted fiscal stance, tightening monetary conditions in late 2007, reducing the pace of
nominal depreciation of the sum, and limiting the pass-through of higher international food
prices through administrative measures, particularly during the fall of 2007 (Box 1). Fund
staff estimates of the CPI (based on the authorities’ raw data) indicate a pick up in inflation of
only ½ percentage point to 12 percent during 2007.

Despite the tightening of monetary conditions late in the year, the monetary
stance was accommodative for much of 2007. The policy of nominal depreciation of the
sum in the face of high external inflows complicated the conduct of monetary policy. Broad
money growth rose to 46 percent by end–2007, as the sharp increase in net foreign assets was
only partially sterilized by the accumulation of deposits in the Fund for Reconstruction and
Development (FRD) and the use of monetary policy instruments (Tables 3 and 4). Monetary
conditions were tightened aggressively at year-end and broad money growth slowed to
39 percent by March 2008.

Box 1. Impact of and Policy Response to Higher International Food and Fuel Prices
Self sufficiency, price controls, and trade policies have shielded Uzbekistan from the high international
food and fuel prices.
Uzbekistan is a net exporter of food and
energy. The country has become a net
exporter of food in the last two years, while
large energy exports have contributed to the
external surplus.

Prices of basic food items and energy
products are controlled. In 2007, retail
prices for flour, bread, and cooking oil were
increased by 16½, 17½, and 22½ percent,
respectively. At the same time, controls on
export of some food items (e.g. wheat, rice,

supply of low-priced foodstuffs for local
markets. Consequently, food inflation was reported at only 11.7 percent at end-2007, contributing about
6.8 percentage points to overall inflation. Domestic prices of petroleum products were increased on
average by 21 percent in 2007. However, their contribution to overall inflation was less than 1
percentage point given the low share of energy in the consumption basket. This was subsequently
followed by adjustments in administered prices for utilities in the range of 15 to 33 percent. According
to the authorities, the weight of goods and services with administered prices in CPI is 15 percent.

Costs arising from price controls are borne largely by the producers through the setting of wheat
procurement and crude oil prices below international levels. The authorities indicated that there is
no explicit subsidy from the budget related to food and petroleum products. Budgetary subsidies for
utilities amounted to only 0.1 percent of GDP in 2007. Grain producers benefited from loans from state
banks (about 1 percent of GDP) at a preferential interest rate of 3 percent.

The government is putting in place measures to improve the future supply situation. The acreage

oil and gas exploration and production are rising, but these will take time to translate into greater output
volumes.

8.
Fiscal policy was prudent and the outcome better than budgeted. The augmented
fiscal surplus remained unchanged from 2006 at about 5 percent of GDP, compared with a
budgeted deficit of 1 percent of GDP (Tables 5 and 6). The impact of the tax cuts and higher
wage and salary expenditures was offset by increased revenues—from higher international
commodity prices, VAT collections, and social security contributions—and a continued
decline in public investment. In an encouraging development, the statistical discrepancy
between above-the-line fiscal data and budget financing data declined significantly,
suggesting some improvement in data coverage and classification.
9.
Structural reforms progressed further in 2007. There was a concerted effort to
increase minimum bank capitalization. The authorities removed banks’ disincentives to
attract local currency deposits by unifying reserve requirements on foreign and local currency
deposits. Treasury modernization continued under the ongoing technical assistance project, as
did tax reforms (Box 2). Further, the restructuring of “shirkats” into private farms was
completed. Uzbekistan moved up slightly in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business
ranking to 138 in 2008, from 145 in 2007. However, rankings for activities such as trading
across borders, protecting investors, and dealing with licenses declined.
III. ECONOMIC PROSPECTS AND POLICIES OF THE AUTHORITIES
A. Outlook and Risks
10.
The economic outlook for 2008 is favorable. The authorities project GDP growth of
at least 8 percent, mainly driven by increases in industrial production (petrochemicals,
machinery building, and textiles). The current account surplus is projected to remain large,
with continued strong growth in exports and remittances, and official reserves are expected to
increase further. The authorities expect to curb inflationary pressures through tighter
monetary and continued prudent fiscal policies.
11.
Risks to the 2008 economic outlook currently appear limited. Growth prospects
for most of Uzbekistan’s trading partners are strong, despite downside risks, and commodity
prices are expected to remain buoyant. The Uzbek economy remains insulated from
developments in global financial markets because of its limited integration. Staff analysis of
vulnerabilities suggests that a 10 percent decline in international commodity prices would
reduce the current account surplus and government revenues by only about 1 percentage point
of GDP each. In case of such an adverse shock, the authorities expect a slower accumulation
of assets in the FRD, with the budget position excluding the FRD remaining broadly
unchanged.

10
Box 2. Tax and Treasury Reforms
In recent years, the Uzbek authorities have undertaken impressive tax and treasury reforms.
Tax Reforms. The authorities: (i) reduced taxes on profit and income while increasing taxes on
natural resources; (ii) streamlined the tax system by reducing the number of taxes and fees and
introducing a simplified taxation for SMEs ; (iii) unified the regulatory framework by bringing all laws
and regulations under a single comprehensive tax code in 2008; (iv) unified the accounting rules for
estimating the tax base and tax payments; and (v) reduced tax exemptions and concessions. At the
same time, reporting for tax purposes was simplified and the number of tax inspections reduced
considerably.

Treasury reforms. The areas of progress include: (i) adoption of a long-term strategy for public
financial management reform; (ii) formal establishment of the treasury (with regional branches) under
the ministry of finance; (iii) creation of the treasury single account system and gradual closure of
budget organizations’ accounts; and (iv) improved execution of expenditures through the treasury
system.

12.
The medium-term outlook is also favorable. The authorities target 8–9 percent
export-led GDP growth over the medium term. They contend that these ambitious targets are
achievable through consolidating macroeconomic stability, modernizing various sectors,
improving physical and social infrastructure, enhancing the role of the private sector, and
attracting FDI. They expect the current account to continue registering relatively large
surpluses. However, the recorded current account surplus should decline as external statistics
improve as debit items are properly recorded. The staff’s more conservative baseline scenario
based on current policies assumes that growth would slow down gradually to about 6 percent
as export growth slows and the economy faces capacity constraints, and the current account
surplus would decline gradually to 8 percent of GDP. With low and declining external and
public debt levels, the debt outlook is resilient to adverse shocks (Tables 7–10).

11
B. Macroeconomic Policy Mix to Reduce Inflation
13.
The authorities acknowledge inflation as a major near-term challenge and
intend to tighten monetary conditions significantly. They intend to limit reserve money
growth to about 28 percent (compared to 45 percent in 2007) by offsetting about three fourths
of the projected increase in official reserves through indirect monetary policy instruments and
higher government deposits, including in the FRD. Under this scenario, domestic inflationary
pressures would be reduced even though inflation would decline only marginally because
higher imported inflation would partly offset the impact of the tighter monetary policy stance.
Credit to the economy would increase by 31 percent.
14.
To support such a monetary policy, the authorities intend to maintain a prudent
fiscal stance in 2008. They project the augmented budget surplus to remain at about
5 percent of GDP. Such a surplus would be achieved through a large increase in savings of
commodity-based revenues in the FRD, while the consolidated government budget position
would weaken. The latter assumes conservatively that the tax-to-GDP ratio would decline
after the recent tax cuts and takes into account the authorities’ intention to further increase
wages and salaries, especially in health and education sectors. The authorities consider the
continued increase in public sector wages and salaries as essential, given their low level and
the need to attract high quality employees to the public sector and fight corruption. They also
prefer wage and salary increases to subsidies, which in their view are difficult to target, and
encourage corruption and smuggling of goods to neighboring countries.

15.
The authorities intend to continue with the policy of gradual nominal
depreciation of the sum. The strong external position is fueling monetary expansion in an
environment where the indirect monetary policy tools to effectively counter inflationary
pressures are limited and the interest rate channel is ineffective because of low monetization

12
and an underdeveloped money market. The authorities acknowledge that allowing a nominal
appreciation would take some pressure off indirect policy instruments and help control
monetary conditions and inflation, while meeting the credit needs of the economy. However,
they believe that the current policy of targeting a small nominal depreciation to support
exports and domestic production has served them well. Moreover, the authorities do not
agree with the staff assessment that the sum is undervalued (Box 3). Therefore, they plan to
continue with their exchange rate policy, but if inflation outcomes so demand, they would
consider slowing the rate of nominal depreciation, as in 2007.

The authorities plan to strengthen the financial sector to enhance its role in
economic growth. Notwithstanding recent progress, the financial system remains
underdeveloped with low intermediation (Box 4 and Tables 11 and 12). Non-core functions
of banks, including the obligation to report transactions to tax and customs authorities,
negatively affect public confidence in the banking system and encourage cash transactions.
The authorities acknowledge the importance of an effective financial system in strengthening
the conduct of monetary policy and facilitating medium-term growth. They have recently
allowed foreign exchange transactions in euros to help develop the foreign exchange market
and plan to continue increasing bank capitalization by 20 percent annually over the next few
years, sell 51 percent of Asaka Bank to a strategic partner, corporatize the National Bank of
Uzbekistan, and implement by 2010 BASEL II standards.
Financial intermermediation remains low in Uzbekistan

Box 3. Staff’s Assessment of the Exchange Rate Level
Following the trend of recent years, the real effective exchange rate depreciated by 1 percent in 2007,
while the nominal effective exchange rate depreciated by 7 percent.
Staff assesses the exchange rate as significantly
Uzbekistan: Real Exchange Rate, 2000–07
undervalued despite the complications in the
assessment arising from weaknesses in data quality
and existing import restrictions. Based on an outof-sample calibration of the CGER approaches and
estimates, the exchange rate is estimated to be
undervalued in the range of 9–28 percent (see
Table).

¾ Two approaches to estimating the underlying
current account balance were considered. In
scenario 1, the underlying balance was
estimated at the projected surplus in 2013
(8.4 percent of GDP). In scenario 2, the estimated surplus was reduced by the amount of the errors
of omissions projected for that year, which yielded an underlying surplus of 6 percent of GDP.
This assumes that the recorded current account surplus will narrow as Uzbekistan improves BOP
statistics, while export growth slows as the economy reaches capacity constraints. The estimates
also assume an NFA benchmark that is an average of the 2007 (26 percent) and projected 2013
(59 percent) NFA positions. This is to allow for a continued build up in international reserves, as
nonrenewable resource wealth is transformed to financial wealth and saved for intergenerational
equity purposes. The sensitivity analysis of the misalignment to the NFA position suggests that in
scenario 1 a 10 percentage point variation in the NFA-to-GDP ratio would change the degree of
misalignment by 1 and 4 percentage points under the MB and ES approaches, respectively.

¾ The equilibrium real exchange rate approach does not yield reliable results over the short sample
period (1992–2007). There is also no reason to believe that, on average, the real exchange rate was
in equilibrium over this period as Uzbekistan underwent considerable structural changes.

1/ Based on CGER methodologies (see SM/06/283). Misalignment is defined as the real exchange rate adjustment that would close
the gap between the estimated "current account norm" and the "underlying" external balance. Pooled estimates specification.

Notwithstanding the undervaluation, the staff is of the view that the balance of payments is unlikely to
lead to disruptive exchange rate movements over time because the financial system is not integrated
with global markets and in the event of higher international commodity prices the authorities could
increase savings in the FRD. Further, the poor quality of macroeconomic data, the application of
CGER coefficients to an out-of-sample country, and the restrictive trade policies introduce
considerable doubt about the degree of misalignment.

Box 4: Uzbek Banking Sector Developments and Issues
The banking system remains underdeveloped but relatively sound. The deposit base and
penetration (ratio of loans and assets to GDP) are one of the lowest in CIS countries. Average
bank profitability is also low. The system remains default-free and all banks are members of
the mandatory deposit insurance scheme. A recent Moody’s review of the banking system
found CBU’s on- and off-site supervision adequate.

Stress tests reveal low vulnerabilities. A
doubling of nonperforming loans and the
attendant provisioning would have only a
marginal impact on capital adequacy,
reducing it from the current 24 percent to 22
percent. Bank capital can sustain significant
appreciation and remain above the minimum
capital threshold of 10 percent.

State intervention remains prevalent. Bank
concentration is high—the top 5 banks own
70 percent of assets—and state banks account
for more than one half of system assets,
capital, and loan portfolio. Close government
control affects banks’ independence and
hampers competition. Banks are burdened
with non-core functions, including tax
withholding and finanical oversight.

foreign credit lines has fallen over time,
lowering foreign currency exposure of domestic banks. Nonperforming loans have stayed
stable as share of total lending.

Basic reforms should boost confidence and improve profitability and efficiency. A
removal of the non-core functions would boost confidence in the banking system and reduce
the need for de facto restrictions on cash withdrawals and high household deposit rates.
Profitability would be helped by reduced directed lending, lower household deposit rates, and
higher market rates on central bank paper held by commercial banks. The intended
privatization of the two large state banks should help improve the system’s competitiveness
and efficiency.

17.
Recent government decrees raised questions about Uzbekistan’s compliance with
international AML/CFT standards. According to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF),
the suspension of key AML/CFT provisions until 2013 and a 12–month deposit amnesty that
prohibits banks from seeking information on source of funds “effectively repeal” the Uzbek
AML/CFT’s regime. 3 The authorities insisted that the AML/CFT legislation conforms to
international standards and noted that they will undergo a full AML/CFT assessment by end2008 in keeping with their obligations to the Eurasian Group for Combating Money
Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism. They expressed their intention to consider the
recommendations of this review.
18.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to fiscal reforms. In addition to
ongoing tax and treasury reforms, they intend to strengthen tax enforcement to allow the taxrelated functions of banks to be discontinued; consolidate extra-budgetary funds and
government entities’ accounts into the consolidated budget to increase transparency;
introduce medium-term budgeting; and adopt the GFSM 2001 budget classification and
switch to standard accounting for budget preparation and reporting.

Trade liberalization is not on the
authorities’ reform agenda in the near future.
Consistent with the “localization program”,
customs tariff rates are among the highest in the
region and there are higher excise taxes on
imports relative to similar locally produced
goods. 4 The import process requires heavy
documentation and is time consuming. The
authorities noted that imports of raw materials
and capital goods are subject to low tariffs and
indicated that a reduction of high tariffs on
consumer and luxury goods is not envisaged.

Sources: Uzbek authorities; WEO; and Fund staff estimates.

FATF Statement, 28 February 2008, http://www.fatf-gafi.org/dataoecd/16/26/40181037.pdf

The simple average tariff is 14.9 percent and the weighted average tariff is 16.6 percent. In addition, various
taxes and fees are levied on imported goods.

16
20.
Market participants continue to report delays on sales of foreign exchange for
consumer goods. The authorities denied the existence of any de facto or de jure
convertibility restrictions and argued that consumer goods imports have been stable because
domestic production has increasingly met local demand. The authorities have provided all
current foreign exchange laws and regulations for a full-fledged review by the Legal
Department. The review did not identify any exchange restrictions or multiple currency
practices. The staff is keeping the issue of de facto delays on the sale of foreign exchange for
consumer goods under review.
D. Other Issues
21.
The de facto exchange rate regime has been reclassified. Based on the authorities’
interventions in the foreign exchange market in 2007 and the behavior of the nominal
exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate regime has been reclassified as a crawling peg from
the previous classification of conventional peg. The authorities agree with this classification
for the current regime and signaled their intention to transition gradually to a currency basket
(U.S. dollar and euro) as an operational target.

22.
The authorities intend to address weaknesses in economic data. Data limitations
and methodological differences do not allow for the use of a single measure of inflation for
policy discussions. The official CPI is based on inappropriate techniques that lead to a
systematic underestimation, while large differences among various price indices hinder the
evaluation of inflationary pressures in the economy. National income accounts employ
inadequate valuation methods and data from the expenditure side are inconsistent with
external sector and public finance data. Large errors and omissions in the balance of

17
payments point to inadequate coverage and classification, and complicate the assessment of
the exchange rate level. The prohibition on dissemination of balance of payments data among
government agencies impedes coordination of macroeconomic policy. The authorities
indicated their commitment to address capacity constraints and improve statistics, working
closely with the statistical advisors provided by the Fund. 5
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
23.
The Uzbek economy has performed well in recent years, benefiting from a
favorable external environment and an improved policy framework. The authorities’
response to high export commodity prices has been prudent and has generally contributed to
macroeconomic stability. The current strength of the Uzbek economy presents the authorities
with an opportunity to undertake the necessary reforms to achieve their short-and mediumterm objectives.
24.
The main policy challenge in 2008 is to reduce inflationary pressures, and staff
welcomes the envisaged tightening in monetary policy. However, the current policy mix is
not sustainable. Given the strength of the balance of payments, the staff recommends a more
flexible exchange rate policy, that allows appreciation, to take pressure off monetary and
fiscal policies.
25.
The sum real exchange rate appears to be significantly undervalued.
Uzbekistan’s economic fundamentals have strengthened significantly and a real appreciation
of the exchange rate is inevitable. Staff recommends allowing this to take place through
nominal appreciation rather than inflation, as this would create less economic distortions,
give the CBU control of money supply, provide room for high private sector credit, and lower
the sterilization burden on fiscal policy. In staff’s view, a gradual appreciation of the sum is
unlikely to hurt exports provided structural reforms that facilitate the business environment
are stepped up.
26.
The staff commends the authorities’ prudent fiscal stance, which is essential in
the short term to support monetary policy. The use of commodity revenue windfalls as an
important sterilization tool is appropriate in the current environment of high inflation. Over
the medium term, however, given the low level of public debt, reducing inflation and
adopting a more flexible exchange rate policy would allow the authorities space to reduce
fiscal savings to finance social and infrastructure expenditures. Despite the current strong
fiscal position, the staff cautions against continued sharp increases in public sector wages and

salaries in light of their impact on private sector wages and salaries and hence on the
competitiveness of the Uzbek economy.
27.
Strong reforms will be needed to sustain high growth rates. The authorities’
ambitious medium-term growth objectives will require that the macroeconomic policy mix
allows domestic demand to play a larger role in contributing to medium–term growth;
financial intermediation is enhanced; the trade system is liberalized; price controls are phased
out and replaced by transfer programs that can reach the poor effectively; and the difficult
business environment improves. Otherwise, with current policies, that are biased in favor of
externally-driven growth, staff expects growth to slow gradually.
28.
Financial sector reforms are critical for sustained growth. The staff urges the
authorities to discontinue immediately the non-core functions of banks and eliminate any
remaining de facto restrictions on cash withdrawals and transactions. Such reforms should
allow elimination of other policy measures to promote deposits, including the deposit
amnesty, very high deposit rates on household deposits, and their exemption from the
statutory reserve requirement. The plans to continue increasing bank capitalization over the
next few years are encouraging and should further strengthen the banking system. The staff
recommends that the authorities ensure compliance with international AML/CFT standards.
29.
The authorities’ steadfast implementation of tax and treasury reforms is
welcome. The priority going forward should be to complete the introduction of the treasury
single account, improve tax enforcement, and switch to standard accounting for budget
preparation and reporting.
30.
Trade liberalization is critical if the Uzbek economy is to sustain high growth
through private sector development. The staff advises the authorities to lower and unify
tariffs for all economic agents, eliminate differences in excises on imported and domestic
goods, remove restrictions on exports (including food items), reduce administrative costs in
international trade, streamline customs procedures, and accelerate efforts for WTO accession.
The staff also urges the authorities to fully adhere to their obligations under Article VIII of
the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
31.
There is an urgent need to improve the quality of economic statistics, which
significantly hampers surveillance. In particular, the staff recommends expeditious
progress in addressing weaknesses in price indices and developing national income accounts
from the expenditure side by utilizing fully the services of the IMF-provided statistical
advisors. The staff also recommends better dissemination of economic data and participation
in the GDDS.
32.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation discussions with Uzbekistan take
place within a 12-month cycle.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments, as well as the large errors and omissions term
in the balance of payments due to data shortcomings, which hinder a full analysis. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 8 years, subject to data availability.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), noninterest current account in percent of GDP, and nondebt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the
baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level
after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

The exchange rate is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. However, the
market has been characterized by one sided interventions by the Central Bank of Uzbekistan
leading to exchange rate stability against the U.S. dollar since April 2007, with a band of
+/-1 percent around the trend line. The exchange rate regime is classified as a crawling peg.
Uzbekistan accepted the obligations of Article VIII Sections 2(a), 3 and 4 of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreements with effect on October 15, 2003.

expected to have a financial arrangement with the Fund in the near future.
XIII. Technical Assistance:
Technical assistance and training have been provided by the Fund (MAE, FAD, STA, LEG,
and INS) to Uzbekistan in a number of areas. Technical assistance is now being provided on
budget and treasury reforms, price indices, national income accounts, and balance of
payments statistics through assistance of resident advisors.
Monetary and exchange affairs:
April 2002 mission: External public debt management (with the participation of a
World Bank consultant; the mission was carried out in the framework of a joint IMFSwiss regional project for countries in the Swiss constituency, financed by the
Government of Switzerland).

4
In October 2003, a member of MFD participated in a staff visit to review the foreign
exchange system, and assist the government in identifying the foreign exchange
restrictions and multiple currency practices that needed to be abolished before the
authorities accept the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4, of the IMF’s
Articles of Agreement.
Fiscal affairs:
October/November 2002 mission: Public expenditure management review.
September 2004 mission: Public expenditure management review.
Statistical issues:
March 2000 mission: Balance of payments statistics.
April 2000 mission: Money and banking statistics.
November 2003 mission: National accounts and price statistics.
August/September 2004 mission: National accounts statistics.
May 2007 mission: National income, prices, and balance of payments statistics.
Legal issues:
The Fund has provided advice and assistance to the Government and the
Central Bank of Uzbekistan on a range of legal issues, especially relating to foreign
exchange and banking legislation. In particular, in 2000 and in 2002, a member of
LEG conducted a review of the foreign exchange regulations. In October 2003,
another member of LEG participated in a staff visit to assist the government in
identifying the foreign exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices that
needed to be abolished before the authorities accept the obligations of Article VIII,
sections 2, 3, and 4, of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement.
Training:
Uzbek officials have participated in courses in Washington, at the IMF-Singapore
Training Institute, and at the Joint Vienna Institute in the areas of macroeconomic
management, financial programming, taxation, public expenditure and treasury
management, monetary statistics and policy, and balance of payments analysis.
Courses on selected topics were also organized in Tashkent in June 1993, May 1994,
and April/May 1998.

5

XIV. Resident Representative:
The Fund’s first Resident Representative, Istvan Szalkai, was in Tashkent from
September 1993 to September 1995. His successor, Mark O’Brien, served from
November 1995 to December 1997. He was replaced by Christoph Rosenberg who served
from January 1998 to April 2001. Currently, the Fund does not have a resident representative
in Uzbekistan, but maintains a locally staffed office in Tashkent.
XV.

Resident Advisors:

Richard Grzebinski served as an advisor on computerization to the State Tax Committee
from January 1994 to January 1995. His successor, Mr. Emmanuel Sigler, served from April
to June 1995.
Alexander Agafonoff served as an advisor on monetary policy at the Central Bank of
Uzbekistan from November 1994 to December 1995.
Jim Stevenson began his service as an advisor on treasury operations at the Ministry of
Finance in September 1996. His assignment was prematurely terminated in July 1998
because of a lack of cooperation by the ministry of finance.
John Zohrab began his service in January 2003 as an advisor to the ministry of finance. He
assisted the authorities with the Public Financial Management (PFM) project, including
treasury modernization, while visiting Tashkent from Georgia. In November 2006, he was
relocated to Tashkent to assist with PFM project implementation, continuation of treasury
reform, and PFM legal framework strengthening.
Devi Manraj began her long-term technical assistance project as a regional resident advisor
based in Tashkent in January 2008. Her terms of reference envisage assisting the authorities
with real sector statistics, in particular addressing the shortcomings in the national income
accounts and price statistics.
Nataliya Ivanyk, a regional resident advisor in external sector statistics started her assistance
to the Uzbek authorities in February 2008. The objective of her assignment is to improve the
quality of balance of payments statistics (in particular address the persistently negative errors
and omissions item), assist the authorities with compilation of the international investment
position statistics, and facilitate reporting of these data to the Fund on a regular basis for
publication.

ANNEX II: UZBEKISTAN–RELATIONS WITH SELECTED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS
The World Bank
(As of May 31, 2008)
1.
Uzbekistan became a member of the IBRD and IDA in September 1992, of the IFC in
October 1993, and of the MIGA in November 1993. Prior to FY02, Uzbekistan was an
IBRD-only borrower. In December 2001, it became a blend country eligible for both IBRD
and IDA borrowing but the last lending operation to Uzbekistan, which was approved in
October 2006, was an IDA-only credit.
2.
As of June 7, 2008, there are two IBRD loans, two blend IBRD-IDA operations and
two IDA credits in the active portfolio, namely: Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
(US$75 million, approved August 1997); Rural Enterprise Support (US$36.14 million,
approved December 2001); Bukhara/Samarkand Water Supply (US$20 million IBRD loan
and SDR15.9 million IDA credit, approved March 2002); Drainage, Irrigation and Wetland
Management (US$35 million IBRD loan and SDR18.4 million IDA credit, approved June
2003); Health II Credit (SDR26.9 million, approved September 2004), and Basic Education
(US$15 million, October 2006). The undisbursed balance of the ongoing projects as of endMarch 2008 was US$130.7 million and the IBRD and IDA net commitments as of endMarch 2008 was US$252.3 million.
3.
The Bank’s non-lending activities in Uzbekistan in recent years have included a
country procurement assessment (FY02), a living standards/poverty assessment (FY03), a
country economic memorandum (FY03), an investment climate assessment (FY04), a public
expenditure review (FY04), a financial accountability assessment (FY04), a number of policy
notes under a programmatic public expenditure review and a programmatic poverty
assessment (FY05 – 07), a governance assessment in the health sector (FY08) and a health
and nutrition study (FY08). Presently the Bank is continuing economic and advisory work
within the framework of technical assistance in line with the government’s Welfare
Improvement Strategy (PRSP). The areas covered by this technical assistance include
microfinancing, housing financing and efficiency of public utilities. The Bank is also
currently providing — or administering on behalf of other donors—several grants, including
grants for the development of capacity of public sector audit institutions and for wheat flour
fortification.
4.
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Uzbekistan covering FY02–04
expired in July 2004. The World Bank prepared an interim strategy note for Uzbekistan for
FY07–08 centering on technical assistance, capacity building and advisory services which
was discussed by the Bank’s Executive Directors in July 2006. The interim strategy
maintains the World Bank’s focus on alleviating poverty in Uzbekistan by continuing to
engage the authorities on governance and economic recovery, and trying to reach out to civil

7
society. The new CAS for Uzbekistan for FY08-11 is scheduled for the review on June 12,
2008. The proposed CAS focuses on key areas of support for human development: improved
access to safe water, improved health status, improved incomes in rural areas, and protection
of the environment.
5.
Since Uzbekistan became an IFC member in 1993, the IFC has committed nearly
US$68 million of its own funds and has arranged for over US$13 million in syndications.
The IFC has focused its activities on supporting SMEs, developing financial markets and
leasing and providing TA to improve the business environment. IFC has provided SME
credit lines to Asaka Bank, Hamkorbank, and Parvina Bank. In addition, IFC approved a
second SME credit Line to Hamkorbank coupled with technical assistance to strengthen bank
management and operations. IFC is also considering the possibility of starting a new
Microfinance Bank in Uzbekistan jointly with EBRD, ADB, KfW and a private microfinance
provider. IFC will continue to seek qualified private intermediaries for investment under the
IFC Central Asia Leasing Facility, such as UzKDB (Uzbekistan Korea Development Bank)
and other institutions for future SME credit lines. IFC is also a significant shareholder in the
Central Asia Small Enterprise Fund (CASEF) that provides equity and quasi-equity to local
enterprises—CASEF has made four equity investments to date in Uzbekistan. IFC recently
provided $10 million to Aureos Central Asia fund which will invest in SMEs in Kazakhstan,
Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
Furthermore, the IFC has selectively invested in the real sector which included projects in the
pharmaceutical industry, furniture manufacturing, granite processing and cheese production.
6.
On the technical assistance side, the IFC has been very active through the Private
Enterprise Partnership Central Asia on improving financial intermediation for micro and
small business enterprises as well as improvements to the business environment. For
example, in 2002 the IFC helped to develop new leasing legislation which improved
considerably financing options for SMEs, and in 2005 with IFC support, seven new
Presidential decrees were adopted to help improve the business-enabling environment for
SMEs. Ongoing TA projects include the SME survey and business environment reform
policy project and, the leasing and mortgage development work. The IFC will continue to
promote private sector development through dedicated technical assistance aiming to
improve the business environment and legislation, as well as continue to support financing to
SMEs and micro-enterprises. As of April 2008, the IFC portfolio stood at US$9 million, with
99 percent in financial markets and 1 percent in the real sector. The portfolio is
predominantly composed of loans.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
(As of May 31, 2008)
7.
Uzbekistan became a member of the EBRD in 1992. The current Country Strategy
covering the period 2005-2008 was approved in July 2005. The Strategy noted that although

8
some progress had been achieved on the economic side since 2003, the transition targets set
in the intermediary strategy had not been met, and as a result the Country Strategy suspended
the public sector operations. It mentioned, however, that the Bank would stay engaged in
Uzbekistan and focus its activities on private sector investment and entrepreneurship.
8.
The EBRD’s cumulative commitments of EUR 467 million are concentrated in three
main areas: financial institutions (34.3 percent), natural resources and energy (27.8 percent),
and infrastructure (22.9 percent). Most of the Bank’s funding is in the form of debt (93
percent of the Bank’s portfolio in Uzbekistan) with only EUR 31 million in equity
investment. The current disbursement ratio is 87.4 percent of total commitments. Overall,
EBRD’s portfolio is performing well, with the exception of one private sector operation in
the textiles sector. With 41 percent of EBRD’s outstanding portfolio in the private sector, the
Bank’s operations in Uzbekistan are below the target ratio of 60 percent, reflecting modest
role of the private sector in the economy and also a consequence of the low level of western
FDI, a main source of business volume for the Bank. In terms of business volume, the
limitations of the Strategy and the difficulties in the investment climate had brought it down
to EUR 4 million in 2006, increased it to EUR 17 million in 2007, with a target of EUR 20
million for 2008.
9.
A new Country Strategy for 2009–11 will be discussed with the Uzbek authorities as
of mid-2008 possibly in view of reopening some cooperation with the public sector, and will
be presented to the Board in early 2009.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
(As of May 31, 2008)
10.
Uzbekistan became a member of the ADB in 1995. The current Country Strategy and
Program (CSP) for Uzbekistan was endorsed by the ADB Board of Directors in March 2006.
The CSP covering 2006–10 aims to continue to support the country’s transition to a marketbased economy and its integration with the global economy. In line with the country’s own
strategic priorities, the ADB plans to have its operations focus on four key areas: (i) rural
development, (ii) promotion of private sector development, (ii) regional cooperation in
transport and customs transit, and (iv) improvement of social services with an emphasis on
early childhood development and basic education.
11.
The CSP envisages that the ADB provides loans to Uzbekistan of about US$100
million a year over the next three years and about US$2 million a year for technical
assistance (TA) grant for support of capacity building and policy and institutional reforms.
The authorities and the ADB agree to review the CSP from time to time and update the
ADB’s operations programs, in line with the country’s changing needs and in consultation
with development of other development partners’ programs. Currently, the ADB and the
Government are discussing on the Country Operation and Business Plan for 2009-2011.
12.
Uzbekistan plays an important role in regional cooperation. The ADB commends
Uzbekistan’s active participation and support for the Central Asia Regional Economic

9
Cooperation (CAREC) program. The ADB encourages Uzbekistan to continue playing an
active role in regional cooperation.
13.
The actual achievement of the ADB’s operations in Uzbekistan will depend on the
progress in the country’s implementation capacity, and relevant policy and institutional
reforms in the areas of the ADB operations. The newly approved technical assistance project,
entitled “Policy and Institutional Reform Support,” is to assist the Government to implement
Welfare Improvement Strategy of Uzbekistan: 2008-2010.
14.
The ADB’s operational approach has been a constructive engagement in Uzbekistan,
with its assistance tailored to the pace and direction of reforms undertaken by the
government. The ADB's approach to investment lending has taken into account (i) impact on
poverty reduction; (ii) contribution to regional cooperation through CAREC; (iii)
contribution to formulation and implementation of the government's reform strategies and
policies; and (iv) implementation progress of existing projects in the sector under
consideration.
15.
During the ADB annual meeting in May 2008, President Haruhiko Kuroda announced
$500 million in immediate budgetary support to tackle rising food costs in Asia-Pacific
region and pledged to double lending to $2 billion for agriculture in 2009. In 2008, ADB is
already planning to lend $1 billion to the agricultural and natural sector and will double its
lending to the sector to over US$2 billion in 2009. In addition, the ADB will provide up to
$500 million as immediate budgetary support to the hardest-hit countries in Asia-Pacific for
safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable in the face of rising food prices. The ADB is of
the view that this will help governments alleviate the fiscal burden so that they can bring
food to the table of the vulnerable, poor and needy. These resources could also be used to
import food grains and agricultural inputs such as fertilizers.
16.
As of 31 December 2007, cumulative lending to Uzbekistan was $1.1 billion
equivalent for 23 loans. Of these, 19 loans for $872.3 million were provided from Ordinary
Capital Resource (OCR) and four loans for $102.6 million equivalent from ADF. Education
account for the largest share of lending (27%), followed by agriculture and natural resources
(25%) and transport and communication (19%). Average annual lending over the period
1997-2006 was $92.5 million and $57.6 million for 2005-2006. Annual lending levels have
been uneven with a hiatus in lending in 1999, and a peak of $236.5 million in 2002. The
ADB has provided 67 TA grants to Uzbekistan totaling $34 million. As of year end 2007,
cumulative direct value-added cofinancing for Uzbekistan amounted to $62 million for 2
investment projects, and $2.4 million for 5 technical assistance projects.
At the end of December 2007, the portfolio had no project “at risk.” Overall, the ADB
portfolio performance is rated satisfactory in terms of impact and outcome, and
implementation progress. Contract awards in 2007 totaled $49.3 million, bringing the
cumulative figure to $468.1 million. Disbursements during the year totaled $59.3 million,
bringing cumulative disbursements to $433.6 million.

10
ANNEX III: UZBEKISTAN—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provided to the Fund, and particularly price and national accounts statistics,
have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. The authorities do not
participate in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and have yet to
approve publication of a country page in International Financial Statistics (IFS). At the
request of the authorities, an STA evaluation mission visited the State Statistics Committee
(SSC) in May 2007 to assess the need for IMF technical assistance to improve national
accounts, price, and balance of payments (BOP) statistics.
Real sector statistics
2.
Despite some progress in the implementation of the 1993 System of National
Accounts, the 2007 assessment mission determined that the methodology for compiling the
annual GDP estimates should be improved, particularly the constant price estimates.
Appropriate procedures need to be developed for reconciling production and expenditurebased estimates of GDP. Discrete quarterly GDP estimates are not compiled. The collection
of primary source data for compiling national accounts statistics relies predominantly on the
old Soviet-type system (including complete enumeration of legal units, collection of
cumulative data, use of numerous fragmented survey questionnaires, and classification of
economic activities according to the old material product system). The restructuring of the
data collection system should start as soon as possible (with a target to implement new
collection procedures at least partially for the collection of data for 2009). 1 A long-term
resident advisor in real sector statistics was posted in the SSC as of January 2008 to
implement the work program..
3.
The official CPI is based on inappropriate techniques that lead to a systematic
underestimation of inflationary pressures. Hence, Fund staff estimates an alternative CPI
(based on the authorities’ raw data). During the February 2005 Article IV mission, technical
assistance was provided to SSC staff in implementing international standards for treatment of
seasonal goods in the CPI, however, implementation is pending. No progress has been
achieved either on implementing the Fund’s recommendation for computing an index for the
fruits and vegetable group in the Uzbek consumer price index. The long-term resident
advisor in real sector statistics is also working on this issue.
4.
In external trade statistics, exports of cotton and other bulk exports are valued on a
c.i.f. basis rather than f.o.b. Some adjustments are made to capture informal cross-border
1

With the assistance from Eurostat under the TACIS program, the SSC introduced sample surveys of small
businesses and informal economic activities, which also use integrated survey questionnaires. The SCS expects
to receive further assistance from Eurostat in service statistics, national accounts (particularly, non-observed
economy), and external trade.

11
trade and shuttle trade. Two parallel systems are used for compiling trade data—one based
on customs declarations and the other based on enterprise surveys. STA has recommended
that the customs data be used for compiling merchandise trade statistics and the enterprise
reports to collect data on trade in services only.
Government finance statistics
5.
Detailed data on revenue and expenditure of the consolidated government budget are
compiled by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) on a monthly basis, and are available after a
processing time of about four weeks. Data for extrabudgetary funds are available quarterly
with a longer delay, and include only broad categories of revenue and expenditure of the four
largest funds. The authorities occasionally provide fiscal tables that include net lending,
foreign-financed investment, and details on the financing of the deficit. A persisting
statistical discrepancy between the financing of the budget based on the above-the-line and
below-the-line data points to possible coverage and classification issues. The authorities do
not reconcile the monetary and fiscal financing data on a regular basis.
6.
Budget expenditure data are organized according to a largely functional classification.
An economic classification is available only annually, but the quality of these data is
inadequate. The MoF occasionally provides data on tax arrears. Information on total proceeds
from privatization operations and Treasury bills are provided on a quarterly basis, and data
on issues and repayments of Treasury bills are available monthly on request.
7.
In February 2003, following an October 2002 mission, FAD sent a resident advisor to
assist the authorities in developing efficient expenditure management procedures, including
budget and treasury reforms. As part of this project, substantial progress has been achieved in
developing a new Chart of Accounts, conforming to government finance statistics (GFS)
guidelines, while the Treasury Law was revised and approved by Parliament in August 2004.
The authorities have published data on 2005 Budget execution as well as on the 2006 Budget
on the official website of the MoF.
8.

Uzbekistan does not report GFS to STA.

Monetary and financial statistics
9.
Following the introduction of new charts of accounts for the Central Bank of
Uzbekistan (CBU) and for the commercial banks in 1997, a number of missions have assisted
the CBU in compiling monetary statistics using data from the new charts of accounts and in
accordance with the IMF recommended methodology. With the implementation of major
recommendations of these missions, a draft IFS page for Uzbekistan has been prepared by
STA and sent to the authorities for approval. Action by the authorities is pending.
Balance of payments and external debt
10.
Uzbekistan does not report balance of payments statistics to STA. A March 2000
STA mission (a follow-up to the February 1998 mission) reported that the authorities had
made considerable progress in compiling balance of payments statistics in line with the

12
recommendations of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).
Nevertheless, problems remain, including the large and persistently negative errors and
omissions item, which points to inadequate coverage and underreporting of debit
transactions.
11.
The 2007 STA assessment mission identified the need for a two-year period of
technical assistance on external sector statistics. It proposed that the objectives should be to
improve the quality of balance of payments data, to compile international investment position
statistics, and to facilitate reporting of these data to STA on a regular and timely basis for
publication. The IMF regional advisor on external sector statistics conducted the first mission
in February 2008.
12.
Legal and institutional issues were found to hamper the compilation and
dissemination of external sector statistics as well as the delivery of technical assistance.
These include: (i) the balance of payments statistics together with relevant source data are
treated as classified data, which impedes not only the pace of statistical development but also
interagency data sharing; (ii) the restricted access to data strongly affects the efficiency of
technical assistance work; (iii) there is no legal framework to clearly defining the
responsibility to compile the international investment position and gross external debt
statistics.
13.
The mission made efforts to analyze the reasons for the large and persistently
negative errors and omissions item. Key factors include the understatement of debit entries
such as imports of services, income payments (including for FDI), and shuttle trade (most
likely with a negative balance). Undercoverage of outflows (FDI and nonbank assets abroad)
was also identified. Detailed time series data were not available to the mission to quantify the
impact of each of the items identified.
14.
Data provision on external debt has improved considerably since 2003 and is broadly
satisfactory. Data on external government and government-guaranteed debt, including
projections of future debt service obligations, are provided by the MoF in U.S. dollars. The
data are submitted with quarterly frequency, though often with considerable delay. Aggregate
data are broken down into government and government-guaranteed debt and further
classified by type of lender (multilateral, bilateral, and commercial). The authorities do not
separately indicate the amount of concessional debt, the amount of private debt owed or debt
intermediated by banks. The data include projections of future debt service obligations under
existing agreements.
15.
Data on external private debt not guaranteed by the government, including projections
of future debt service obligations and new loan agreements, are provided by the central bank.
Aggregate data are submitted on a quarterly basis.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Uzbekistan
On July 14, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Uzbekistan.1
Background
The Uzbek economy has performed well in recent years. The favorable external environment
and improvements in macroeconomic policies resulted in high growth rates, large current
account surpluses, a significant decline in the debt burden, and a more than quadrupling of
foreign exchange reserves from 2003 to 2007.
Growth accelerated in 2007. Official statistics indicate that GDP grew by 9½ percent, driven by
trade, transport and communications, industry, and services. Available evidence suggests
private investment rose as enterprises benefited from lower taxes and moderate improvements
in the business environment. Consumption was supported by higher wages and salaries and
increased remittance inflows.
The external position strengthened further. The current account surplus rose to 19 percent of
GDP in 2007, aided by fast-growing remittance inflows, booming prices of commodities (gold,
copper, and energy), and buoyant partner demand for Uzbek exports. Foreign direct
investment inflows picked up, but from a low base. The import cover of gross official reserves
rose to 10 months by end-2007. External debt (mostly public) fell further to 17½ percent of
GDP.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

Inflation continued to be high in 2007. Increases in administered prices pushed up the price
index, while the large external surplus and sharp increases in wages and salaries contributed
to inflationary pressures. The authorities responded, including by adopting a tighter-thanbudgeted fiscal stance, tightening monetary conditions in late 2007, and reducing the pace of
nominal depreciation of the sum. Fund staff estimates of the CPI (based on the authorities’ raw
data) indicate a pick up in inflation during 2007 of only ½ percentage point to 12 percent.
Despite the tightening of monetary conditions later in the year, the monetary stance was
accommodative for much of 2007. Broad money growth rose to 46 percent by end-2007, as
the sharp increase in net foreign assets was only partially sterilized by the accumulation of
deposits in the Fund for Reconstruction and Development and the use of monetary policy
instruments. Monetary conditions were tightened aggressively at year end and broad money
growth slowed to 39 percent by March 2008.
Fiscal policy was prudent and the outcome better than budgeted. The augmented fiscal
surplus remained unchanged from 2006 at about 5 percent of GDP, compared with a budgeted
deficit of 1 percent of GDP. The impact of tax cuts and higher wage and salary expenditures
was offset by increased revenues—from higher international commodity prices, VAT
collections, and social security contributions—and a continued decline in public investment.
Structural reforms progressed further in 2007. Most importantly, there was a concerted effort to
increase minimum bank capitalization; treasury modernization and tax reforms continued; and
the restructuring of “shirkats” into private farms was completed. Uzbekistan moved up slightly
in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ranking. However, rankings for activities such as
trading across borders, protecting investors, and dealing with licenses declined.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for Uzbekistan’s continued strong economic
performance, which has benefited from a generally favorable external environment and an
improved policy framework. Directors concurred that the current strength of the Uzbek
economy provides an excellent opportunity to move forward with the necessary reforms to
sustain high growth rates in a stable macroeconomic environment.
Directors agreed that the main policy challenge in 2008 will be to reduce inflationary
pressures, and welcomed the envisaged tightening in monetary policy. Given the strength of
Uzbekistan’s balance of payments position, Directors considered that a move towards a more
flexible exchange rate policy, allowing the sum to appreciate, would provide much-needed
support in easing inflationary pressures, and help relieve pressure on monetary and fiscal
policies. While recognizing the difficulties and large uncertainties surrounding the assessment
of the real effective exchange rate level of the sum, most Directors supported the view that the
sum is undervalued. Given the significant strengthening of Uzbekistan’s fundamentals, they
considered that a real appreciation of the exchange rate would be inevitable. Allowing this
appreciation to take place through nominal appreciation rather than inflation would lessen
economic distortions, give the central bank greater control of the money supply, provide room
for the growth of private sector credit, and lower the burden on fiscal policy of the sterilization
of foreign exchange inflows.

Directors commended the authorities for their prudent fiscal stance and the saving of a
considerable part of commodity revenues in the Fund for Reconstruction and Development
(FRD), which serves as an important sterilization tool in the effort to reduce inflation. Over the
medium term, as inflationary pressures abate in the context of a more balanced policy mix,
there should be scope to reduce fiscal savings to finance needed social and infrastructure
expenditures. At the same time, Directors called for continued fiscal prudence, and cautioned
against continued sharp increases in public sector wages.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ steadfast implementation of tax and treasury reforms. The
priorities going forward should be to complete the introduction of the treasury single account,
improve tax enforcement, and switch to standard accounting for budget preparation and
reporting.
Directors emphasized the importance of a strong structural reform agenda to sustain high
growth rates. A macroeconomic policy setting that would allow domestic demand to make a
larger contribution to growth should be underpinned by enhanced financial intermediation, a
liberalized price and trade system, and an improved business environment.
Directors considered that financial sector reforms will be especially important. They welcomed
the plans to continue increasing bank capitalization over the next few years, which should
further strengthen the banking system. Directors encouraged the authorities to discontinue as
soon as possible the non-core functions of banks and eliminate any remaining de facto
restrictions on cash withdrawals and transactions. These reforms should also allow the
elimination of current distortionary policies to attract deposits. Directors called on the
authorities to comply fully with international AML/CFT standards.
Directors underscored the important role that trade liberalization would play in supporting
private sector development. They encouraged the authorities to lower tariffs, eliminate
differences in excises on imported and domestic goods, remove export restrictions, reduce
international trade administrative costs, and accelerate efforts for WTO accession. They called
on the authorities to ensure that sales of foreign exchange for imports of consumer goods are
honored on a timely basis.
Directors underscored the importance of giving urgent priority to making tangible
improvements in the quality of economic statistics, to strengthen the effectiveness of policy
planning and surveillance. They called on the authorities to work closely with the IMF-provided
statistical advisors in addressing weaknesses in price indices, the national income accounts,
and the balance of payments statistics. Directors also encouraged the authorities to enhance
the dissemination of economic data, and to participate in the General Data Dissemination
Standard (GDDS).
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Thomas Moser, Executive Director for the Republic of Uzbekistan
July 14, 2008

1.
My Uzbek authorities would like to thank the staff for the constructive 2008 Article
IV discussions and the concise report. They would like me to convey to the Executive Board
and to Management that they highly appreciate the staff’s analysis and considerations as a
valuable input to policy formulation. In general, the Uzbek authorities share the staff’s views
on the countries short- and medium-term challenges, and in particular on the importance of
reducing inflationary pressures and sustaining high growth rates.
2.
Since the last Article IV consultation, Uzbekistan’s macroeconomic performance
continued to be strong. Economic growth has been high, exports and foreign direct
investment inflows have increased, and external debt has declined to 17.5 percent of GDP.
This good economic performance, which has now lasted for several years, has been
supported by prudent macroeconomic policies and gradual structural reforms. The
commodity revenue windfalls have largely been saved and tax, treasury, and financial sector
reforms have further advanced. Going forward, the economic outlook continues to be good
and downside risks are limited. The authorities are committed to maintaining macroeconomic
stability, advance structural reforms, improve the business environment, and modernize and
expand critical infrastructure.
3.
The Uzbek authorities believe that their economic policies aimed at modernizing the
economy by diversifying industrial production from raw material production towards
manufacturing products with higher value added, by developing the services sector, and by
improving the competitiveness of the Uzbek economy have been successful and succeeded in
promoting employment for the rapidly growing young labor force. The share of finished
goods in exports as well as the private sector share in GDP have steadily increased, and job
creation has been strong. At the same time, the agricultural sector has also been modernized
by transforming the large scale cooperative farms into private farms.
4.
As described in Box 2 of the staff report, the Uzbek authorities have undertaken
comprehensive fiscal reforms in recent years. The GFSM 2001 budget classification is being
adopted and will be applied to the 2010 budget preparation. The consolidation of extrabudgetary funds and government entities’ accounts into the consolidated budget is scheduled
for 2011, but might even be achieved earlier. The authorities will also continue treasury
modernization and strengthen tax enforcement further. This in turn will allow further reforms
in the banking sector, building on the increase in capitalization and the unification of the
reserve requirements on foreign and local currency deposits.

2
5.
In order to contain inflationary pressures, the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) will
continue to limit reserve money growth through indirect monetary policy instruments and
sterilization, including through continued accumulation of deposits in the Fund for
Reconstruction and Development (FRD). As noted in the staff report, the CBU will monitor
inflation closely and revisit its exchange rate policy if necessary. The CBU is also planning
to transition to a USD-Euro currency basket as an operational target. However, the
authorities do not share the staff’s assessment that the real sum exchange rate is significantly
undervalued.
6.
The Uzbek authorities share the staff’s view that economic data quality needs to be
further improved. There has been significant progress with regard to data coverage and
classification for fiscal data. The authorities hope that the technical assistance currently
provided by the Fund will help them to also improve price indices, national income accounts,
and balance of payments statistics.
