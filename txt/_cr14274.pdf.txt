STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 14, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context and outlook: Angola’s recent economic developments have been positive, but
softening oil revenue and limited proven oil reserves highlight the need to contain
emerging fiscal deficits, preserve policy buffers, and continue diversifying the economy.
Focus of consultation: Discussions focused on mitigating the main risks to the
macroeconomic framework and, inter alia, policies to return to structural fiscal surpluses
over the medium term, and to support economic diversification and inclusive growth,
the modernization of the monetary policy framework, and financial stability.
Key policy recommendations:











Return to structural fiscal surpluses in line with the objective set forth in Angola’s
Sovereign Wealth Fund, by mobilizing additional nonoil tax revenue, improving the
efficiency of public investment, and reducing current spending, including by phasing
out the costly and regressive fuel subsidies—while mitigating the impact on the poor
through well-targeted social assistance.
Adopt an improved medium-term fiscal framework, focusing on the structural fiscal
balance to limit the impact of the oil sector on the nonoil economy.
Develop a coherent asset-liability management framework, including a
well-designed stabilization fund to shield the budget from oil revenue fluctuations.
Further improve public financial management systems to avoid, inter alia, a
recurrence in the future of domestic payments arrears.
Continue improving the business climate to boost economic development,
diversification, and competitiveness.
In transitioning over the medium-term toward an inflation targeting regime, enhance
the central bank’s capacity to collect and analyze high-frequency economic data, and
continue de-dollarizing the economy.
Further strengthen the financial system, by continuing to improve the transparency
and accountability of banks, and enhancing bank supervision.
Manage public guarantees transparently and with a view to minimize fiscal costs, as
envisaged in the recently-approved law on public guarantees.

BACKGROUND
1.
Angola was hard hit by the global crisis, but restored macroeconomic stability under
the Stand-By Arrangement (2009-12) and Post-Program Monitoring (2012-14). Economic
growth, particularly of the nonoil sector, has been solid, inflation has been brought to (historically
low) single digits, and external and fiscal buffers have been restored.
2.
Despite Angola’s significant oil wealth, income inequality remains high and poverty
has declined only slowly. The 2008-09 household survey, released in 2011, shows that Angola’s
income distribution is amongst the most unequal in sub-Saharan Africa, with the top 10 percent of
income earners concentrating one-third of total income, and a poverty headcount ratio of
37 percent, and 58 percent in rural areas.
3.
The last general elections in 2012 were comfortably won by the ruling MPLA party.
Since the elections, the authorities have sought to address persistent poverty, by targeting improved
basic services, especially water and electricity, diversify the economy, and make growth more
inclusive, through the implementation of the National Development Plan (NDP) covering 2013-17.
The NDP prioritizes a significant expansion of capital spending to address the country’s large
infrastructure deficit and improve economic diversification and competitiveness in the nonoil sector.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND
RISKS
Recent economic developments
4.
Economic growth is projected to slow to 3.9 percent in 2014, from 5.9 percent in 2013,
mainly due to a temporary decline in oil output and a deceleration in agriculture sector
growth (from last year’s unusually high growth following the end of a prolonged drought).
Growth in the nonoil economy remains robust (7.3 percent), mainly driven by the agricultural sector
and to a lesser extent manufacturing and services. Oil production declined by 10 percent in
January-May 2014, reflecting unscheduled maintenance and repair work in some oil fields, and is
expected to decline by 3.5 percent for the year as a whole as production recovers in the second
semester.1
5.
The National Bank of Angola (BNA)’s inflation target of 7–9 percent for 2014 is well
within reach. Increased agriculture production and declining international food prices, together
with a stable exchange rate, have helped to sustain a steady decline in inflation, which reached a
historic low of 6.9 percent (year-on-year) in June 2014. End-year inflation is projected to increase

series as calculated by the National Statistics Institute (INE).

slightly to 7½ percent, reflecting the impact on prices of the entry into effect on March 1, 2014, of
new, more protectionist import tariff schedule for selected agriculture and light industry products,
although there has been no evidence so far of this impact.
6.
The overall fiscal balance, in surplus in the last four years, is expected to deteriorate
substantially in 2014, reaching a deficit of around 4 percent of GDP. A recovery in oil production
during the second half of the year is expected to contain the decline of oil revenue to 2¾ percent of
GDP. Public spending is expected to increase by one percent of GDP in 2014, mostly due to a higher
payroll (reflecting both higher wages and new hirings), but also an increase in spending on goods
and services. Public investment is projected to remain broadly constant as a share of GDP, with the
timely approval of the 2014 budget permitting a smoother execution of the public investment
program (PIP) during the year.
7.
Expenditure control remains a work in progress, although several improvements have
been made. The ongoing reconciliation exercise resulted in the estimate of 2012 expenditure arrears
being revised up from US$1.5 billion to US$2.3 billion, and the authorities reported that arrears
accumulated in 2013 are now estimated at around US$0.7 billion. Two critical measures, developed
with Fund technical assistance, were put in place with the approval of the 2014 budget: a clear
definition of arrears consistent with international best practice;2 and a new control procedure
requiring the confirmation by the Finance Ministry of all contracts above US$1.5 million. For projects
to be approved, contractors need to provide, inter alia, a commitment note (assuring that the project
is funded under the budget) and a quarterly payment schedule for the contract period consistent
with the annual budget. The new control procedure has already been implemented in the
Construction Ministry and the Energy and Water Ministry, and is expected to be gradually rolled out
to the entire government by end-2015.
8.
The monetary policy stance has been consistent with a gradual reduction in inflation,
while still providing space for an expansion in credit to the private sector. Credit to the private
sector during the first semester of 2014 grew by about 15 percent relative to the same period of
2013, and the share of domestic currency credit increased. To foster financial intermediation, reserve
requirements on domestic currency deposits were reduced from 15 to 12½ percent in February
2014, after a decrease from 20 to 15 percent in June 2013. In line with declining inflation, the shortterm interbank interest rate (Luibor overnight) declined from around 6 percent at end-2013 to under
3 percent in July 2014, and the BNA’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cut its policy rate from
9¼ to 8¾ percent on July 28, 2014 (the second 50 bps cut in eight months).
9.
Financial soundness indicators point to a stable financial system, but one of Angola’s
largest commercial banks received a significant sovereign guarantee in late 2013.
Non-performing loans (NPLs) as a share of credit outstanding increased from 6.1 to 9.8 percent in
the last quarter of 2013, but this increase was reversed in the first half of 2014, in part reflecting a

better execution of the PIP. The BNA is in the process of issuing new regulations regarding the
definition and classification of NPLs to ensure a uniform standard for classifying NPLs. Banco Espírito
Santo Angola (BESA)—which accounts for close to 17 percent of banking system total assets and
about 9 percent of its total deposits—received a sovereign guarantee for US$5.7 billion (4¾ percent
of GDP) at end-2013, covering the equivalent to 70 percent of its loan portfolio. The exposure of the
other private commercial banks to BESA through the interbank market is limited.
10.
Despite a weaker external trade surplus in the first half of 2014, the nominal exchange
rate remained stable.3 During the first five months of 2014, exports declined by 5 percent relative
to the same period in 2013, mostly as a result of the lower oil exports. Import growth slowed in
March and April 2014, a period which coincided with a decline in availability of foreign exchange in
the market, but accelerated in May, so that over the first five months of 2014 imports increased by
close to 19 percent. BNA sales of foreign exchange declined in March and April 2014 relative to the
same period in 2013. Oil companies and their suppliers, which are now required to make all
payments to domestic residents in kwanza, only partially offset the lower BNA sales. A backlog
emerged in fulfilling foreign currency buying orders by commercial banks on behalf of their clients,
and the spread between the parallel and secondary market exchange rates increased. The BNA
increased foreign exchange sales significantly in May and June 2014, and the backlog has now been
largely eliminated, even if the spread (currently about 15 percent) has not fully reverted to the levels
registered in 2013.4
11.
International reserves at the BNA have been stable, following the transfer of
US$5 billion to Angola’s Sovereign Wealth Fund (FSDEA). After reaching in September 2013 a
historic maximum level of US$36.1 billion, gross international reserves declined to
US$31.4 billion (7¾ months of imports) at end-June 2014, largely due to the transfer of US$5 billion
from the Oil for Infrastructure Fund to FSDEA, of which US$3.5 billion were transferred in the fourth
quarter of 2013. The transfer of the remaining US$1.5 billion, originally planned for the first quarter
of 2014, was delayed until the second quarter in response to the decline in oil revenue.
12.
The National Assembly approved on July 4, 2014, the long-awaited nonoil tax reform.
The legislative package comprises three key codes: the general tax code, the tax procedures code,
and the tax collection code. The corporate income tax rate has been reduced from 35 to 30 percent,
while the minimum monthly income exempted from the personal income tax has been increased
from 25,000 to 34,450 kwanza. At the same time, the tax base has been expanded by closing
loopholes. A partial tax amnesty for some tax debts prior to December 2012 was also approved,5

Angola continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under the provisions of Article XIV, Section 2 and
maintains two exchange measures, two exchange restrictions, and two multiple currency practices.

The spread may not have returned to end-2013 levels because of the BNA’s better enforcement of verification
requirements for certain cash transfer operations, leading illegal transactions to go through the parallel market.

The tax amnesty comprises mainly income tax debts and does not include debts from consumption taxes and social
contributions.

although both parliamentarians and Finance Ministry officials explained that, to protect tax
compliance in the future, no further tax amnesties were envisaged.
13.
The authorities are taking measures to improve the business climate and promote
economic diversification (Appendix I). The so-called Angolanization policy seeks, inter alia, to
accelerate human capital formation by giving preference to Angolan workers over expatriates. The
private sector investment law, approved in 2012, aims to encourage foreign investors through fiscal
incentives for investments above US$1 million. The Angola Invest program, also introduced in 2012,
seeks to facilitate access to financing for small and medium-sized enterprises by offering partial loan
guarantees and loan subsidies.6 Administrative procedures in various areas, such as establishing new
enterprises and processing imports, have been streamlined.
Outlook and risks
14.
Medium-term economic growth prospects remain favorable. The oil sector is expected
to recover and grow by 2¼ percent on average over the next five years, as the decline in production
in some oil fields is more than compensated by the commissioning of seven new fields, including a
first phase of a pre-salt oil field expected to start operating in 2017. Large investments in the nonoil
sector are expected to generate much needed diversification and job creation, mainly in agriculture,
but also in electricity, manufacturing, and services. Growth prospects over the longer term will be
significantly impacted by the results of the ongoing pre-salt prospection.
15.
However, the medium-term fiscal outlook is challenging. Oil revenues (as a share of
GDP) are expected to decline while there is high demand for increased spending on infrastructure
and poverty alleviation. Staff projections show persistent and relatively large fiscal deficits over the
medium term, leading to increasing gross financing needs and rising public debt-to-GDP ratios.
While public debt is projected to remain sustainable and there is a low risk of debt stress,7 it will be
important to reverse the projected trend of rising public debt through a return to fiscal surpluses
and build financial assets in FSDEA without recourse to debt accumulation, thus saving part of the
oil wealth for future generations. Efforts to improve the fiscal position could start already in 2014, by
moderating the growth of the wage bill and spending on goods and services in the second semester
to achieve savings of about one percent of GDP for the year as a whole.
16.
If oil output does not recover as expected during the second half of 2014, it will be
important to add exchange rate flexibility to the near-term policy mix. In staff’s view, adding
6

The budget allocates US$1.5 billion (about 1 percent of GDP) to finance interest subsidies or guarantees for up to
70 percent of loans provided through banks in selected sectors.
7

Angola’s public debt is sustainable under the baseline scenario, and the main risks stem from real GDP and interest
rate shocks. Staff estimates an increase in the public debt-to-GDP ratio to 45 percent in 2019, from 33.5 percent of
GDP in 2013. While the projected debt levels remain below sustainability thresholds, risks are rising as shown in the
stress tests—a reduction in real growth has a significant adverse effect on the debt path and, due to increasing
financing needs and higher cost of new financing, the debt path is also sensitive to an increase in interest rates. For
details, see Debt Sustainability Analysis (SM/14/XX).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANGOLA

some exchange rate flexibility would protect international reserves at the BNA and would still be
consistent with achieving the end-2014 inflation objective, as inflation is currently in the lower
bound of the BNA inflation target range, while external conditions, characterized by declining
international food prices, should help to contain inflationary pressures.
17.
The main downside risks in the near term are a protracted decline in oil production
and a reversal of recent gains on expenditure arrears; in the medium and long-term,
downside risks include slippages in the implementation of structural reforms, a sustained
decline in oil prices, and the materialization of the sovereign guarantees, while there are
upside risks from new oil discoveries. The main transmission channels for downside risks are
through lower fiscal revenue, higher fiscal expenditure, and diminished budget funding, potentially
triggering a disorderly fiscal adjustment. If oil production were to temporally fall below projections,
staff would recommend a moderation in the implementation of the public investment program (also
advisable in light of quality concerns), the use of some of the treasury’s deposits to finance the
budget, and exchange rate flexibility. To mitigate medium and long-term risks, the authorities
should continue to implement public financial management reforms as envisaged, preserve policy
buffers to protect against lower oil revenue, and expedite efforts to diversify the economy. To
contain potentially high fiscal costs from public guarantees, staff recommends a transparent
management of any future guarantees in line with the recently-approved legislation. There is an
upside risk of oil discoveries as Angola’s west coast shares geological similarities with Brazil's east
coast, which contains pre-salt formations estimated to hold large quantities of hydrocarbon
resources.

Authorities’ views
18.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s overall assessment of the outlook and risks.
However, they project nonoil economic growth to be somewhat stronger, especially in agriculture.
Also, the authorities believe that exchange rate flexibility is premature due to high levels of
dollarization in the economy and high pass-through to inflation. The authorities recognize the risk of
weakening tax compliance as a result of the recently-granted tax amnesty, but stressed that this
measure was limited and necessary to create a clean slate for the revenue administration as it begins
to implement the nonoil tax reform. The authorities stressed that no new tax amnesties will be
granted in the future. As for public guarantees, the authorities noted that they will actively manage
their exposure with a view to minimizing fiscal costs.
19.
The authorities agreed with staff’s debt sustainability analysis. They see rising public
debt as necessary for their effort to reduce the infrastructure gap. They remain confident that the
social return of investment is higher than its financial cost and, therefore, believe that these
investments will not negatively impact debt sustainability. The authorities also pointed out that
receiving the main fiscal inflow (oil revenue) in foreign currency shield the budget from exchange
rate risk. They also stressed that almost all public companies’ debt is not guaranteed by the
government (with the exception of the state-owned airline company TAAG’s debt) and, therefore,
they view the central government’s gross debt to be comfortable, well below its legal limit
(60 percent of GDP).

ANGOLA

Box 1. Spillovers to and from Angola
The Angolan economy’s heavy dependence on oil is its main linkage with the rest of the world. The
collapse of international oil prices during the global financial crisis of 2008-09 illustrated the importance of this
linkage: growth decelerated from 13.8 percent in 2008 to 2.4 percent in 2009; as fiscal revenue fell sharply and
despite a significant cut in public spending, the overall fiscal balance worsened significantly, from a surplus of
8.9 percent of GDP in 2008 to a deficit of 7.4 percent in 2009; international reserves dropped by one-quarter; and
the exchange rate depreciated by 18 percent leading to higher inflation.
Reflecting changing global energy markets, the key markets for Angola’s oil exports have shifted from
the U.S. to China and India. Currently, about half of Angola’s oil exports go to China and 10 percent to India,
with only 7 percent going to the United States.
Angola’s key bilateral creditors are China, Great Britain, and Brazil. Of Angola’s total external debt, China
holds nearly 41 percent, Great Britain holds 27 percent, and Brazil holds 8 percent.
Angola has strong economic ties with Portugal, but its exposure seems to be limited to the banking
sector. Of the 24 banks operating in Angola, six banks—representing about half of the Angolan banking system
in terms of assets—are majority owned by Portuguese banks. Portugal is the main source of Angola’s imports
(15 percent of the total), followed by Singapore and China (13 and 11 percent, respectively). Angola, in turn, is
Portugal’s main export market outside the European Union (7 percent of total exports, or 2 percent of Portugal’s
GDP). Remittances from Portugal to Angola are marginal (about 0.2 percent of the GDP). Portugal’s FDI to Angola
is significant in the banking sector and also in media and telecommunications, but has largely remained constant
over recent years (at around 8 percent of total).
Outward spillovers from Angola are limited. Trade within the sub-Saharan region remains minimal, although
financial linkages—through the banking system and bilateral loans to sovereigns—are increasing.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Macroeconomic Framework and Asset-Liability Management
20.
Angola’s asset-liability framework needs to be reformed to better align savings and
stabilization objectives with fiscal outcomes. FSDEA has been established with an initial
endowment of US$5 billion, and additional annual transfers equivalent to 50,000 bbl per day are
envisaged, regardless of fiscal outcomes. In addition, oil revenue stemming from the difference
between actual and budgeted oil prices is deposited in a treasury reserve account managed by the
BNA regardless, for example, of how nonoil tax revenue is performing. Under current policies, the
government is projected to run overall fiscal deficits for the foreseeable future incurring debt
obligations while, at the same time, accumulating assets at the BNA and FSDEA. Limiting additional
transfers to FSDEA and the BNA to situations when overall fiscal surpluses are realized would avoid
the incurrence of larger-than-needed public debt.
21.
A fiscal stabilization fund with clear deposit and withdraw rules to smooth oil revenue
volatility should be created in support of the medium-term structural fiscal surplus objective.
While excess revenues are currently deposited in accounts managed by the BNA, there are no clear
rules specifying the circumstances under which the resources from these accounts can be used by
the government to cover higher-than-expected fiscal deficits. Other resource-rich economies have
established fiscal stabilization funds with clearly defined rules, providing transfers to and from the
budget according to economic and commodity price cycles. This framework proved successful in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

ANGOLA

allowing several commodity exporting countries to respond to the international financial crisis of
2008-09, with limited exposure of the fiscal accounts and a moderate adverse impact on growth.
22.
FSDEA has already instituted most of the accepted best international practices for
SWFs, but transparency and governance could be strengthened further. Remaining steps
include the issuance of frequent (quarterly) and timely reports on FSDEA activities and performance,
the timely publication of audit reports, and clear rules for selecting board members and external
asset managers.
23.
Formulating a medium-term debt strategy will be crucial to deepen domestic financial
markets. While recent progress in debt management is encouraging, the Finance Ministry should
continue to adjust its public debt management practices by, inter alia, issuing benchmark securities
and increasing auction predictability. This would serve to increase the government’s domestic
funding capacity, enabling a gradual increase in the share of instruments issued in local currency, in
line with the objectives of de-dollarization and local capital market development.

Authorities’ views
24.
The authorities acknowledged the importance of transferring resources to FSDEA only
in times of fiscal surpluses and noted that the current regulation allows for such flexibility.
They also agreed with the need for increased transparency in the management of FSDEA, although
stressed that significant progress had already been achieved. The authorities noted that work would
begin soon on developing a medium-term debt strategy, with World Bank technical assistance.

B. Saving the Oil Wealth for Future Generations
25.
A gradual fiscal consolidation, starting already in 2014, to achieve annual structural
fiscal surpluses of about 1½ percent of GDP over the medium term would be consistent with
FSDEA’s inter-generational savings mandate and strike a balance with the need to continue
upgrading the country’s infrastructure and reducing poverty. Options include:


Greater prioritization of public investment to ensure high economic and social returns.
This would be supported by development and implementation of a modern public investment
selection and management system. Staff assessed the quality of public investment in Angola
using different metrics, and found it to be generally poor (Box 2). In addition, with poor
investment quality, maintenance and repair costs over time are likely to be higher.



Reducing fuel subsidies. Fuel subsidies, which tend to benefit disproportionally the higher
income earners, should be reviewed and gradually reduced (Box 3)—introducing a well-targeted
conditional cash transfer (CCT) scheme to protect the less fortunate with a subsidy amount of
50 percent of the poverty line would cost on an annual basis around ½ percent of GDP,

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANGOLA

one-eighth of the current level of spending on fuel subsidies.8 Consistent with international
experience, a public campaign and open consultations with key stakeholders (to explain the
rationale for removing fuel subsidies) can facilitate a smooth process.


Improving budget practices. Two areas for improvement are: further streamlining quasi-fiscal
operations (QFOs), and improving public employment and compensation policies. Budget
expenses on fuel subsidies are currently calculated based on the budget oil price, which is
generally below the market price, giving rise to QFOs. These could be eliminated by using the
budget reserve to pay for higher-than-programmed fuel subsidies. The budget envisages an
indexation of public wages to inflation plus additional hiring. The indexation policy, although
common in some countries, is not best practice as it introduces inflationary inertia and
unnecessary rigidities in budget management. Aligning salary increases with productivity gains
and performance indicators would avoid such rigidities and provide performance incentives.



Further developing nonoil taxation. Staff welcomes the recent approval of the core decrees
comprising the nonoil tax reform. The approval of this legislation should be followed by
improvements in the tax and customs administrations to fully realize the potential for higher
nonoil revenue collections. A value added tax (VAT) could also be introduced in due course and,
if implemented diligently, would provide more stable revenue for the budget, thus reducing the
dependency on oil revenue and shielding the budget better from oil revenue volatility.

Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities shared staff’s recommendations to improve nonoil taxation, reform
public financial management, and reduce fuel subsidies. They stressed their commitment to
streamlining QFOs, which were reduced from US$9.3 billion in 2011 to US$3.5 billion in 2013, and
noted that Sonangol‘s authorization for out-of-budget spending on housing programs had already
been revoked. The authorities also stressed their commitment to strengthening nonoil taxation, for
which Fund technical assistance will be provided in the area of revenue administration. They agreed
with the need for improving the efficiency of public investment, but argued that urgent
reconstruction needs following the end of the civil war could partially explain Angola’s very low
efficiency score. In any event, the authorities expressed interest in implementing a better system of
public investment management, for which they will need technical assistance. They also agreed on
the need to gradually reduce fuel subsidies, and noted that this reform would need to be well
prepared and communicated to the public. The authorities questioned whether CCT schemes would
be a good option for Angola at this stage (see below).

8

CCTs usually require a well develop network of social services with capacity to certify the achievement of the
conditions required to receiving the subsidy, and thus most countries started the program with small pilot programs.

Box 2. Efficiency of Public Investment in Angola
The framework for measuring the efficiency of production units has been widely used to gauge the efficiency of
public spending (see Herrera and Pang, 2005). This framework is based on a production function approach,
where inputs are combined to produce outputs for a given technology. A common way to operationalize this
framework is by using nonparametric methods such as the data envelopment analysis, which estimates
efficiency frontiers benchmarking the most efficient production units. Once the frontier is estimated, an
efficiency score for each unit can be calculated by measuring its distance relative to the frontier.
This method has several limitations, however, including its sensitivity to outliers (when outliers are present,
inefficiency will be over-estimated). To overcome this limitation, partial frontier methods can be used. Such
methods take a random sample with replacements from the dataset to calculate pseudo-efficiency scores. The
process is repeated many times, and the final scores takes the average of all the partial pseudo-efficiency scores
(see Felder and Tauchmann, 2013).
This methodology was used to assess the efficiency of public investment spending in Angola and other 103
countries between 2000 and 2010, considering real public capital stock per capita as input and a composite
index of infrastructure as output. The composite index tries to capture the multidimensionality of infrastructure
by using indicators from three sectors: telecommunications, power, and road transport. Indicators of each sector
are then standardized, expressed in per capita terms, and combined using a principal components procedure.
According to the calculations, the efficiency of Angola’s public investment spending ranks last amongst the 104
countries in the sample. In the short-term, these results call for a prudent approach from the authorities in
increasing public investment, particularly in light of the ambitious spending agenda envisaged in the NDP. They
also call for improving inter-agency coordination to improve the integration of the investment and current
spending budgets. In the medium-term, the authorities should develop and implement a system of public
investment management.

Box 3. Fuel Subsidies in Angola
Angola is one of the largest fuel price subsidizers in the world. The gasoline (pump) price in Angola is currently
US$0.62 per liter (US$2.35 per gallon), situating it amongst the lowest decile of the distribution of gasoline world
prices.
The fiscal cost of fuel subsidies in Angola has been increasing over recent years due to higher international fuel
prices. Currently, spending on fuels subsidies amounts to 4 percent of GDP. This represents half of the spending in
health and education, one-third of the spending in public investment, or 16 times the sum of all spending in the
country’s social safety net programs.
Rationalizing fuel subsidies would not only generate resources to expand the social safety net, but could also help
to strengthen the fiscal position over the medium term. As in other countries, part of the resources could be used
to finance a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program to reduce poverty and generate opportunities for the less
favored people. For Angola, a program that would transfer income to the poor equivalent to 50 percent of the
poverty line (i.e., US$40.5 per month and per family of 5 persons) would cost only ½ percent of GDP, or oneeighth of what fuel subsidies currently cost.

C. Economic Diversification and Inclusive Growth
27.
Despite Angola’s significant natural resource wealth and high growth rates over the
past decade, poverty remains high and has declined slowly relative to comparator countries.
The oil sector contributes substantially to output but employs a relatively small share of the
working-age population and the income elasticity of poverty reduction is low. A more diversified
economy, for example, driven by agriculture or services, could have a greater impact on poverty
reduction, especially if supported by strengthened social safety net programs.
28.
Achieving economic diversification, however, is challenging. Angola’s exports, fiscal
revenue and, to a lesser extent, output continue to be dominated by the oil sector. At the current
high international oil prices, Angola’s average cost of production implies that every oil barrel has a
rent in excess of US$60. While much of this rent is captured by the government through taxes and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

ANGOLA

royalties, the oil sector remains very profitable, allowing it to attract the most qualified Angolan
workers.9 Therefore, there is a need to continue improving the business climate and developing the
nonoil private sector by, inter alia, reforming the institutional and legal framework and promoting
economic diversification through enhanced access to credit for entrepreneurs and to training for
workers in the nonoil sector. Import tariff protection, however, should play a limited and temporary
role in developing nonoil production given the risks of entrenching vested interests and
perpetuating inefficiencies and high prices for consumers.

Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities are confident that the measures being implemented to upgrade the
country’s infrastructure and improve the business climate will allow the Angolan economy to
diversify, making growth more inclusive. While they agreed that gradually removing fuel
subsidies and using part of the proceeds to strengthen the country’s social safety net was
appropriate to make growth more inclusive, they had doubts about the usefulness of CCT schemes
for Angola at this stage. They noted that the government still needed to invest heavily in
infrastructure to remove bottlenecks and support economic diversification, and expressed a
preference for exploring social safety net options that would not risk discouraging workers from
joining the labor force. The authorities agreed with the need to periodically review the country’s
import tariff structure to ensure that vested interests do not become entrenched.

D. Modernizing Monetary Policy and Strengthening Financial Stability
30.
Transitioning over time to an inflation targeting (IT) framework requires advances in
three key areas. First, the process of de-dollarization of the economy needs to continue its course.
This will help to eliminate the currency mismatch in banks’ balance sheets and permit, over time,
greater exchange rate flexibility, which will in turn reinforce de-dollarization. Second, interest rates
on government securities must be determined through competitive bidding in the primary auctions.
Continued de-dollarization and market-based determination of interest rates will jointly lead to
greater financial deepening and an increase in the share of kwanza denominated assets, and thus to
the strengthening the interest rate channel of monetary policy. Third, the BNA and the National
Institute of Statistics (INE) will need to continue developing high-frequency economic indicators to
provide policy makers with better and timely data to inform their decisions.
31.
Angola’s financial system has significant potential for increasing its contribution to
financial intermediation and thus to economic growth, but supervision should be reinforced.
The increase in the number of banks has led to more competition and to lower interest rate margins.
The BNA must remain vigilant of excessive risk taking by banks, limit the extent to which banks will
make up lost revenue by unduly increasing fees and commissions, and avoid regulatory
9

Skilled labor is one of the main bottlenecks for economic diversification in Angola. The country’s prolonged civil war
has led to severe human capital constraints with, for example, the population from whom potential middle and
upper-level managers are usually drawn among the lowest with tertiary school education in the sub-Saharan Africa.

forbearance—including the uniform enforcement of the forthcoming regulations tightening the
classification of NPLs. In this context, and to contain the potential fiscal cost of the public guarantee
to BESA, the authorities should closely monitor compliance with the agreed actions by BESA’s
management, including lending and NPL classification practices, strictly enforce the agreed monthly
provisioning plan, reduce the bank’s high reliance on short-term wholesale funding by seeking, in
due course, additional capital to BESA. The insurance and pension fund sectors and the domestic
capital market have the potential to increase their contribution by providing longer-term savings
and financing. In order to ensure financial stability, it is important that the BNA, the Capital Markets
Commission, CMC, and the Insurance Regulatory and Supervisory Agency, ARSEG, have adequate
human and financial resources to perform well their regulation and supervision function.
Box 4. Banco Espírito Santo Angola (BESA)
Banco Espírito Santo Angola (BESA) is a commercial bank—established under Angolan law—jointly owned
by Portugal’s BES (55 percent) and Angolan investors (45 percent). At end-2012, BESA was the second largest
bank in Angola by assets, accounting for 17 percent of the banking system’s total assets, but accounting for only
8¾ percent of total deposits. As a result of this balance sheet structure, the bank was more dependent on the
wholesale funding market than other Angolan banks.
BESA has come under pressure as the difficulties at its majority owner, Banco Espírito Santo (BES) of
Portugal, mounted. The BNA acknowledged on July 17, 2014, that BESA faced difficulties with its loan portfolio
and indicated that the BNA would ask BESA’s shareholders to increase their equity capital contributions.
In the absence of new capital, the BNA announced on August 4, 2014, extraordinary measures to address
BESA’s situation. These include the appointment of provisional administrators to carry out an overhaul of BESA.
The BNA also stressed that BESA’s depositors would be protected and that business relations with existing clients
would continue, and noted that the sovereign guarantee of US$5.7 billion extended in December 2013 would
eventually be revoked.
BESA’s financial difficulties are not expected to destabilize Angola’s banking system. The exposure of other
banks to BESA in the interbank market is limited, as lending is backed by guarantees in the form of government
securities. Moreover, BNA’s intervention, by appointing new managers and reassuring depositors that they are
protected, has ring-fenced the rest of the banking system. Up until the week ending July 31, 2014, there were no
signs of stress in the interbank market.

32.
Progress continues to be made to improve Angola’s anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. The AML/CFT law was amended in
January 2014, addressing some of the most pressing outstanding issues identified by the Financial
Action Task Force (FATF), and Angola’s Financial Intelligence Unit has recently been endorsed as a
new member of the Egmont Group. In June 2014, the FATF encouraged the authorities to make
further improvements by, inter alia, addressing the remaining issues regarding criminalization of
money laundering and ensuring that Angola has an adequate legal framework for the confiscation
of funds related to money laundering.

Authorities’ views
33.
The authorities agreed that one of the first steps in the transition toward an IT regime
is allowing for the market-determination of interest rates for treasury securities. They stressed
the need to proceed cautiously in allowing greater exchange rate flexibility, noting that the current
high pass-through to prices ruled out significant changes in the nominal exchange rate. On
high-frequency indicators, the authorities mentioned several areas in which they were making
progress, including quarterly national accounts, which are scheduled for release in 2015.
34.
The authorities noted that the forthcoming regulations on NPLs would help to
strengthen bank supervision, and highlighted their commitment and ongoing actions to
improve the AML/CFT framework and foster the development of the domestic capital market.
They see the latter as a priority to deepen the market, facilitate financing for private companies,
strengthen the transmission channel for monetary policy, and further de-dollarization. The
authorities also noted that in the short-term this process could entail higher financial costs for the
treasury which, however, would be compensated with long-term gains in growth and
competitiveness.

E. External Balance Assessment
35.
Empirical models suggest that the real exchange rate appears overvalued by
10 to 25 percent. While the estimated magnitude of the overvaluation depends on the specific
approach employed and confidence intervals are generally large and in one case undervaluation
cannot be ruled out, point estimates of the three approaches show overvaluation.
36.
The current level of international reserves at the BNA appears adequate. The results of
the Assessment of Reserve Adequacy (ARA) show that Angola’s level of international reserves is
adequate for precautionary purposes. The assessment incorporates the stability of the exchange rate
in recent years, but does not consider the high level of dollarization of the financial system, which
provides an additional function for reserves.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANGOLA

37.
Non-price competitiveness indicators support the finding of overvaluation. Angola
ranked 179 out of 189 economies in 2014 in the World Bank’s "Ease of Doing Business" Index. Other
indicators of competitiveness, such as the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index,
show broadly the same result. Within the various dimensions of the World Bank’s index, Angola
does particularly poorly in four indicators: (i) Resolving Controversies (188/189); (ii) Enforcing
Contracts (188/189); (iii) Starting a Business (178/189); and (iv) Trading across Borders (169/189).
Programs led by the Economy Ministry are addressing some these high costs of doing business.
38.
Restoring competitiveness requires addressing a broad range of structural
impediments. Due to Angola’s high import content and consequent high pass-through to inflation,
any significant depreciation of the nominal exchange rate would result in higher inflation and thus
not lead to a significant effect on the real exchange rate. While staff favors gradually allowing more
exchange rate flexibility, the most effective policies to address the currency overvaluation are those
that improve the country’s infrastructure and address its structural competitiveness problems, such
as the weak rule of law, poor contract enforcement, and difficulty in setting up a business.
Authorities’ views
39.
The authorities agreed with the need to accelerate and deepen reforms to improve the
business climate to enhance competitiveness. There were some differences in views regarding the
adequacy of international reserves, which some considered to be more than adequate and thus
could also be a source of budget financing. While staff agreed that this made sense from an
asset-liability management perspective, it recommended clearly defining and separating the
functions of international reserves between those allocated to revenue stabilization and those
serving other purposes.

F. Data Issues
40.
Data compilation and dissemination have improved since the end of the civil war but
there is ample room for improvement. Data availability on the oil sector is mixed, but largely
adequate on the aggregate—monthly data on exports and revenues to the budget are published,
but monthly data on production are not. Data on the diamond sector are only available on an
annual basis. INE publishes monthly consumer and wholesale price information for Luanda on a
timely basis, and is extending the indices to cover the rest of the country; it recently issued National
Accounts for the first time, covering annual output, expenditure and income data from 2002-12, and
plans to start publishing quarterly GDP estimates in 2015. The Finance Ministry made large strides in
improving the quality of the fiscal accounts, facilitated by the incorporation of all government
spending within the budget since 2013. However, the timeliness and public availability of a full set of
fiscal accounts remains inadequate largely reflecting the challenges in reconciling oil revenue flows
and capital spending financed offshore via foreign credit lines. The BNA has substantially improved
the collection and dissemination of monetary and financial sector data, but the reconciliation of
financial and fiscal data remains an issue. Data on the external sector are mixed and only published
with long time lags. Data for private capital account transactions remain weak and in need of
development.

STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Angola has achieved remarkable growth and macroeconomic stability since the end of
the civil war. Inflation is at historic lows, international reserves are adequate, and it has started to
save part of the oil wealth for future generations. This successful macroeconomic management can
be taken forward through the development of a coherent asset-liability management framework
that meets different but important needs, i.e., a fiscal stabilization fund to protect annual budgets
against volatile oil revenue, a SWF to save for future generations when fiscal surpluses are
generated, and a medium-term public debt policy that helps to manage fiscal deficits and develop
the domestic capital market.
42.
Emerging fiscal deficits need to be addressed to preserve space for the authorities’
objectives to rebuild infrastructure and reduce poverty and inequality. While possible
commercially viable pre-salt oil may be found, staff urges the authorities to hope for the best but
prepare for the worst. The fiscal deficits projected for the next five years should be reduced, and
Angola should return to fiscal surpluses over the medium term. This can be achieved if concerted
efforts are deployed in reforming nonoil revenue administration, modernizing public sector wage
policy, and reducing and ultimately eliminating costly and regressive fuel subsidies while expanding
the social safety net for the poorest segments of the population. Going forward, tax liabilities should
be strictly enforced to avoid moral hazard following the granting of a recent partial tax amnesty.
43.
The low efficiency of public investment needs to be addressed. To limit the costs of
scaling up capital spending and to improve efficiency, developing and implementing a system of
public investment management could substantially reduce the cost of public investment and
improve its value-for-money, facilitating the needed improvements in Angola’s infrastructure while
containing future maintenance and repair costs.
44.
Ending domestic payments arrears is needed and requires continued commitment and
vigilance. The recent measures to strengthen public financial management—including by
strengthening the role of the Finance Ministry in the approval of contracts and clearly linking project
execution and payment schedules to available budget allocations—are important steps in the right
direction. However, continued support at the highest levels for the implementation of the
authorities’ action plan will be needed to enhance public financial management on a lasting basis.
45.
The current level of international reserves provides an adequate buffer, and some
exchange rate flexibility could ease the pressures on the BNA to provide foreign exchange to
the market. Angola’s concentration of exports in one volatile commodity and the currently high
(although declining) level of dollarization of the economy and its financial system call for
international reserves that are generally higher than what would be considered adequate in other
countries. The current level of international reserves seems sufficient and there is little room, if any,
for reductions. The lower-than-expected level of inflation provides an opportunity to introduce
some exchange rate flexibility. More flexibility in the exchange rate would reduce the public’s
expectation of a fixed exchange rate and increase the public’s awareness of two-sided foreign

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANGOLA

exchange risks. This in turn would contain risk taking and ultimately make the economy more
resilient to foreign exchange fluctuations. Staff encourages a further liberalization of the foreign
exchange regime as Angola’s current environment appears to support a move toward acceptance of
the obligations under Article VIII, Section 2(a), 3 and 4.
46.
Economic diversification is not only an imperative to reduce oil dependency, but also
for increasing employment and reducing poverty. A sustainable reduction in poverty has to be
achieved through job creation, mainly by developing small and medium-sized enterprises in the
nonoil sector that provide the bulk of employment. The authorities’ reform agenda tackles a number
of critical constraints for doing business in Angola, including improving access to credit and training,
and streamlining of licensing procedures and reducing their cost. Implementation of these
initiatives, together with infrastructure improvements, is critical to improve competitiveness. But
recent increases in import tariffs to promote production in the nonoil sector should be kept under
periodic review and should be removed within a specified timeframe before vested interests become
entrenched.
47.
Financial intermediation continues to grow strongly with continued de-dollarization,
and financial stability should be supported by further improvements in supervision. The recent
monetary policy easing was appropriate given that inflation is below the BNA target range.
However, the BNA should remain vigilant about inflationary pressures. Effective and evenhanded
implementation of prudential norms, including the forthcoming regulations to more uniformly
measure NPLs, will help to foster trust in the banking system. Close monitoring of compliance with
the agreed actions by BESA’s management should help to contain the potential fiscal cost of the
public guarantee extended to BESA at end-2013. The recently-approved legislation provides an
appropriate degree of transparency in the granting of public guarantees in the future. Accelerating
the implementation of the action plan to address the outstanding weaknesses in Angola’s AML/CFT
framework will also contribute to strengthening the financial system.
48.
Angola’s macroeconomic data are broadly adequate for surveillance. Progress has been
made in improving the compilation and dissemination of statistics, but gaps need to be addressed,
particularly in the production of more detailed and timely fiscal accounts and in the coverage of the
balance of payments.
49.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Angola be held on the
standard 12-month consultation cycle.

reforms leading to prolonged slower growth.
Bond market stress from a reassessment in sovereign risk:
Japan: Abenomics falters, depressed domestic demand and
deflation lead to bond market stress (medium-term).

Medium

Euro area: Sovereign stress re-emerges due to incomplete
reforms, unanticipated outcomes from the asset quality
review and stress tests in the absence of a fiscal backstop.

Low

United States: protracted failure to agree on a credible
plan to ensure fiscal sustainability (medium-term).

Low

Adjust medium-term asset-liability management
strategy with fiscal stabilization function; rely
more heavily on domestic financing sources.

Low

Regional geopolitical risks (financial flows, commodity
prices, and supply chains)
(a) A sharp increase in geopolitical tensions
surrounding Russia/Ukraine that creates significant
disruptions in global financial, trade and commodity
(b) Heightened geopolitical risks in the Middle East,
leading to a sharp rise in oil prices, with negative spillovers
to the global economy.
Delayed implementation of MTFF (leading to imprudent
financing of sovereign debt)
Government Guarantees to distressed bank result in
substantial fiscal cost and create moral hazard in banking
system

Medium

High

Delay non-critical investment spending and
finance increase fiscal deficit with government
deposits.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF
staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability
below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views
on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and

Status
Ongoing. In 2013 a multiannual commitment process was
introduced for public investment (cabimentação plurianual).
Ongoing IMF technical assistance is helping the authorities to
develop capacities to effectively work with an MTFF aiming at
having fiscal responsibility legislation in the coming years.
Ongoing. Public financial management (PFM) reforms also made
headways with the introduction of two critical measures to control
the proliferation of domestic expenditure arrears: (i) the budget
framework law now includes a clear definition of arrears consistent
with international best practice; and (ii) a new control procedure
requires the confirmation by the Finance Ministry of all contracts
above US$1.5 million.
Ongoing. The main non-oil tax reform codes were approved by the
National Assembly on July 4, 2014, paving the way for the next
steps.
Not met.
Partially met. Since 2011 the General State Account (Conta Geral) is
publishing comprehensive stock-flows reconciliation for oil
revenues. There no regular publication of fiscal or public debt
information.

Partially met. Currently the only remaining QFO is the part of oil
subsidies not authorized in the budget law. The authorization for
Sonangol to do out-of-budget spending for housing programs has
been revoked.
Partially met. Sonangol's concessionaire's revenue was reduced
since 2013 from 10 to 7 percent, but the formula is still not based
on a system of cost-based reimbursement for concessionaire
expenses incurred to reduce the drain on budgetary resources.
Not met.

Ongoing. The Financial Stability Committee was established and the
BNA has published three Financial Stability Reports. Enforcement of
existing rules and regulations needs to be tightened, and
regulations on NPLs and provisioning need to be strengthened.
Partially met. In 2013 the BNA issued a series of new corporate
governance regulations for the financial system, drawing on the
recommendations of the 2011 FSAP. The BNA also issued a series
of regulations requiring banks and other financial institutions to
disclose their ownership structure and internal organization,
including their internal control systems.
Ongoing. The BNA rightly removed and reversed incentives against
domestic currency savings instruments by equalizing the reserve
requirements for domestic and foreign currency deposits. The new
oil sector foreign exchange law has provided a further impetus to
de-dollarization.
Achieved. International reserves increased by about US$5 billion
since end 2011.
Achieved. BNA has leaned towards reducing chronic excess reserves
and reserves held in the deposit facility.
Achieved. Reserve requirements on domestic currency deposits
have been.

Largely achieved. Minimum capital requirements increased in 2013.

Ongoing. Legislation approved in late 2013 addresses the most
pressing issues identified by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
Angola’s Financial Intelligence Unit has recently been endorsed as a
new member of the Egmont Group.

Appendix I. Improving the Business Environment1
This Appendix summarizes the government’s structural reforms to improve the business climate and
develop the private sector. The reforms are grouped in three areas: the institutional and legal
framework; economic diversification; and support for national entrepreneurs and local production.
Assessing the business environment
1.
The business environment in Angola has improved in recent years but much remain to
be done (Figure 1). The World Bank’s Doing Business report for 2014 ranks Angola amongst the
countries that have improved since 2005. However, much remains to be done. Angola continues to
be poorly rated on several indices. The World Bank’s report for 2014 ranked Angola (179 out of
189 countries). Within the various dimensions of this index, Angola was ranked particularly poorly on
resolving insolvency (189), enforcing contracts (187), starting a business (178), and trading across
borders (169). Angola was similarly ranked poorly on the World Economic Forum Global
Competitiveness Index for 2013-14 (142 out of 148 countries). The five factors noted by respondents
as most problematic were corruption (19 percent), inadequately educated workforce (15 percent),
inefficient government bureaucracy (15 percent), access to financing (14 percent) and inadequate
supply of infrastructure (10 percent). The country’s low performance on corruption was mirrored in
the low ranking of Angola (155 out of 177 countries) in Transparency International’s Corruption
Perception Index for 2013.

Reforming the institutional and legal framework
2.
Improving the institutional and legal framework to support private sector
development is a key priority under Angola’s National Development Plan. The three main
initiatives in this area relate to reducing bureaucratization, facilitating credit, and encouraging
private investment.
3.
The Reduction of Bureaucracy Program (RBP) is part of the broader Angola Invest
Program (see below) and aims to eliminate unnecessary administrative barriers to business. The
program has been guided by World Bank’s Doing Business report in mapping these barriers, setting
benchmarks of performance, and identifying best practices. The RBP has already achieved important
results. Recent legislation significantly reduces the time needed for incorporation to 2 days, and the
cost from US$2,800 to US$120. The cost of a commercial permit was cut from US$1,000 to US$100,
and the time to obtain a permit cut from up to several months to about 8 days. Draft legislation will
further revisit these costs, abolishing the minimum paid-in capital requirement and the need for a
public deed executed by a notary. A new fee structure will cut the cost of licensing industrial
activities by around 70 percent for investments below US$5 million. A major reform of licensing for
construction companies is due in late 2014, cutting licensing fees, introducing automatic license
renewal, abolishing licenses for construction suppliers and merging licenses for private and public
contracts. In other areas, the government has introduced an integrated electronic system to
streamline cross-border trade and payments, mandating registration for all traders and a new
license for these transactions.
4.
The Facilitating Credit Program (FCP) brings together several governmental agencies to
implement measures to reduce the constraints on business credit growth. The FCP acts on three
main pillars. Measures under the legal and institutional framework pillar aim to simplify the
registration of property rights, clarify land rights, create a public registry for credit guaranties
provided, introduce alternatives to mortgages suitable for the local context, improve processes and
simplify the legal requirements to execute a guarantee, improve and expand the use of the Credit
Risk Information Center at the BNA, and improve the effectiveness of payments by the state to its
suppliers. Measures under the supply pillar aim to promote credit to agriculture develop credit
products of different maturities, support credit to buy a house, promote credit syndicates to finance
large-scale national products, and promote leasing, factoring and renting. Measures under the
demand pillar aim to improve accounting practices by companies (particularly small and medium
enterprises, SMEs), promote the development of agricultural insurances, promote the use of banks,
and expand financial education.
5.
The Private Investment Law was revised in 2012. The revised law grants incentives to
investment above US$1 million, subject to approval and negotiation with the National Private
Investment Agency (ANIP) and covering the repatriation of capital and tax deductions on a
case-by-case basis. The most generous benefits are offered to investments in the non-oil sector and
in the less developed regions. Investments between US$10 million and US$50 million must be
approved by the Cabinet, and investments above US$50 million require Presidential approval.

36

Foreign investors can set up fully-owned enterprises in many sectors, but are frequently encouraged,
but not required, to take on local partners.
6.
The Government has a policy to encourage the Angolanization of company employees and
the use of Angolan suppliers. Employment regulations restrict a company’s employment of
expatriates to 30 percent of the workforce and prohibit compensation discrimination for the same
position and responsibilities. Similarly, while there is no formal discrimination against foreign firms,
companies with Angolan participation are generally favored. The Promotion of Angolan Private
Entrepreneurs Law gives Angolan-owned companies preferential treatment in tendering for
government contracts and only firms with a majority Angolan stake can benefit from incentives
under the Angola Invest Program.
Diversifying the economy
7.
Diversifying the economy is essential to Angola’s development. The government has
focused on improving the business environment by cementing macroeconomic stability and
building infrastructure. The National Development Plan now places greater emphasis on
coordinating public and private investment to develop industrial clusters and corporate networks
and has three complementary layers that bundle specific initiatives:


First, at the base, the strategy seeks to create Cross Linkages, consisting of initiatives specific to
the diversification strategy or other programs such as the RBP.



Second, in the middle tier are Targeted Programs to change the structure of production chains
in specific sectors. These programs are organized around economic clusters identified in the
National Development Plan such as food and agri-business, extractive activities, oil and gas,
housing, services, water and energy, transports and logistics.



Third, in the top layer is the Projects to Accelerate Diversification (PADs) program supporting
projects that can accelerate diversification, driving additional investment up or downstream in
the value chain. This can be because of their size, their potential role as an anchor in a cluster or
production chain, positive externalities, or the transfer of know-how. So far, 45 projects have
been identified.

8.
To promote international investment contributing to diversification, the Government has
recently launched the International Production Relocation Program (IPRP). This aims to attract
foreign direct investment from technologically advanced companies that have been adversely
affected by the global economy but that could benefit from entering a fast-growing market such as
Angola’s. To support such investment, the government can help identify infrastructure, and
fast-track procedures to deal with administrative hurdles.
Support to local entrepreneurs and local production
9.
The Angola Invest Program (AIP) initiated in January 2013 is the centerpiece of the
government’s policy to support domestic production, focusing on SMEs. To reduce administrative
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

ANGOLA

hurdles, the AIP has launched the RBP noted above. To benefit from incentives under the AIP,
enterprises must be at least 75 percent owned by Angolan nationals and must register with the
National Institute of Support to Small and Medium Enterprises (INAPEM). Some 8,000 companies
have so far registered.


To ease access to credit, the budget allocates US$1.5 billion to finance interest subsidies or
guarantees for up to 70 percent of loans provided through banks in select sectors. By mid-2014,
over US$520 million in loans has been approved for 270 projects.



The AIP includes educational and consulting services to entrepreneurs routed through
INAPEM. Since January 2014, INAPEM has offered training to establish a business to more than
22,000 entrepreneurs and consulting services to 93 businesses.



The Institutional Support Initiative under the AIP requires public entities to allocate up to
25 percent of their budgets to companies registered with INAPEM. Registered companies can
benefit from 10 percent lower corporate taxes and other tax benefits.



The AIP also provides support to designated flagship sectors, which include eggs, poultry and
milk. Egg production tripled since January 2013 and Angola is approaching self-sufficiency.
Large-scale projects are being implemented to scale up poultry production. The feasibility of
small-scale milk production is being assessed.



The AIP has launched a ‘Made in Angola’ stamp for local production. So far, 54 companies have
joined the program with 387 products.

10.
The government is also committed to supporting the cooperative sector and the AIP
includes such initiatives. A Cooperatives Law will soon be submitted to the National Assembly which
has benefitted from broad consultation with and support from the private sector.
11.
Finally, the AIP also includes the promotion of the Special Economic Zones (SEZs). The legal
framework to regulate the SEZs is nearing completion and positions the SEZs as areas provided with
top quality infrastructures for the development of industrial or agro-industrial activities, with
dedicated public services to reduce bureaucracy and increase transparency, and subject to more
flexible regulations (e.g. labor, customs), in order to create competitive companies that produce
products that substitute imports. A large-scale SEZ has already been established in Luanda, though
additional investment is necessary and some legacy issues need to be addressed.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
David Robinson and Bob Traa

Prepared by the staff of the International Monetary
Fund.

Angola’s public and external debts are rising but remain sustainable. Gross public debt
rose by about 5 percentage points during 2013, to 35 percent of GDP at end-2013, mostly
because of external borrowing by the state-owned oil company Sonangol; the country’s
net public debt was lower at 21 percent of GDP. The projected path of Angola’s public
debt is sustainable despite vulnerabilities. Gross public debt is projected to reach
45 percent of GDP by 2019 due to sizeable projected fiscal deficits for the foreseeable
future. This path is vulnerable to real GDP and interest rate shocks. Angola’s gross
external debt, which was 22 percent of GDP at end-2013, is projected to reach 37 percent
of GDP by 2019.

ANGOLA

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Angola’s public debt is estimated at 35 percent of GDP at end-2013. Public debt statistics
comprise the central government, public entities, and (external debt of) the state-owned oil and
airline companies (Sonangol and TAAG, respectively).1 There was a 5 percentage point of GDP
increase in public debt in 2013 relative to 2012, which is explained mainly by an increase of about
1 percentage point in short-term domestic debt and 3 percentage points in Sonangol’s external
debt.
Staff estimates that net public debt stood at 21 percent of GDP at end-2013. Angola
accumulated sizable public assets in the recent past. Net debt excludes from gross debt the value of
available financial assets. These are in two funds: the Petroleum Fund / Sovereign Wealth Fund
(FSDEA),2 and the treasury reserve at the BNA.
The rise of short-term debt as well as foreign currency denominated debt (as a percent of
total debt) needs to be followed closely. The heat map toolkit pins down that these indicators are
above adequacy levels (slightly in the case of debt in foreign currency). The authorities need to
moderate their use of T-bills (short-term debt) and rely more on medium and long-term debt. Risks
stemming from a high share of debt in foreign currency, however, are low because the authorities’
main fiscal revenue (oil) is also denominated in foreign currency.
Staff estimates a persistent increase in public debt over the medium term due to projected
fiscal deficits for the foreseeable future. In 2014, the overall fiscal deficit is projected to reach
4 percent of GDP. Over the next years, staff estimates that the central government will continue in a
similar deficit position mainly due to softening oil revenue but also because of the implementation
of the ambitious investment agenda envisaged in the National Development Plan. With persistent
fiscal deficits and despite solid economic growth, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated to
increase to about 45 percent by 2019.
Interest costs are expected to rise. In the past, Angola faced low interest costs because it relied on
financing through expenditure arrears (at zero interest rate) and bilateral credit lines (with low
interest rates). With softening oil revenues and high financing needs, the country would increasingly
rely on market financing, therefore, increasing its financing costs gradually over the next years.
The baseline debt path is highly vulnerable to real GDP and interest rate shocks. Stress tests
show that the debt path is highly sensitive to shocks from the real GDP and interest rate shocks. As
discussed in this staff report for the 2014 Article IV consultation, the Angolan business cycle has
historically a high correlation with oil prices. Therefore (as happened before) a sharp decline in oil

The Petroleum Fund was created by Presidential Decree 48/11 in March 2011. In June 2013, its denomination was
changed to Angola’s Sovereign Wealth Fund (FSDEA). Assets from FSDEA at end-2013 comprised bank deposits.

prices can easily trigger a sharp economic slowdown or recession. Under this stress scenario, the
debt path would increase sharply. Additionally, due to high financing needs an increase in interest
rate would also increase the expected debt path.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Angola’s external debt position appears sustainable. Under the baseline, external debt increases
from 22 percent of GDP in 2013 to 37 percent of GDP in 2019. Of the various standard shocks, the
most significant is a current account shock (proxy for a decline in oil exports). Under this shock
scenario, the current account balance is assumed to be one-half standard deviation below the
baseline, which could be a major shock, given recent volatility. Under that scenario, the external
debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 61 percent in 2019. The second most significant shock is the
real depreciation shock, which assumes a one-time real depreciation of the local currency of
30 percent in 2015. Under that scenario, the external debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to
54 percent in 2019. The interest rate and output shocks have less pronounced effects.
While the authorities have taken steps to collect private sector debt statistics, there is still no
available data on private sector debt for Angola. Thus, the external debt sustainability analysis is
currently solely based on public sector external debt, including two state-owned enterprises
(Sonangol and TAAG).

Safeguards Assessments:1 The first-time safeguards assessment, which was finalized in May 2010,
found that the National Bank of Angola (BNA) is subject to annual external audits by a reputable
firm and has taken steps to address the audit qualifications. The assessment confirmed, however,
weak governance and transparency practices at the BNA, including lack of timely publication of
annual financial statements. The assessment also made recommendations to enhance the legal
framework and independence of the central bank, and to strengthen the control framework in the
reserves management and internal audit areas. Since this assessment, the BNA has adopted
measures to enhance governance and accountability, including the production of its financial
statements. The 2009 statements were audited and published together with the auditors’ report;
the 2010 audit was completed and the results were published on the BNA website in
mid-October 2011. Since financial year 2011, the BNA has been publishing on a regular and timely
basis its annual financial statements, which are subject to external audit by a reputable international
firm. Since 2010, the BNA has introduced and consolidated several supporting bodies to its Board
of Directors, such as the Monetary Policy Committee, the Financial Stability Committee, and the
Investments Committee. The Board of the BNA has strengthened its internal audit function, and in
January 2011, it reconstituted its Audit Board. It also adopted in December 2010 guidelines for the
management of international reserves and in May 2011 conducted a first semi-annual internal audit
of their implementation.

Exchange Arrangements: Angola’s de facto exchange arrangement has been classified since
October 2009 as “stabilized arrangement”. The BNA intervenes actively in the foreign exchange
market in order to stabilize the exchange rate by selling part of the oil-revenue related foreign
exchange in auctions to banks. Auctions were temporarily suspended from April 20 to
October 1, 2009, leading to the establishment of a formal peg. Following the resumption of
auctions, the kwanza depreciated, but has remained relatively constant since 2010. The authorities
maintain strong control over the exchange rate, which is the main anchor for monetary policy. The
BNA publishes a daily reference rate, which is computed as the transaction-weighted average of
the previous day’s rates of successful bids by commercial banks. Banks and exchange bureaus may
deal among themselves and with their customers at rates that can be freely negotiated provided
they do not exceed the reference rate by more than 3 percent. Staff will continue to closely monitor
developments in the exchange system.
Angola continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under the provisions of Article XIV,
Section 2, and maintains two exchange measures, namely: (i) limits on the availability of foreign
exchange for invisible transactions, such as travel, medical, or educational allowances; and (ii) limits
on unrequited transfers to foreign-based individuals and institutions. In addition, Angola maintains
two exchange restrictions resulting from: (i) limits on the remittances of dividends and profits from
foreign investments that do not exceed US$1,000,000;2 and (ii) the discriminatory application of the
0.015 percent stamp tax on foreign exchange operations that are subject to approval under Article
1

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision has shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. There are concerns about
data quality and timeliness and efforts are underway to strengthen the statistical base, including
through technical assistance from the Fund and World Bank. The authorities are committed to using
the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) to improve the statistical system. Angola started
participating in the GDDS in October 2003 and metadata were posted on the IMF’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board. The metadata needs to be updated.
Angola now has several regular and informative statistical publications, reflecting significant
progress in the provision of data and transparency in statistical reporting. Progress has been
strongest in the BNA and recently in the National Institute of Statistics (INE). Both now provide and
publish much more extensive data on a timely basis. Data delivery and publication from the Ministry
of Finance could be significantly improved. Data postings on the Ministry of Finance website include
detailed revenues from the oil sector. Notably absent is the regular publication of data on oil
production by the Ministry of Petroleum.
National Census
INE has just completed a national census count. This is the first census in the four decades since
independence. Preliminary aggregate population estimates are expected in September 2014, but a
comprehensive assessment of the data is not expected for several years. The census questionnaire
covers a substantial collection of information, mostly of a demographic and social nature. The
census follows the 2011 release of the 2009 Household Well Being survey, but the data released
from this survey was only partial.
National Accounts and Price Statistics
INE has released the national accounts for Angola for 2002-12. The data are preliminary for
2011 and 2012. This is the first issuance of national accounts in Angola and includes annual data on
output, expenditures, and income. INE plans to issue preliminary national accounts with a one-year
lag and final accounts after two years. The national accounts include annual GDP at constant prices
using 2002 prices. The Ministry of Planning will continue to issue preliminary estimates and
projections of annual GDP (output). A quarterly GDP series is in production and is scheduled to be
published in 2015. INE also publishes monthly reports on consumer and wholesale price indices. The
CPI index is based on Luanda data, but INE has now also started to publish data on consumer prices
in the six capitals of the major provinces. The objective is to move towards a national consumer
price index. INE also publishes other important data bulletins, including quarterly bulletins on
business confidence, industrial production and employment, and on merchandize trade.

Monetary and Financial Statistics
Data for the depository corporation survey and the balance sheet of the BNA have recently been
revised with the help of STA technical assistance. The data are now based on the new standardized
report forms and Angola has become a full contributor to the IMF’s IFS. The BNA delivers data to
the IMF on a timely basis. It also publishes comprehensive data on its webpage on a monthly basis.
The BNA has also started to publish other very important reports. These include a quarterly inflation
report as well as its annual report (summarizing monetary and macroeconomic as well as inflation
developments), and a six-monthly financial stability report (assessing the stability of the financial
system). BNA data on financial soundness indicators should be published at regular frequency
(e.g., 30 or 60 days after the end of each quarter). The usefulness of the BNA’s Financial Stability
Report could be enhanced by being more up to date, as there is currently a long lag between the
period the report refers to and the time it is published (e.g., the latest report, published at end-July
2014, refers to the first half of 2013).
Government Finance Statistics
The timeliness and quality of government finance statistics needs to be substantially improved.
Revenue and expenditures are correctly recorded on accrual basis but some issues persist when
operations above and below-the-line are reconciled. Of the utmost importance is that consolidated
and detailed fiscal data is published regularly (at least quarterly) in electronic format at the Ministry
of Finance web page. Information on oil revenues is monthly published with great detail and
consistency but it would more useful for analysts and stakeholders if it was published as
spreadsheet instead of PDF images. The information available is presented based only on the
budgetary classifiers rendering difficult to do an economic analysis of the fiscal situation. All
information should be presented using not only the budget but also the economic classification.
Thus far, the Ministry of Finance reports on a “modified” GFSM 1986 by using an adjustor to
reconcile numbers above the line (registered on an accrual basis) with those below the line
(registered on cash basis). In time, the Ministry of Finance should start a comprehensive migration
toward the GFSM 2001 standard.
External Sector Statistics
The balance of payments and international investment position are compiled in line with the
recommendations of the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual. These statistics are
compiled and disseminated annually, with a lag of nine months after the reference period. A
technical assistance mission from STA on external sector statistics was conducted in July 2010. It
noted that few of the recommendations made by the previous missions had been implemented and
that little progress had been made in strengthening the compilation framework. The technical units
are understaffed and there are problems of non-compliance with data reporting requirements by
resident enterprises. A thorough review of the balance of payments and IIP for 2008 and 2009 was
conducted. The authorities have made progress regarding the methodological soundness of
classification of balance of payments transactions. Nonetheless, some inconsistencies have been
found, especially regarding the classification of transactions involving arrears and SDRs. The IIP
showed important inconsistencies with the balance of payments and the external debt statement.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

ANGOLA

Coverage and timeliness of source data remain a major shortcoming. The development of the BNA’s
International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS), known as SIOBE, was halted due both to lack of
staff and the uncertainty regarding its replacement by a similar ITRS being developed by the BNA.
Given that there are major discrepancies between the foreign trade data from INE and the BNA, the
re-establishment of a working group composed by INE, BNA, the Customs Office, and the Ministry
of Commerce is advisable.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 3, 2014

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Angola
On August, 29, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Angola.
After a strong growth in 2013 estimated at 6.8 percent, economic growth in 2014 is projected at
3.9 percent despite a decline in oil output. Robust growth in the nonoil economy, mainly driven
by a very good performance in the agricultural sector, is expected to offset a temporary but
considerable drop in oil production.2 Ongoing investments in agriculture are expected to pay off
with an increase in agriculture production by about 11½ percent in 2014. Other sectors such as
manufacturing, electricity and services, are also expected to contribute. Inflation projected to
reach 7½ percent by end-2014 is well within the Banco Nacional de Angola (BNA)’s objective.
The overall fiscal balance, which was in surplus in the last four years, is expected to deteriorate
substantially in 2014, reaching a deficit of around 4 percent of GDP. Oil revenue fell by 14
percent during January-May 2014, mainly due to a 10 percent decline in oil production related to
unscheduled maintenance and repair work in some oil fields. International reserves at the BNA
remain adequate at an equivalent of 7¾ months of imports.
Notwithstanding strong economic growth over the past decade, poverty and income inequality
remain a challenge. The 2009 household expenditure survey, released in 2011, shows that
Angola’s income distribution is among the most unequal in sub-Saharan Africa, with the top 10
percent of income earners concentrating one-third of total income, and puts the relative poverty
headcount ratio in Angola at 37 percent (60 percent in rural areas).
Progress in structural reforms has been strong. The long-awaited non-oil tax reform was
approved by the National Assembly on July 4, 2014, which is a crucial step toward reducing the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

budget’s heavy reliance on oil revenue. Public financial management (PFM) reforms also made
headways with the introduction of two critical measures to control the proliferation of domestic
expenditure arrears: (i) the budget framework law now includes a clear definition of arrears
consistent with international best practice; and (ii) a new control procedure requires the
confirmation by the Finance Ministry of all contracts above US$1.5 million. The Economy
Ministry has also continued with the implementation of a number of measures aimed at
improving the business environment, including the Angola Invest program.
The medium-term economic growth prospects remain favorable. The oil sector is expected to
recover and grow by 2¼ percent on average over the next five years, as the decline in production
in some oil fields is more than compensated by the commissioning of seven new fields, including
a first phase of a pre-salt oil field expected to start operating in 2017. Large investments in the
nonoil sector are expected to generate much needed diversification and job creation, mainly in
the agricultural sector, but also in electricity, manufacturing, and services. The projected strong
growth in the nonoil sector of about 7¾ percent on average over the next five years is also
expected to increase domestic competition, thus contributing to reducing inflation further.
Growth prospects over the longer term, however, are uncertain but should be firmed up during
2015, as ongoing pre-salt prospection should help to determine the amount of commercially
viable oil reserves.
Executive Board Assessment3
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal and commended the authorities
for the progress made toward macroeconomic stability, having reached a historically low level of
inflation and an adequate level of international reserves. Directors welcomed the improved
economic outlook, but noted that risks require additional efforts to strengthen policies. In the
long run, reducing the dependence on oil is key to containing external vulnerabilities and
achieving sustainable and inclusive growth.
Directors concurred on the need to preserve space for rebuilding infrastructure and reducing
poverty and inequality, while saving part of the oil wealth for future generations. This requires
addressing emerging fiscal deficits and returning to fiscal surpluses over the medium term,
including by strengthening nonoil revenue administration, modernizing public sector wage
policy, and gradually eliminating costly and regressive fuel subsidies while expanding well
targeted social safety nets. Taking note of the recent partial tax amnesty, Directors encouraged
the authorities to strictly enforce tax liabilities going forward to avoid any negative impact on tax
collection.
3

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summing ups can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors emphasized the need for a coherent asset liability management framework, including a
fiscal stabilization fund that could improve the management of Angola’s natural resource wealth
and protect annual budgets against volatile oil revenue. They noted the very low efficiency of
public investment and saw merit in developing a system of public investment management that
would help meet Angola’s infrastructure needs at a lower cost. They welcomed the recent
measures to strengthen public financial management and end domestic payment arrears, and
looked forward to their steadfast implementation.
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to de dollarize the economy and strengthen financial
stability, and underscored that effective and evenhanded implementation of prudential norms is
necessary to foster trust in the banking system. In this regard, they welcomed the extraordinary
measures taken to address the problems at Banco Espírito Santo Angola and the new legislation
clarifying procedures for the granting of public guarantees, and encouraged actions to address the
outstanding weaknesses in the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating Financing of Terrorism
framework.
Directors saw the current conditions of relative stability and low inflation as an opportunity to
introduce some exchange rate flexibility, which would help reduce dollarization and develop
more effective monetary instruments. They noted that reserve levels are currently adequate and
should be maintained to provide an appropriate buffer against external shocks.
Directors stressed that a sustainable reduction in poverty is best achieved through the
development of small and medium size enterprises in the private, nonoil sector. They were
encouraged by the authorities’ efforts to diversify the economy and improve the business
environment and competiveness. They were concerned, however, by the increasing use of trade
protection, and recommended a periodic review of the recently introduced import tariff schedule
with a view to lowering tariffs within a specific timeframe.
Directors welcomed progress on the compilation and dissemination of economic statistics, and
encouraged the authorities to address the remaining gaps in the production of more detailed and
timely fiscal accounts and in the coverage of the balance of payments.

Introduction

Angola has witnessed a robust improvement in economic conditions over the past five years,
after being hard hit by the global financial crisis, the adverse effects of commodity price
shocks and a subsequent sluggish recovery in the world economy. The government’s
commitment to strengthen macroeconomic stability and maintain peace and security provided
the necessary impetus to foster broad-based growth, accelerate the pace of diversification and
structural transformation, and spur productivity, particularly in nonoil sectors.
The authorities are appreciative of the Fund’s continued engagement and value the candid
discussions and exchange of views with staff during the recent Article IV consultation
mission.
2.

Recent Economic Developments and the Outlook for 2014

Angola’s economic agenda in the coming years, as stated in its National Development Plan
(PND) for the period 2013-2017, is to unleash its growth potential through economic
diversification and transformation. While rents from extraction of oil resources will play a
pivotal role in boosting domestic resources to expand the provision of infrastructure and
basic social services, reliance on oil revenues remains a major source of fiscal vulnerability
given the volatility of world oil prices. Policy priorities to minimize risks induced by
commodity price volatility include spurring productivity in agriculture and manufacturing
sectors, including building up human capital and creating an enabling environment for job
creation and doing business.
Economic growth is projected to reach 3.9 percent in 2014, a decline from 6.8 percent in
2013 and 5.2 percent in 2012, due to temporary disruptions in oil production and deceleration
in output growth in the agriculture sector due to drought. Robust growth in the nonoil sector
(7.3 percent), driven primarily by ongoing investments in the agriculture, manufacturing,
electricity and services sectors is expected to off-set the transitory decline in the oil sector
(3.5 percent).
Inflationary expectations in 2014 are expected to remain in the lower side and aligned with
the Banco Nacional de Angola (BNA) medium term target of 7-9 percent, due mostly to
benign environment marked by declining international food prices, increase in agricultural
production and a stable exchange rate. Gross international reserves declined to $32.1 billion
in May 2014, from a high historic level of $ 36.6 billion reached in September 2013, mainly
due to a transfer of $ 5 billion from the Oil for Infrastructure Fund to Angola’s Sovereign
Wealth Fund. Nonetheless, the level of coverage of international reserves for 2014 (7.1
months of import cover) is still adequate to cushion external shocks.

2
The Angolan authorities remain committed to strengthening the fiscal buffer. After running a
surplus over the last four years, the authorities expect an overall fiscal deficit of around 4
percent of GDP in 2014, reflecting a 10 percent decline in oil revenue during the first quarter
of 2014. While this is unlikely to be a permanent phenomenon, significant steps have been
taken in nonoil tax reform under the recently approved fiscal legislation aimed at diversifying
the sources of nonoil revenues.
3.

Structural Reforms in 2014

The Angolan authorities have embarked on a wide range of structural reforms to increase the
sources of nonoil revenues, improve public financial management and strengthen the
financial sector. As part of the authorities’ efforts to reduce the budget reliance on oil
revenues, the National Assembly approved in July 2014 a legislative package comprising
three codes: the general tax code, the tax procedure code, and the tax collection code. In
addition, changes to personal and corporate income taxes were introduced to boost
consumption and investment.
Public financial management reforms continue to be implemented. More importantly, the
authorities have taken steps to prevent the accumulation and proliferation of arrears with the
inclusion in the budget framework law of a clear definition of arrears that is consistent with
international best practices. Furthermore, a new control procedure has been effected
requiring the confirmation by the Ministry of Finance of all contracts above $ 1.5 million.
To prevent the proliferation of non-performing loans (NPLs), the BNA has initiated the
process of issuing new regulations on the definitions and classification on NPLs. This new
regulation will improve the comparability of the performance of banks by investors and
depositors, and provide proper incentives for banks to improve their lending practices.

Medium Term Outlook and Policy Priorities

Angola’s main challenge like most resource rich countries is to translate economic growth
into improvements in the living standards of its populace. The growth path over the medium
term is expected to remain robust, sustained by a recovery in the oil sector with the
commissioning of seven new fields. In addition, large investments in the nonoil sector,
particularly in agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing and social services are expected to
create the necessary conditions to spur the much needed economic diversification and job
creation. In this regard, prioritizing public resources to expand the accumulation of capital
and enhance productivity in the non tradable sector, to reduce the dependence on imports, is
one of the center pieces in the implementation of the National Development Strategy.
Fiscal Policy
To cope with the projected slow down in oil revenue, the authorities will continue to build
fiscal buffers by gradually increasing savings from current oil wealth to the Sovereign

3
Wealth Fund. Furthermore, to mitigate the downside risks stemming from commodity price
volatility including the decline in oil reserves and a reversal of recent gains in domestic
arrears, the authorities remain committed to adopt revenue enhancing measures. Most
importantly, the authorities shall continue the implementation of nonoil tax reform and
strengthen public financial management, through containment of recurrent expenditure,
particularly the wage bill, gradually phasing out fuel subsidies, improving efficiency in
capital spending and adoption of effective safety net programs, much in line with staff’s
advice. These measures are vital to maintain the public finances in a sustainable path.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
The authorities’ monetary stance for the near term will continue to focus on anchoring
inflationary expectations, improving liquidity management and strengthening financial
surveillance. To improve the effectiveness of their conduct of monetary policy and transition
towards an inflation targeting regime, the authorities will focus on three core areas. First, to
foster the de-dollarization process, the authorities will strive to eliminate the currency
mismatch in bank’s balance sheets, and permit, over time, more flexibility in the exchange
rate. Second, in order to increase financial deepening and strengthen the interest rate channel,
the authorities are taking measures to establish market-based interest rate determination.
Third, the BNA and the National Institute of Statistics will collaborate in developing high
frequency indicators to provide policy makers with timely information to inform their
decisions.
To strengthen the domestic banking system, the BNA has introduced new regulations
concerning corporate governance, risk management and internal control as well as external
audit procedures. The authorities are also committed to implement the appropriate fiscal and
monetary policy mix to maintain inflation within the BNA’s medium term target of 7-9
percent.
Financial Sector Policies
Fostering financial deepening and inclusion is one the major challenges to create more
opportunities and support private sector development and job creation. To this end, the
authorities have launched a number of initiatives to improve credit access by small and
medium sized enterprises, such as the Facilitating Credit Program (FCP). Measures under the
implementation of the FCP include inter alia, simplification of the registration of property
rights, legalization of land rights and creation of a public registry for credit guarantees. Other
measures include: improve processes and simplify the legal requirements to execute a
guarantee; improve and expand the use of Credit Risk Information Center at the BNA;
promote the development of agricultural insurances; and expand financial education.

Concluding Remarks

The Angolan authorities reiterate their commitment to the implementation of sound policies
and structural reforms that foster macroeconomic stability, enhance broad-based growth, and
reduce poverty and inequality. To this end, the authorities will continue to implement nonoil
tax reforms, improve efficiency in investment spending, and strengthen fiscal buffers. The
modernization of the monetary policy framework, including the adoption of measures to
allow more flexible exchange rate and a gradual transitioning to an inflation targeting regime,
will continue to be the cornerstones in strengthening the effectiveness of monetary policy. On
behalf of my authorities I wish to thank the Fund for the continuing support and advice to
promote economic development and shared prosperity in Angola.
