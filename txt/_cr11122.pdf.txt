KEY ISSUES
Slovakia has swiftly recovered from a deep recession, and is facing a favorable mediumterm macroeconomic outlook, with real GDP projected to grow by around 4 percent per
year. Against this backdrop the policy focus should shift from crisis response to enhancing
the foundations for long-term growth and stability while addressing the crisis-induced
deterioration of the fiscal position.
Fiscal policy: reducing the general government deficit to below 3 percent of GDP in
2013. A significant consolidation this year is projected to narrow the deficit from almost
8 percent of GDP in 2010 to about 5 percent of GDP. Achieving the 2013 deficit target
will still be challenging, however, and pressures to adopt low-quality measures or
prematurely cut taxes will have to be resisted.
The financial sector: as banking sector conditions improve with the economic recovery,
remaining vigilant and monitoring unfolding risks, particularly with regard to exposure of
foreign parent banks to sovereign risk, housing loans and signs of accelerating credit
growth. Improving the liquidity of the secondary government bond market could support
capital market development overall.
Unemployment: reducing the high long-term unemployment. The crisis caused the
already high unemployment to surge, and long-term unemployment of low-skilled and
young workers has risen to among the highest in the EU, in spite of the strong recovery.
Addressing the unemployment problem will require a broad range of policy actions.
Medium-term growth: focusing on productivity gains as the key to achieving continued
robust growth and, in combination with labor market flexibility and wage moderation,
safeguarding external competitiveness. Sustaining efforts to build and enhance human
capital, further improve the business environment and foster competition, will help boost
productivity.

CPI inflation dropped to among the

lowest in the euro zone in 2010, but jumped in
early 2011. Weak domestic demand against a
background of low energy and food inflation
reduced inflation to a historically low rate of
1 percent (y-o-y) in November 2010. However,
reflecting the global increase in the price of oil and
other commodities, and in part because of indirect
tax hikes at the beginning of 2011, CPI inflation
jumped to 3.2 percent (y-o-y) in January 2011 and
further accelerated to 3.8 percent in March.
However, the projected tightening of monetary
conditions will help reduce the impact of secondround effects.

FISCAL POLICY—SETTING A CREDIBLE
CONSOLIDATION PATH
With the stabilization of growth the key fiscal policy challenge is to set a consolidation
path toward a medium-term target that ensures sustainability. Following important fiscal
adjustment this year, consolidation will need to continue during 2012–13 with a view to
bringing the government deficit below 3 percent of GDP in 2013. The authorities’ fiscal
policy priorities should guide the composition of the adjustment. Simultaneously achieving
these priorities and the consolidation targets will require broad-ranging revenue efforts
and expenditure reallocation and cuts.

The 2011 budget contains a front-

In spite of the recovery, the general

government deficit remained high in 2010, at

contracted sharply and spending continued to
expand at a fast pre-crisis pace. Reflecting a
subdued revenue performance and continued
strong expenditure growth, the deficit was almost

The 2011 deficit is projected to decline

Public Investment and Absorption of the EU Funds in Slovakia

In contrast to overall investment, which has been
relatively high reflecting extensive FDI, public
investment has been relatively modest in Slovakia. In
2009, general government investment was among the
lowest in the central and eastern European (CEE)
region, amounting to about 2.3 percent of GDP. This
low level in part reflects the relatively small size of the
government, particularly excluding social benefits,
subsidies and interest payments (see Annex I).

Low public investment appears to have implications
for the overall level of infrastructure, which appears to
be below the level of infrastructure in other CEE
countries. According to the 2011 World Economic
Forum’s Global Competitiveness report ranking of
infrastructure, Slovakia is below most emerging
European countries, including regional peers (a higher
ranking indicates a less favorable position).

In part to help narrow the infrastructure gap with
high-income EU member countries, Slovakia receives
financial support through EU Funds. For the EU multiyear budget implementation period 2007–13, total
available EU fund resources for Slovakia amount to
close to 3 percent of GDP per year, including cofinancing from the state budget at about 10 percent
of the total (OECD, Economic Survey of the Slovak
Republic, 2010). EU funds also serve other purposes,
including in agriculture and education, and in part are
disbursed directly to private sector recipients (only
about 1/3 of the EU funds is available for
government). In 2010, Slovakia received a total of
euro 1.9 billion in EU funds, euro 653 million of which
was disbursed to government—about euro 454
million for capital expenditure and the rest for current
expenditures.
Absorption of EU funds is relatively slow compared
with other CEE countries, which in part could reflect a
different time profile of the planned disbursements.
Oversight of the drawing of EU funds has been
strengthened, and Slovakia is expected to absorb near
100 percent of its allocation by the end of the 2007–
13 program—as was the case under the previous
program.

The System of Social Security Contributions in Slovakia

Current status:

Proposed changes:

The current system of social security and health
contributions and income taxes in Slovakia is
complex and costly to administer. Employers
contribute 35.2 percent, and employees contribute
13.4 percent of gross wages and salaries—part of it
for social security and part for health insurance. The
amounts are capped by maximum assessment bases
that depend on the average wages. All together,
there are eight types of insurance; eighteen
contribution rates; three different assessment bases
(for personal income tax, social security
contributions, and a special assessment base for
economically-inactive people); various minimum
and maximum assessment bases; a large number of
discretionary allowances; a set of exemptions based
on the employment status (employed, selfemployed or contractual); different social security
contributions for the employed and self-employed;
and different deductions from gross income for the
employed and self-employed for personal income
tax purposes.

The main goals of the proposed reform (to be
implemented from the beginning of 2012) are to
simplify the system, make it more transparent and
equitable, and create conditions for the unification
of collection of taxes, custom duties, and social
security contributions. The main change is to focus
on overall labor cost (by adding the employers’ total
social security contributions to the basic wage) and
calculate a “super-gross wage” that would become
a universal assessment base for social security
contributions and personal income taxes. In
addition, the proposed changes entail a standard
single health contribution rate (9 percent) and a
differentiated social security contribution rate
(19 percent for employees, 16 percent for selfemployed and 13 percent for contractual). Besides
unifying different assessment bases for different
types of insurance, the new arrangement will
subject all workers to a uniform assessment base
regardless of their employment status. The
maximum assessment base will be replaced by
maximum nominal contributions.

The favorable treatment of the self-employed
distorts incentives and erodes revenue collection.
Self-employed can use standardized deduction of
40 percent of income and then pay social security
contribution on only half of the net amount. In
2009, the annual income subject to taxes and social
security contributions was euro 5,600 for
employees and euro 1,700 for the self-employed.
Furthermore, approximately 80 percent of the selfemployed who pay social security contributions pay
the amount according to the minimum base. As a
result on these differences, the number of people
claiming such status increased by 34.3 percent
between 2004 and 2010.

Because the 19 percent flat income tax is calculated
from the super gross wage, the reform implies a
shift of taxes from social security contribution to
income tax. Based on the current proposed rates,
the reform is projected to shift over euro 1 billion
from social security contribution to income tax.
Overall revenue collection is estimated to decline by
about euro 70 million a year. The reform is also
combined with a scheme to lower social security
contribution rates. If fiscal deficit targets are
achieved, rates will be cut by 1 percentage point
every year with a maximum of 4 percentage points.

economic recovery in the second half of 2009 and the
government commitment to fiscal consolidation led to
a gradual reduction in spreads to about 1 percentage
point. With reference to CE4 countries, spreads on
Slovak government bonds are similar to the
Czech Republic, substantially below Hungary and
Poland.

euro in January of 2009 eliminated currency risks and
supported the liquidity of Slovak government bonds
through the ECB operations.
Nevertheless, conditional on fundamentals the
yields on Slovak sovereign bonds are still
significantly above other euro countries. A
regression analysis based on 11 euro countries
(Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain)
reveals that yields are positively correlated with
government debt and the fiscal deficit as a percentage
of GDP, and negatively correlated with real GDP
growth and government bond liquidity (captured by
the stock of government debt). The plot below
compares the average yields in 2010 with the
predicted yields. The average yields on Slovak
government bonds have been considerably above the
predicted values, similarly to other CE4 countries
outside the euro area. This suggests that Slovak yields
have benefited from strong fundamentals, but some
premium above core euro area still remains.

Several factors explain this relatively low spread.
Public debt remains relatively low at 41 percent of
GDP, even though it has grown considerably since
2008. The government’s commitment to fiscal
consolidation has preserved market confidence
although the fiscal deficit has increased to almost 8
percent of GDP. The rebound in economic growth
improved debt dynamics. Finally, the adoption of the

percentage of net number of workers who
left Pillar II is about 3 percent).



Participation in the second pillar has been
changed from mandatory to voluntary for
new labor market entrants in 2008.



The qualifying period for pensions was
extended from 10 years to 15 years for both
Pillar I and Pillar II. Since the Pillar II started in
2005, this implies that workers who were
older than 47 years of age in 2005 cannot
receive a pension under pillar II.



The ceiling of the contributory wage has
been increased from three times the average
wage to four times of that.



The indexation of pension is made at the
average of price inflation and the wage
increase (the so-called Swiss indexation),
where the weight of each parameter is 0.5.



For disabled contributing workers, the State
subsidizes their contributions only if they
remain in Pillar I.



Women who have children less than six years
of age can voluntarily join Pillar II.



In 2007, the government approved a Bill to
pay Christmas allowance for 1,051,936
pensioners with low level of pensions.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Slovak
Republic
On May 25, 2011 the Executive Board of the IMF concluded the Article IV consultation with the
Slovak Republic, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting.1
Background
The Slovak economy has continued its robust recovery. The upturn has been stronger than in
most of Slovakia’s neighbors reflecting strong fundamentals and a surge in the export-oriented
manufacturing sector, which benefited from a revival in global demand. In tandem, the financial
sector has regained strength, profits in the corporate sector are recovering, real estate prices
have stabilized, and the fiscal position is improving.
The growth outlook for 2011 and beyond is favorable. While growth will still be driven mainly by
the export sector, a gradual rebound in domestic demand would provide some boost and
broadly offset the withdrawal of fiscal support. Overall, staff projects real GDP growth of about
3¾ percent in 2011 and of about 4¼ percent in 2012–15, among the strongest performances in
the European Union, but still significantly below the pre-crisis rate of expansion.
The economic recovery has had little positive effect on employment. The unemployment rate,
has climbed to over 14 percent, and is even higher among low-skilled workers and in less
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing ups can be found here:

prosperous regions. With the turnaround in economic activity, employment started to recover in
late 2010, but the gains, so far, have been small and insufficient to prevent an increase in longterm unemployment.
Inflation dropped to among the lowest in the euro zone in 2010, but accelerated in early 2011.
Reflecting the global increase in the price of oil and other commodities, and in part because of
indirect tax hikes at the beginning of 2011, CPI inflation jumped to 3.8 percent (year-on-year) in
March. However, as core inflation remains well-anchored, the projected tightening of monetary
conditions will help reduce CPI inflation to below 3 percent in 2012 and beyond.
The 2011 budget includes a significant fiscal consolidation package that is projected to reduce
the general government deficit to about 5 percent of GDP. A structural drop in revenue and
continued strong expenditure growth kept the fiscal deficit in 2010 at around 8 percent of GDP
for a second year in a row. The high deficits contributed to a rapid increase in the general
government debt to around 41 percent of GDP. Yet, this ratio is still relatively low, and market
confidence has remained intact—reflected in a relatively low risk premium over corresponding
euro zone benchmark bonds.
Financial conditions and the situation of the financial sector have improved. Credit growth is
recovering gradually, and monetary conditions are supportive with a low interest rate. Banks
have enhanced their balance sheet and improved capital and liquidity ratios. Their profits
rebounded in 2010, reflecting cost cutting measures, higher interest rate spreads and lower
provisions, notwithstanding a still high level of nonperforming loans.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2010 Article IV consultation with the Slovak Republic, Executive Directors
endorsed the staff’s appraisal, as follows:
The Slovak economy is recovering from the sharp recession. The immediate priorities are to
restore fiscal sustainability and address the high unemployment, while over the medium term
maintaining external competitiveness within the monetary union should be a key objective.
The sharp deterioration in the fiscal position, which largely reflects structural weaknesses, is a
concern. In this regard, the front-loaded fiscal adjustment of about 2½ percentage points of
GDP in 2011, and the authorities’ strong commitment to bring the fiscal deficit down to below
the Maastricht norm in 2013 are welcomed. The adjustment properly balances the dual
objectives of ensuring fiscal sustainability and allowing the recovery to continue.
To spread the burden over time and enhance market confidence, the 2011 adjustment should
be anchored within a clear medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy. This could be facilitated
by adopting a real expenditure growth ceiling consistent with deficit targets and expenditure
policy priorities, including reforming health care and pensions. In addition to containing
expenditure, revenue measures, including raising indirect taxes and eliminating exemptions, will
also be necessary.

3

The resilience of the banking sector in the face of the global crisis is encouraging. The
supervisory authority’s proactive response to the crisis and the confirmation by stress test
results of the ability of the sector to absorb a variety of severe shocks are welcomed. Continued
close monitoring of banking sector developments, in particular lending to corporate and real
estate sectors, will nevertheless remain essential. In light of the large share of foreign
ownership in Slovak banks, enhancing cross-border supervisory coordination is essential.
The increase in long-term unemployment, particularly among low-skilled workers is regrettable.
The authorities should remove structural impediments to employment, including by
strengthening higher education and vocational programs and enhancing active labor market
policies. The authorities’ initiative to improve the labor market prospects of low-skilled workers
through a combination of reduced social security contributions and in-job benefits are welcome.
External competitiveness has been preserved in recent years with wages growing in line with
productivity, and Slovakia’s market share in global exports continuing to expand. However,
maintaining competitiveness in the monetary union will require sustained structural reforms. In
addition to labor market and educational reforms, enhancing the business environment and
strengthening public sector governance, with a special emphasis on public procurement and the
absorption of EU funds are important.
