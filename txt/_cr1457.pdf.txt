STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 9, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context: The tightening of global liquidity has increased external pressures and
heightened the focus on India’s macroeconomic imbalances (high inflation, large current
account and fiscal deficits) and structural weaknesses (particularly supply bottlenecks in
infrastructure, power and mining).
Outlook and risks: Growth is expected to slow to 4.6 percent this fiscal year, the lowest
level in a decade, reflecting global developments and domestic supply constraints.
Headline CPI inflation is expected to remain near double digits for the remainder of the
fiscal year. The current account deficit is narrowing, driven by a significant improvement
in exports, robust remittances flows, and a rapid diminution of gold imports.
Nonetheless, India has very little room to adopt countercyclical policies, constrained by
persistently-high inflation, and sizeable fiscal and external imbalances. Spillovers from
renewed external pressures interacting with domestic vulnerabilities are the principal
risks.
Key policy recommendations:









High and persistent inflation is a key macroeconomic challenge facing India. Further
increases in the policy rate will be necessary to tackle high inflation and inflation
expectations.
If external pressures from global financial market volatility resume, rupee flexibility
should be the first line of defense, complimented by use of reserves, increases in
short-term interest rates, actions on the fiscal front, and further easing of constraints
on capital inflows.
Further fiscal consolidation is needed. Tax and subsidy reforms will be required to
durably lower fiscal imbalances.
Enhanced financial sector supervision, better monitoring of banks’ credit quality, and
improved information on corporate vulnerabilities will be needed as a basis for
tackling rising corporate and financial sector strains.
Addressing supply bottlenecks and structural challenges—particularly in the
agriculture and power sectors, and in the pricing and allocation of natural resources
(including coal, natural gas, and fertilizers)—will be essential to achieve faster growth,
job creation and poverty reduction.

Growth has fallen sharply. Growth averaged 8½ percent before and for two years after the

uncertainty.

2.
Balance of payment pressures intensified during the summer of 2013 as external
shocks interacted with domestic macroeconomic vulnerabilities. As global liquidity conditions
tightened, India was faced with significant portfolio debt outflows, and pressures on currency, equity,
and bond markets. Investor concerns were amplified by India’s persistently-high inflation, weakening
growth prospects, large current account and fiscal deficits, and domestic political uncertainty (Figure
2). In response, liquidity conditions were tightened, limits on FDI and external borrowing were
loosened, capital flow measures were introduced, and gold import duties were increased sharply (see
Selected Issues Chapter I).
3.
Over the past four months, a combination of improving external conditions and
domestic policy efforts have calmed markets. Externally, global financial markets improved as the
U.S. Fed decided not to advance the reduction in its monthly asset purchases. Domestically, the
central bank increased its headline policy rate and intervened in FX markets by offering USD swaps
to oil companies and to banks, with the latter leading to sizeable nonresident Indian (NRI) deposit
inflows. In addition, the parliament passed the land acquisition, pension and companies bills, and
thus far in 2013 the Cabinet Committee on Investment (CCI) has approved previously-stalled projects
worth around 5 percent of GDP. On the fiscal front, measures were implemented to continue to raise
diesel prices, to shrink the financial losses of state electricity boards, and to contain central
government spending. As external pressures eased, the government was able to unwind the earlier
steps taken to tighten liquidity and partly reverse restrictions on capital outflows (Annex I).
4.
Against the background of parliamentary elections (expected by May 2014) and
prospective global liquidity tightening, policy discussions centered on mitigating risks
associated with the challenging domestic and external economic environment. Discussions
focused on strengthening the macroeconomic position and containing vulnerabilities by narrowing
fiscal and external imbalances to create space for countercyclical policies (see text chart), the

but has been progressively tightened in 2013/14, consistent with Fund advice. Also, the central bank
has allowed the currency to adjust flexibly to market conditions and intervened sparingly to counter
excessive volatility in the exchange rate. Almost all key recommendations of the 2012 FSAP Update
have been implemented (Annex II) and progress has been made in improving electricity pricing, and
in achieving passage of the land acquisition, pension, and companies bills. Progress on product and
labor market reforms has, however, been limited.

growth is currently estimated at around 5½
percent but is expected to rise to its medium-term growth potential of around 6¾ percent (under
current policies) as unblocked investments are implemented and global growth improves. As a result
of the weak economy the output gap has been widening, and is now estimated at about 1 percent of
GDP.

These correspond to 4.4 percent (2013) and 5.4 percent (2014) at market prices.

7.
Despite the growing output gap, monthly CPI inflation (yoy) is expected to remain
near double-digits well into next year. The high headline inflation is a result of a number of
factors, including: food inflation feeding quickly into wages and core inflation; entrenched inflation
expectations; cost-push shocks from binding sector-specific supply constraints (particularly in
agriculture, energy, and transportation); the pass through from a weaker rupee; and ongoing energy
price increases. WPI inflation is expected to rise to 7.4 percent by March 2014, remaining well above
the RBI’s comfort zone and falling only slowly (to 6.3 percent by March 2015).
8.
The current account deficit is narrowing fast. The current account deficit reached a record
4.8 percent of GDP in 2012/13 due to sharply weaker exports, higher imports of oil and gold, and
binding supply constraints (particularly in coal and iron ore). India’s external vulnerabilities have
fallen significantly in recent months, helped by policy actions taken to shrink the current account and
strengthen capital flows. In particular, the current account deficit has been on a marked downward
trajectory as exports improved, remittance inflows remained solid, and higher import duties and
quantitative restrictions discouraged gold imports.2 In addition, non-oil, non-gold imports have
declined in line with weak domestic demand, and capital inflows have strengthened.
9.
Staff expect the current account deficit to fall to around US$61 billion (3.3 percent of
GDP) in 2013/14. The current account deficit is expected to continue declining over the mediumterm as domestic mining constraints ease, external demand improves, and the competitivenessenhancing effects of depreciation are fully realized. This smaller deficit is expected to be financed by
a combination of FDI and an increased reliance on debt, including inflows of deposits from nonresident Indians. There are, however, risks that the current account deficit could be higher depending
on: (i) the ability to successfully lower CPI inflation (which will be essential to generate the sustained
reduction in gold imports and increase in households financial savings that is assumed in the
forecasts); (ii) the potential for higher oil prices; and (iii) the pace of recovery of external demand.
India’s gross international reserves are comfortable (at US$296 billion at end-December 2013, or
145 percent of the Fund’s reserve adequacy metric) and are expected to rise steadily to US$314
billion by March 2015 (Figure 3).

However, the limits on gold imports should be viewed only as a stop-gap measure and have the potential to
become less effective over time (including from increased smuggling). Durably lowering the demand for gold as a
store of value will only be achieved through low inflation, raising real interest rates on deposits, and ensuring
macroeconomic stability.

The principal risk facing India is the
inward spillover from a tightening of global
liquidity interacting with domestic vulnerabilities
(Annex III). International reserves are ample, but
recent experience highlights that, with U.S. monetary
policy normalizing, the impact from global financial
market volatility could be disruptive (Figure 4). With
a still-significant external financing need, India is

INDIA

exposed to higher global interest rates and a reversal of capital flows. Such pressures could tighten
domestic financial conditions, weaken corporate and bank balance sheets, curtail credit growth, and
force a further procyclical tightening of monetary and fiscal policy. This could further raise borrowing
costs, trigger portfolio outflows, and create the potential for disorderly adjustments in exchange rate
and asset prices. Potential upsides to the outlook would arise from healthier global growth or lower
oil prices.
11.
On the domestic front, risks stem from slow progress in addressing infrastructure and
supply-side constraints (particularly in the power and transportation sectors). Unless binding
supply constraints are decisively addressed, high inflation and slow growth will continue to
undermine macroeconomic and financial stability, necessitating a tighter monetary policy stance (Box
1). Given the commitment to medium-term fiscal consolidation, fiscal policy will not be able to
provide support to domestic demand, which will also weigh on growth. On the other hand, growth
upsides could arise from further investor-confidence-boosting policy actions (for example, if diesel
price increases were accelerated), a greater-than-expected response of exports to the weaker
currency, or faster implementation of CCI-approved projects. Outward spillovers from an output
shock in India would have modest global implications (given the scale of India’s trade and financial
flows), but would affect some neighboring countries in South Asia through trade, remittances and
FDI channels (see Selected Issues Chapter II).
Authorities’ Views
12.
The authorities were more sanguine than staff about India’s near-term growth
prospects. Citing green shoots in the data for power generation and exports, good agricultural
performance and robust rural demand, they consider a growth projection of 5 percent to be
reasonable for FY13/14, rising to 8 percent in 2–3 years. Order books are filling up, iron ore projects
have been unlocked, and thus far in 2013 the CCI has cleared projects worth US$95 billion, which
should translate into a pickup in activity in the final months of FY 2013/14. The authorities noted
that final GDP data, using the broader-based Annual Survey of Industries, would be higher than the
preliminary, industrial production-based quarterly GDP figures. They were also of the view that fiscal
expenditure restraint would not have a material effect on near-term growth.
13.
The authorities agreed that a sharp adverse swing in market sentiment prompted by a
scaling back of unconventional monetary policies (UMP) in advanced economies is the main
risk currently facing India. They pointed to the need for greater clarity and communication by
policy-makers in advanced economies in regard to the planned pace of UMP tapering. At the same
time, they considered that India’s domestic fundamentals were strong (reflected in the
oversubscription of the IFC’s first off-shore issuance of rupee-linked bonds), and that vulnerabilities
had been addressed, particularly on the external side. The authorities stated that the recent decline
in gold imports can be sustained, given the introduction of inflation-indexed bonds—offering
households an alternative inflation hedge to gold—and further stabilization of the macroeconomic
situation. They agreed with staff that exchange rate flexibility is an important policy feature that
helps to contain external risks, and considered the RBI’s stock of international reserves to be broadly
adequate to address any need to smooth short-term volatility.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA

14.
The authorities noted that India has demonstrated its ability to respond to shocks and
market concerns. While recognizing that more chronic problems—such as persistent inflation—
have been allowed to linger, the authorities argued that vigorous policy responses had been
forthcoming when actions were urgently needed. For example, when the fiscal deficit became a
matter of concern in FY 2012/13, the Ministry of Finance delivered on restraining spending to meet
the deficit target. Similarly, when markets feared the current account deficit was becoming excessive,
the government put in place effective measures to rein it in and to mobilize over $34 billion in net
capital inflows (largely through NRI deposits).3

POLICY PRIORITIES
India has very little space for countercyclical policy stimulus. Monetary policy will need to be tightened
to durably reduce inflation, and high budget deficits afford little scope for fiscal support to the economy.
As a result, expediting structural reforms is the only feasible option to boost both actual and potential
growth, create jobs to absorb India’s rapidly-growing labor force, and reduce poverty.

A. Monetary Policy
15.
In the summer, in the midst of exchange
market pressures, the RBI took a number of steps
to tighten domestic liquidity and support the
exchange rate (Annex IV). India’s monetary policy
response relied on a tightening of money market
liquidity engineered by:

The RBI introduced two foreign exchange swap schemes in September 2013—one to encourage new foreign
exchange deposits into India by non-resident Indians with a minimum term of three years; and one to encourage
long-term overseas foreign exchange borrowing by banks. Under both swap schemes, the RBI agreed to sell to banks
on a forward basis and until November 30, 2013, USD against rupees at concessional rates, which gives rise to
multiple currency practices (MCP) relating solely to capital transactions. These MCPs are not subject to Fund approval
because the Fund has declined to assert jurisdiction over MCPs relating solely to capital transactions (see
BUFF/85/34).
4

The initial recalibration of the LAF on July 15 specified an overall limit of 1 percent of NTDL of the banking system.
LAF is a key element of the operating framework of the RBI.

5

The MSF allows banks to borrow overnight at their discretion up to two percent of the respective NTDLs, at a margin
above the repo rate, against collateral of government securities.

Undertaking open market sales of Government of India Securities by the RBI (of around INR 150

As a result, the interbank call money market rate was increased by some 300 basis points with the
MSF rate becoming the effective policy rate, money market and three-month t-bill rates rose by
about 300 basis points, and there were lesser increases in rates further out the yield curve. The
preference for these liquidity-tightening measures to increase short-term interest rates (rather than
increase the policy rate) was due to the fact they could be put in place quickly and be easily
unwound as pressures eased. In addition, these measures were more targeted at supporting the
rupee by significantly raising the short-term costs of shorting the currency. A comparable tightening
(of 300 bps) undertaken through increases in the repo rate would have been unprecedented, likely
had a larger impact on growth, and been politically difficult to achieve.

17.
However, inflation remains too high and the RBI will need to continue raising policy
rates in the coming months. High and persistent inflation is a key vulnerability that has caused
household inflation expectations to continuously exceed actual inflation and become embedded in
behaviors. This, in turn, has driven a rising demand for gold and is adding to downward pressures on
the rupee. The RBI’s resolve to pay greater attention to headline CPI in monetary policy formulation
and to strengthen its anti-inflationary efforts are commendable. However, the ingrained nature of
inflation and inflation expectations mean that reducing inflation—even over a protracted horizon—
will require significant increases in policy rates, which will weigh on growth.6 Given uncertainties
surrounding the strength and lags associated with the monetary transmission mechanism, an
incremental approach to monetary tightening is warranted. However, it will be important to
6

As an illustrative guide of the adjustment required, calculations using a Taylor rule (embedded in a structural
forecasting and policy model customized to India’s specific circumstances) suggest that the repo rate would need to
rise significantly over the next six months from its end-November level of 7.75 percent, in order to lower inflation
expectations, tackle inflation inertia, and sustainably lower CPI inflation to around 7 percent by end-2015 (see
Selected Issues Chapter III).

communicate the RBI’s policy reaction function and the shift in its tolerance for high CPI inflation
through clear forward guidance on the direction and intent of policy. In addition, should high
inflation expectations persist and inflation remain sticky, a more front-loaded path of interest rate
increases may be needed (Figure 5).
18.
Sustainably lowering inflation will require a simpler monetary framework with clear
objectives and operational autonomy for the RBI:


The RBI should move towards adopting the containment of inflation as its primary objective, with
headline CPI inflation providing the principal nominal anchor for monetary policy.7 The evolution
of the CPI plays a key role in influencing both inflation expectations and wage formation.8 While
the RBI should see through the impact of transitory shocks, the current evolution of food prices,
rising at a rapid pace for several years, is not a transitory phenomenon and reflects both
consumption demand and supply constraints. In addition, empirically, food price shocks
propagate strongly and rapidly into non-food, non-fuel (core) prices.



To further enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy, the RBI should clearly communicate
how it intends to meet its stated inflation objectives and, as part of that process, should publish
rolling one-year-ahead projections of both the CPI and WPI.



In terms of monetary operations, the overnight repo rate should remain the principal policy tool,
deployed in the context of a fully flexible exchange rate.



In the context of implementation of the Financial Sector Legislative Reform Commission’s (FSLRC)
recommendations (Box 2), legislative changes should be made to underpin the RBI’s operational
autonomy.

Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities agreed that inflation was too high, and that monetary policy would
need to remain vigilant over the near term. At the same time, they noted that supply-driven, food
inflation is a key driver of the headline number. With the good monsoon this year, they believed
food inflation should fall and that, in any case, monetary policy has a limited role in tackling food
inflation. The authorities agreed that the output gap remains significantly negative and should help
lower inflation going forward. As a result, they consider that the growth – inflation tradeoff will need
to be carefully managed and there was a significant risk of overtightening, particularly in light of the
need to create jobs to absorb India’s growing labor force.9 The central bank noted that, given the
7

The RBI has had both an immediate inflation objective (WPI inflation should lie within a range of 4–4½ percent) and
a long-term inflation objective (WPI inflation at 3 percent). The weight attached to these objectives is unclear, since
WPI inflation has exceeded the target range for the past three years and is projected by the RBI to remain at around
6½ percent in the near-term.
8

A narrower focus, for example on core CPI, would not be appropriate. See R. Anand, D. Ding and V. Tulin (2013),
“Assessing Second-Round Effects of Commodity-Price Shocks in India”, IMF WP (forthcoming) for a discussion.
9

As such, at its December 2013 policy meeting, the RBI opted to leave rates on hold, providing time to examine

risks of derailing the ongoing economic recovery and uncertainties surrounding monetary
transmission, a gradualist approach was needed to disinflate the economy over an extended period.
They were less persuaded of the need for a further, significant increase in policy rates to lower
inflation and inflationary expectations. Instead, they believed it would be prudent to give some time
for the effects of the recent interest rate increases to feed through before revising the policy stance.
20.
The authorities indicated they would take a view on possible changes to the monetary
policy framework only after the Patel Committee issues its report (expected in early 2014). They
emphasize that they have been working, through their communications strategy, to shift the dialog
with markets toward the CPI, which they consider will enhance the RBI’s credibility on inflation issues
over the medium term. They are not persuaded of the need to release rolling, year ahead forecasts of
inflation, but they made it clear that significant internal and public conversations are still to be had
before the authorities settle on any change in the basic monetary policy set-up.

fundamentals. Based on a range of empirical
methodologies, the FY 2013/14-average real
effective exchange rate appears to be slightly over-valued (Annex V).10 As such, and given the sizable
inflation differential with trading partners, some further modest nominal depreciation from current
levels should not be a cause for concern.

22.
Recent policy measures have been targeted at improving the environment for capital
inflows. India has shifted from a pre-Lehman Brothers era where FDI flows more-than-financed the
CAD, to a situation where FDI covered only around one quarter of the deficit in 2012/13, with a
corresponding increased reliance on debt flows. Over the past year the authorities have taken
multiple steps to bolster capital inflows, including liberalizing the caps on FDI inflows; relaxing

Based on the External Balance Assessment, the May 2013 External Sector Report concluded that India’s cyclicallyadjusted current account and the value of the rupee are broadly in line with fundamentals, with the EBA current
account regression approach indicating that the current account deficit was smaller than a level compatible with
fundamentals and desired policies. Since the release of the External Sector Report, subsequent calculations by Fund
staff suggest that the medium-term current account norm for India is a deficit which is centered around 2½ percent
of GDP, a level slightly smaller than the forecasted medium-term current account (see Annex V).

restrictions on external commercial borrowing; offering FX swaps to banks to attract more NRI
deposits and increase banks’ ability to borrow; and working with the IFC in its US$1 billion bond
program directed at offshore investors. The authorities have also supported the currency by
providing dollars directly to oil importers through FX swaps (see Annex IV for details of FX swaps to
banks and oil importers and their impact).11 In addition, a swap line with the Ministry of Finance
Japan has been increased from $15 billion to $50 billion, and the government is considering
increasing imports of cheaper Iranian oil, which can be partly settled in rupees.
23.
Further opening up of the capital account should, however, be undertaken prudently.
The opening to FDI and portfolio flows which occurred in 2013 will help finance the current account
deficit. However, given the potential risks to corporate balance sheets, a further relaxation of external
commercial borrowing (ECB) rules should be undertaken only incrementally and cautiously alongside
a deeper domestic financial market. Options of issuing a maiden international sovereign bond, if
market conditions permit, and of seeking entry into global bond indices, should be explored. The
authorities could also look into increasing the availability of bilateral swap lines. The flexible rupee
and recent movements in the currency have increased incentives to hedge FX exposures. As such, the
relaxation of restrictions that reduce the depth of the onshore forwards and futures markets would
be beneficial.12
24.
If external pressures re-emerge, a well-communicated package of policy measures
should be put in place to minimize disruptive movements in the currency and bolster
confidence. Going forward, an improving export environment, an easing of supply bottlenecks to
shrink import demand, and a smaller fiscal deficit should help reduce external vulnerabilities.
Nevertheless, if capital account pressures were to resurface, continuing to allow the rupee to adjust
flexibly to market conditions will be essential. In addition, a comprehensive plan should be
announced to:


Tighten monetary conditions through both an increase in the repo rate and a renewal of liquidity
tightening measures to make it more costly to short the rupee. Such measures would help
contain the inflationary impact of exchange rate depreciation and, temporarily, bolster the capital
account position. However, liquidity tightening should be seen as a complement to, not an
expedient substitute for, raising the repo rate. In following this approach, it will be essential to
clearly communicate the central bank’s intentions and its motivations for using the range of tools
it has in its monetary toolkit.

11

The magnitude of the FX swaps is fully disclosed through the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) template
on both the RBI and IMF websites.

12

Key restrictions include: banks have been banned from proprietary trading in domestic currency futures and
exchange traded options; margin requirements on domestic U.S. dollar-rupee forward trades were doubled to 100
percent; and FIIs and NRIs cannot trade currency futures in India.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA



Deploy India’s ample FX reserves, including by again taking oil marketing companies out of the
spot market and offering them a short-term bilateral FX swap window priced at market rates.
Recent experience indicates that this has been an effective strategy in changing market
expectations and, as such, should be used again.



Similarly, FX swaps for NRI deposits (at market-based rates and without the subsidy embedded in
the recent NRI swaps) should again be offered if needed.



A clear package of fiscal measures, in addition to those needed to achieve fiscal targets, would
help support confidence and lessen the burden on the central bank in reacting to market
pressures. These could include administrative action to raise diesel prices at a faster pace, and
further limit the subsidized consumption of LPG.



Measures to further restrict capital outflows should be avoided, not least because recent
experience suggests that they could well be counterproductive, potentially catalyzing capital
flight through different routes. The renunciation of such measures should be clearly
communicated to bolster investor confidence.

The mission noted that it would be important for the government to develop an agreed set of
contingency plans—along the lines described above—so as to be ready to react to heightened
market pressures. These plans should be fully coordinated across the relevant government agencies
and would constitute a highly valuable preparatory exercise.
Authorities’ Views
25.
The authorities argued that external vulnerabilities have been greatly reduced, owing
in large part to strong policy actions taken. Gold imports have been sharply curtailed, and goods
and services exports are starting to pick up even before the full impact of rupee depreciation is felt.
FII debt inflows have been negative since May but equity investment flows have remained resilient.
With only a relatively small amount of FII debt remaining, the mix of FII money now present on
Indian markets has become more durable. The authorities noted the effectiveness of the FX-swap
scheme for oil marketing companies in stabilizing the currency market and shifting market
sentiment. They also pointed to the success of their efforts to mobilize durable capital inflows,
particularly from NRIs and FDI.
26.
The authorities agreed that exchange rate flexibility would continue to be a key pillar
of their response to external volatility. In their view, the broad thrust of the liquidity tightening
and FX intervention policies employed during July-September had been correct. They argued that
with the Reserve Bank of India moving towards improved communication of its views, the risk of
volatility would be further reduced. Looking ahead, if faced with a similar round of capital flow
volatility, they indicated that the thrust of their response would likely be similar, using a combination
of exchange rate flexibility, some monetary tightening, and, if needed, limited use of foreign
exchange reserves.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27.
The authorities indicated that a new crisis management framework has been
established under the management of the inter-regulatory Financial Stability and
Development Council (FSDC). The authorities argued that this group, which has met regularly over
the past few months, should enhance India’s ability to respond to shocks threatening the Indian
financial system. At the same time, they recognized this was a work-in-progress and agreed with
staff’s suggestion to test the FSDC crisis management system, potentially in a “war game exercise”
setting.

C. Fiscal Policy
28.
There is a firm commitment to meet the 2013/14 fiscal deficit target, but achieving this
goal will be challenging. The authorities demonstrated their commitment to fiscal consolidation by
meeting the Budget deficit target for 2012/13, despite a slowing economy (Figure 6). Politically
difficult steps were taken to raise fuel and retail electricity prices, target direct cash transfers using
the expanding Unique Identification (UID) program (Box 3), and restructure the debt of public
electricity distribution companies. For 2013/14, the Budget deficit target of 4.8 percent of GDP
appears achievable.13 However, weak revenue growth, higher global oil prices, rupee depreciation,
and higher interest rates, mean that achieving this near-term goal will entail significant reductions in
spending. For this fiscal year, in addition to the announced measures to rationalize non-plan
expenditure, the target is expected to be met by requiring agencies to give up un-utilized spending
allocations, and to not release further budgeted amounts to such agencies. In addition, cash-rich
public sector enterprises are being asked to transfer higher dividends to the central government.
Such efforts, however, will create a substantial additional drag on growth, particularly given that
fiscal multipliers on such spending are relatively large in India. 14 Additional fiscal reforms (including
better-targeted subsidies, introduction of a GST and direct tax code) are unlikely to be introduced
before the May 2014 general elections, although there is some discussion of raising diesel prices at a
somewhat faster pace in the remainder of this fiscal year.
29.
The government’s goal of a 3 percent of GDP deficit target by 2016/17 represents a
reasonable medium-term consolidation plan, but the policies to achieve that outcome have
yet to be articulated.15 A better quality of fiscal adjustment could be achieved through a more
balanced package of revenue measures and expenditure reductions. In particular, the staff would
recommend the following package of fiscal reforms to meet the authorities’ medium-term fiscal
target:
Approving the goods and services tax. This represents the single most important revenue reform
and will help boost growth by lessening distortions and creating a single Indian market for goods
and services.



13

This implies a deficit of 5.3 percent of GDP under the IMF’s definition, due to the differential treatment of
disinvestment proceeds.
14

See J. Tapsoba (2013), “Options and Strategies for Fiscal Consolidation in India,” IMF WP 13/127.

15

Staff’s medium-term fiscal forecasts are calculated on the basis of current policies and, as such, show relatively little
fiscal adjustment in the coming years.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA



Approving a new direct tax code with streamlined and smaller deductions, raising excise taxes
back to pre-GFC levels, and improving tax administration.



Reforming untargeted subsidies on fuel and fertilizer. Continuing the ongoing move toward
targeted transfers will have strong beneficial effects on growth and the distribution of income.
This should be the central plank of expenditure rationalization and will allow spending to be
redirected toward more socially- and economically-productive areas (including greater
investment in health and education). An important step would be to raise diesel prices at a more
accelerated pace, so as to ensure full cost recovery by mid-2014 (and thereafter link domestic
fuel prices to movements in international prices).



Targeting food subsidies. The recently-passed Food Security Act—which aims to provide
subsidized rice, wheat and coarse cereals to 67 percent of the population—is expected to add
significantly to the fiscal subsidy burden going forward (Box 4). Efforts should be made to
convert these subsidies to a system of targeted, direct cash transfers as quickly as possible. In
addition, governance and transparency in the allocation of subsidized food should be
strengthened and the efficiency of the Public Distribution System enhanced.



Adhering to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (2003) by the central
government. This would imply that the central government commits and adheres to a credible
path of fiscal consolidation, reaching a central government deficit of 3 percent of GDP by FY
2016/17.



Minimizing additional pressures on the fiscal position from future bank recapitalization needs
(including by increased bank provisioning) and the liabilities of electricity distribution companies
(by continuing to raise tariffs to cost recovery levels).

Focusing on the implementation of a more sustainable package of fiscal reforms, as described above,
would build confidence, support monetary policy in fighting inflation, free resources for investment,
lessen vulnerabilities and generate a positive dynamic of lower financing costs and improved
economic and social prospects. Without such measures, the composition of fiscal adjustment will
likely be met through a compression in needed capital spending or an underfunding of important
social programs, which would undermine growth and the government’s laudable pro-poor and
inclusive growth goals (see Selected Issues Chapter IV).
30.
Even without medium-term fiscal adjustment, government debt remains on a
sustainable trajectory, and is projected to stabilize at around 64 percent of GDP in 2017/18.
The public debt sustainability analysis (DSA) using the Fund’s new DSA template suggests that India’s
public debt burden remains manageable. While the baseline scenario already uses conservative real
GDP growth assumptions, further negative growth shocks represent one of the major risks to the
debt outlook, with shocks to real interest rates and contingent liabilities posing additional risks (see
Annex VI).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA

Authorities’ Views
31.
The government has reiterated the importance of meeting its FY13/14 Budget deficit
target. The authorities stated that this was a “redline” with strong credibility implications if not met.
As such, no slippage will be permitted. They argued that revenue performance this year is on track,
and they emphasized that meeting the deficit target does not entail an expenditure cut, but only
involves expenditure rationalization by recalling unspent balances with spending units and not
releasing further budgeted amounts to them. Fiscal accounting in India is done on a cash, not accrual
basis, so the authorities recognize the risk that some spending pressure from this year could spill
into next year. However, they point to the fact that similar spillovers happen every year, and they
argue that there is no evidence that the size of this carryover is growing from year to year.
32.
The authorities agreed that fiscal consolidation was needed over the medium term. In
their eyes, the goal of reducing the central government deficit to 3 percent of GDP (authorities’
definition) by 2016/17 is achievable, but they did not believe there was a need to re-invigorate the
Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) process. The FRBM Act has recently been
amended to adopt this target, therefore, revising the Act at this stage may not be needed. Revenue
enhancement is key, particularly through better tax administration, and the authorities were hopeful
that the goods and services tax (GST) and the direct tax code (DTC) bills will be passed by next year.
The authorities are also optimistic that direct cash transfers—combined with the unique
identification (Aadhaar) system—will generate significant fiscal savings through de-duplication of
subsidy recipient rolls. The authorities do not see significant risks to fiscal consolidation from
implementation of the Food Security Act, and underlined the importance of the Act in tackling
poverty and hunger and ensuring improved social outcomes.

D. Financial and Corporate Sector Issues
33.
Strains are building as corporate financial positions deteriorate and bank asset quality
weakens (Figure 7). Slowing growth, the delayed authorization of permits for infrastructure projects,
and rising costs of capital are placing pressure on corporate profitability. Average corporate leverage
and debt payment capacity are not markedly worse than during the global financial crisis, but default
probabilities of the most vulnerable 10 percent of firms are far greater than in 2009. This vulnerability
is further aggravated by concentration risk: banking sector loans to India’s ten largest conglomerates
account for almost 100 percent of banks’ net worth.16 The banking system is well capitalized (the
capital adequacy ratio was 13.8 percent in March 2013), but nonperforming assets (4.2 percent of
total advances) and restructured loans (an additional 5.7 percent of gross advances) are expected to
continue to rise. The deterioration in credit quality has been worse among public banks where
lending is concentrated in poorer-performing sectors such as infrastructure (especially power),
aviation, agriculture, steel, and textiles. However, despite the sizeable recent depreciation in the
exchange rate, there has, as yet, been little apparent additional strain on corporate balance sheets
arising from currency mismatches (see Selected Issues Chapter V). In addition, new capital injections
16

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA

for India’s banks (to meet Basle III requirements and additional capital requirements due to
restructured loans being reclassified as NPAs) are likely to be manageable (Box 5).
34.
Enhanced financial sector supervision and monitoring, and increased bank
provisioning, are warranted. To tackle rising strains in the financial system, and improve the
functioning of financial intermediation more broadly, the RBI has outlined its plans to further
enhance the monitoring and supervision of banks’ credit quality and require banks to further
increase provisioning. In particular, the RBI’s recently-introduced incremental provisioning and
capital requirements for bank lending to corporates with foreign-currency exposures are steps in the
right direction. As recommended in the FSAP, advances and commitments to interrelated companies
should be appropriately measured and limited, and the existing ceilings fully enforced—this is a
critical measure and should be undertaken prior to issuing new banking licenses (see Annex II). A
further priority should be to gather information on, and analyze, the inter-linkages between
corporate vulnerabilities and the health of the banking system, particularly on the extent of
unhedged FX exposures of large firms with international operations.
35.
Strengthening prudential regulation for banks’ asset quality classification and
concentration risks are needed. Implementation of the Mahapatra Committee’s recommendations
(to more rigorously classify restructured advances) is a step in the right direction, but further
measures in the areas of asset quality recognition and concentration risks are needed. The objective
should be to fully recognize the true asset quality of banks’ portfolios, with restructured loans
counted toward nonperforming assets immediately after a restructuring, and then moved to the
performing bucket only after a period of satisfactory performance. This is of particular importance for
the public sector banks. Moreover, all sectors of the economy (including infrastructure and real
estate) should be subject to the same loan quality classification rules.17
36.
Enhancing the institutional and legal framework for debt recovery is an important step.
This will require improvements in the legal and institutional insolvency framework, the regime for
insolvency professionals, the functioning of the distressed asset market, and out-of-court settlement
procedures. Initial steps by the FSLRC to explore updating India’s financial regulatory architecture
should be intensified, to bring the institutional and legal framework in line with India’s fast-growing
and complex financial system.
37.
Various financial sector reforms should increase credit availability and broaden access
to financial services. Recently-announced plans to simplify bank branch licensing, create
inclusiveness criteria for underserved areas, and enhance competition in the banking sector—
including by accelerating the approval process for new private sector banks and opening the Indian
market further to foreign banks—will expand access. The December 2013 introduction of CPIindexed bonds (particularly those sold to retail clients) is a further positive step and will help reduce
17

The banking sector is subject to a number of additional regulatory requirements, many of which are distortionary in
nature. These issues have been covered in the 2012 Financial Sector Stability Assessment Update (IMF Country Report
No. 13/8).

the demand for gold and divert savings to productive uses, intermediated by the domestic financial
system. Other welcome reforms already underway include: introduction of a ten-year bond futures
contract; improvement in the recovery mechanism for distressed debt; and establishing the central
large borrowers’ database, which will improve the supervision of large exposures. In addition to these
efforts, gradually reducing the Statutory Liquidity Requirement, concomitant with a decline in the
fiscal deficit, will help free up resources for lending to the private sector rather than channeling
savings into government securities. On the financial inclusion side, the Governor’s call for a feasibility
study on mobile banking offers the possibility to integrate currently un-banked segments of India’s
population into the financial system.
Authorities’ Views
38.
The authorities recognize that corporate profitability has fallen, putting pressure on
financial sector balance sheets. They agreed with staff that these pressures, while manageable at
present, will need to be carefully monitored going forward, and noted that other major EMs are
facing similar strains. The RBI is keen to find ways to incentivize the early recognition of problem
assets by banks, and the authorities feel that the newly-adopted Companies Act should over time
facilitate a clearer insolvency framework. The authorities also acknowledge that the foreign exchange
exposure of Indian corporates is not fully clear, but they believe that most such borrowing has either
a formal or natural hedge.
39.
The authorities emphasized the potential impact of a range of reforms to strengthen
financial intermediation and advance financial inclusion. In particular, the RBI laid out the five
pillars of its planned developmental measures to improve the Indian financial system. These include:
(i) strengthening the monetary policy framework; (ii) enhancing banking structure (through new bank
entry, branch expansion, encouraging new varieties of banks); (iii) broadening financial markets (by
improving the liquidity and depth of government securities, money, derivatives, and corporate debt
markets); (iv) expanding financial inclusion (involving better access to finance for SMEs, the
underserved parts of the population, through technology (such as mobile banking) and business
practices (for example, maintaining the requirement that banks open at least 25 percent of their
branches in unbanked rural centers); and (v) improving the financial system’s ability to handle
corporate and financial institution distress (by strengthening financial restructuring, procedures for
rescue of viable businesses, and insolvency practices).

E. Structural Policies to Boost Growth
40.
Key structural reforms are needed to reduce supply bottlenecks, bolster employment
growth, improve medium-term growth prospects, enhance growth inclusiveness, and reduce
poverty. While major policy actions may understandably be difficult to implement ahead of the
general elections expected by May 2014, any positive steps taken would enhance investment,
improve the supply response of the economy, and help raise potential growth.
41.
Nonetheless, slow action on key structural reforms (introduction of GST, comprehensive
energy and fertilizer subsidy reforms, agricultural reforms, and power sector reforms) continues to
18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA

adversely affect sentiment and domestic investment (see Selected Issues Chapter VI). Needed
inclusive growth-promoting measures include:


Addressing structural challenges in the power sector and in natural resources. State Electricity
Boards (SEBs) have raised tariffs but much more needs to do be done to eliminate losses. The
pricing and allocation of a wide range of natural resources (including coal, natural gas, electricity,
and fertilizers) are subject to complex and cumbersome mechanisms and regulations, which need
to be addressed. Moving the pricing and allocation of natural resources toward a market basis
would make them more transparent and raise investment.



Easing strict labor regulations and addressing skills mismatches. These will be vital to raise
productivity, increase formal sector employment, and improve potential growth. Raising
educational attainments and enhanced focus on vocational training are required to ease India’s
skill mismatch (see also Selected Issues Chapter VII).



Reforming the agriculture sector, particularly reducing administrative inefficiencies in food
distribution, pricing, and storage, and boosting productivity in agricultural production.



Enhancing health and education outcomes by sustainably increasing spending, improving their
quality, raising the efficiency of social programs and focusing on inclusiveness (as emphasized in
the 12th Five-Year Plan).



Strengthening the business, trade, and investment climate and enhancing governance. According
to a range of business environment indicators, India underperforms in areas necessary to run a
business (e.g. trading across borders, enforcing contracts, and resolving insolvency) but performs
better in the areas of obtaining credit and protecting investors (Figure 8).

Authorities’ Views
42.
There is consensus that structural reforms are going to be the lynchpin of an eventual
rebound in growth. The authorities note that a number of long-awaited legislative measures have
been passed recently, and that the Cabinet Committee on Investment is now seeing success in
unlocking key infrastructure projects. Power linkages are well-understood as a bottleneck, and more
effective health and education spending will be key to ensuring that the “demographic dividend”
pays off. At the same time, there is not the same level of consensus on the need for labor market
reform, and the authorities do not agree with India’s ranking on the World Bank’s ease of doing
business indicators, questioning the methodology used in arriving at these rankings. They pointed
instead to the recent Ernst and Young Global Confidence Barometer (issued October 2013), which
ranked India among the most favored of global investment destinations.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
India presently faces a challenging macroeconomic landscape. A weakening risk appetite
toward major emerging market economies, along with global liquidity tightening, have placed
pressure on India’s balance of payments. However, there is little room for countercyclical
macroeconomic policies to respond. Rather, a tightening of fiscal and monetary policies is needed to
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

INDIA

narrow macroeconomic imbalances, supported by actions to relieve supply-side bottlenecks. The key
near-term risk arises from a sudden stop in external capital inflows, emanating from either domestic
or external triggers.
44.
The immediate outlook is for a gradual growth recovery and persistently-high
inflation. Growth will reach its nadir in 2013 on weaker domestic investment and tepid external
demand. India’s growth has underperformed in recent years, largely due to domestic factors (chief
among them policy uncertainty and supply-side bottlenecks). Headline CPI inflation will remain near
double digits for the remainder of the fiscal year, as second-round effects of high food price inflation
continue to drive inflation momentum.
45.
Recent policy initiatives have reduced vulnerabilities. The authorities have taken
substantive measures in recent months to narrow external and fiscal imbalances, raise policy interest
rates, move forward on structural reforms, accelerate project approvals, and manage market
volatility. Of particular importance have been measures to shrink energy subsidies, allow the
exchange rate to adjust, bolster capital inflows, and alleviate supply-side constraints. Continued clear
communication of these policy initiatives will enhance their effectiveness.
46.
The principal risk facing India remains the inward spillover from global financial
market volatility, involving a reversal of capital flows. If capital account pressures re-emerge,
then rupee flexibility should continue to be the first line of defense, complimented by the use of
reserves, tightening of monetary conditions, additional fiscal consolidation efforts, and further easing
of constraints on capital inflows. In addition, to prepare for further global financial market volatility,
the government should design a contingency plan and communication strategy that is wellcoordinated across agencies and can be rolled out in the event conditions deteriorate.
47.
High and persistent inflation remains a central macroeconomic challenge. High inflation
over the past several years has induced double-digit inflation expectations, driven a rising demand
for gold, and placed downward pressure on the exchange rate. Achieving a sustained reduction in
inflation will require a tightening of the monetary stance, possibly over a protracted period, which
inevitably will weigh on growth prospects. Headline CPI should provide the principal nominal anchor
for monetary policy, as food and fuel price shocks propagate rapidly into core inflation, and inflation
expectations and wage formation are closely linked to CPI inflation.
48.
The continued opening of the capital account and rupee flexibility are welcome. The
current account deficit financing mix would be improved by enhancing the environment for FDI.
However, given the potential risks to corporate balance sheets, further relaxation of limits on external
commercial borrowing (especially for sectors without natural hedges) should be implemented
cautiously. India’s flexible exchange rate will remain important to offset substantial inflation
differentials and respond to external shocks.
49.
Fiscal consolidation is essential and there is scope to improve the quality of that fiscal
adjustment. The authorities commitment to adhering to its near-term budget target is
commendable. While the medium-term fiscal targets and resulting pace of consolidation are broadly
20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA

appropriate, measures still need to be articulated and implemented to underpin the targeted fiscal
adjustment. Achieving this adjustment will require more efficient taxation (including through
introduction of the GST) and expenditure (including through reforms to fuel and fertilizer subsidies).
Steps taken to tie India’s social safety net to the UID program are welcome. Reorienting spending
toward 12th Plan priorities in health and education will require further reforms to fuel and fertilizer
subsidies.
50.
India’s financial system is well capitalized and supervised, but slowing growth has
highlighted corporate vulnerabilities and led to deteriorating bank asset quality. The RBI’s
recent initiatives to increase provisioning and capital requirements for bank lending to corporates
with foreign currency exposures are welcome steps, as is the improved loan classification of
restructured advances. A key information gap concerns the extent of unhedged foreign currency
exposure of large corporates, which should be rectified. Improvements in the legal and institutional
insolvency framework would also help deepen domestic capital markets.
51.
Broader structural reforms are needed to raise potential growth, particularly
improvements in the pricing of natural resources. While power distribution companies have
started raising tariffs and are being restructured, the pricing of natural resources (including coal,
natural gas, and fertilizer) should move toward a market basis to boost investment. In addition,
removing infrastructure constraints, easing restrictive labor laws and reforming agriculture
production and marketing will boost potential growth.
52.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12­month cycle.

Box 1. Debt, Inflation, and Growth1
Containing persistently-high inflation and a firm commitment to reducing the debtgenerating fiscal deficits are critical for achieving higher long-term growth. The conventional
view in the literature is that public debt can stimulate aggregate demand and output in the short run,
but crowds out capital and reduces output in the long run. Likewise, persistently-high inflation can
be detrimental for growth. There are also possible non-linear effects where the build-up of debt or
persistently-elevated inflation above a certain threshold can harm growth.
We provide a re-examination of the debt-inflation-growth relationship using recent
developments in dynamic heterogeneous panels, in a sample of 40 countries over the period
1966–2010. Cross-country experience shows that some economies have run into debt difficulties
and experienced subdued growth at relatively low debt levels, while others have been able to sustain
high levels of indebtedness for prolonged periods and grow strongly without experiencing debt
distress. This suggests that the effect of public debt on growth varies across countries, depending
critically on country-specific factors and institutions. The estimation strategy takes into account,
jointly, all three key features of panel data (i.e. dynamics, heterogeneity and cross-sectional
dependence).
Public debt and inflation are found to have significant negative long-run effects on growth.
The results indicate that, if the debt-to-GDP ratio is raised and this increase turns out to be
permanent, then it will have negative effects on economic growth in the long run. However, if the
increase is temporary and debt-to-GDP is subsequently brought back to its normal level, then there
are no long-run growth effects. Similarly, persistently-high inflation has a negative impact on longrun growth. A universally-applicable threshold effect in the relationship between either public debt

Box 2. Financial Sector Legislative Reform Commission (FSLRC)1
Motivation and reform strategy
In recognition of the fact that India’s financial regulatory architecture dates back to the 1930s, the Ministry of
Finance in March 2011 convened the FSLRC to propose reform of financial sector legislation. The aim was to
identify gaps and overlaps in existing law which—combined with financial and technical innovation—could give
rise to regulatory arbitrage, forum shopping, and other inefficiencies. The Commission, which submitted its report
(www.bit.ly/16svr5W) in March 2013, proposed a new Indian Financial Code (IFC), the aim of which is to establish
a single, unified legislative framework that could survive for the next 20-30 years. The principles of independence,
accountability and transparency underpin the design of the IFC; for example, all new regulations would need to
be justified by demonstration of the market failure they correct, and include a formal cost-benefit analysis.
Monetary policy
The draft IFC does not specify the objective of monetary policy, but rather leaves it to the Ministry of Finance
(MoF), which would issue a statement to this effect from time to time. While not enshrined in law, the objectives
would be quantitative, publicly disclosed, and once set, the RBI would have instrument independence to achieve
them. A formal, decision-making Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), appointed by the government and RBI,
would be accountable to an empowered RBI Board (but not to parliament), with regular publication of MPC
minutes. An independent debt management office would be established. Coordination between the MoF, RBI and
new agencies would be handled by an upgraded Financial Sector Development Council which would have
statutory authority. Capital controls would be regulated asymmetrically: MoF would regulate foreign exchange
inflows while RBI would regulate outflows.
Financial sector regulation and supervision
Given the lack of international consensus on best practice, the FSLRC settled on a model whereby a new Unified
Financial Agency (UFA) would undertake consolidated supervision of the entire nonbank financial sector,
including those NBFIs now supervised by the RBI. (RBI would continue to supervise banks.) The Commission felt
that this approach offered the best hope of avoiding the kind of regulatory lacunae that have led to a series of
challenges in recent years: unsupervised chit funds (Ponzi schemes, in effect); under-regulated credit
cooperatives; unit linked insurance plans which straddle insurance and investment products; and most recently
the poorly-supervised National Spot Exchange, which illegally allowed forward derivatives to be traded on its
platform. Enhanced consumer protection is also a key objective of the FSLRC reforms.

Assessment and next steps
The FSLRC report is not uncontroversial. It has generated much debate, and some of its recommendations were
the subject of formal dissents by some members of the Commission. The FSLRC report is expected to be a
fulcrum for discussions on financial sector reforms for the period ahead.

Box 3. Aadhaar: India’s Unique Identification Number1
The inability or complexity of proving who you are causes many Indian citizens to lose out on
public benefits, and makes access to financial services costly or unavailable. To address this
challenge, India’s Unique Identification Authority began to issue biometric identification numbers to
residents in August 2010. The goal is simple, yet India’s scale makes it a challenge.
The strategy is to issue 600 million unique identification (UID or “Aadhaar”) numbers by 2014,
and to reach more or less full coverage by 2018 (see bit.ly/16sigBN). Aadhaar aims to leverage
technology to eliminate ghosts and duplicates in subsidy rolls. Registration sites have been set up in
most localities, and they can register applicants even if power is temporarily off-line. Aadhaar
establishes identity but not citizenship, and signing up is voluntary. Only basic information is
collected: name, date of birth, gender, parents’ names (and UIDs, if available), address, and
importantly biometric data: all ten fingerprints and an iris scan.
It is the biometric data which renders
introduction of Aadhaar at India’s scale difficult.
Each new applicant must be verified not to be one
of the existing Aadhaar holders—a simple task
when the number of Aadhaar holders is small, but
the computational challenge grows as registration
rolls out across India. Each new applicant must be
biometrically checked against all those existing
Aadhaar holders. As of September 2013, over 400
million Indians had Aadhaar numbers, and as many
as 800,000 to 1 million new enrollees are added
daily.

Potential fiscal gains from introduction of Aadhaar include savings on subsidies due to “deduplication” of beneficiary rolls (e.g., elimination of ghosts), particularly as benefits are meant
to be deposited directly into special “no-frills” bank accounts for beneficiaries. Thus far, 23
million bank accounts have been linked to Aadhaar numbers, but that figure is expected to rise to
100 million by end-2013. Eventually Aadhaar will also contribute to better revenue performance
when it is integrated with direct and indirect tax databases.
Financial inclusion is an important objective of Aadhaar. As of 2010, only about 200–250 million
Indian citizens had bank accounts. Aadhaar has been approved by the RBI as a way to satisfy “know
your customer” (KYC) norms, and the UID Authority is working with financial regulators to enable
electronic, or e-KYC, platforms. Among other things, it is expected that Aadhaar will enhance the
coverage and therefore usefulness of the Credit Bureau, making access to financial products more
readily available to Indian citizens.

Box 4. Food Security Act: Fiscal Implications1
The National Food Security Act is an important effort to ensure that the majority of India’s
population has access to adequate quantities of food at affordable prices. The legislation is a
landmark, representing the largest food security program in the world, involving the distribution of
subsidized grain to two-thirds of India’s population of 1.2 billion persons. It proposes to cover up to
75 percent of the rural population, and up to 50 percent of the urban population, with an entitlement of 5
kg per person per month of food grains at issue prices of Rs. 2 and 3 per kg for wheat and rice,
respectively. Nonetheless, the Act has been introduced at a time when international experience indicates
that conditional cash transfers, rather than physical distribution of subsidized food, have been found to be
a more efficient means of achieving food and nutritional security.
The fiscal implications of the Food Security Act (FSA) are likely to be significant. The food subsidy
cost of implementing the FSA is estimated at Rs. 124,502 crores (about 1.1 percent of GDP) for fiscal year
2013/14. The food subsidy is calculated as [economic cost-issue price]*foodgrain requirement. The
“economic cost” (as computed by the Food Corporation of India) includes, in addition to the minimum
support price (MSP) paid to farmers, handling, storage and distribution costs. The “issue price” is the sale
price of grain to consumers; the “foodgrain requirement” is the quantity of foodgrains required under the
FSA. Food subsidy costs are estimated to increase to Rs. 140,192 and Rs. 157,701 crores, both about
1.1 percent of GDP, respectively, in FY 2014/15 and FY 2015/16. The “incremental” food subsidy under the
FSA—over and above the subsidy that is already provided under the existing Targeted Public Distribution
System (TPDS, see details below)—is estimated at Rs. 23,951 crores (equivalent to about 0.2 percent of FY
2013/14 GDP).
However, the FSA needs to be carefully evaluated to take into account not only the cost of the food
subsidy, but also three additional cost dimensions, which can potentially magnify the fiscal implications of
the FSA (see Table 1).




First, if implementation of the FSA includes “grandfathering” of existing beneficiaries, even when their
income levels may imply that they no longer qualify for
the FSA program, then the estimated fiscal cost could
be higher.
Second, if implementation of the FSA requires merging
the current classification under the TPDS with new and
more careful identification schemes, then there may be
misclassifications which could raise costs. For example,
there may be pressure to expand the size of those
classified as “covered” under FSA to include those who
are not truly poor, but are misclassified as such under
the current scheme.

Third, the open-ended procurement policies of the government (whereby the government commits to

2/ Includes buffer norms and strategic reserve for rice and wheat.



These estimates of the incremental costs of the FSA should be seen as tentative, as the precise costs
of the current TPDS (and additional welfare) schemes are not easy to calculate. Given the experience
that off take increases when grain is offered at very low prices, and that the estimates do not include
various additional expenditures stated in the Act which are difficult to quantify, the calculations here are
likely to be underestimates. Indeed, other sources have estimated higher fiscal costs of the FSA.2
Nonetheless, full implementation of the FSA is unlikely to happen in FY 2013/14, hence the immediate
implications for the government’s fiscal position will likely be more limited.

Box 5. The Potential Capital Needs of India’s Commercial Banking Sector1
Although manageable, India’s banks are likely to require significant new capital injections over
the next few years, based on the challenging operating environment, combined with the new
Basel III capital requirements. The challenges on the business front are embodied in the fastincreasing restructured advances, which now (as of March 2013) comprise 5.7 percent of the banking
systems’ gross advances, and 7.1 percent of the Public Sector Banks’ (PSBs) advances. Restructured
assets are usually not considered ‘non-performing’ in India, and their rapid rise has led some observers
to doubt the publicly displayed financial strength of many Indian banks. Here we stress-test the banks’
capital position with regard to sudden deterioration in loan quality, and evaluate the impact of Basel III
requirements via a dynamic simulation approach.
A stress test of banks’ balance sheets found the PSBs in particular vulnerable to a change in
classification on a significant share of restructured loans to non-performing assets (NPAs). Each
bank’s balance sheet was stressed individually, based on 45 percent of restructured advances moving to
NPAs, and those NPAs being provisioned against loss at a minimum 60 percent.2 3 All banks are
compared with regards to their Tier 1 capital ratio and their ratio of impaired loans after provisions. As
of March 2013, the average Tier 1 ratio is more than 3 percent higher for private sector banks than for
public banks, with private banks’ impaired-loans-to-provisions ratio almost 1.4 percent lower. Moving
from the March 2013 data points to the post-stress data, the average Tier 1 ratio decreased by about
1.7 percent for the PSBs, and less than 0.4 percent for the private sector banks, respectively. Mean
impaired loans after provisions increased by almost 1.4 percent for PSBs, and less than 0.3 percent for
private banks. The figure below also shows how the banks location in Tier 1 – Impaired Loans after
Provisions space shifts, with the PSBs moving significantly to the right.

The average provisioning ratio of private sector banks is slightly above 60 percent; this provisioning ratio was used as a
minimum. If a bank’s provisioning ratio for 2012/13 exceeded that number, its actual number was used.

Historically, about 15 percent of restructured advances have moved into NPAs, with the authorities having used a

Box 5. The Potential Capital Needs of India’s Commercial Banking Sector (concluded)
Employing more severe scenario assumptions illustrates the potential for significantly higher
potential recapitalization costs for the government . Assuming that both the PSBs’ NPAs and their
restructured loans double, with three alternative provisioning ratio scenarios assumed (restructured
loans provisioned at 50 percent, both restructured loans and the existing NPAs at 75 percent, and both
at 100 percent), and under a 7 percent Tier 1 target capital ratio for all PSBs, Table 1 illustrates these
results. In the most severe case, the government’s share of the recapitalization cost would amount to
5 percent of FY2012–13 GDP.

The additional bank capital that will need to be raised for the PSB’s based on Basel III capital
requirements will likely be moderate (Table 2). The capital needs of banks will increase with faster
credit growth, and with the amount that banks desire to hold above the March 2018 Tier 1 capital ratio
of 7 percent. For alternative values of this cushion—0, 1, and 2 percent—and using return on assets
(ROA) or return on equity (ROE) as the profit driver, the cost for the central government does not
exceed 2 percent of FY 2017–18 GDP.4 The cells reflecting results of scenarios deemed more plausible
are highlighted in Table 2.

In order to get a comprehensive overview of the exposures of larger

with the banks. It is not clear how comprehensive it will be at this juncture,

Impact

Policies to Minimize Impact

Domestic Risks
H

M–H: High inflation could weaken trust in economic
management, depressing investment and financial
savings and higher current account deficit. It also hurts
the poor, especially in urban areas, the most. High
inflation expectations could increase the economic
costs of bringing inflation down in a sustainable way,
further damaging growth.

Raising interest rates until inflation is clearly on a
downward trend. Improved agricultural productivity
and investing in infrastructure to improve the supply
response can reduce food price pressures.

M-H

H: Growth will fall further, worsening tax revenues, add
to corporate vulnerabilities and bank NPAs. Failure to
increase the economy’s capacity would exacerbate
inflation and the current account deficit.

Further measures to ease supply bottlenecks, reduce
policy uncertainty, facilitate inward investment, and
improve the business climate and governance.

Countercyclical
fiscal expansion

M

M: The captive investor base for government bonds
lowers financing risks. Crowding out could hurt
investment, and given little spare capacity, inflation and
the current account deficit would rise. Continued slow
fiscal consolidation would depress sentiment and
increase India’s vulnerabilities.

Fiscal consolidation and subsidy reform (protecting
the poor) must be undertaken. Spending
reorientation will make consolidation more growthfriendly. Measures should be taken to raise tax-toGDP ratio to pre-crisis levels.

H: Continued corporate stress could add to bank NPAs,

H

H: As in 2008/09 and in recent months, financial
stresses would be severe, given domestic and external
vulnerabilities and weak balance sheets.

Focus on further capital account liberalization, in
particular FDI. Continued interregulatory
coordination and monitoring of financial conditions
and risks. Rupee flexibility would absorb some of
the shock, and monetary policy should be tightened.

Protracted period

M–H: Deterioration in the European economic outlook
would further cloud the prospects for recovery in India,
both for exports and investment.

Structural reform will raise returns to investment

extended the maturities of U.S. dollar term deposits
offered by BI, and relaxed the rules on FX purchases by exporters to encourage repatriation.

 India initially conducted limited intervention in the spot market, but mostly allowed the rupee to depreciate.
In August, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began providing its FX reserves directly to oil marketing
companies (OMCs) through swap arrangements (at the market exchange rate). In addition, the central bank
offered subsidized FX swaps to banks to attract non-resident Indian foreign currency (FCNR(B)) deposits and
increase banks’ overseas FX borrowing. The oil swaps and the FCNR(B) scheme both closed by endNovember, and the OMCs returned to the FX market. The total volume of swaps with OMCs and banks
amounted to about US$10 billion and US$34 billion (mainly from FCNR(B) deposits), respectively.

 Russia allowed increasing flexibility in the ruble, which depreciated by 6 percent in May/June 2013, the
highest among emerging European countries, prompting some modest interventions by the Central Bank of
the Russian Federation (CBR) utilizing an exchange rate band mechanism to limit short-term fluctuations.

 Turkey intervened significantly through the spot market by about US$18 billion by end-2013 (representing
more than 15 percent of net international reserves).
Monetary policy and liquidity management
Policy rate movements. Facing inflationary pressures exacerbated by a depreciating currency led many EMs to
raise policy rates. Brazil increased the policy rate by 275 basis points (bps) since the start of its tightening cycle
in April 2013, India has had more moderate hikes of 50 bps in its repo rate, while Indonesia has raised its
policy rate by 150 bps since end-May. However, others facing lower inflationary pressures reduced policy rates
to offset the tightening of global financial conditions (Mexico) or to support weak domestic activity (Hungary).
Liquidity measures. Rather than rely on higher policy rates to protect the currency, some countries also raised
short-term market interest rates through a range of other measures. The RBI in India raised the marginal
standing facility (MSF) rate—the upper ceiling of the interest rate corridor—by 200 bps and capped liquidity

provision at the repo rate (subsequently reversing these measures as markets stabilized). Indonesia increased
the overnight deposit facility rate (i.e. the rate at which the central bank provides liquidity) by a total 150 bps.
Turkey lifted the top end of its interest rate corridor by 125 bps, but left the main policy rate untouched. The
Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) also suspended liquidity provision at the policy rate during
designated exceptional days, resulting in an average increase of about 350 basis points in interbank rates by
end-2013. Hungary, on the other hand, did not face as much external pressures and chose to further ease

monetary conditions by launching a scheme in April 2013 (to be operational in June-August 2013) to alleviate
financing constraints of small and medium enterprises. The scheme was then extended to end-2014 with an
increased funding allocation.
Capital flow measures (CFMs)
CFMs have been used to a limited extent. Brazil eased CFMs significantly, reducing the tax rate to zero on
fixed income (foreign portfolio investment) and short FX derivative positions in June 2013. India liberalized
restrictions on external commercial borrowing and FDI. However, the government also tightened restrictions on
some capital outflows from residents (although subsequently partially reversed this measure). Indonesia
relaxed regulations on banks' short-term foreign borrowing and shortened the minimum holding period for
central bank bills to attract foreign investors.
Import restrictions
India hiked the gold import duty and imposed quantity restrictions on gold imports.
Fiscal measures
India introduced expenditure rationalization policies and Indonesia, as planned prior to the tapering talk,
increased subsidized fuel prices, among other measures. Brazil, India, Indonesia and Turkey all reiterated their
commitment to meeting their fiscal targets.
Contingency financing
Several countries made arrangements for contingency financing. India increased its swap line with Japan
to US$50 billion (from US$15 billion). Also, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) launched a US$1 billion
offshore rupee bond program, with a first issuance of around $160 million in November. Indonesia renewed its
swap arrangement with Japan (US$12 billion) in August and further increased its size (to US$22.8 billion) in
December. It also agreed on new swap arrangements with China (Yuan 100 billion) and Korea (US$10 billion).
Mexico renewed its Flexible Credit Lines with the Fund in December 2012.
Summary: Indian policy response
In sum, India responded in a manner similar to that of other EMs affected by UMP tapering, deploying a
broader range of policy measures, but the initial communication of the policy intent and composition of these
measures could have been better explained to market participants. In particular, the repo rate could have been
raised sooner to complement India’s use of liquidity tightening measures. Nonetheless, India’s limited
intervention in foreign exchange markets, and continued rupee flexibility, have served the country well in
responding to global financial market shocks.
The FX swaps made available to OMCs and banks have proved effective at relatively low cost. By
temporarily removing a significant source of FX demand (which is also highly volatile) from the foreign
exchange market, the swaps to OMCs limited volatility and halted self-fulfilling momentum in the exchange rate.
The swaps involved no loss in gross international reserves, and the resulting forward position is limited and fully
disclosed. The FCNR(B) deposit scheme attracted a significant amount of stable inflows (with maturities
between 3-5 years) in just three months, and the subsidy is relatively limited (3–3½ percent below market rate).
If external pressures re-emerge, these FX swaps could be deployed again, but the resulting forward position
should be carefully monitored.

Annex V. India’s External Sector Assessment1
The staff assess that India’s current account deficit is slightly above a range of estimates for its
medium-term norm and the exchange rate is slightly above levels that can be explained by underlying
fundamentals. Compared to its trading partners, India’s demographic structure, low per capita income,
favorable growth prospects and large developmental needs justify running current account deficits.
However, these pro-deficit factors need to be balanced by consideration of both sustainability and
financing vulnerability risks, which tend to limit the size of the desirable deficit. Options to reduce the
savings-investment imbalance include lowering inflation expectations to support private savings in
financial assets rather than gold, slowing the rate of growth of public consumption, structural reforms,
and further developing financial markets.
Current Account and Exchange Rates
1.
The current account deficit widened to a historical high of 4.8 percent of GDP in
2012/13, mainly due to a rising trade deficit (Figure 1). After a period of strong performance,
exports decelerated sharply from late 2011 (in response to a lower global demand as well as binding
supply constraints), while imports have slowed only moderately on account of continued fuel
subsidies, inelastic demand for imported oil, high inflation expectations, and import-encouraging
supply bottlenecks. In particular, gold imports (which are used partly as an inflation hedge) rose
significantly (see Selected Issues Chapter I).
2.
The real effective exchange rate has shown much short-term (within-year) volatility
over the last several years, while the commodity terms of trade has deteriorated moderately.
The NEER depreciated by about 30 percent in the last decade while the REER appreciated by about
10 percent during the same period, reflecting the large inflation differential between India and its
trading partners. The deterioration in commodity terms of trade (including oil, gold, and agricultural
products) could have important implications for the current account and REER, given the structural
increase in energy intensity of India, higher gold imports in recent years, and the inflationary effects
of higher food prices. 2
3.
The observed worsening of the current account balance following the global financial
crisis largely reflects a faster drop in national savings than in investment (Figure 1). Since the
late 1990s there has been a sharp increase in both savings and investment rates (consistent with an
improvement in growth), but the widening current account deficit in the last few years primarily
reflects a faster fall in national savings than investment as high inflation and negative real interest
rates caused a shift away from savings in financial assets toward investment in valuables. Despite
that, average private and public savings and investment are still relatively high in India compared
with other emerging market economies and advanced countries.

Model-based Current Account and Exchange Rate Valuations
4.
This section assesses the magnitude of the current account gap and REER misalignment
in India using External Balance Assessment (EBA) and Consultative Group on the Exchange
Rate (CGER)-type methodologies.


The External Balance Assessment (EBA) comprises three different methods for assessing the
cyclically-adjusted current account and exchange rate compared to medium-term fundamentals
and appropriate policies.3 The current account regression estimates the cyclically-adjusted
current account norm and compares it to a structural current account deficit (CAD) in 2013. The
second method is based on a RER regression, which derives the deviation of the REER from its
estimated equilibrium level, based on a set of fundamentals. The third method is the External
Sustainability approach, which computes the current account balance that stabilizes the net
foreign asset (NFA) position and compares it to the underlying CAD to measure the gap.



The CGER-type methodologies4 use an external sustainability (ES) approach and a macroeconomic
balance (MB) method from Beidas-Strom and Cashin (2011). The ES and MB methodologies
focus on current account misalignments and the required exchange rate adjustments that will
ensure consistency between the underlying current accounts and the associated norms in the
medium-term.

5.
Model-based estimates suggest that India’s current account deficit is above a range of
estimates for its medium-term norm, and the exchange rate is slightly above levels that can be
explained by underlying fundamentals. These estimates are presented in the table below.
The EBA methodologies. Based on data available as of November 2013, the current account
regression estimates India’s cyclically-adjusted current account norm (i.e. the current account
compatible with fundamentals and desired policies) to be -4.0 percent of GDP. The projected
2013 CAD of 3.3 percent of GDP corresponds to a structural CAD of 2.6 percent of GDP, implying
a gap of 1.4 percent of GDP compared to the norm. The cyclically-adjusted CAD is much lower
than the actual CAD as the output gap is small relative to the rest of the world’s output gap and
the terms-of-trade gap is large. These results suggest that the 2013-year-average real effective
exchange rate is undervalued by 8 percent. The RER regression suggests that India’s REER is
overvalued by about 3 percent. According to the ES approach, India’s current account norm is
-1.6 percent of GDP, which is smaller than the staff’s CAD projection for 2018 (the outer year of

the medium-term horizon when output gaps are generally assumed to be closed), resulting in a
gap of -1.1 percent of GDP and a real exchange rate overvaluation of about 6 percent.


The CGER-type methodologies. The macrobalance approach by Beidas-Strom and Cashin
(2011) suggests a current account norm of -2.6 percent of GDP (using the fiscal balance
consistent with the desired fiscal position), about 0.2 percentage points lower than the
underlying current account in the medium-term (-2.8 percent of GDP). Based on an elasticity of
the CAD to the real effective exchange rate of -0.17 (as referenced by Vitek (2009)), this would
imply an exchange rate misalignment of about 1 percent. The external sustainability approach
estimates a current account norm for India which stabilizes the NFA/GDP of the country around
its norm (estimated from a panel data model). Comparing this current account norm (-1.9
percent of GDP) with its underlying value (-2.8 percent of GDP), while using above elasticity,
implies a REER overvaluation of about 5.4 percent.

1/ For exchange rate gap, positive value indicates overvaluation. The estimated gaps are adjusted to impose a

2/ The gap under the CA regression of EBA is relative to its cyclically adjusted value.
3/ The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach is based on Beidas-Strom and Cashin (2011). It calculates the difference
between the medium term CA balance (year 2018) and an estimated equilibrium CA "norm". The latter is a function of
various fundamentals (fiscal balance, old-age dependency ratio, NFA, oil balance, real GDP per capita, real GDP growth,
aid, and remittances). The ES approach is based on Vitek (2009) and calculates the difference between the actual CA
balance in 2018 and the NFA-stabilizing CA balance. The real exchange rate adjustment is calculated to bring the
current account balance in line with its NFA-stabilizing level.

6.
Model-based estimates suggest norms for the medium-term current account deficit
ranging between 1½ and 4 percent of GDP (see table). However, in staff’s judgment, the EBAestimated CAD norm of 4 percent of GDP is larger than can be sustainably financed given the
implications for gross financing needs. Such a large CAD would imply a steady weakening of the NFA
position, calling into question whether global financial markets would be willing to sustainably
finance such a large deficit. Given the potential risks associated with global financial market volatility
(as evidenced by events post 22 May, 2013), staff judges that a CA norm closer to the EBA-based ES
approach or the CGER-like methodologies would be more appropriate, implying a modest

overvaluation of the real exchange rate.5 This result is also comparable to the Reserve Bank of India’s
finding that India’s sustainably-financed current account deficit is around 2.5 percent of GDP.6
Capital Account Flows, International Reserves and International Investment Position
7.
India’s financial account has been dominated by portfolio equity and FDI flows (Figure
2). However, the composition of the current account deficit financing has shifted toward more debt
flows and away from FDI recently. In 2012, FDI inflows only financed a quarter of the current account
deficit, while they generally exceeded the CAD before 2007/08. Debt flows, particularly in the form of
non-resident Indian (NRI) deposits and trade credits, have increased. Similarly, external commercial
borrowings (by Indian corporates) have increased significantly since 2008. Net portfolio flows have
been very volatile in the past and more recently in response to global financial market volatility.
8.
India’s net foreign asset (NFA) position and its composition have deteriorated. While
both assets and liabilities have risen steadily over the last decade, external debt has increased sharply
in the last three years (and is concentrated among the corporate sector). However, external debt at
23.8 percent of GDP at end-September 2013 remains moderate compared to other emerging market
economies.
9.
Central bank intervention has focused on seeking to reduce the pace and volatility of
exchange rate changes (Figure 1). The authorities are committed to a market-determined exchange
rate and have recently undertaken FX intervention through FX swap facilities for oil importers and
NRI deposits. However, with the widening of the CAD and exchange rate interventions, international
reserve coverage has fallen since mid-2011 (Figure 2). International reserves have stabilized at
around US$296 billion, a level which is more than adequate as measured by various metrics,
including the IMF’s composite reserve adequacy measure. Specifically, international reserves in India
stand at around 5¾ months of imports, and 145 percent of the IMF’s composite metric. As such,
India is well placed to withstand external shocks.

The May 2013 External Sector Report concluded that India’s current account and the value of rupee were broadly in
line with fundamentals.

Annex VI. India: Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis1
India’s public debt remains sustainable given manageable interest rate costs and expected recovery in
the economy’s growth rate. 2 Under the baseline, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to decline
gradually to about 64 percent of GDP in the medium term from the current level of 68 percent, with
gross financing needs also reducing slightly to about 12 percent of GDP in 2018/19. While the baseline
scenario already uses conservative real GDP assumptions, further negative growth shocks represent one
of the major risks to the debt outlook. In addition to this, realization of contingent liabilities coming
from future bank recapitalization needs and liabilities of the electricity distribution companies may also
push the debt trajectory up above the 70% benchmark, before the debt-to-GDP ratio declines gradually
in the medium term. On the other hand, the captive domestic investor base is likely to mitigate the
impact of any real interest rate shocks.
1.

India’s public debt sustainability analysis is based on the following assumptions:



Macroeconomic assumptions. Growth is forecast at 4.6 percent (at factor cost) in 2013/14,3
and should slowly return to trend in the medium term (at around 6¾ percent). The WPI is
expected to fall from 7½ percent in 2012/13 to around 5¼ percent in the medium term.
Similarly, the CPI is projected to decline from 10½ percent in 2012/13 to around 6½ percent
in 2018/19. This baseline scenario assumes continued implementation of structural reforms
that do not require legislative approval, and a relatively benign global economic recovery
scenario as outlined in the WEO.



Fiscal Assumptions. The 2013/14 central government budget deficit is expected to reach the
authorities’ deficit target of 4.8 percent of GDP, which corresponds to 5.3 percent under the
Fund’s definition. Over the medium term, this is expected to decline slowly toward
5.1 percent of GDP, while state government deficits should decline to 2 percent of GDP.

1

o

Tax performance, especially for income taxes, is expected to increase slightly as ongoing
administrative measures continue to be implemented and base broadening is expected
to continue. Goods and Services Tax is not assumed in this baseline as it requires
legislative changes, including a constitutional amendment.

o

At the same time, some savings are likely to be found from petroleum subsidies, as the
diesel under-recoveries are eliminated, and the planned gradual introduction of cash

Prepared by Ran Bi (SPR), Mehdi Raissi, and Rahul Anand.

The analysis of public debt sustainability is based on the framework developed for market access countries. See Staff
Guidance Note for Public Debt Sustainability Analysis in Market Access Countries, IMF, May 2013.
3

The real GDP growth rates presented in the public and external DSA tables are based on market prices, as required
by WEO. However, to be consistent with the authorities’ measure of real GDP, the text here and other macro tables
present real GDP growth at factor cost.

transfers should help rationalize spending over the medium term. However, the recently
enacted Food Security Act will keep the subsidy bill high.
o

Public banks are expected to be recapitalized to reach Basel III targets and some of the
debts of electricity distribution companies are to be assumed by the government, in line
with recent announcements.

2.
Under the baseline projection, India’s debt ratio and gross financing needs will enter a
declining path from 2014/15. India’s primary deficit is projected to decline below its debtstabilizing threshold (estimated at 3.2 percent of GDP based on the 2018/19 projections) in 2013/14
and continue to improve gradually over the medium term. Therefore, gross financing needs are
expected to remain at 12¼–13 percent of GDP in 2013/14-2014/15 before gradually declining to
11¾ percent in 2018/19. Automatic debt dynamics arising from the interest rate-growth differential
will on average reduce the debt ratio by some 2¾ percentage points per year from 2013/14 to
2018/19. As a result, public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to fall from 67¼ percent in 2013/14 to
64 percent in 2018/19. This is a more modest debt reduction than envisaged in the last staff report,
which projected a debt-to-GDP ratio of around 60 percent by 2017/18. The slower pace of debt
reduction is due to the weaker growth outlook (especially in the near term) and implementation of
the Food Security Act.
3.
India faces relatively low risks to debt sustainability under the baseline, but it could be
vulnerable to a slower real GDP growth and a contingent liability shock. The heat map suggests
that the debt burden benchmark and the gross financing needs threshold are exceeded under one or
both of these two shocks. A one-standard deviation shock to GDP growth pushes the debt-to-GDP
ratio to 72 percent in 2015/16, while under the financial sector contingent liability shock (which could
arise from losses at public banks),4 the debt-to-GDP ratio peaks at 76 percent in 2015/16. Both
shocks, however, do not change the downward debt trajectory in the medium term. The lack of fiscal
adjustment is another principal risk to debt sustainability in India’s context. An unchanged primary
balance would raise the debt ratio to 68 percent in 2015/16 before trending downward. Finally, the
combined macro-fiscal shock also has a large level effect but does not change the direction of the
debt trajectory. The debt profile, on the other hand, is at risk to market perception shocks and
external financing requirements. In fact, a real interest rate shock would slow down debt reduction
considerably. However, these two shocks are not very relevant for India given that most of the debt is
financed through a captive domestic investor base, the very small external debt is mostly from
official creditors, and more than adequate international reserves are available in the rare case that
external financing needs arise. The upside risks include better tax buoyancy, a GST and a new Direct
Tax Code that improve efficiency and lead to near-term revenue gains. A strong revival of the
economy could also return India to the debt dynamics prevailing before the global financial crisis.

Due to the lack of data on the actual public bank recapitalization needs, the default shock of 10 percent of total
banking sector assets is used.

There is no evidence of a systematic projection bias in the baseline assumptions and
the projected fiscal adjustment is in line with other countries’ experiences. India’s forecast track
record is comparable to that of all other surveillance countries. The median forecast error for the
primary balance and inflation during 2004–12 is at around 1 percent of GDP and in line with other
countries. Forecast error for real GDP growth, however, is somewhat larger than in other countries
given India’s economic growth volatility. India’s projected fiscal adjustment (an improvement of
around ½ percentage points in cyclically-adjusted primary balance/GDP over the medium term) is
very modest and should be achievable. This magnitude of adjustment is also in line with other
countries’ experiences, with a 3-year adjustment in cyclically-adjusted primary balance at
38 percentile among all surveillance countries. Finally, the boom-bust analysis is triggered because
India had a positive output gap in 2010–12 before a negative gap opened in 2013. The baseline
projection captures the boom-bust cycle but also reflects India’s higher real growth rate, even in the
downturns, than other highly-indebted market access countries.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
As per the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), the
exchange rate in India is classified as floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined in the
interbank market, where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes at times. The RBI’s role is to
modulate excessive volatility so as to maintain orderly conditions. On August 20, 1994, India
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement. India
maintains the following restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions, which are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a):
restrictions related to the nontransferability of balances under the India-Russia debt agreement;
restrictions arising from unsettled balances under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with
two Eastern European countries; and a restriction on the transfer of amortization payments on loans
by non-resident relatives. The Executive Board has not approved these restrictions.
Article IV Consultation:
The previous Article IV consultation discussions were held in November 2012. The staff report (IMF
Country Report No. 13/37) was discussed by the Executive Board on January 25, 2013.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
FSSA/FSAP report was issued in January 2001; a fiscal transparency ROSC was issued in
February 2001 (http://www.imf.org/external/np/rosc/ind/fiscal.htm); the data model of the ROSC
(Country Report No. 04/96) was issued in April 2004. The missions for the FSAP Update took place in
2011, and concluding meetings were held in Delhi and Mumbai in January 2012—the FSSA Update
report was published in January 2013 (Country Report No. 13/8). Detailed assessment reports on
FSAP-related papers were issued in August 2013 and published as Country Reports No. 13/265–268.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
In Bank FY13 (July 1, 2012–June 30, 2013), IBRD/IDA lending in India totaled US$1.3 billion. IFC
committed US$1.4 billion in FY13. The new World Bank Group’s (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) for India for 2013-2017 focuses on helping India to accelerate poverty reduction and boost
shared prosperity. The CPS is guided by the Government of India’s “Innovation Impulse with
Investment” approach, which lays out the Government’s vision of how best to use the financing and
expertise from multilateral institutions to address India’s development challenges and places
significant importance on the value-added of the World Bank’s program that goes well beyond
financing. It wants to partner with the WBG on projects that have a systemic and transformational
impact, those that help innovate and pilot new approaches, and those that help leverage resources.
The strategy is closely aligned the Government’s 12th Five-Year Plan, and its goal of “faster,
sustainable, and more inclusive growth.”
Under the new CPS, the WBG will contribute to India’s development by deepening and
strengthening WBG engagement in three priority areas: integration, rural-urban transformation and
inclusion. A common theme across these areas will be an emphasis on improved governance,
environmental sustainability, and gender equality. “Integration” will include addressing
infrastructure gaps as one of the key measures needed to help low-income states converge more
quickly with their faster-growing neighbors. With 600 million people expected to live in India’s cities
by 2031, “transformation” will require intensified engagement over the strategy period and beyond
on improving the management and livability of medium-sized cities. The rural-urban transformation
presents tremendous opportunities, both for agriculture and poverty reduction, and
competitiveness. Supporting urbanization is a key structural shift in the CPS. “Inclusion” will entail a
stronger focus on human development with improvements in healthcare systems and nutrition, on
the quality of education at all levels, as well as on better access to finance and social protection for
the underprivileged.
A second significant shift in WBG support is towards 14 low-income and special category states1,
where many of India’s poor and disadvantaged live. Over the next five years, the Bank will work with
the Government to rebalance the lending portfolio, so that 30 percent of all IBRD/IDA lending will
be directed to these states, which together account for 400 million (one-third of India’s poor people
living on less than $1.25 per day). Many of these states also have human development indicators—
high infant mortality, high child malnutrition, low female literacy—on par with the poorest countries
in the world. IFC has also intensified its program in low-income states; annual commitments have
more than quadrupled in the last five years from $60 million in FY09 to $273 million in FY13.

1

Low-income and special category states include: Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha,
Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and eight northeast states (Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram,
Sikkim, and Uttarakhand). IFC also includes West Bengal, but excludes Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDIA

Engagement in more advanced states and at the central level will focus on activities that are
transformative and innovative. Projects are expected to test second-generation approaches, which
overtime could be scaled up and replicated in low-income states.
To make a meaningful contribution to India’s many development challenges and to meet the
Millennium Development Goals, the volume of WBG support—from IBRD, IDA, and IFC— should
reach $5 billion annually over the next five years. A robust knowledge portfolio will complement
and underpin financing and includes (i) focus on in-depth analytical work on key cross-sectoral
questions; (ii) inform design and implementation of future interventions by drawing on impact
evaluations; (iii) respond quickly and flexibly with demand-driven technical assistance and just-intime knowledge support to help reform and implementation; (iv) broker South-South and acrossstate knowledge exchanges; (v) develop flexible programmatic approaches to develop analytic and
advisory activities; and (vi) scale-up training capacity. Aligned with its regional strategy, IFC’s
Advisory Services program in India is aligned with the regional strategy on inclusion facilitating
access to services for base of pyramid populations, and expanding the private sector’s footprint in
low-income states), climate change, and global integration.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) operations in India began in 1986. Cumulative public sector
loan commitments totaled $28.4 billion as of 31 October 2013 for 175 loans. With an additional $2.2
billion in private sector loans (the latter without government guarantee), total loan commitments on
a cumulative basis amount to $30.6 billion. These funds have been provided from AsDB’s ordinary
capital resources (OCR). Also, AsDB has approved equity investments amounting to $0.3 billion.
AsDB’s lending and equity activities are summarized below.

CPS is anchored to AsDB’s Strategy 2020 and has been designed to support the Government of
India’s 12th Five Year Plan (2012–2017) vision of faster, more inclusive, and sustainable growth. The
CPS emphasizes robust infrastructure development, job creation and access to jobs, regional
connectivity, and environmental sustainability. The backbone of the India program will be energy,
transport, and urban services. On a selective basis, ADB will also invest in special purpose vehicles
for infrastructure financing, water resources management, skills development, and state-level fiscal
reforms.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance, but weaknesses remain in the
timeliness and coverage of certain statistical series. India has an intricate system for compiling
economic and financial statistics and produces a vast quantity of data covering most sectors of the
economy, but these do not always follow international standards. India subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standards (SDDS) on December 27, 1996 and started posting its metadata on the
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on October 30, 1997. It is currently in observance of the
SDDS, although it uses flexibility options for timeliness of data on general government operations and
on the periodicity and timeliness of labor market data.
2.
The data module of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC, IMF Country
Report No. 04/96) was published in April 2004. It assesses India’s data dissemination practices against
the SDDS requirements and assesses the quality of six datasets based on the Data Quality Assessment
Framework (DQAF) developed by STA.
3.
National accounts and employment statistics: The Central Statistical Organization (CSO)
releases a new series of national accounts, with base year 2004–2005 with a dissemination lag for
quarterly releases of two months. Large revisions to historical series and major discrepancies between
supply and expenditure national accounts complicate analysis: these differences have become larger
in recent quarters. Supply-side data remain of better quality than expenditure-side data. Estimates of
value added in constant prices for public administration and defense may be biased upwards, as they
are based on the government’s wage bill (with arrears counted in the year that they are paid) deflated
by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI). There are long standing deficiencies in employment data: they are
only available on an annual basis and with a substantial lag, and they only cover the formal sector,
which accounts for a small segment of the labor market.
4.
Price statistics: Since January 2006, the Labour Bureau has published a CPI for industrial
workers with a 2001 base year. A revised all-India CPI with new weights was unveiled in early 2011.
Presently, there are four CPIs, each based on the consumption basket of a narrow category of
consumers (namely industrial workers, urban and non-manual employees, agricultural laborers, and
rural laborers). The CPIs are published with a lag of about one month. With the exception of the
industrial workers CPI, the other indices are based on weights that are over ten years. The WPI was
also recently revised and has a 2004/05 base year. Data are also subject to frequent and large
revision, usually upward. New RBI price series on residential real estate have helped surveillance in this
area, though geographic coverage remains limited, and price data for commercial real estate are not
available. The RBI has started producing a series covering rural wage data, which helps surveillance,
but economy-wide wage data are scant.
5.
External sector statistics: While the concepts and definitions used to compile balance of
payments statistics are broadly in line with the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

INDIA

(BPM6), trade data have quality, valuation, timing, and coverage problems, and data on trade prices,
volumes, and composition are not regularly available on a timely basis. Only trade credit extended for
more than 180 days is included in the balance of payments (and the IIP); trade credit is often less than
180 days in most countries. Bilateral data on services exports to the United States and other
developed countries are manifold higher than counterpart services imports published by these same
countries. External debt statistics are available on a quarterly basis with a one quarter lag. Estimates of
short-term external debt are presented in the debt statistics on an original maturity basis. The shortterm maturity attribution on a residual maturity basis is only available annually (and excludes residual
maturity of medium- and long-term nonresident Indian accounts). The international investment
position (IIP) statistics cover the sectors prescribed in the BPM6 and these data are disseminated
within six months of the reference period in respect of annual data1. Coverage of direct investment
positions data is hampered by the absence of appropriate legal or institutional authority. India began
disseminating the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity as
prescribed under the SDDS in December 2001. The more up-to-date information on certain variables,
such as total foreign reserves, foreign currency assets, gold, and SDRs, are available on a weekly basis
and are disseminated as part of a weekly statistical supplement on the RBI web site.
6.
Monetary and financial statistics: The RBI web site and the RBI Bulletin publish a wide array
of monetary and financial statistics, including reserve money and its components, RBI’s survey,
monetary survey, liquidity aggregates (outstanding amounts), interest rates, exchange rates, foreign
reserves, and results of government securities auctions. In 2011, the RBI started publishing a weighted
average lending interest rate and other lending rates at annual frequency. The frequency and quality
of data dissemination have improved substantially in recent years.
7.
Concepts and definitions used by the RBI to compile monetary statistics are in broad
conformity with the guidelines provided in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Nevertheless, the following concepts and principles deviate from the MFSM. First, the resident sector
data do not provide sufficient information on the sectoral distribution of domestic credit. Specifically,
under their present sectorization scheme, the authorities subdivide the resident nonbank sector data
by (i) central government; (ii) state government; and (iii) the commercial sector (including other
financial corporations, public and other nonfinancial corporations, and other resident sectors).
Second, commercial banks add accrued interest to credit and deposit positions on a quarterly basis
only (instead of the prescribed monthly basis).
8.
The RBI reports monetary data for IFS on a regular basis. Since October 2006, the RBI has
initiated the electronic reporting of monetary data, which is a major improvement from the previous
paper-based reporting which was prone to errors and delays. India has also submitted to STA test
data (starting from December 2001 data) on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) that have been

resulting in substantial differences.

developed to implement the methodology outlined in the MFSM. STA is working with the authorities
in resolving the outstanding data issues on the development of the SRFs.
Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) is responsible for compiling
and disseminating the GFS. India reports the budgetary central government cash flow statement
within one month after the reference month and stock of liabilities within one quarter after the
reference quarter. With the agreement of the authorities, STA uses these data to compile a monthly
cash flow statement for publication in the International Financial Statistics, following the GFSM 2001
presentation, with some missing breakdowns, particularly for expenditure. Data on fiscal performance
at the state level are available only at annual frequency and with a considerable lag. Data on the
functional and economic classification of expenditures are available with considerable lag. There is
also scope to improve the analytical usefulness of the presentation of the fiscal accounts. For example,
classification of government expenditure between developmental/nondevelopmental and
plan/nonplan obscures the economic nature and impact of fiscal actions. The MoF reports central
government data (on a cash basis) for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(GFSY), the latest reported data corresponding to 2010. Two years after the reference year, the
Ministry of Finance reports general government data to STA in the GFSM 1986 format, that staff
reworks to the GFSM 2001 presentation for inclusion in the GFSY (latest reported data correspond to
2008). Data on the general government operations are not internationally comparable as they exclude
data on the operations of the extra-budgetary funds, local governments, and social security funds.
Under the SDDS, India disseminates annual general government data within 3 quarters after the
reference year, using the timeliness flexibility option but meets the SDDS specifications for central
government debt and operations.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on India
January 27, 2014
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report was
circulated to the Executive Board. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Economic and financial developments
1.
Recent activity data point to continued weakness in economic activity. Industrial
production (IP) shrank by 2.1 percent y/y in November, following a 1.6 percent decline in
October, as consumer durables contracted by double-digits. Capital goods production and
mining remain weak. Both manufacturing and services PMIs declined in December, with
services PMI remaining in a contractionary zone for six consecutive months.
2.
Headline CPI inflation has moderated, but core CPI inflation remained flat. In
December, headline CPI inflation declined to 9.9 percent y/y due largely to easing vegetable
prices, while core CPI inflation remained flat at about 8 percent y/y. WPI inflation also
declined to 6.2 percent y/y due to a moderation in food prices, even as core WPI inflation
ticked up to 2.8 percent y/y. Market participants appear evenly split between those expecting
higher rates, and those expecting unchanged rates, at the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI)
January 28 monetary policy review.
3.
The trade deficit widened in December, but robust capital inflows have allowed
a build up in international reserves. The trade deficit widened to US$10.1 billion from
US$ 9.2 billion in November. Imports continued to contract (15.2 percent decline y/y in
December) reflecting weak domestic demand, while export growth slowed to 3.5 percent y/y
from 5.9 percent y/y in November. International reserves now stand at US$ 293 billion, about
US$ 3 billion higher than the stock of reserves held on May 22, 2013. This rise in reserves
can largely be attributed to flows obtained through the RBI’s foreign exchange swap window
(non-resident Indian foreign currency deposits and banks’ foreign currency borrowings) and
equity inflows. Furthermore, net portfolio investment inflows (both equity and debt) have
been about US$ 7 billion since early-December.
4.
The Patel Committee (PC) in its report submitted to the Governor of the RBI on
January 21, 2014, has called for a complete overhaul of the monetary policy framework
in India. It has recommended that inflation, as measured by all-India headline CPI inflation,
should be the nominal anchor for the monetary policy framework. The focus on headline
CPI, despite a large weight on food and fuel inflation in CPI, is considered a critical
prerequisite for reducing and anchoring inflation expectations. Subject to the establishment
and achievement of the nominal anchor, monetary policy should be consistent with a
sustainable economic growth and financial stability. The PC’s recommended target for
inflation is 4 percent with a +/- 2 percent band around it, with the target to be formally

2
adopted after inflation is brought down to 8 percent over a period not exceeding the next 12
months and to 6 percent over a period not exceeding the next 24 months.
5.
To enhance monetary policy transmission, the PC report recommends a phased
refinement of the current operating framework of monetary policy, liquidity
management and its instruments in particular. The overnight repo rate should continue to
be a single policy rate, and the weighted average call rate the operating target. However,
RBI’s liquidity operations should be geared toward greater use of auctioned term repos
(tenors up to three months) and as they gain acceptance among market participants for
liquidity management, the 14-day term repo rate should serve as the operating target. In
addition, the PC has recommended reducing the Statutory Liquidity Ratio, consistent with the
path of fiscal consolidation, to a level fitting the requirements of the liquidity coverage ratio
prescribed under the Basel III framework. The PC report proposes establishing a monetary
policy committee (MPC), to enhance formulation, transparency, and accountability of
monetary policy. The MPC would be chaired by the RBI Governor and comprise both
internal and external members. The report also identifies the need to reduce the fiscal deficit
to 3 percent of GDP by 2016/17, and calls for a commitment from the Government to
eliminate administered setting of prices, wages, and interest rates as key institutional
requirements for effective monetary policy transmission.
6.
The RBI has mandated banks to make additional provisions for unhedged
foreign currency exposures from April 2014. The RBI will require banks to make
additional provisions if the estimated loss from unhedged exposure exceeds 15 percent of the
company's earnings before tax, interest and depreciation (EBITDA), progressively raising the
provision as estimated losses increase.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 20, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with India
On January 27, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with India.
India’s growth has slowed markedly, reflecting global developments and domestic supply
constraints, while inflation remains stubbornly high. Led by falling infrastructure and
corporate investment, the slowdown has generalized to other sectors of the economy. The
financial positions of banks and corporates have deteriorated. The combination of
persistently-high inflation, sizeable current account and fiscal deficits intensified the global
liquidity tightening-induced balance of payment pressures experienced during the summer,
which resulted in significant portfolio debt outflows, and pressures on currency, equity and
bond markets. Along with improving external conditions, positive policy steps taken by the
authorities have improved market sentiment. The current account deficit, after reaching a
record high in FY2012/13 (fiscal year ending March), is narrowing fast, and capital inflows
have picked up. While recent policy initiatives have reduced vulnerabilities, the policy space
remains strictly circumscribed because of high deficits and debt, and elevated inflation.
Growth is projected at 4.6 percent for fiscal year 2013/14, and should pick up to 5.4 percent
in 2014/15 (at factor cost). Stronger global growth, improving export competitiveness, a
favorable monsoon, and a confidence boost from recent policy actions should deliver a
modest growth rebound. However, fiscal restraint and a tighter monetary stance will act as
headwinds, slowing the recovery. CPI inflation is expected to remain near double-digits well
into next year, driven by high food inflation that feeds quickly into wages and core inflation;
entrenched inflation expectations; the pass through from a weaker rupee; and ongoing energy
price increases. WPI inflation is forecast to remain above the Reserve Bank of India’s
comfort zone, given that supply constraints will ease only gradually. The current account
deficit should narrow in fiscal year 2013/14 to about 3.3 percent of GDP, supported by
rebounding exports, higher remittances, rapidly-shrinking gold imports, weakening domestic
demand, and broadly stable oil prices.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
The principal risk facing India is the inward spillover from global financial market volatility.
Protracted economic and financial volatility (triggered by advanced economies’ exit from
unconventional monetary policies), a lengthy Euro area growth slowdown, and higher oil
prices are the main external risks. Slow progress on structural reforms, high inflation, failure
to ease supply constraints, and resorting to expansionary fiscal policy are key domestic
downside risks. On the upside, going beyond announced reforms or faster-than-envisaged
legislative progress would lead to higher growth and reduce economic vulnerabilities.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the Indian authorities for their ability to maintain
macroeconomic and financial stability amid a challenging macroeconomic landscape.
Directors welcomed ongoing efforts, including recent policy initiatives, to reduce external
vulnerabilities, rebuild buffers, and revive investment. They noted, however, that growth has
slowed markedly and inflation remains persistently high, while spillovers from global
financial market volatility continue to pose a significant risk. Against this backdrop,
Directors underscored the need to rein in inflation, prudently consolidate the fiscal position,
and accelerate structural reforms to address supply bottlenecks and promote sustainable and
inclusive growth.
Directors supported the central bank’s policies of rupee flexibility and limited foreign
exchange intervention. They welcomed the gradual, cautious move toward further external
liberalization. Directors considered that these measures are important tools to deal with
capital account pressures, which, if they were to re-emerge, should be complemented by
judicious use of reserves, tightening of monetary conditions, and additional fiscal adjustment.
Directors encouraged continued efforts to improve the financing of the current account
deficit. Measures to facilitate foreign direct investment inflows and deepen domestic capital
markets should continue to help reduce external vulnerabilities.
Given entrenched double-digit inflation expectations, Directors recommended that the
authorities maintain the monetary policy stance appropriately tight, and stand ready to raise
the policy rate further so as to bring down inflation to more sustainable levels. They
welcomed recent initiatives to strengthen the monetary policy framework with a clear
communication strategy, aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Directors commended the government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation and supported
its medium-term targets. To this end, they emphasized the need for a comprehensive package
of measures, comprising both tax and subsidy reforms, to ensure the quality and
sustainability of consolidation. Rationalizing fuel and fertilizer subsidies and introducing the

goods and services tax are essential to create fiscal space, while safeguarding priority capital
spending and targeted social programs, particularly health and education.
Directors stressed that reviving growth and raising the long-term growth potential require
broader structural reforms to improve infrastructure, the business climate, and the pricing and
allocation of natural resources. They also saw as key priorities reforms aimed at boosting
agricultural productivity and supporting formal job creation, by relaxing labor laws and
addressing skills mismatches.
Directors recognized that India’s financial system is well capitalized and supervised, and
welcomed progress in implementing the recommendations of the FSAP Update. They
welcomed in particular recent measures to enhance supervision and increase bank
provisioning. Directors noted nevertheless that deteriorating corporate financial positions and
weakening bank balance sheets, especially among public banks, warrant close monitoring.
They encouraged the authorities to further strengthen prudential regulation of banks’ asset
quality classification and concentration risks, and pay due regard to the inter-linkages
between corporate vulnerabilities and banking system health. Steps are also needed to
modernize the legal and insolvency framework.

Statement by Rakesh Mohan, Executive Director for India
and Janak Raj, Senior Advisor
January 27, 2014
1.
On behalf of our authorities, we would like to thank staff for a thoughtful,
comprehensive and balanced assessment of recent macroeconomic and financial sector
developments in India and the evolving outlook. The report reflects the constructive and
candid discussions that the Mission had with our authorities. Our authorities broadly share
the staff’s assessment.
2.
India was impacted by the turmoil in the global financial markets on the back of
tapering concerns in mid-2013. With a swift and decisive policy response, India was able to
minimize the fallout on the real economy and maintain financial stability. The authorities
acted to contain the current account deficit significantly, which is expected to be financed
comfortably through sustainable capital flows. The fiscal deficit has also been reduced and
our authorities are committed to pursuing the path of fiscal consolidation. The country
continues to face a challenging domestic macroeconomic situation as growth has slowed
down while inflation remains elevated. However, supply side pressures are easing due to the
good monsoon during 2013-14.
3.
Our authorities are determined to tame inflation, revive the growth impulses in the
short run and put the economy back on a high growth trajectory over the medium term.
Recent Macroeconomic Developments
GDP Growth and Short-term Outlook
4.
GDP growth picked up, though modestly, to 4.8 per cent in Q2 (July-September) of
the fiscal year 2013-14 (the Indian fiscal year is from April to March). Growth in the first
half of the fiscal year has been placed at 4.6 per cent. This is indeed disappointing when seen
against India’s growth record averaging around 8 per cent in the previous 10 years. However,
indications are that the growth has bottomed out and our authorities expect it to be better in
the second half on account of rebound in agriculture and improved export performance. The
early and good monsoon will have a positive impact on rural demand, besides boosting hydro
electricity generation. A fuller recovery is likely to start taking shape towards the end of the
fiscal year when the recent measures initiated to clear the logjam constraining economic
activity and investment work through the various inter-sectoral linkages in the economy.
India’s exports during 2013-14 are expected to grow in double digits, benefiting from the
improved global growth prospects. The market sentiment has also improved, which is
reflected in a sharp rise in stock markets. The Reserve Bank of India has projected GDP
growth at 5 per cent for 2013-14.
5.
The near term outlook beyond the current year is expected to improve on account of
several factors. Many of the constraints to growth such as bottlenecks in project
implementation, shortage of coal and iron ore, and delay in environmental and regulatory
clearances are being actively addressed. The Cabinet Committee on Investment (CCI) has

2
cleared projects amounting to about 5 per cent of GDP. Most of the liquidity tightening
measures taken during July-August 2013 in the wake of financial markets turbulence, which
possibly had some impact on growth, have by and large been rolled back. All these
developments should have a positive impact on the near term outlook.
6.
One data issue has had an impact on ongoing growth estimation. Contemporaneous
estimates of industrial production are dependent on the Index of Industrial Production (IIP).
The preliminary data from this index have, in recent years, been found to underestimate
industrial growth as exhibited by the more comprehensive Annual Survey of Industries
(ASI), and hence, overall GDP growth. Whereas the IIP is compiled contemporaneously on a
monthly basis, the ASI is an annual survey whose results become available with a lag. For
instance, the results from the comprehensive ASI, which have now become available for
2011-12, suggest that industrial production increased by over 10 per cent as compared with
the preliminary data indicating a growth of 3 per cent. Likewise, industrial production based
on ASI during 2010-11 and 2009-10 increased by around 13 per cent and 10 per cent
respectively as compared with the IIP estimates of 8 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.
Consequently, the GDP estimates for 2009-10 and 2010-2011 were revised - from 7.2 per
cent to 8.6 per cent for 2009-10 and from 8.6 per cent to 9.3 per cent for 2010-11. Our
authorities, therefore, believe that final GDP growth estimate for 2011-12 and following
years will also be higher than the current estimates.
7.
The World Bank in its recently released Global Economic Prospects (GEP) projects
India’s GDP growth for 2014-15 at 6.2 per cent vis-a-vis 5.4 per cent by the IMF in its
January 2014 WEO Update as also in the 2014 Article IV Report. The IMF’s WEO and
World Bank’s GEP estimates for almost all large countries are similar, except for India. Also,
as per the projections of GEP, India will see the strongest recovery among major developing
economies between 2013-16.

8.
Elevated and persistent inflation remains a cause of serious concern. While wholesale
price inflation has exhibited some moderation, retail inflation, which is dominated by food
items, has continued to remain high. To contain inflation and anchor inflation expectations,
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised the policy repo rate by 50 basis points during AugustOctober 2013 even when growth had slowed down. However, the RBI decided to pause in
December 2013 to avoid over-tightening given a weak state of the economy and the
significant output gap. It is comforting that most recent data suggest moderation in both
wholesale and retail inflation. As supply pressures ease, and supply management improves,
food inflation is expected to moderate further.
9.
With the availability of the new all India consumer price index (CPI), the Reserve
Bank is now endeavoring to move the dialogue in favor of CPI as a part of its communication
strategy. The Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary Policy Framework
set up by the RBI, submitted its report recently. It has made many recommendations. These,
among others, include the proposal that inflation should be the nominal anchor for RBI’s

3
monetary policy framework. Consequently, it suggests that RBI should adopt the new CPI
(combined) as the measure of the nominal anchor for policy communications.
Fiscal Policy
10.
As the elevated fiscal deficit posed a major challenge to the economy, our authorities
have committed to reduce it in a calibrated manner and have taken some politically tough
decisions. The government has persevered with regular monthly increases in diesel prices to
reduce the diesel subsidies in a phased manner. The fiscal performance in 2012-13 was better
as the actual gross fiscal deficit declined to 4.9 per cent of GDP in 2012-13 as against the
budgeted level of 5.1 per cent. For 2013-14, our authorities have budgeted the gross fiscal
deficit at 4.8 per cent of GDP. Our authorities remain committed to contain the gross fiscal
deficit to the budgeted level.
11.
The Unique Identification Number (UID) or Aadhar is expected to avoid leakages
and hence savings on subsidies. So far, over 400 million Indians have been issued Aadhar
numbers. Over 23 million bank accounts have been linked to Aadhar numbers.
12.
The fiscal implications of the Food Security Act entail an incremental budgetary
allocation of Rs 100 billion in budget estimates (BE) for 2013-14, which is the first year of
its implementation. The legislation came into effect during the current year, hence only a
partial roll out could be put in effect. The food subsidy costs calculations in the Report
assume full implementation in the entire country in the current year. For this to happen the
State Governments need to adopt it and they also have to prepare the implementation
mechanism. The Central Government would be providing adequate funds in a caliberated
manner depending upon field level requirements. Presently, it is estimated that the FY 201415 requirement would be limited to Rs 1,200 billion, as compared with the full estimated
food subsidy of Rs 900 billion in 2013-14.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
13.
India’s forex market came under pressure during May-August 2013 on account of
capital outflows following the talk of tapering of quantitative easing. The forex market has
since stabilized. As a result, most of the measures taken to stabilize the forex market have
been rolled back. Responding to the various policy measures taken by the authorities to
contain gold imports and improved export performance, the current account deficit narrowed
down sharply to 1.2 per cent of GDP in Q2 of 2013-14 from 4.9 per cent of GDP in Q1 of
2013-14 and 5.0 per cent of GDP in Q2 of 2012-13. Our authorities believe that the CAD in
2013-14 will be less than the staff estimate of US $ 61 billion (3.3 per cent of GDP) for
2013-14. The recent narrowing of the trade deficit should bring the CAD to a more
sustainable level, i.e., less than US $ 50 billion (less than 3 per cent of GDP) for the year as a
whole.
14.
In addition to containing the current account deficit, efforts have also been made to
make the Indian economy more resilient by building buffers. Foreign exchange reserves have

4
been replenished by mobilizing US $ 34 billion by way of non-resident Indian (NRI) deposits
and bank borrowings in the international market. India’s foreign exchange reserves, now at
US $ 292 billion, are comfortable in terms of various reserve adequacy criteria. While India
may still be vulnerable to debt outflows on account of disorderly exit from quantitative
easing by major central banks, this risk has been mitigated due to the containment of the
current account deficit, reduction in the stock of the volatile component of capital flows, and
an increase in foreign exchange reserves. Therefore, India is now in a much better position to
deal with capital outflows should they take place. The enhanced currency swap arrangement
with Japan for US $ 50 billion provides India an additional buffer to deal with any potential
external sector shock.
15.
It needs to be recognized that bulk of the outflows by Foreign Institutional Investors
(FIIs) of over US $ 10 billion during June-August 2013 were of debt, out of a debt stock of
US$ 37 billion (as at end-May 2013). Equity portfolio outflows were much lower at US $ 3.8
billion, out of a stock of US $ 141 billion (as at end-May 2013). Significantly, equity
outflows have been more than offset by large inflows in the subsequent period. In the past
five years, foreign institutional investors have invested over US$ 90 billion in the equity
market. FDI flows to India have also remained stable in the recent period. This clearly
suggests that long-term investors continue to have faith in India’s growth prospects, and it is
debt investors who are more fickle. This observation has relevance for the general IMF
advice related to the opening of debt flows.
Financial Sector
16.
India’s banking sector continues to be sound and healthy. Although NPLs of the
banking sector have risen in the recent period, they still remain at a manageable level.
Moreover, banks are maintaining adequate provisions. In order to ensure that NPLs do not
grow further, banks have been advised to put in place a robust mechanism for early detection
of signs of distress. Banks in India remain adequately capitalized. The stress tests conducted
by the IMF assume that 45 per cent of all restructured advances would turn into NPAs. This
assumption is unrealistic as the past historical average is at around 15 per cent. The stress
scenario should not only be severe but also plausible. Similarly, the restructured to
substandard NPA category conversion should attract the specific provisioning requirement as
applicable to sub-standard assets instead of average provisioning of 60 per cent assumed by
staff. Therefore, our authorities feel that the RBI’s approach whereby 30 per cent of
restructured assets turn into NPAs, which is twice the historical average, is conservative
enough. Based on this assumption, the capital needs of banks will be significantly lower.
17.
Concerns have been expressed regarding the treatment of restructured assets. The RBI
has announced that asset classification/provisioning relaxations in respect of restructured
assets will be phased out by April 1, 2015. As a prudential measure, banks are now also
required to have capital and provisioning requirements for their exposures to entities with
unhedged foreign currency exposure.
18.
Staff has indicated that the vulnerability of the banking sector is aggravated by
concentration risk: their report mentions that banking sector loans to India’s ten largest

5
conglomerates account for almost 100 per cent of banks’ net worth. The source of this market
sensitive information is not the RBI. Therefore, one is not sure as to how much reliance can
be placed on the inference drawn based on this information, which is not in the public
domain. In any case, such a number becomes relevant only under the premise of correlated
default. However, most of the large corporates are well diversified as a result of which they
are in a better position to face the business cycle swings.
19.
Several measures have been initiated to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory
framework of banks. The Basel III capital regulation has been implemented in India from
April 1, 2013 in phases. Additional capital requirements on account of Basel III, as is also
estimated by staff, are likely to be manageable. It may be noted that in order to ensure that
the public ownership of banks does not in any way hamper the growth of public sector banks,
our authorities have capitalized public sector banks to the extent of Rs. 477 billion over last
five years and another Rs. 140 billion will be infused during 2013-14.
Financial Inclusion
20.
The spread of financial inclusion among the uncovered segments of households and
businesses has been a major policy objective for a long time. The Reserve Bank is examining
the recommendations of the Committee on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small
Businesses and Low Income Households, which submitted its report recently.
Structural Reforms
21.
To raise the long-term growth potential of the economy, our authorities have
introduced several structural reforms. The projects cleared by the CCI, as alluded to earlier,
should improve the overall investment climate. We have moved a step closer to the
introduction of the Goods and Services Tax with the Ministry of Finance having accepted all
the recommendations of the Parliament Standing Committee on Finance. Some long-pending
bills in the Parliament have been passed. FDI policy has been liberalized. The investment
policy regime has been improved across a number of sectors. New land policy guidelines
have been formulated for 12 major ports in the country that will help them to undertake
various development projects. Construction work on the railways’ dedicated freight corridor
has been initiated. To encourage financial savings by the household sector, Inflation Index
Bonds (IIB) have been introduced. The National Transport Development Policy Committee
(NTDPC) set by the Government is likely to submit its report shortly. This should pave the
way for wide-ranging reforms in the transport sector.
Medium-term Prospects
22.
Notwithstanding the recent growth slowdown, India’s long-term productive capacity
and potential have not been much affected. It is only some supply bottlenecks that have
temporarily affected the investment activity. These bottlenecks as alluded to earlier have
been addressed to a significant extent. Once investment activity revives, India should be able
to quickly regain its long-term growth potential. We reiterate that staff’s estimates of
potential growth seem to focus on the very near-term growth prospects of the economy.

6
They, therefore, vary annually and are sensitive to choice of methodology. Potential growth
is a medium to longer-term concept. As such, potential growth reflects underlying structural
trends rather than cyclical variations and year-to-year shifts and events.
Conclusion
23.
The recent period has been challenging for the Indian economy. Even as our
authorities were grappling with slow growth and persistent inflation, our economy, like many
other emerging market economies, had to contend with the turbulence in financial markets.
In particular, India’s currency came under pressure due to its high current account deficit.
However, through deft handling, India was able to quickly restore stability in the forex
market. India’s elevated current account deficit has been addressed, while the fiscal deficit is
on a downward path. Swift and quick policy response during difficult times has been the
hallmark of India’s policy making. Our authorities, however, have been conscious of the
several challenges that remain. Elevated and persistent inflation continues to pose a major
macroeconomic challenge. Another major challenge is to revive investment activity and put
the Indian economy back on a high growth trajectory.
