IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia

On August 28, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The economic recovery has strengthened. Real GDP growth accelerated to 3.8 percent in 2014,
from 2.7 percent in 2013. Strong growth was attributed to double-digit growth in investment
driven by activities in the Technological Industrial Development Zones and public infrastructure,
as well as strong private consumption supported by robust credit growth and improving labor
market conditions. Facing imported deflationary pressures, monetary stance has been broadly
accommodative. The decline in associated bank lending rates has helped revive credit growth to
over 9.5 percent y-o-y in May 2015 from the trough reached two years ago. Exports grew
robustly following a pick-up in automobile, chemical and plastic products, although net exports’
contribution to growth remained negative due to high investment-related imports.
However, GDP growth in 2015 is expected to moderate to 3.2 percent, with significant downside
risks. A derailment of recent political agreement could negatively impact economic sentiment
and growth. In the medium-term, this may also complicate the opening of negotiations for the
EU accession, which remains deadlocked for nine years due to the name dispute with Greece. In
addition, spillover risks from a prolonged and deep crisis in Greece could weigh down growth
significantly.
Fiscal policy space has largely been depleted since 2008. Entering the global financial crisis with
one of the lowest public debt to GDP ratios in emerging Europe served FYR Macedonia well,
but public sector debt since then has nearly doubled reaching 43.3 percent of GDP in 2014. In
2014, fiscal deficit widened to 4.2 percent of GDP, mainly due to a shortfall in both non-tax and
capital revenues. For the first half of 2015, profit and excise taxes outperformed due to the

forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

removal of exemptions on non-reinvested profits and higher cigarette production from the
government’s strategic partnership project with Philip Morris. Nevertheless, the
under-performance of VAT and non-tax revenues together with wage increases for the police
force and additional capital expenditures entailed by the worsened security situation are likely to
result in a deficit of around 4 percent of GDP in 2015, compared to 3.4 percent targeted in the
budget.
Macroeconomic stability on both domestic and external fronts was sound. Deflation, mostly
reflecting external prices and cuts in administered prices, ended in April 2015. Current account
strengthened further in 2014 aided by strong export growth and resilient private transfers. FDI
inflows held up and more than covered the current account deficit. A successful euro bond
issuance in 2014 improved reserves coverage, allowing FYR Macedonia to pre-finance its 2015
external fiscal financing needs and repay the Fund earlier than scheduled.
The financial sector is well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable. Non-performing loans have
stabilized at relatively low levels by regional standards, and remain fully provisioned. The steady
decline in local currency to FX interest rate spreads shows improved confidence which has
helped the de-euroization of both deposits and loans. Spillover risks from Greece to the financial
sector are being closely monitored.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors praised the authorities’ efforts to promote broad-based growth, noting the
support provided by public investment, improved credit conditions, and robust exports and
foreign direct investment. At the same time, Directors cautioned that downside risks to the
outlook include domestic political uncertainties and regional pressures. Against this background,
they encouraged the authorities to strengthen fiscal policy performance and enhance policy
buffers, while promoting greater private-sector-led job growth.
Directors stressed the need for further fiscal consolidation, in light of the sharp rise in public debt
and limited policy space. They stressed that further measures would be needed to achieve the
target set in the 2015 supplementary budget, including by collecting tax arrears and scaling back
the planned increase in goods and services spending. Looking ahead, Directors welcomed the
authorities’ intention to reduce the overall deficit to below 3 percent of GDP in line with their
medium-term fiscal strategy and enshrine sustainability in fiscal rules. They recommended that
the planned debt ceiling of 60 percent of GDP should be complemented by a lower operational
threshold or debt brake to create adequate space for fiscal policy to counter macroeconomic and

demographic shocks. Directors also encouraged greater efforts to strengthen public finance
management, improve revenue efficiency, and rationalize expenditures.
Directors considered the conduct of monetary policy to be appropriate and welcomed the
authorities’ efforts to preserve financial stability and contain possible spillovers from the crisis in
Greece. They recommended that the authorities stand ready to tighten policies, including using
macro-prudential instruments, in case of demand pressures or financial stability risks. Directors
praised the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the supervisory framework and crisis management
tools, as well as the enhanced communication and exchange of information within the European
Single Supervisory Mechanism. Given the limitations of the capital flow management measures
including the possibility of circumventions, they viewed the enhanced monitoring and
strengthened prudential measures currently in place as warranted to counter possible regional
contagion effects.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts in attracting FDI and boosting exports and
employment. They urged the authorities to continue with structural reforms to ensure stronger
job creation and a broader sharing of prosperity through greater spillover into the domestic
economy. Directors advised further efforts to ensure easier access to credit for firms, shorter
delays in collecting payments, a more predictable legal and regulatory framework, better skills
match, and streamlining of the numerous inspection bodies.

OF MACEDONIA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 10, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context: The broad-based GDP growth supported by public investment, improved credit and
labor market conditions, and robust exports is expected to moderate in the near term.
Domestic political uncertainties and the crisis in Greece constitute significant downside risks.
Fiscal policy space built up in pre-crisis years has largely been depleted. Rebuilding policy
space and buffers to preserve macroeconomic and financial stability is a priority now.
Key policy recommendations


Fiscal Policy. The solid economic recovery provides an opportunity to step up fiscal
consolidation this year in order to achieve a deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2017 in line
with the authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy. Both revenue and expenditure measures are
needed to achieve this outcome. The public debt limit at 60 percent of GDP under the
envisaged fiscal rules should be complemented by a lower operational target, or debt brake at
50 percent of GDP to ensure adequate policy space to counter shocks and absorb spending
pressures from an ageing population. Budgetary institutions and macroeconomic forecasting
also need to be strengthened to ensure successful implementation of fiscal rules.



Monetary and Financial Policy. The monetary policy easing cycle has ended but it is too
early to start tightening in light of a still negative output gap and very low inflation. High
structural liquidity serves as a buffer in the context of possible spillovers from Greece but also
poses some risks in light of strong consumer credit growth. A tightening of policies, including
using macro-prudential tools, should start if financial stability risks emerge or the
de-euroization trend reverses. Enhanced monitoring and strengthened prudential measures
currently in place are warranted to counter possible contagion effects from Greece. In this
context, the recently-introduced capital flow measures have limitations, and their costs and
benefits should be closely monitored.



Structural Policy. The authorities’ policies to attract FDI have borne fruit in terms of
diversifying exports and increasing employment. Further and more lasting gains in exports and
competitiveness will depend on reforms to improve skills and remove constraints on the
operation of the domestic private sector as well as providing better infrastructure.

CONTEXT
1.
Economic recovery has strengthened. Benefiting from strong fiscal stimulus, credit growth
and foreign investment, FYR Macedonia is experiencing one of the highest economic growth rates in
the region. With output recovery more robust than in other emerging European countries, income
convergence continued in post-crisis years and was faster than in other Western Balkan countries.
GDP per capita in PPP terms now stands around one third of the EU-15 average (text chart).

2.
Going forward, the challenge is to maintain economic recovery without jeopardizing
sustainability, while also tackling downside risks. The government’s growth strategy focusing on
attracting foreign investment and enhancing public infrastructure has produced robust growth and
a well-diversified export portfolio. However, export success has come at a cost of rapidly rising
external public and private indebtedness and resulting high financing needs. While improving
infrastructure remains a key ingredient to support the export-led growth in this small, land-locked
economy, going forward, a careful balancing is required to secure strong pay-off from the debt
build-up. At the same time, the uncertain external environment, particularly with regards to Greece
and possible spillovers, makes it urgent to bolster policy space.
3.
Domestic political climate has become more polarized. The wiretapping scandal in early
2015 alleging vote rigging and large-scale government abuse of power led to the resignation of top
officials and has made the domestic political discord a front and center issue. With mediation from
the European Union (EU) and the US, the main political parties have reached an agreement to hold
new elections on April 24, 2016. Transition arrangements are complex, spanning over a period of
9 months. They include the return of the opposition to the Parliament, the appointment of a special
public prosecutor in September 2015, the appointment of opposition members to several high-level
positions, the resignation of the incumbent government before mid-January 2016, and the
formation of an interim government led by the current ruling coalition with a mandate limited to the
organization of elections.

The EU Accession, which anchors the authorities’ long-term vision, remains at an
impasse. In its October 2014 progress report, the European Commission maintained its
recommendation to open accession negotiations which have been blocked by the name dispute
with Greece. Recently, the Commission fielded an expert mission that recommended urgent actions
targeting intelligence, judicial and prosecution services, external oversight, conduct of elections and
media freedom. Progress on this front will likely weigh in the Commission's decision to maintain its
recommendation.
Text Box. Relations with the Fund and IMF Past Policy Advice
A two-year Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) was approved on January 19, 2011. In March 2011, the
authorities drew about US$305 million (286 percent of quota). Following the expiration of the PLL in January
2013, there was a period of post-program monitoring which terminated in January 2015. All outstanding
Fund credit (about US$174 million) was repaid in advance in February 2015.
The authorities’ policy actions in the areas of monetary and financial sector have generally been in line with
the IMF advice. Traction in the areas of fiscal policy and public finance management has been limited over
the past few years. The authorities are yet to implement a fiscal policy anchored in a medium-term fiscal
strategy which ensures a gradual consolidation and stabilizes public debt, a key recommendation of the
2014 Article IV Consultation.

Box 1. Deflationary Developments and Drivers
FYR Macedonia experienced deflation like several other countries in the region. Headline inflation in
FYR Macedonia began to fall sharply in mid-2013 and turned negative in April 2014. The falling inflation was
mostly due to falling food and energy prices and their pass-through to domestic prices. Many neighboring
countries in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe (CESEE), including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria,
Hungary, Kosovo, Montenegro and Poland, experienced deflation in 2014 (text charts).

Credit growth strengthened further against the backdrop of relaxed monetary
conditions. Facing imported deflationary pressures, the monetary stance has been broadly
accommodative, with the key policy rate unchanged at 3.25 percent and relaxation measures on
certain reserve requirements in place for more than 1½ years (Figure 3). The associated decline in
bank lending rates has helped revive credit growth to about 9 percent y-o-y in June 2015 from the
trough reached two years ago. The steady decline in local currency to FX interest rate spreads has
helped the de-euroization process of both deposits and loans (Figure 3, Box 2).

Box 2. Trends in De-Euroization
Similar to other Balkan countries that operate a fixed exchange rate regime, euroization has
traditionally been high in FYR Macedonia. This has been driven by factors typically identified in
the literature: low initial credibility of institutions, volatility of inflation and income, and lower
interest rates offered on foreign currency-denominated loans by foreign bank subsidiaries. In
addition, large private transfers, notably from Germany, have contributed to significant deposit
euroization –prompting banks to extend foreign currency-denominated loans in order to match
the asset and liability structure of their own balance sheets.
While price and exchange rate stability remains the primary objective of monetary policy in
FYR Macedonia, fostering a continuous process of de-euroization has been an important
policy goal. With a view to contain balance sheet risks of unhedged non-financial private sector
agents, the monetary authorities have progressively put in place regulatory safeguards and
buffers against excessive euroization since 2009. These have included: (i) differentiated reserve
requirements for LC and FX liabilities; (ii) a cap on the daily net open FX position of banks to
30 percent of their own funds; and (iii) requirements from banks to identify and document the
situation of large unhedged FX borrowers. More recently, the central bank continued to balance
the needs for monetary stimulus with the objective of maintaining a significant spread between
the central bank bill and ECB main policy rates, in order to incentivize the banks to offer a
substantial currency deposit/loan spread.
These policies have borne fruit, bringing down loan and deposit euroization levels,
particularly for the non-financial private sector (text charts). In the context of declining LC
and FX lending rates but of a slower decline in the currency spreads, the proportion of foreign
currency-denominated loans has fallen below 45 percent of total loans at end-2014 compared to
53.5 percent in January 2009. The proportion of foreign currency-denominated deposits has fallen
to below 42 percent of total deposits from the peak of about 59 percent observed during the
2009 financial crisis, driven by both corporates and households.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
GDP growth is expected to remain broad-based but moderate to 3.2 percent in 2015
under the combined effects of domestic political uncertainties and the crisis in Greece, before
gradually improving over the medium term. Some private investment plans, both domestic and
foreign, are reportedly on hold until new elections, while private consumption is being affected by
negative confidence effects. Output gap is projected to close in 2018 (Figure 1). The current account
deficit is expected to improve in the medium term reflecting the build-up of export capacities in the
Technological Industrial Development Zones (TIDZ) (Table 3). While private transfers are assumed to
hold steady as proven during the global financial crisis, FDI would weaken to 3.1 percent of GDP in
2015 and 2016, and modestly strengthen thereafter. External debt would rise further reflecting
public sector borrowing. As oil prices begin to stabilize, headline inflation is projected to reach
0.8 percent at end-2015.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline ("low" is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, "medium" a probability between 10 and
30 percent, and "high" a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks at the time of
discussions with the authorities.

Box 4. Linkages to Greece and Possible Spillovers
A prolonged and deep crisis in Greece could potentially affect FYR Macedonia’s economy via direct and indirect
real links, international financial linkages, as well as through the presence of Greek-owned banks in the domestic
financial sector.



Direct trade links with Greece are limited, but exports to the euro area (EA) constitute a large part of total exports
(text chart). Exports to Greece have halved since the global financial crisis and now count for less than 5 percent
of total. However, exports to other EA countries, particularly Germany, have rapidly increased in recent years due
to FDI and activities in the Technological Industrial Development Zones (TIDZ). A significant slowdown in EA
growth would, therefore, impact FYR Macedonia’s exports. Additional impact could come from possible
disruption of bulk trade at the harbor of Thessaloniki which processes most of this trade.



International financial linkages include FDI flows and external government financing. FDI stock from the EA
constitutes about half of the total stock, whereas a tenth of FDI stock consists of investment from Greece. Fiscal
financing needs are likely to remain high for the coming years and stand at 15 percent of GDP in 2016 which
include payments falling due externally. Increased uncertainty and risk aversion in the market could significantly
increase sovereign risk spreads elevating debt servicing costs and effectively ruling out external bond issuance.



Greek-owned banks hold a significant share of FYR Macedonia’s banking sector assets but
appear sound. About 22 percent of assets and 24 percent of deposits in the banking sector are
Greek-owned, mainly through the Stopanska Bank (a subsidiary of National Bank of Greece
holding one fifth of assets/deposits), and marginally through a small subsidiary of the Alpha
Bank. Both subsidiaries are adequately capitalized, liquid, mostly deposit-funded, operate on a
stand-alone basis, and do not hold Greek sovereign bonds. Exposures to parent banks are
limited at less than 3 percent of assets.

Spillovers from Greece through indirect channels could weigh significantly on growth, while the combination of
higher financing needs, lower reserves and the inability to issue bond externally could create pressures on the
foreign exchange market. Under the downside scenario, where the crisis in Greece is prolonged and deep, the main
assumptions include: (i) a significant decline in overall exports due to lower demand in the EA and possible disruption of
trade through Greece; (ii) lower FDI inflows from the EA as some EA investors may go into a long wait-and-see mode;
(iii) deposit withdrawals from the Greek subsidiaries and a slowdown in credit growth due to general uncertainties, and
(iv) a significant spike in sovereign spreads given uncertainties and risk aversion in the international financial market.
Remittances are projected to remain unchanged. The resulting lower consumption, exports and investment would lower
real GDP growth to around 1½ percent in 2015–16 (text chart). The lower growth would widen the overall fiscal deficit;
additional financing needs for 2015 are likely to be met through domestic liquidity. The current account deficit would also
widen on account of the trade deficit as the reduction in imports would not outweigh the fall in exports. A prolonged
period of market stress and no sovereign issuance could create pressure on reserves and the exchange rate, particularly if
deposit outflows are not contained within the domestic financial sector.

1/ The downside scenario with prolonged crisis in Greece assumes (i) 10 percent fall in export values in 2015 -2016 along with associated drop
in import values; (ii) 10 percent decline in FDI inflows from euro area in 2015-2016; (iii) a slowdown in private sector credit by half of that of
baseline in 2015 with no recovery in 2016; and(iv) an increase in sovereign spreads by 300 bps in 2015 and 200 bps in 2016. Other relevant
assumptions include no further deterioration in domestic political situations, remittances held-up, and secured intercompany repayments.

The authorities have stepped-up preemptive and contingency measures in the financial sector. Since 2010, the
authorities have strengthened their supervision and crisis management tools to contain possible spillovers stemming from
Greece. Banks have been subjected to stringent provisioning requirements for holding low rated assets and to ex post
notification for any significant transactions with Greece. In addition, current prudential regulations limit intra-group
exposure to 10 percent of capital. Bank deposits, liquidity position and developments in FX market are being monitored
st
on a daily basis. In 2012, the authorities prohibited the early repayment of subordinated loans extended after July 1 , 2012
to parents. The lender of last resort (LOLR) framework is aligned with the international best practices (FSAP update, 2008).
Emergency Liquidity Assistance in local currency is available against qualifying collateral which have recently been
extended, but not in foreign currency. The NBRM has also a handful of bank resolution tools and intervention powers for
broad triggers to address problems with capital adequacy and liquidity (such as corrective actions, administration,
recapitalization, purchase and assumption transactions including removing shareholders, and revocation of license). On a
forward-looking basis, stress tests conducted by the NBRM show both Greek subsidiaries being able to withstand strong
liquidity pressures.
1

More recently, the authorities adopted capital flow measures (CFMs) against Greece. These measures aim at
preventing any Greek interest, including many Greek-owned companies of all sizes operating in FYR Macedonia, to
suddenly borrow from Macedonian banks and send to Greece. While the magnitude of the risk is hard to quantify, the
sizable presence of Greek businesses make the risk significant and the authorities wanted to prevent possible misconduct
that would have undermined the soundness of the domestic financial sector or potentially cause a balance of payment
crisis. The measures are time-bound (valid for a maximum of 6 months) and forward-looking: the authorities noted that
their aim is not to affect current transactions.

11.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s views on the near-term outlook and risks, but
were more optimistic on the medium term. While still in the process of revising their forecasts,
they expect a broadly similar GDP growth rate for 2015. However, they view the negative impact of
domestic political uncertainties to have peaked in May and the impact from Greece to be more
short-lived. In particular, the authorities expect a faster improvement in confidence and, for the
medium term, an accelerated FDI and public investment to support a growth of around 4 percent
and stronger exports to produce lower current account deficits. Risks from a prolonged and deep
crisis in Greece are viewed as significant, but manageable given the reorientation of trade flows that
have already taken place since 2010 and policy actions taken to limit contagion, including
recently-adopted capital flow measures (CFMs) (Box 4). The authorities also project a faster rebound
in prices with headline inflation reaching 2 percent by 2016.



Low revenue efficiency. FYR Macedonia’s tax productivity and efficiency are low compared
to regional peers, particularly for the VAT which contributes one third of tax revenues and
social contributions (text chart).

13.
Fiscal deficit is projected to reach 4 percent of GDP in 2015 compared to 3.4 percent
targeted in the original budget. Revenue developments in the first sixth month showed a
stronger-than-budgeted performance in profit taxes, resulting from the removal of exemptions on
non-reinvested profits, and in excise taxes due to higher production from a strategic partnership
with Philip Morris. However, most other revenue categories, particularly VAT, other taxes and
non-tax revenues, underperformed. During the mission’s visit, the authorities were in the process of
preparing a supplementary budget which is currently being discussed in the parliament. Based on
the details shared with the mission, which include wage increases for the police forces and
additional capital expenditures entailed by the worsened security situation together in the amount
of 1.1 billion denars, staff’s preliminary estimates suggest a deficit of 4 percent of GDP for 2015.
14.
With no policy changes, the overall deficit is likely to remain well above 3 percent of
GDP in the medium term with general government debt rising to 45 percent of GDP by 2020.
The broader public sector debt would reach 54 percent of GDP. The projected fiscal trajectory would
produce a primary deficit (2.1 percent of GDP) that is 1.6 ppts higher than the debt-stabilizing
primary balance and increase gross fiscal financing needs from 15 percent of GDP in 2015 to
18 percent by 2020 (Public DSA Annex).
15.
The authorities’ envisaged fiscal rules are likely to yield too little fiscal consolidation in
the medium term. The planned fiscal rules, which are expected to be operational as of January 1,
2017, will cap the overall budget deficit at 3 percent of GDP and public debt at 60 percent. However,
given the fixed exchange rate regime, a lower debt limit would serve FYR Macedonia better by
creating a larger fiscal space needed to counter macroeconomic shocks and absorb medium-term
spending pressures from population ageing. A lower debt level would also reduce risks emanating
from elevated financing needs. Under the baseline (no policy change) scenario, the public debt rule
is projected to be non-binding but the overall fiscal deficit is likely to miss the limit envisaged in the
fiscal rule.

appropriate in light of the lower growth. Achieving this target would require saving the significant
over-performance in profit tax revenues and adopting additional measures. These measures would
include scaling back the increase in goods and services spending from 21 percent in the original
budget to 14 percent in the supplementary budget, and collecting a part of the tax arrears which for
2014 alone amounted to 2 percent of GDP (text table). The recommended consolidation implies a
reduction of 0.6 percent of GDP in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance for 2015 and 0.7 percent
for 2016. The authorities considered staff’s 2015 fiscal projections to be too pessimistic on the
revenue side, particularly for VAT and social contributions, and thought the deficit target in the
supplementary budget was achievable without additional measures.
17.
In line with the authorities’ medium term fiscal strategy (MTFS), staff recommended
consolidation to keep public debt comfortably below 50 percent of GDP (text chart). The
authorities’ 2015–17 MTFS appropriately aims to reduce the overall deficit to below 3 percent of
GDP by 2017; however, measures are yet to be identified. Working within the parameters of low tax
rates, and, in the absence of a thorough public expenditure review, staff sees scope for adjustment

Expenditure cuts. The composition of public expenditure is heavily skewed in favor of
wages and social transfers (Figure 2). Transfers constitute 64 percent of total expenditure
(18 percent in subsidies), which does not sit well with a catching-up economy requiring
significant investment in infrastructure (Table 2). Staff recommended rationalization based
on a thorough public expenditure review to identify areas of low efficiency.

Staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to enshrine sustainability in fiscal rules but



The inclusion of debt incurred by state-owned enterprises in the overall limit is appropriate
given the full government guarantee. In this context, the projected scaling up of investment and
borrowing by PESR, which is outside the budget, needs to be complemented by clear and
transparent procedures to assess, select, prioritize and monitor these projects to ensure
adequate debt-servicing capacity in future.

19.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to the formal fiscal rules and were
confident that the deficit would be below 3 percent of GDP by 2017. They noted the boost in
growth and competitiveness from higher infrastructure spending and their plan to prioritize
expenditures in favor of capital projects in roads, railway, energy, and health infrastructure. They
were not overly concerned about the medium-term debt dynamics and stressed that debt would
remain well below the 60 percent limit. They are closely monitoring the PESR debt which they see as
relatively stable, with new borrowing netting out repayments. The authorities noted the
shortcomings in their MTFS document– including the lack of sectoral guidance for detailed budget
preparation, and the absence of reconciliation with the previous MTFS – which they propose to
address in the public finance management reform program to be drafted later this year. The
authorities are currently considering the design features taking into account regional experiences to
include in their new Fiscal Responsibility Law.

Most emerging European countries that use a debt rule either cap the public debt at 50 percent of GDP (Hungary)
or at a lower level (Kosovo and Serbia) or use debt brakes starting at 50 percent of GDP (Slovak Republic and

incentives and market for distressed debts.
23.
The two Greek-owned subsidiaries are sound but there are risks of contagion. Both
subsidiaries are liquid and well-capitalized with limited links to parents and Greece (Box 4). Since
2010, NBRM has been pro-active in putting in place various prudential measures (stringent
provisioning requirements for holding Greek assets, limitation of intra-group exposure to 10 percent
of capital, ex-post notification for parent-sub transaction, daily monitoring of deposits, and
pre-approval for subordinated loan repayment) that have led Greek-owned subsidiaries to
drastically wind down exposure to the parent group. However, a short-term drain in the form of
repatriation of non-distributed earnings or deposit outflows cannot be ruled out—which both banks
appear capable of withstanding given high share of liquid assets. Risks of a broader contagion in the
form of system-wide deposit withdrawal seem contained for now.

Staff recommended a tightening of monetary policies should demand pressures pick
up, a low probability in the current environment, or risks to financial stability emerge.
Consumer and mortgage lending growth rates have been in the double-digits, which require
vigilance. The authorities agreed and expressed their intention to use targeted macro-prudential
policies to address risks concentrated in specific borrower group, while an increase in the policy rate
would be considered in case of external or price stability risks. Staff supports this approach. Reserves

needed to preserve the ongoing de-euroization, which has a bearing on financial stability, should
external uncertainties negatively impact the pace of private transfer inflows and conversion of
deposits from foreign to local currency.

26.
Staff supported maintaining the strengthened surveillance currently in place to fend
off contagion risks. The prudential measures that have been in place for some time has served to
protect the stability of the financial sector. The revised Banking Law provides the central bank with
powers to intervene in insolvent banks or ring-fence illiquid but solvent ones. More recently, as
discussed in Box 4, the authorities, fearing possible capital outflows by Greek businesses operating
in FYR Macedonia, adopted CFMs which ban new capital flows to Greece.2 These measures have
limitations, including the possibility to circumvent. While agreeing with the staff that prudential
measures would have been preferable to address these concerns, the authorities explained that, in
the absence of any clear signs of financial instability, they were unable to intensify surveillance of
financial transactions in solvent banks via further prudential measures. There has been no noticeable
impact of CFMs on the domestic economy to date, including on the regular operations of Greek
banks and businesses. There have also been no signs of circumventions via third parties or spillovers
on other countries’ policy responses. The costs and benefits of the CFMs, however, need to be
assessed on an ongoing basis.
27.
The authorities noted good progress regarding supervisory cooperation in the context
of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). The supervision department of the central bank
successfully passed the European Banking Authority (EBA) assessment on the equivalence of
confidentiality regimes in April, hence paving the way for its formal participation in supervisory
colleges on cross-border banking groups. In practice, the exchange of information on the
Greek-owned banks has taken place on a regular basis in the last few months within the SSM. The
authorities eagerly await further EBA assessments scheduled in 2016, as passing these would
authorize lifting the current EU requirement that subsidiaries of EU banks fully provision their
holding of non-EU public assets. This requirement comes at a high cost to the domestic banking
sector.

Staff is seeking additional clarifications from the authorities to ascertain the possible jurisdictional implications of
the recent measures.

C. Structural Policy—Cementing Gains in Exports
Diagnostics
28.
A low tax regime, competitive wages and improved business environment have been
successful in attracting FDI and benefiting exports and employment. FYR Macedonia, ranked
overall at 30th, is among the best performers in the region according to the World Bank’s Doing
Business indicators. FDI, particularly in manufacturing, has helped transform the structure of exports
in favor of automobile and chemical products in recent years. Major German, American, British, and,
more recently, Belgian firms have started outsourcing the production of components. These trends
have resulted in steady gains in the world market and the EU. 3

An assessment of FYR Macedonia’s external sustainability shows no major
misalignment of the exchange rate. The real effective exchange rate, which has remained stable in
recent years, partly driven by the deflation experienced since 2014 shows a moderate
undervaluation in assessment under all three approaches: macroeconomic balance, equilibrium
exchange rate and external stability (Box 5). Other price competitiveness indicators, such as labor
costs, are more or less in line with productivity (Figure 4). The current account deficit is projected to
stay below the level estimated as the norm according to the macroeconomic balance approach
(between 4½–5 percent of GDP) throughout the medium term.
30.
While these developments are evidence of FYR Macedonia’s export competitiveness,
high private sector indebtedness poses risks (text chart). FYR Macedonia is one of the few
countries in the region where private sector debt has continued to increase in post-crisis years,
driven by external borrowing. Recent FDI inflows have largely been in the form of intercompany
debt, as opposed to equity. A cross-country analysis shows FYR Macedonia’s private sector debt
level to be too high compared to fundamentals, such as interest costs and growth potential, despite

account deficit recorded at the end of the year.

1/ A negative value indicates undervaluation.

Under the EBA-lite methodology, with “desirable policy values” set as follows: (i) cyclically adjusted fiscal
balance corresponding to the debt-stabilizing primary balance of -1.3 percent of GDP minus long-term interest
payments estimated at 1.3 percent of GDP; (ii) constant capital control index, (assessed so far at 0.55);
(iii) constant share of private credit to GDP (slightly below 50 percent); and (iv) constant reserve-to-GDP ratio
(at 28.5 percent at the end of 2014), the undervaluation of the real exchange rate appears even larger, with a
computed gap of -7.3 percent. The EBA estimations improve on CGER methodology by expanding the range of
explanatory variables used to calculate the real exchange rate and current account norms, notably including
foreign aid and remittances in the case of emerging economies.
Both sets of results should, however, be interpreted with some cautions for a country where the goods and
services deficit is above 17 percent of GDP in 2014, offset by foreign remittances. While remittances flows have
traditionally proven quite stable over time, they should be considered an exhaustible resource for external
vulnerability assessment in the long run. Ensuring competitiveness would require vigilance so that remittances
do not create Dutch disease-type developments, for example by increasing reservation wages too high. So far,
cost competitiveness seems broadly in line with productivity developments and the real effective exchange
rate remains stable.

31.
Spillovers from the TIDZ to the domestic economy remain limited. Export products
stemming from these zones, which represent more than a third of total exports in 2014, have large
import contents, and anecdotal evidence suggests limited spillover to domestic suppliers, partly
owing to their inability to meet technical and
safety requirements for exports to the EU.
32.
In addition, the domestic private sector
seems to have benefited less from the
improving business environment. Small
domestic firms face credit constraints due to high
collateral requirements, which on average stand at
250 percent of the loan value. Over 90 percent of
firm loans require collateral, which reflects banks’
practice to lend on the basis of physical assets that
can be pledged rather than on the basis of
business plans and cash flow projections, resulting
in high reliance on self finance. Delays in collecting
payments, which on average require four months,
also create widespread liquidity constraints for the
domestic private sector.

Discussion
33.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment that continued success in FDI will
require second generation reforms. Given that tax rates are among the lowest in the region,
further success in FDI and exports, particularly to increase their domestic value added content, will
require structural reforms to boost higher education and skills, and providing better infrastructure.
These reforms will also enhance growth potential which is needed to carry the rising debt burden.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

34.
Staff stressed the need to remove impediments affecting the domestic private sector.
Policies to help build technical and managerial skills that would improve reliability and quality of
products and business planning would help link the domestic private sector with foreign companies
operating in the TIDZ. In addition, improving access to finance, reducing payment delays and
removing regulatory hurdles are important, particularly for small businesses. The authorities are
aware of these challenges and mentioned regular dialogue with both domestic private sector and
foreign investors. However, private sector stakeholders point to the weak implementation of the
Financial Discipline Law that aims to enforce timely payments and noted little progress regarding
the clarification of the mandate of the numerous inspection bodies.

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
The broad-based GDP growth is expected to continue in 2015 but moderate to
3.2 percent. Benefiting from strong fiscal stimulus, dynamic credit growth and improving foreign
investment, FYR Macedonia has been experiencing one of the highest economic growth rates in the
region. However, more recently, domestic political uncertainties and the crisis in Greece are serving
to slow momentum as confidence weakens. A possible worsening on both fronts constitute
significant downside risks to the outlook.
36.
Fiscal consolidation should be a priority. The general government debt to GDP ratio has
nearly doubled since 2008. In light of the broad-based economic recovery and looming risks facing
the outlook, fiscal consolidation needs to be stepped up. Underperformance of VAT and non-tax
revenues, as well as wage increases and additional security-related capital expenditures, are likely to
result in a higher-than-budgeted overall fiscal deficit in 2015 despite strong performance in profit
and excise tax revenues. The supplementary budget currently under consideration should identify
compensating measures, including scaling back increase in goods and services spending and
collecting tax arrears, to ensure a deficit of 3.6 percent of GDP. Fiscal consolidation should continue
in the medium-term to reduce the overall deficit to below 3 percent of GDP in line with the
authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy and keep public debt comfortably below 50 percent of
GDP.
37.
The plan to enshrine sustainability in fiscal rules is a step in the right direction, but
more needs to be done to ensure adequate policy space. The planned debt ceiling of 60 percent
of GDP is too high for a country like FYR Macedonia where fiscal policy serves as the main
counter-cyclical policy tool, and further room needs to be created to accommodate long-term
spending pressures in pension and health from an ageing population. The proposed debt ceiling
should be complemented by a lower operational threshold or debt brake at 50 percent of GDP in
line with other countries in the region to create adequate policy space.
38.
Successful implementation of fiscal rules also requires a robust public finance
infrastructure. The current weak linkages between the medium-term and the annual budget
process, and over-optimistic revenue projections reveal weaknesses which would need to be
resolved prior to the fiscal rules coming into force in 2017. Strengthening institutional arrangements
to support a robust medium-term budgeting framework, better macroeconomic forecasting, and
24

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

effective and transparent budget execution would be important. In this context, the expansion of
public investment in infrastructure needs to be complemented by clear and transparent procedures
to assess, select, prioritize, and monitor projects.
39.
Monetary tightening should start in case of signs of demand pressures or financial
stability risks. Over the past two years, the central bank has used reserve requirements and the low
policy rate to appropriately support the resumption of credit growth. A negative output gap and
very low inflation do not yet call for monetary tightening while high excess liquidity also serves as a
buffer against possible spillovers from Greece. However, with credit growth picking up, the
authorities should stand ready to tighten policies, including using macro-prudential instruments, in
case of domestic demand pressures or signs of financial stability risks. This would also help preserve
the ongoing process of de-euroization.
40.
The financial sector remains healthy, while spillover risks from Greece are being
closely monitored. Banks, including the two Greek-owned subsidiaries, are well-capitalized, highly
liquid and increasingly funded by domestic deposits. Nonperforming loan ratios have stabilized and
these loans remain fully provisioned. Since 2010, the authorities have strengthened their supervisory
framework and crisis management tools to contain possible spillovers from Greece. Communication
and exchange of information within the European Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) has also
been intensified. Given the limitations of the CFMs, including the possibility of circumventions,
enhanced monitoring and strengthened prudential measures currently in place are warranted to
counter possible contagion effects from Greece.
41.
A key challenge going forward is to cement recent gains in exports and FDI to raise
potential growth. A low tax regime, competitive wages and improving business environment have
been successful in attracting FDI and boosting exports and employment. However, the domestic
private sector has benefited less from improving business environment while spillovers from the
Technological Industrial Development Zones to the domestic economy remain limited. Going
forward, structural reforms are needed to ensure a broad-based sharing of prosperity. This would
entail further efforts to ensure easier access to credit for firms, shortening delays in collecting
payments, including from the public sector, a more predictable legal and regulatory framework,
boosting labor skills, and streamlining the role of numerous inspection bodies.
42.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with FYR Macedonia be held
on the standard 12-month cycle.

Annex 1. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
A fast rising public debt largely denominated in foreign currency and high financing requirements are
key risk factors. Stress tests show that while debt level does not pose significant risks of debt distress
under shock scenarios, rapid debt accumulation, large gross financing needs and large share of FX debt
call for caution in debt management. Stronger fiscal consolidation is needed to stabilize debt and
rebuild fiscal policy space.
1.
General government debt is expected to rise by 7 percentage points of GDP over the
forecast horizon, to about 45 percent at end-2020. Debt level is expected to briefly dip in 2015 as
a large Eurobond issuance in July 2014 pre-financed debt repayment and reduced financing needs
for this year. Debt accumulation over the medium term is mainly driven by high primary deficit and
partially offset by favorable growth prospects.
2.
While the level of debt is not alarmingly high, large gross financing needs and a high
share of FX debt pose significant risks. The baseline gross financing needs are higher than
regional average and exceed the benchmark for stress tests throughout the projection period.
Foreign-currency denominated debt averages about 73 percent of general government debt over
the projection period, presenting high risk of debt distress due to currency mismatch.
3.
Stronger fiscal consolidation is needed to stabilize debt and rebuild fiscal space.
General government debt has almost doubled since 2008 as a share of GDP, severely eroding
available fiscal buffers essential for weathering shocks. . The primary deficit is expected to reach
2.1 percent of GDP by 2020, 1.6 percentage points higher than the debt-stabilizing primary balance,
revealing a pressing need for stronger fiscal consolidation.
4.
Public sector debt, including that of non-financial public sector, is expected to rise to
56 percent of GDP over the forecast horizon from 44 percent of GDP in 2014. Debt of public
non-financial enterprises, mostly reflecting borrowing by two SOEs, Public Enterprise for State Roads
(PESR) and Electricity Production Company (ELEM), is expected to nearly double over the projection
period, from 5.4 percent of GDP to 10.3 percent in 2020. Aside from the fast buildup, debt by
non-financial SOEs is predominantly denominated in foreign currency, presenting risks of currency
mismatch.

1/ Based on available data.
2/ Bond Spread over German Bonds.
3/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock at the end of previous year.
4/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
5/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
6/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
7/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
8/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

Table 1. FYR Macedonia: Non-Financial Public Sector Debt Stress Test Scenarios
Name

Description

Impact on debt
1/

Primary Balance Shock

Minimum shock equivalent to 50 percent of planned adjustment (50
percent implemented), or baseline minus half of the 10-year historical
standard deviation, whichever is larger. There is an increase in interest
rates of 25bp for every 1 percent of GDP worsening in the primary
balance.

4.5

Real GDP Growth Shock

Real GDP growth is 1.5 percentage point lower in the period 2015–20;
revenue-to-GDP ratio remains the same as in the baseline; level of noninterest expenditures is the same as in the baseline; deterioration in
primary balance leads to higher interest rate (see above); decline in
growth leads to lower inflation (0.25 percentage points per 1
percentage point decrease in GDP growth).

6.6

Interest Rate Shock

Interest rate increases by difference between average real interest rate
level over projection and maximum real historical level, or by 200bp,
whichever is larger.

2.1

Real Exchange Rate Shock

Estimate of overvaluation or maximum historical movement of the
exchange rate, whichever is higher; pass-through to inflation with
default elasticity of 0.25 for EMs and 0.03 for AEs.

3.9

Combined Macro-Fiscal Shock

Shock size and duration based on the underlying shocks.

17.8

Notes:
1/ Percentage points in excess of the baseline at the end of the projection period.

Source: IMF staff.
1/ Public sector is defined as non-financial public sector.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Bond Spread over German Bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
8/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in euro terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Exchange Arrangement:
The currency of the FYR of Macedonia is the denar. The FYR of Macedonia maintains a
managed floating exchange rate system with a de facto stabilized arrangement against
the Euro. Households can transact through commercial banks or through foreign
exchange bureaus that act as agents of banks; enterprises can transact through the
banking system. The reserve requirement on foreign currency deposits is set at 15 percent,
while that on FX-indexed denar deposits are set at 20 percent.
At end-June 2014, the official exchange rate was 55.4 denars per U.S. dollar and 61.69
denars per euro. The FYR of Macedonia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 with effect from June 19, 1998.
Article IV Consultations:
The first consultation with the FYR of Macedonia was concluded in August 1993. The last
consultation was concluded on August 28, 2015. The FYR Macedonia is on the standard
12-month Article IV consultation cycle.

IMF–WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
Background
The Bank and the Fund country teams on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia maintain
close collaboration, seeking synergies and harmonizing policy recommendations. Close
coordination has resulted in largely shared views of the economic situation in the country.

Key Areas of World Bank Involvement


The World Bank program in FYR Macedonia focuses on two interrelated themes: i) Growth
and Competitiveness; and ii) Skills and Inclusion. For Growth and Competitiveness,
successful poverty reduction would need sustained private sector led growth, making FYR
Macedonia more attractive as a destination for investments and as a country whose private
companies can compete at the regional and global level. For Skills and Inclusion, the fruits
of growth can be shared broadly if more Macedonians have access to better jobs and if
public services are of good quality and delivered efficiently. Since FYR Macedonia’s future
is clearly linked to the European integration, the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy
actively promotes the EU accession agenda and this represents a cross-cutting theme of
the strategy.



A series of two budget support operations (Competitiveness DPL) were made available to
the Government with the aim to improve the competitiveness of the economy to develop a
stronger export-oriented enterprise sector. The second DPL was disbursed in 2014.



The Regional and Local Roads Program Support Project (US$105 million) and the new National
and Regional Roads Rehabilitation Project (US$ 71 million) are helping with the rehabilitation of
the regional and local roads and provide institutional support to improve the management of
roads. The World Bank finances the energy sector through the Electric Power Development
Energy Community of South East Europe Project APL3 (US$44 million) to improve the
transmission grid, including an interconnection with Serbia. Local development is assisted
through the Municipal Services Improvement Project (US$75 million), which is helping to
improve transparency, financial sustainability and delivery of targeted municipal services in
selected municipalities. The World Bank is also active in the human development sector
through the Conditional Cash Transfer Project (US$25 million), and the Skills Development and
Innovation Support Project (US$24 million).



The World Bank has recently completed negotiations for the new Roads Upgrading and
Development Project in the amount of EUR 83 million. The project objectives are to improve
transport connectivity for road users along Corridor VIII between Skopje and Deve Bair, and
to improve the asset management and planning function of Public Enterprise for State Roads.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of August 6, 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Areas that
would benefit most from further improvement are national accounts and government finance
statistics.

National accounts: The quality of national account measurement needs to improve. Some
discrepancies between GDP and its components, as well as between annual and quarterly figures
remain. Timely and consistent provision of data is still an issue. In 2013, by the decision of the
Government of FYR Macedonia, amendments were made to the National Classification of Activities—
NKD Rev.2—which entailed significant changes in the decomposition of historical data. The primary
objective was to make Macedonian national statistics comparable with that of other European
countries, for example, ensuring that the content and structure of national statistics is completely
harmonized with the European Classification of Activities NACE Rev.2.
Price statistics: Improvements to the CPI have been introduced in accordance with international
standards and EU regulations to align the Classification of Individual Consumption According to
Purpose (COICOP).
Government finance statistics: Debt data on a disaggregated basis for the broader public sector are
not available on a regular basis. Macedonia does not report government finance statistics to the Fund
for publication in either the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) or the International
Financial Statistics (IFS).

Monetary sector: EUR receives a monthly electronic report of monetary statistics, covering the
balance sheet of the central bank, the commercial banks and other depository corporations.

External sector: External sector statistics meet international standards. In additional to monthly
balance of payments data, the authorities compile and disseminate international investment position
(IIP) data, reserve assets and foreign currency liquidity data, and external debt statistics.
II. Data Standards and Quality
FYR Macedonia participates in the General Data
Data ROSC published on September 29, 2004.
Dissemination System (GDDS), and, since
November 2011, in the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS).

Statement by Mr. Menno Snel, Executive Director for Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia and Mr. Jeroen Clicq, Advisor to Executive Director
August 28, 2015
On behalf of our Macedonian authorities, we thank staff for the candid and constructive
exchange of views during the mission. This year’s Article IV mission took place at a time
when the situation in Greece and the domestic political situation were quite uncertain. Not
surprisingly, the staff report has listed those two issues as the main downside risks for the
Macedonian economy.
We are happy to report that significant progress has been made on both fronts. With the
timely and forward-looking measures to contain negative spillovers from Greece and the
agreement reached in the Eurogroup on Greece on August 14, the scenario of a prolonged
and deep crisis in Greece, set forward in box 4 of the report, has been avoided and possible
negative spillovers from Greece will likely be contained. Also, the domestic political
situation has significantly improved. On July 15, the four main political parties reached an
agreement that put the political crisis to an end. All parties agreed to ensure full
implementation of the agreement facilitated by EU Commissioner Hahn, Members of the
European Parliament, and the EU and US Ambassadors to Skopje. Parliamentary elections
will take place in Macedonia on April 24, 2016. The incumbent government will submit its
formal resignation to Parliament in time to enable the caretaking Government, headed by a
new Prime Minister, to be sworn in 100 days before the Parliamentary elections. All current
ministers will hold their positions in the interim government. It was also agreed that by
September 15, a new Special Prosecutor with full autonomy will be appointed to lead the
investigations arising from the interception of communications.
Unemployment reduction is the top priority of the Macedonian authorities.
Unemployment at almost 27 percent, and reaching 50 percent among young people, is the
central economic problem of Macedonia. Reducing unemployment is the top priority of the
Government. In recent years, good progress has been achieved in this area by implementing
structural reforms and active labor market policies. As a result, the unemployment rate is on
a declining path from 37 percent in 2005 to 27 percent in 2015. We would have liked that the
staff paper devotes more attention to this main challenge for economic policymaking. The
authorities’ strategy to reduce unemployment, and by doing so reducing social tensions in
this multiethnic society, is essential to understand the broader economic policy choices of the
Macedonian authorities. In a small land-locked economy like Macedonia, unemployment
reduction will only materializes if investments take place. To attract foreign investors, the
Macedonian authorities offer a favorable tax environment, are undertaking the necessary
infrastructure investments and are creating a favorable business environment. This
development strategy is bearing fruit and Macedonia is experiencing the highest economic
growth rate in the region. The country has successfully diversified its exports. The strategy
of strengthening the export base resulted in a shrinking trade deficit, which is an important
factor for monetary policy under the chosen monetary strategy of exchange rate targeting. It

2
is expected that total job creation of FDIs will exceed more than 30,000 jobs in the next 2 to
3 years, with significant positive impacts on disposable income, tax and social contributions
and VAT related revenues.
The Macedonian experience illustrates that in countries where infrastructure bottlenecks are
constraining growth, the gains from increased and efficient public investments by alleviating
these bottlenecks are large. We believe that the report should have elaborated more on the
long-term growth potential of the economy instead of being overly concerned about the
short-term fiscal consequences of the country’s development strategy given that the
authorities are firmly committed to ensure fiscal sustainability, sound public finances and are
in the process of adopting a fiscal rule.
Macro-economic situation
In 2014, growth reached 3.8 percent, the highest in the region. The economy is growing at
a solid pace without inflationary pressures. July data show a mildly negative (-0.3 percent)
headline inflation, while core annual inflation was, on average, 0.2 percent in the first seven
months of the year.
In July 2015, the authorities have revised GDP growth for 2015 from 4 percent to
3.5 percent reflecting the likely impact of a prolonged political crisis and the Greek crisis
casting uncertainty on the economy during June and July. The authorities’ growth forecast is
somewhat higher than the 3.2 percent set forward in the staff report because a faster
improvement in confidence, especially in the construction and trade sector, is expected.
Downside risks have recently abated, bringing the projected growth well within reach. The
quality of the macroeconomic forecasts of the authorities has markedly improved. Over the
last two years there have been no significant forecasting errors.
Fiscal policy
As stated in our introductory remarks, the authorities are firmly committed to sound fiscal
policies. Sound public finance management is a top priority. With the support of the EU,
the authorities are enhancing medium-term budget planning and fiscal reporting. The
authorities acknowledge that maintaining stability and sustainability of the budget and public
debt levels is important for a small country like Macedonia. At the same time, they consider
that at this stage prioritization of capital expenditures for roads, railway, energy and health
infrastructure is still needed to help the economy grow and further reduce
unemployment. Against this background and because of countercyclical fiscal policy
measures, public debt has indeed increased but debt dynamics illustrate that the debt will
remain well below the theoretical 60 percent limit. Staff’s comparison between public debt
levels in 2008 and 2014 is somewhat misleading since the low debt level in 2008 was due to
early repayment of debt under unfavorable terms. Assessing debt developments in the period

3
2006 -2014 illustrates that debt levels increased by 12.8 p.p., mainly due to capital
investments which are generating economic growth. Both public debt at 43.7 percent and
general government debt at 36.1 percent are among the lowest in Europe.
The authorities expect for 2015 a budget deficit of 3.6 percent compared to the
4 percent set forward in the staff paper. The authorities also project significant lower
financing needs for 2015 (8.86 percent) than those calculated by the staff (15 percent). The
authorities consider staff’s fiscal projections too pessimistic especially on the revenue side.
For the first half of 2015, the budget deficit was 1.7 percent of GDP. Compared with the
same period in 2014, budget revenues are already 14 percent higher, tax revenues are
15.6 percent higher and social contributions are 8.2 percent higher. The good results are
mainly due to higher revenues from both profit tax and excises. The supplementary budget
adopted by the authorities on July 16 does not entail major changes to the basic
macroeconomic parameters but rather reallocates some expenditures to support government
policies and projects such as intensifying the construction of the gas pipeline network from
Klecovce to Stip. Increasing salaries for the police is another additional spending item.
The Selected Issues paper on fiscal rules is a valuable input for the ongoing domestic
discussions. The authorities are in the process of adopting a fiscal rule and are currently
looking at developing proper institutional settings, including the development of a proper
legal basis, automatic correction mechanisms and brakes, top-down processes and escape
clause at times of significant natural and economic distress. The authorities are highly
committed to a deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2017. The authorities are also thankful
for the technical assistance received by the Fund which has contributed to increased revenue
collection.
Monetary and financial sector policy
The economic and financial conditions prove that the current monetary policy setup is
adequate. Exiting from accommodative monetary policy will mainly depend on changes
in the external position of the economy and its effects on foreign reserves. As of June 30,
2015 the gross foreign reserves stood at EUR 2,254.8 million and foreign reserves registered
a somewhat higher decrease than expected in the second quarter. Yet, foreign reserves
adequacy indicators remain within the safe zone. The continuing process of de-euroization
reflected by an upward trend of the share of Denar deposits in total deposits indicates the
credibility of the monetary authority, the strengthened confidence in local currency and the
preferences to favor domestic savings.
The Macedonian banking system is largely funded by domestic deposits and is very well
capitalized. The legal minimum capital adequacy is 8 percent. In addition the authorities use
moral suasion to induce large banks to maintain capital adequacy of at least 12 percent. Total
deposit growth in June was somewhat influenced by lower household deposits due to the

4
domestic political developments and the crisis in Greece but total deposits still increased by
8.8 percent on an annual basis at the end of the second quarter. Nonperforming loan ratios
have stabilized and are fully provisioned. Solid monthly growth of total loans to the private
sector was recorded in June and the annual growth rate of total loans in June was 9.1 percent.
The authorities have put in place sound prudent bank supervision and are experiencing
good cross-border cooperation in the banking supervision with the Single Supervisory
Mechanism. More recently, the National Bank of Macedonia has taken a number of actions
to improve the contingency framework. The authorities (i) have established a Financial
Stability Committee with involvement of the Governor and the Minister of Finance, (ii) have
improved the regulation on collateral, and (iii) have improved, in cooperation with the World
Bank, the contingency planning for dealing with high risk banks and introduced contagion
metrics for assessing systemic risk. For the three largest banks and one small Greek
subsidiary, a written strategy has been prepared, based on the current law, outlining how the
central bank would resolve each of them if they would become problematic.
In the context of the decision of the ECB to freeze the level of emergency liquidity to Greece
and the risk of Greece’s non-payment to the Fund on June 30, the Macedonian authorities
adopted, on June 28, protective measures to safeguard the balance of payments and
financial stability given the imminent threat of negative spillovers. These measures are in
line with the Fund’s institutional view on capital controls; i.e. they are transparent,
temporary, precautionary and don’t disturb the normal conduct of business. Indeed, until
now, the authorities did not receive any complaints about these measures from banks or
businesses and the trade relations with Greek companies have continued normally from the
Macedonian side. The authorities have, in the meantime, with the expertise of the Fund,
slightly amended the decisions to bring the restrictions fully in line with the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement.
Structural reforms
Macedonia lists at the top among regional peers in the last 9 years, including the latest
World Bank Doing Business report.
In line with Fund advice and with the support of the World Bank and IFC, the authorities are
intensifying their efforts to strengthen the links between the companies operating in the
Technological Industrial Development Zones and the domestic private sector. The authorities
agree with the staff’s recommendations on the importance to continue to ease the
operating environment for the domestic private sector. This is why the authorities have
intensified the dialogue with the business community and the chambers of commerce.
Recently, the authorities took measures to reduce the fines for the domestic companies and
are continuing their efforts to improve access to finance for SMEs, through the European

5
Investment Bank and the Macedonian Bank for Development Promotion, and to boost
education systems to reduce skill mismatches and develop entrepreneurial spirit and skills.
To strengthen the innovative capacity of the Macedonian economy, the Fund for
Innovations and Technology Development has launched in the beginning of 2015 its first call
for co-financing grants for start-up, spin-off companies and innovations and will co-finance
in 2015 for €458.700 projects in the area of IT, electrical, engineering, education, food and
machinery industries. It is expected that the Fund for Innovations and Technology
Development will contribute to generate new businesses and jobs (especially for young and
highly qualified persons) and to better connect research and entrepreneurship.
It is also worth noting that the authorities are preparing an Action Plan to address
shortcomings in the areas of rule of law and judiciary, public administration, media, electoral
reform, inter-ethnic relations and economic governance. All these reform measures will
continue to enhance economic growth, competiveness and provide a boost to job creation.
Concluding remarks
Unemployment reduction is a top priority for Macedonia and the authorities are delivering on
this objective. Sound fiscal policies and strengthening medium-term budget planning are high
on the political agenda and the authorities look forward to a continued collaboration with the
EU and the Fund on this. Macedonia is transitioning towards a knowledge-based economy
and the authorities are well aware that the economic prospects of Macedonia depend on the
developments in the European economies. Against the background of the EU accession
objective, for which Macedonia fulfilled all the criteria necessary to start accession
negotiations already in 2009, there is clear political consensus and orientation towards both
EU and NATO membership.
On a final note, we observe that Macedonia has completed, on February 27, 2015, the early
repayment of its entire outstanding obligations to the Fund, amounting to SDR 123.1 million.
This reflects the country’s improved access to domestic and international capital markets.
