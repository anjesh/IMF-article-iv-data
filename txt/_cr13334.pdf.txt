STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 8, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: Over the past year, Mexico has maintained macroeconomic stability and has made
significant progress in advancing growth-oriented structural reforms. The country’s close ties with
the global economy, while a source of strength, heighten the economy’s exposure to external
risks. The transition to a less accommodative monetary policy in the U.S. and other advanced
economies is a key risk.
Recent Developments: In 2013, the economy has begun to operate below capacity, with growth
expected to slow to 1.2 percent and core inflation running at historically low rates. Demand
policies are consistent with preserving macroeconomic stability, while supporting a recovery in
growth. The external current account deficit and real effective exchange rate are broadly in line
with fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Mexico’s asset markets showed more resilience
than many other emerging markets after the Fed initiated its discussion of tapering on May 22.
Structural reforms: Over the past year, more than a half dozen major reforms have been
approved to upgrade several areas, including labor markets, telecommunications, and education.
Most recently congress approved a comprehensive fiscal reform. It is also considering an energy
reform that opens the door for private investment in hydrocarbons and a financial sector reform
that seeks to increase intermediation, promote competition and enhance financial stability. Staff
estimates that these reforms will boost potential output growth to 3½ to 4 percent a year,
compared with the pre-reform estimate of 3 to 3¼ percent a year, with upside risk to this outlook.
Fiscal reform: The recently approved fiscal reform should provide for a more transparent and
effective fiscal anchor, while limiting the procyclicality of spending. In this context, the
government defined a path for the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) through 2018 that
entails a gradual decline in the PSBR to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2017. The authorities have
introduced several legal provisions that give assurances that spending growth will fall in line with
this objective, but care will be needed to avoid remaining risks of fiscal slippage.
Advice from Previous Article IV Consultation: The ambitious agenda of structural reforms is in
line with Fund advice from past consultations and the financial sector reform implements a
number of key recommendations of the 2011 FSAP Update. Staff supports the authorities’ plan for
the pace of medium-term fiscal consolidation in light of the economic slowdown in 2013,
although this pace is not as rapid as envisaged in the 2012 consultation.

CONTEXT
1.
Over the past year, Mexico has maintained macroeconomic policy continuity while
pursuing an ambitious agenda of growth-enhancing reforms. Fiscal policy has been governed
by a Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) since 2006, monetary policy operates under a credible inflation
targeting framework, which includes a firm commitment to exchange rate flexibility, and the
2011 FSAP Update found that the financial regulatory and supervisory framework was sound. The
authorities have refrained from adopting any capital flow measures, in line with their view that an
open capital account reduces policy uncertainty and supports long-term growth. The macroprudential framework aims at limiting maturity and currency mismatches in the banking system. The
government has made impressive progress in advancing structural reforms through laws to upgrade
education, make labor markets more flexible, and foster competition in telecommunications.
Congress is currently debating a fundamental reform of the energy sector and is in the final stages
of approving a reform to broaden access to financial markets. In October 2013, Congress modified
the fiscal framework, reformed the main taxes, and introduced a universal pension scheme and
unemployment insurance.
2.
Mexico has close ties with the global economy. There are substantial trade, banking,
portfolio and direct investment, and remittance connections with the United States, and Mexico’s
manufacturing sector is highly integrated into the U.S. supply chain (Figure 1). Mexico competes
directly with China in the U.S. market, where China accounts for 23 percent of U.S. imports and
Mexico accounts for 12 percent. Linkages with the rest of the Americas are relatively small. Foreignowned banks account for about 70 percent of banking system assets, although these banks operate
as a subsidiary—which means they are regulated and supervised by the National Commission of
Banking and Securities (CNBV). The U.S. accounts for over half of Mexico’s foreign portfolio liabilities
and foreign direct investment, with another significant share coming from other advanced countries
(such as the United Kingdom, Japan, Spain, Canada, and Germany). The internationalization of the
domestic sovereign bond market increased sharply since the inclusion of Mexico in the World Global
Bond Index (WGBI) in 2010. Based on a recent survey, the BIS reported that the Mexican peso is the
most actively traded emerging market currency in the world, with a daily global trading volume of
US$135 billion. This means that Mexico’s deep and liquid foreign exchange and domestic equity and
sovereign bond markets can serve as an early port of call for global investors in episodes of financial
turbulence and hence are susceptible to risks of contagion.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
In 2013, the economy has begun to operate well below capacity, with real GDP growth
expected to slow to 1.2 percent (down from 3.6 percent in 2012). In the first semester, activity
declined sharply, opening a sizable output gap estimated at -1.5 percent of potential GDP in the
second quarter. Growth in manufacturing (accounting for 16 percent of real GDP) stagnated, as
weakness in U.S. manufacturing, especially in durables, led to virtually no growth in non-automotive

4

MEXICO

manufacturing exports. Supply-side bottlenecks in natural gas supply to manufacturing have played
a role as well. Also public spending (16 percent of real GDP) fell by about 2 percent in real terms
(Figure 2). Construction (about 7 percent of real GDP) declined much more sharply than expected, as
the result of financial difficulties of the largest homebuilding firms, uncertainty about the
government’s low-income housing policy, and slow execution of public spending on infrastructure.
Projected growth for 2013 assumes a strong rebound in the second semester, with manufacturing
recovering in response to a pick-up in U.S. manufacturing, and public spending regaining its lost
momentum. However, this projection assumes a gradual recovery in construction—where the
financial difficulties of large homebuilders could persist and impose a drag on the rest of the sector.
The storms that hit both coasts in September are expected to have only a modest effect on growth.
4.
The slack in the economy is helping to contain price pressures, with headline inflation
now projected at 3½ percent by the end of the year—somewhat above the target of 3
percent. Supply shocks had driven up food prices and pushed headline inflation above 4 percent
earlier this year. (Figure 3). However, since mid-year these pressures on food prices have subsided,
and core inflation has stayed at historical lows of 2½ percent y/y since July. Inflation in services—the
central bank’s preferred indicator of the strength of domestic demand—has been running at 2¼ to
2½ percent y/y since early 2013. Medium-term inflation expectations have remained firmly
anchored at 3½ percent—albeit still above the mid-point of the target range.
5.
Demand policies are supporting a recovery in growth. The public sector borrowing
requirement (PSBR) is expected to reach 4.1 percent of GDP this year, compared with 3.7 percent of
GDP in 2012 (Figure 4).1 This stance would imply a considerable fiscal stimulus in the second
semester, as the PSBR amounted to only 1.0 percent of GDP in the first semester. The central bank
has reduced its policy rate so far this year by a total of 100 basis points to 3.50 percent in response
to the widening of the negative output gap and in the absence of significant inflationary pressures.
6.
The external current account deficit is projected to widen to 1.7 percent of GDP in
2013 (Figure 5). The non-oil trade deficit would remain at 1 percent of GDP, while the oil trade
surplus would fall to 0.6 percent of GDP, reflecting weaker production and exports of oil. The Fund’s
current account model and a range of exchange rate metrics in the External Balance Assessment
(EBA) suggest that the current account balance and real exchange rate are broadly in line with
fundamentals and desirable policy settings (Annex).
7.
Mexico’s financial asset markets showed more resilience than many other emerging
markets after the Fed initiated its discussion of tapering on May 22. In this context, net capital
inflows are projected to remain steady at about 4 percent of GDP in 2013. Through April, investor
appetite for Mexican assets was underpinned by heightened prospects for further structural reforms,
as well as the ample global supply of liquidity, generating a strong appreciation of the peso and a

The 2012 outturn exceeds the 2012 PSBR projected at the time of the 2012 Article IV consultation (2.6 percent of
GDP), as expected net inflows to the oil stabilization funds failed to materialize, in the context of slightly weaker oil
prices and production, and higher energy subsidies reflecting higher imports.

In the second quarter, gross capital inflows, especially portfolio investment, from nonresidents fell sharply from a peak in the first quarter. Residents helped cushion the effects of this
shift by keeping more of their funds within Mexico, leading to a smaller decline in overall net capital
inflows. The recent delay in tapering announced by the Fed in mid-September has led to signs of a
recovery in capital inflows. In late September, the government placed a record 10-year bond of
US$3.9 billion at a spread of 135 basis points (Box 2). The central bank has refrained from any
foreign exchange market intervention this year, while the government shortened the duration of its
local debt issuance.

Box 1. Response of Foreign Exchange and Local Currency Bond Markets Post-May 22
Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke’s remarks on May 22, that asset purchases could be scaled back,
triggered a sharp re-pricing of risk across global markets. Market participants moved forward their
expectations about the onset of the tightening cycle, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury
rising by about 60 basis points by mid-June. After the June 18–19 U.S. monetary policy meeting, when the
Fed clarified that it could begin to trim asset purchases later in 2013, the 10-year yield on Treasury bonds
also rose sharply, reaching 2.7 percent by end-June. The Fed is now expected to begin to scale back the
Large Scale Asset Purchase program in the first quarter of 2014 and to start raising the target for the Federal
funds rate in early 2015.
Foreign Exchange Market
The peso initially depreciated sharply vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, but FX markets functioned in an
orderly manner. Between May 22 and June 21 (the height of market turbulence), the depreciation of the
peso and the increase in its volatility were among the highest in emerging markets. But the adjustment was
orderly and the foreign exchange market functioned well, as reflected in normal levels of bid-ask spreads
and no unusual movements in trading volumes. The Central Bank refrained from intervening in the foreign
exchange market or imposing restrictions on capital outflows. The level and implied volatility of the
exchange rate have fallen since, and the cumulative depreciation of the peso vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar was
6.6 percent through October.

Mexico’s deep and liquid FX markets may have contributed to the marked depreciation of the peso
during May-June. Emerging market countries with deeper financial markets may experience short-term
pressures on their assets as these are sold as financial proxies for others with less desirable fundamentals,
less liquid markets and/or capital account restrictions. The Mexican peso has become the single most traded
emerging market currency, is fully convertible and trades 24 hours daily. Thus, investors may have hedged
currency risk using the Mexican peso because it is deeper and more liquid than its peers in the region.

The bond market was characterized by a re-pricing—but not a selloff—of these securities. Between
May 22 and June 21, the yield on 10-year bond (Mbonos) rose by about 130 basis points, but by endOctober the Mbono yield had declined to 6.05 percent—an increase of about 100 basis points with respect
to May 21. During this period, the rates on short-term government securities (CETES) fell in line with the cuts
in the policy interest rate of 50 basis points, helping to steepen the slope of the yield curve on government
securities. The volatility of Mbono yields picked up and some signs of illiquidity surfaced. Market
participants reported that primary dealers had scaled back their willingness to make markets under all
conditions, leading to higher intraday price volatility and wider bid-ask spreads. Some participants related
this to a broad-based scaling back of risk-taking. Others pointed to regulatory changes that imposed higher
capital charges on holdings of government securities and the possible implementation of the Volcker rule.

Investors hedged their exposure to interest rate risk by shortening duration through interest rate
swaps, while offsetting currency risk in derivatives markets. The ability to hedge these risks helped keep
foreign holdings of government securities relatively stable. This stability also reflects the broadening of the
investor base that took place after Mexican sovereign debt was incorporated into Citigroup’s World
Government Bond Index in 2010.

9.
The banking system—which accounts for about 60 percent of financial system assets—
has remained resilient (Figure 6). The expansion in bank credit to the private sector has slowed
from about 15 percent in nominal terms in mid-2012 to 10 percent as of August 2013. As of July
2013, the system’s capital adequacy ratio stood at 15.6 percent, largely unchanged from a year ago.
Larger banks generally have more comfortable ratios, but even the smallest banks are well above
the new regulatory minimums adopted after the implementation of Basel III. However, NPLs have
increased to 4 percent of total loans in July 2013, from 3.1 percent at end-2012, although provisions
still amounted to 174 percent of NPLs. Pockets of vulnerability have been concentrated in the
construction sector—where the NPL ratio doubled to about 6 percent—and in some segments of
consumer lending, especially payroll lending.2 Housing prices have remained broadly stable in real
terms over the last year after picking up in late 2011–early 2012, suggesting the absence of a bubble
in this market. According to staff estimates, the growth slowdown in 2013 could raise the NPL ratio
by another 0.3 percentage points by end-year.
10.
Non-bank financial institutions hold about 40 percent of financial system assets, with
pension funds and mutual funds accounting for nearly two-thirds of that total. In recent years,
the growth rate of assets of pension and mutual funds has been higher than the one of banks and
both are under the authorities’ regulatory perimeter. The number of other unregulated entities
(especially Sofomes and Sofoles) is large, but after the global financial crisis, these entities now
account for a small share of financial system assets. The insurance sector is profitable, but has only
experienced moderate growth in recent years, despite strong competition and significant foreign
presence. Life insurance accounts for about 40 percent of the premiums and insurance companies
are often part of a financial group, which includes a commercial bank. Pension funds and insurance
companies have remained the most important institutional investors in domestic financial markets
(equities and bonds), and they have gradually diversified their holdings away from government
securities.

Though the rising NPLs to construction need to be monitored, banking sector credit to these firms represents only
around 9 percent of total credit. Most non-performing loans have been concentrated in the largest three homebuilders, and these are fully provisioned.

Box 2. Corporate Fund-Raising in Capital Markets
Mexican corporates’ access to capital market funding has remained firm in 2013, despite the new
signals about the pace of adjustment of U.S. monetary policy. Primary bond issuances (domestically and
abroad) and syndicated bank loans have remained high through October 2013, while equity issuances are
already at record levels.
Bond issuances and syndicated loans have held up after May 22, although on tougher terms. Mexican
firms issued bonds in the amount of US$9.0 billion between January 2013 and May 22, and US$13.6 billion
between May 22 and end-September. Syndicated loans rose from US$3.4 billion during the first period to
US$14 billion in the second. Average yield to maturity on domestic currency issuances increased from
5.7 percent to 7.3 percent over

Compared to other countries in the region, Mexican capital markets have been relatively unscathed
by market uncertainty. The total value of bond issuances and syndicated loans in the four comparator Latin
American countries has dropped significantly in the post-May 22 period. In addition to issuing less, firms in

OUTLOOK AND POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Structural Reforms Can Transform the Medium Term Outlook
11.
The ambitious structural reforms will most likely stimulate faster growth over the
medium term (Box 3). Over the past 20 years, real GDP growth has averaged about 2¾ percent a
year, with virtually no growth in total factor productivity. If implemented properly, the reforms can
have far-reaching effects on the economy. With the prospect of structural changes in many areas—
such as higher production of hydrocarbons, increased competition (especially in
telecommunications), financial deepening and enhanced labor market flexibility—potential output
growth could increase through more investment, more employment in the formal sector and gains
in total factor productivity.

12.
With these considerations in mind, staff raised its estimate of growth over the medium
term. Real GDP is projected to rise by 3.0 percent in 2014, as demand policies as well as faster
growth in the U.S. (especially in manufacturing) support the recovery in Mexico. As for the medium
term, it will probably take several years to see the full effect of the reforms, since investors would
probably wait for the adoption of all secondary regulations and clarity on the new rules of the game
before undertaking major projects. For 2015–2018, staff projects that real GDP would grow by 3½ to
4 percent a year, faster than the previous estimate of potential growth of 3–3¼ percent, while
inflation would remain in line with the central bank’s target. With this growth projection, staff
estimates that the output gap would not close until 2016.
13.
The authorities believed that the reforms would have a more profound effect on
growth. In their view, the reforms would boost growth to the range of 4 to 5 percent a year. It was
agreed that conservative estimates of the effects of the reforms on growth at this stage would help
guard against overly optimistic policies, since the effects are difficult to measure at the beginning of
this potentially transformative process. The authorities emphasized the synergies that could come
from such a wide range of reforms at the same time, and saw the reforms as a source of upside risk
to the outlook. As the effects of the structural reforms take hold, the authorities stressed they would
act to prevent any overheating that might arise from a surge in investment.

Pacto por México. When this government took office in December 2012, it signed an agreement with the
two main opposition parties to promote political cooperation on structural reforms to strengthen
competitiveness, growth and job creation. By end-2013, it is expected that congress will have approved over
a half dozen major reforms that have been on the country’s agenda for some time. The key reforms include:

Energy reform (approval pending). This proposal opens the door for more private sector
participation in the hydrocarbons and electricity sectors. It would modify Article 27 of the constitution by
removing the ban on risk-sharing contracts in the hydrocarbons sector and broaden the scope for contracts
with private firms in the electricity sector, while retaining the ban on concessions in both sectors. The
constitution would still say that Mexico’s hydrocarbon resources belong to the Mexican people. It would also
alter Article 28 by removing the state’s monopoly in upstream and downstream operations in hydrocarbons
and in electricity. Once these amendments are approved, the government would submit the secondary laws
essential to implement the reform. Critical issues to be decided include the nature of the contracts, the fiscal
regime for hydrocarbons, and the legal framework for an independent operator in electricity transmission.

Fiscal reform (tax reform approved in October 2013, amendments to the Fiscal Responsibility
Law (FRL) in reconciliation). Amendments to the FRL will require the government to commit to a target for
the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) consistent with a desired path for public debt, and limit
current spending growth—net of pensions, interest payments, fuel costs of the state electricity company and
revenue sharing—which will help curb the bias towards procyclical spending. Congress has approved a tax
reform to boost tax revenues by 2.0 percent of GDP by 2018. Steps are also taken to strengthen collection of
sub-national taxes and transparency in intra-governmental revenue sharing. PEMEX’s fiscal regime will also
be modified for all upcoming hydrocarbon contracts to replace some taxation by dividends. Finally, the
reform expands the social safety net through the introduction of a universal pension and unemployment
insurance.

Financial sector reform (approved by Chamber of Deputies in September 2013; Senate
approval pending). The reform would foster greater competition in the financial sector by, inter alia,
granting more flexibility to development banks to extend credit within a sound prudential framework and
improving the system of loan guarantees and collateral—including by streamlining dispute resolution
through the creation of specialized business courts. The reform also includes steps to address several
recommendations of the 2011 FSAP. It proposes to strengthen regulatory powers, enhance consumer
protection, and establish consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates. It would also formalize Basel
III rules, especially to set up a countercyclical capital buffer and phase in the new liquidity standards. Finally,
more technical aspects of the reform include steps to strengthen bank resolution procedures and give the
National Banking and Securities Commission more control over its salaries.

Education reform (approved in September 2013). This reform aims to bring the quality of
education in Mexico closer to the standards in other OECD countries. One of the key changes in the
education reform is to create a professional system for evaluating, hiring, assigning and promoting teachers,
while reducing labor unions’ interference in access to teaching positions. Enhancing the quality of education
would, among other things, reduce the skills gap and help integrate a greater share of the labor force into
the formal sector.

Telecommunications reform (approved in mid-2013). The reform includes three important
measures to promote competition in this sector to provide broader and cheaper access to
telecommunications. First, it allows for more foreign ownership of companies in segments of the telecom
sector including satellite communications—up from 49 percent under current legislation. Second, it creates a
new regulatory body which will have the power to grant and revoke telecommunications and broadcast
concessions, including the ability to force break-ups or asset sales to eliminate anti-competitive effects.
Third, by removing barriers to effective enforcement and resolution of disputes, the reform seeks to address
the common practice of large firms to delay enforcement of administrative orders through injunctions.

12

MEXICO

Box 3. Structural Reforms (Concluded)

Labor reform (approved in late 2012). This reform has three critical measures. First, to lower the
cost of hiring workers and boost formal employment, the law introduces new contractual modalities,
including flexible labor contracts. Second, to provide judicial certainty and reduce separation costs, the
legislation streamlines the settlement of labor lawsuits and caps compensation for unjustified dismissals.
Finally, to improve labor organization within firms, productivity and labor skills will take precedence over
seniority as the main criteria for promotion and filling vacancies, which should increase incentives to invest
in human capital.

Governance and Transparency reforms (pending). The federal government will create a National
Anti-Corruption Commission. Also, the Federal Institute for Access to Public Information and Data Protection
will be given greater autonomy and its powers will be expanded. The key element of the security reform in
the Pact involves the creation of a national gendarmerie.

14.
The reforms would most likely affect the balance of payments by generating a surge in
foreign direct investment and imports followed by an expansion of exports. Staff prepared an
illustrative scenario with a rise in the external current account deficit to about 2 percent of GDP in
2015–16, assuming that foreign direct investment rises to 1½–2 percent of GDP a year over the
medium term, compared with less than 1 percent of GDP in recent years (Table 3). These
investments would lead to an oil trade surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP by 2018, compared with
balance in a no-reform scenario. In this scenario, net international reserves would rise from
US$167 billion at end-2012 to US$223 billion by end-2018, which would allow the central bank to
broadly keep the reserve coverage ratio constant in terms of portfolio investment.

Global Economy Still Main Source of Downside Risks
15.
While Mexico’s close ties to the global economy confer important benefits, the
authorities stressed that Mexico’s economy remains vulnerable to near-term risks from the
global economy. The most prominent risk arises from the expected shift towards a less
accommodative monetary policy in the U.S. The transition is likely to proceed smoothly, but tail risk
scenarios could be triggered by a faster-than-expected tightening of financial conditions in the U.S.
In this event, the effect of tighter U.S. financial conditions would depend on whether these were
associated with faster U.S. growth, which would boost Mexico’s growth. Other risks could arise from
a slowdown in EMs or a reemergence of financial distress in Europe. The staff noted that financial
stress in the euro area could re-emerge as a result of stalled or incomplete delivery of policy
commitments at the national or euro area level, a negative assessment of the asset quality review
combined with insufficient backstops, or adverse developments in some peripheral countries.
Disappointing activity in EMs—or a deeper than expected slowdown in China—would also bring
about a reassessment that trend growth will be lower as a result of weaker than expected productive
capacity and human capital. The effects of these scenarios would most likely operate through
portfolio capital flows, as a reassessment of the risk premia in EMs could trigger a pullback from
emerging market assets. There would also be some effect on exports, if global growth slowed as a
result of these shocks. The transmission of these shocks would probably not come directly through
the banking system, which is funded largely through local retail deposits and has a subsidiary
structure for the foreign-owned banks.

16.
The authorities agreed that these contagion scenarios are risky for countries like
Mexico, especially given its high integration with international capital markets. The authorities
emphasized that the best policy response in the event these risks materialize would be to maintain
the strong policy framework—including an open capital account and reliance on exchange rate
flexibility as a key policy buffer—and credibility in the central bank’s inflation targeting regime by
keeping inflation expectations strongly anchored.

Stronger Fiscal Framework
17.
The recently approved fiscal reform is designed to build on the strengths of the
previous fiscal framework. Previously, the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) set a balanced budget
target excluding investment by PEMEX, the state oil company (i.e., a ‘traditional deficit’ of about
2 percent of GDP a year), with escape clauses to allow fiscal stimulus in periods of economic
downturn. A complex network of four oil stabilization funds was designed to handle savings from oil
price windfalls (when actual oil prices exceeded the budget price). The public sector borrowing
requirement (PSBR), however, was usually larger than the traditional deficit, since draw-downs from
oil stabilization funds and other financing (‘non-recurrent revenues’) were used to pay for spending
overruns during the year. Overall, this system provided a good balance between a numerical fiscal
rule and discretion, with the PSBR declining from 5.1 percent of GDP in 2009 to 3.7 percent of GDP
in 2012. However, it created non-transparent incentives to under-budget, and for the PSBR path to
diverge from the traditional deficit.3 Moreover, the oil stabilization funds have been virtually
depleted after helping to finance countercyclical fiscal policy in the aftermath of the collapse of
Lehman. Both the traditional deficit target and the PSBR tend to support expenditure procylicality,
since they allow spending to rise in periods of higher revenues.
18.
The new framework provides for a more transparent and effective fiscal anchor and
limits spending procyclicality. The FRL has been amended to make the PSBR an explicit fiscal
target in addition to the traditional measure of the deficit. The annual budget documents must
include 5-year projections for the PSBR consistent with a sustainable debt path, as well as specific
annual numerical targets. This step will enhance fiscal transparency and provide a closer link
between fiscal policy and the evolution of public debt and domestic demand. The amended FRL
requires the government to set a cap on real expenditure growth, which will help contain spending
especially during periods of revenue windfalls. The cap will apply to Structural Current Spending
(SCS)—defined as current primary expenditure including transfers to state and local governments
for capital but excluding those outlays governed by automatic rules (pensions, subsidies for
electricity, and subnational revenue-sharing). Staff suggested that a cap covering all primary
spending would reduce incentives for reclassifying outlays to avoid the cap on SCS, but the
authorities see little scope to cap public investment. The new FRL retains the current structure of the
four oil stabilization funds. Staff noted that the rules governing these stabilization funds are
exceedingly complex and still allow use of excess revenues to cover unexpected increases in
3

spending or shortfalls in other revenues. It would be important to simplify these funds to create
more scope to save oil revenue windfalls.
19.
Congress also approved a tax reform that moderately raised non-oil tax revenue and
phased out subsidies on domestic sales of gasoline to try to reduce the dependence on oil
revenues. Key tax measures include the extension of the 16 percent value-added tax to firms in
border regions and an increase in income tax by broadening the tax base and applying higher tax
rates to high income earners. The reform also includes an 8 percent ‘junk food’ tax and a mining tax.
The domestic gasoline subsidy is to be phased out by end-2014. Afterwards the domestic gasoline
price will rise with domestic inflation and the government will raise the domestic price further in line
with increases in international gasoline prices to prevent the reemergence of the subsidy. The staff
noted that the projected revenue yield of the tax reform, while realistic, is subject to risks. This
makes the link between domestic and international gasoline prices all the more important to ensure
that fuel subsidies are phased out permanently. Staff also commented that the tax reform will lead
only to a modest increase in non-oil tax revenues, and further reform may be required in a few years
to continue to reduce dependence on oil revenue. The fiscal regime for the state oil company
(PEMEX) is to be updated in the context of the energy reform.
20.
In the context of this new framework, the government defined a path for the PSBR
through 2018. Initially the government intends to keep the PSBR at 4.1 percent of GDP in 2014 to
avoid a fiscal contraction while the economy is operating well below capacity. The target reflects
more transparent spending provisions to preclude under-budgeting, and incorporates spending that
is based on a conservative assumption for the price of Mexico’s exports of oil.4 In its fiscal plan sent
to congress in September 2013, the government announced its medium-term fiscal path, which
stated the intention to reduce the PSBR to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2017—a medium-term anchor that
would gradually reduce public debt in relation to GDP. The energy reform—which is expected to
increase oil production from 2.5 million barrels per day (mbpd) to 3.0 mbpd by 2018—and the
elimination of gasoline subsidies are expected to generate a moderate boost in oil revenues as a
share of GDP, compared with constant production and declining oil revenues in a no-reform
scenario. The tax reform would raise non-oil tax revenues from 10.0 percent of GDP in 2013 to
10.6 percent by 2017–18. Total expenditures would initially rise from 25.2 percent of GDP in 2013 to
26.4 percent in 2014, reflecting partly adjustments to avoid under-budgeting but also higher public
investment and the cost associated with reforms such as the universal pension and unemployment
insurance. As spending caps become effective and electricity costs are contained, expenditures
would decline to 25.0 percent of GDP by 2018.
21.
This fiscal path implies an increase in public debt from 44 percent of GDP at end-2012
to 47 percent by 2016, with a decline to 46 percent by 2018. The different DSA scenarios suggest
that Mexico’s public and total external gross debt levels are sustainable over the medium term, even

The budget is based on an export price of US$85 per barrel for Mexico’s oil mix, which is below the staff projection
of US$98 per barrel.

under the most extreme shocks. In addition, the adjustment of the cyclically-adjusted primary
balance in line with the authorities’ medium term plan does not provide warning signals of being
unsustainable, considering pre-2009 Mexican data or the distribution of cross-country evidence on
recent fiscal adjustments. The broad institutional coverage of Mexico’s public debt, which includes
development banks and other key public entities such as PEMEX provide reassurance that gross
public sector liabilities are well captured in the assessment. Given Mexico’s favorable currency and
maturity debt structure, moreover, the pass-through of interest rates or exchange rate shocks are
relatively small, and thus the risks to the budget associated with these shocks appear to be low over
the projection period. The new FRL also includes important steps to strengthen the finances of
subnational governments by limiting their ability to take on debt and enhancing reporting
requirements.
22.
Staff endorsed the new fiscal framework, noting that it would allow for more effective
control of fiscal policy. While a somewhat tighter fiscal stance in 2014 would be preferable, staff
accepted that it would not be advisable to initiate fiscal tightening when the economy will be
operating below capacity. It also noted that spending in 2014 was based on a conservative
projection for the world price of oil, which could yield opportunities to achieve a somewhat lower
PSBR. Staff emphasized the importance of the government’s articulation of plans to carefully
manage spending and revenues over the next three to four years to entrench confidence that the
medium-term target for the PSBR can be reached.
23.
In this context, the new FRL will include transitory articles that lock in key elements of
fiscal policy through 2017. These transitory articles set ambitious targets to control current
spending. The transitory provisions establish that SCS cannot grow faster than 2 percent in real
terms—about half of the projected growth in 2014 and lower than the 5 percent real growth during
2006–2013—relative to the budget approved in the previous year. This ceiling will apply to spending
execution throughout the year, aiming at providing more control over the planning and execution of
the budget. The 5-year fiscal projections indicate that these spending caps are consistent with
reducing the PSBR to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2017.
24.
The authorities emphasized that other legal provisions will secure compliance with the
spending targets. In particular, they noted that these provisions will focus on:


Curbing under-budgeting practices. The amendments to the FRL will establish binding constraints
on the real growth in expenditure ceilings not only during the budget process, but also during
execution stage. This should eliminate incentives to under-budget.



Setting medium term spending goals for specific categories. The government will publish detailed
expenditure policy guidelines (PRONAFIDE)5 for 2014–2018 that include annual goals and limits
for specific budget categories that are consistent with the 2 percent annual growth rate limit on
SCS. The real growth in the wage bill will be limited to 2.4 percent a year, implying a decline in

wages in relation to GDP. This policy will be supported by centralization of the education payroll
at the federal level to improve control over teachers’ wages and the opening of new teaching
positions. It will also simplify the transition to performance based payment schemes adopted in
the education reform. Real growth in subsidies will not exceed 2.6 percent a year, while transfers
for capital expenditure by state and local governments will be held constant in real terms after
2014. Purchases of goods and services are to rise by 0.5 percent a year in real terms. The federal
government will centralize procurement of health supplies to reduce these costs and enhance
inventory controls.


Pacing investment. PRONAFIDE will also establish a detailed capital expenditure schedule
consistent with the medium-term path for the PSBR. This schedule would build in a significant
decline in non-PEMEX investment in relation to GDP. However, there may be greater scope for
non-PEMEX investment by 2017–18, as the energy reform gains momentum and allows for more
investment by private firms and less by PEMEX in hydrocarbons.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy Well-Positioned to Manage Risks
25.
The central bank reaffirmed its commitment to adjust the policy rate as necessary to
keep annual inflation close to the 3 percent inflation target. It will also continue to rely on
exchange rate flexibility to help the economy adapt to shifts in global economic conditions. Staff
simulations suggest that—with the output gap projected to close very slowly—the current stance of
monetary policy is broadly consistent with keeping inflation close to the target. The authorities
noted that there was only limited room for further monetary easing, given the stance of fiscal policy
as well as the fact that the policy interest rate was only slightly positive in real terms. The staff and
authorities agreed that exchange rate flexibility would continue to work well as a shock absorber.
Despite recent spikes in exchange rate volatility, there have been no balance-sheet or pass-through
effects from the exchange rate adjustments.
26.
The authorities stated that there are no plans to modify the mechanism for the
acquisition of reserves from PEMEX’s net trade balance. The current mechanism implies that the
increase in international reserves will broadly maintain most coverage ratios at similar levels, except
for a notable increase in the coverage of short-term debt. International reserves are adequate
relative to some standard metrics, but coverage is lower for broad money and foreign portfolio
liabilities (Annex). As of end-2012, reserves were at the lower end of the 100 to 150 percent desired
coverage of the Assessing Reserve Adequacy (ARA) metric. Reserve coverage of imports, imports
plus interest payments, and short-term debt at residual maturities were also above recommended
levels at 4.5 months, 4.9 months, and 209 percent, respectively. However, coverage of broad money
and foreign portfolio liabilities were lower at 19 and 39 percent, respectively.
27.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the strong credibility of the inflation targeting
framework would help Mexico navigate through unsettled global economic conditions.
Developments in the U.S. economy are the main source of risk for Mexico, given the close links
between these two countries. The authorities anticipate that the U.S. Fed will smoothly manage the

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO

transition to a less accommodative monetary stance. However, the authorities recognized that tail
risks could arise from the normalization of U.S. monetary policy, since there is no precedent for
unwinding such a large balance sheet. There is also the tail risk that, in the next round, the debt limit
in the U.S. might not be dealt with in a timely manner.
28.
The authorities were confident that they had the contingency plans—many tested in
the Lehman crisis—to manage these tail risks. They noted that the Fund’s support through the
FCL was an extremely important safeguard and was an integral part of these plans. In this context, it
was agreed that exchange rate flexibility will continue to play an important buffering role in the face
of shocks. There was also agreement that handling tail risks would also call for continued careful
public debt management, especially if investors seek to reduce duration risk in their sovereign debt
portfolio. In an orderly tapering scenario, a more rapid rise than expected in the yield on 10-year U.S
treasuries could be associated with faster growth in the U.S., which could lead to faster growth in
Mexico and might require a hike in the policy interest rate, depending on domestic economic
conditions (Box 4). However, other scenarios could involve higher yields on 10-year U.S. treasuries
and slower growth in the U.S., which might provide scope for a lower policy interest rate in Mexico,
since the strong credibility of monetary policy would keep inflation expectations well anchored.

Box 4. Spillover Effects of the Shift to a Less Accommodative Monetary Policy in the U.S.
The expected transition in U.S. monetary policy towards a more normal stance will affect the Mexican
economy through several channels. In the early stages of the process of normalization, the yield curve in
the U.S. will most likely steepen, as the trimming of asset purchases pushes up yields on longer term rates,
including on 10-year U.S. treasuries, while the Federal Funds rate stays constant. This trend will drive up
long-term interest rates in Mexico, which would tend to curtail investment and growth. However, growth
and investment in Mexico would be encouraged by the expected recovery in the U.S. economy which is
leading to the transition in monetary policy. To assess these effects, staff estimated several models. First it
estimated a model of the yield on 10-year Mbonos. It also developed a small open economy
macroeconomic model for Mexico to analyze the effects of tighter financial conditions as well as faster
growth in the U.S.

Effects on Mbono yields
Staff estimates suggest that changes in US Treasury yields have a significant short-term impact on
local Mexican bond yields. A vector error correction model (VECM) was estimated to examine the
relationship between yields on 10-year Mexican local currency sovereign yield and the domestic overnight
interest rate, the 10-year U.S. government bond yield, a measure of global risk aversion, exchange rate risk
and idiosyncratic sovereign credit risk. A one-standard deviation impulse to U.S. rates (about 10 basis points)
translates into a 6.2 basis point response after two weeks, and peaks at 12.8 basis points (a conditional passthrough of nearly 1.3) after two months.

The model suggests that the reaction of yields on 10-year Mbonos after May 22 was in line with
changes in fundamentals, with no evidence of overshooting. By end-April 2013 Mexican rates were
significantly below their level implied by fundamentals: indeed, the actual yield was almost 70 basis points
below the predicted value from the VECM. Starting in early May, Mexican bond prices reversed the rally and
yields started rising, based on early signs of improvement to the U.S. economy. After May 22, the actual and
model-implied fundamental values of the local sovereign yield moved in lock-step, suggesting that the
yields on 10-year Mbonos are broadly in line with trends in the explanatory variables. The results also
suggest that Mexican interest rates could rise sharply if Mexico faces further bouts of market volatility
caused by shift in expectations or surprises about U.S. monetary policy.

Box 4. Spillover Effects of the Shift to a Less Accommodative Monetary Policy in the U.S.
(Concluded)
Small open economy macroeconomic model
Building on the IMF’s Global Projection Model (GPM), we developed a small open-economy model
for Mexico to discuss policy responses to faster than anticipated tapering in the U.S. In the baseline
scenario, the current stance of monetary policy is broadly consistent with keeping inflation close to the
target. This baseline assumes no change in the U.S. Federal Funds rate, a rise in the yield on 10-year U.S.
treasuries to 3.25 percent by end-2014 and real GDP growth in the U.S. of 2.6 percent in 2014. A simulation
using the GPM for Mexico suggests that, after a negative output gap emerged in the second quarter, the
central bank could hold the policy rate broadly at its current level while continuing to allow the exchange
rate to move in line with market forces.
An alternate scenario considers an orderly faster pace of unwinding of quantitative easing associated
with a faster-than-expected U.S. recovery. In a GPM simulation that assumes a 1 percent faster rate of
growth in the U.S for one year, growth in Mexico would be higher by about ¾ of a percentage point and the
results suggest that a moderate increase in the policy rate might be required to keep inflation on target.
In a disorderly unwinding scenario where the yield on 10-year U.S. treasuries rises but without faster
growth in the U.S., the credibility of monetary policy is critical. In this scenario, financial conditions in
Mexico would tighten and lead to slower growth. If inflation expectations remain well anchored, the central
bank could have scope to reduce its policy rate somewhat. However, the central bank would have to pay
close attention to developments in the foreign exchange market, and may find it necessary to use the policy
interest rate to help preserve orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market.

In either scenario, the strength of bank balance sheets and sound financial regulations should help
mitigate banking sector risks. The rise in yields on government securities would most likely raise lending
interest rates, which could impair credit quality. As reported in the 2012 Financial Sector Stability Assessment
(FSSA) and the most recent Financial Stability Report of the Bank of Mexico, market risk is manageable and
banks’ balance sheets can withstand increases in government bond yields However, the rise in interest rates
would affect asset quality, with the staff’s credit risk model suggesting that a 100 basis point rise in
borrowing costs would raise the NPL ratio by 70 basis points, concentrated mainly in consumer credit.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

MEXICO

Financial Sector Remains Resilient
29.
The authorities commented that the banking system remained sound, with sufficient
cushions to handle the recent increase in NPLs and market volatility. They added that
supervision is strong and risks are closely monitored, as indicated by the findings of the standards
assessments of the 2011 FSAP Update. The recent deterioration in asset quality in the construction
sector was explained almost entirely by the financial difficulties of the three large homebuilding
firms, which had taken on too much leverage to purchase assets of low value. They estimated that
banks’ capital can easily withstand any loan losses in this sector, partly because a significant share of
the loans to the large homebuilders had been provisioned. The authorities emphasized that the
government would not bail out these firms to avoid creating moral hazard. The authorities noted the
recent steps to clarify the government’s low-income housing policy, which should encourage a
recovery in construction next year.6 The authorities believed that credit risk in other sectors was
under control, although NPLs in payroll and other personal loans still needed to be reduced further.
The new FRL includes provisions to constrain the ability of state and local governments to take on
debt, which will help contain credit risk to this sector.7 The authorities noted that the process of
adopting expected loan loss provisioning for commercial loans would be completed by end-2013,
and their estimates suggested that this shift in methodology would not lead to an increase in overall
provisioning levels. The recent increase in yields on local currency government securities has had
very small effects on bank capital, consistent with the findings of the authorities’ stress tests and
those of the FSAP that the banking system is quite resilient to market risk.
30.
The financial sector reform is expected to increase intermediation, promote
competition and enhance financial stability. The reform would encourage access to credit
through several channels. It streamlines the bankruptcy process and eases the legal hurdles for
banks to repossess collateral in case of delinquency and default, including through the creation of
specialized courts. It also establishes a centralized bureau for credit information. The authorities
noted that competition in the banking sector was weak, and highlighted the measures aimed at
promoting the portability of banking services, including housing loans, to promote competition. The
financial sector reform would also include steps to address several recommendations of the 2011
FSAP, including strengthening regulatory powers and the bank resolution framework (Box 5). It
would also strengthen supervision of financial conglomerates by allowing supervisors to obtain
information and regulate the non-financial firms that are part of mixed conglomerates. The reform
also strengthens oversight of Sofomes by requiring them to report information to credit bureaus,
register with the consumer protection agency and comply with AML standards. Staff urged the
authorities to remain vigilant that the enhanced role of development banks does not interfere with

In the view of the authorities, the previous strategy for low-income housing had created the wrong incentives,
fostering residential construction too far from the urban centers where most people work and undermining the
demand for this type of housing. In response, the government is developing a new subsidy policy that will focus on
construction of apartments closer to urban centers starting in 2014.

the commercial banks’ attempts to increase intermediation. It also encouraged the authorities to
ensure that the CNBV’s new powers to enforce investment guidelines for banks—aimed at boosting
credit—be exercised judiciously. Finally the supervisory authorities should enhance their monitoring
of indebtedness and balance sheet exposures in the economy, including through the development
of comprehensive data on balance sheets on corporates and households.
31.
The authorities noted that the effects of international financial regulatory reforms on
Mexico’s financial system have been manageable. They noted that all the foreign banks
operating in Mexico were subsidiaries and were subject to macroprudential limits on transactions
with their parent banks. In the recent post-May 22 market turbulence episode, primary dealers were
less willing to act as market makers for government securities under all conditions. However, the
authorities were uncertain whether this reflected a preference for less risk taking by those banks or
the effects of reforms, such as higher capital risk weights on holdings of Mexican government
securities or the prospect of the implementation of the Volcker rule. They also commented that the
new framework for regulation of derivatives traded over the counter might have a significant effect
on the trading volume of this kind of activity in Mexico.
32.
Mexico has adopted many legislative and institutional measures to strengthen its
AML/CFT framework in line with recommendations and specific observations of the 2008
Mutual Evaluation Report. While most issues have already been addressed, the authorities have
noted that they remain committed to adopting all recommendations. Most recently, the government
has submitted reforms to Congress to bring the legal framework for criminalization of money
laundering and financing of terrorism fully in line with international standards. The government has
also been more aggressive in prosecuting money laundering activities. The Financial Intelligence
Unit has been strengthened to obtain more and better information from financial institutions and
designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs); and will be issuing guidelines to all
reporting entities to freeze the funds of those persons suspected of money laundering or financing
of terrorism.

Box 5. FSAP Recommendations and Financial Sector Reform
Mexico’s FSAP update was discussed by the Executive Board in December 2011. The main recommendations
of the report were the following:

Address high levels of concentration risk. The CNBV should have more legal powers to regulate
financial groups. Prudential and risk management standards should apply fully to holding companies and
financial conglomerates. A swift implementation of Pillar 2 of Basel II, including the introduction of capital
charges for concentration risk and buffers above the regulatory minimum capital levels, should be
considered. These improvements in regulation and supervision will require amendments to laws and are
partly under consideration in the new financial reform bill.

Improve the financial safety network. Several measures are needed to strengthen deposit
insurance, including establishing a program to address the situation of credit cooperatives, transfer legacy
debt of deposit insurance fund to the government, and set up emergency funding with government
guarantee.

Enhance competition. As in the case of financial safety nets, several measures are needed to
improve competition, including review the current structure of retail banking fees, enhance consumer
financial protection, change regulatory framework for pension funds to increase focus on long-term returns,
and promote more contestability and access to financial services. Despite the authorities’ efforts to increase
the number of banks in operation, the sector remains concentrated.

Increase autonomy of supervisors. The FSAP update highlighted the need for more operational
autonomy of key financial supervisory agents (CNBV and CNSF), ranging from more latitude on internal
staffing decisions to increased independence by appointing a fixed-term management team. Reducing
overlapping of responsibilities should remain a medium term goal.
The government’s financial sector reform bill has been approved in the Chamber of Deputies and is
currently under consideration by the Senate. The financial reform is largely uncontroversial and is aimed
at addressing longstanding issues that have limited financial inclusion. On the other hand, concentration risk
remains largely unaddressed by the financial reform, and the CNBV would be given powers to establish
benchmarks to increase bank lending to the private sector, which could create distortions in credit allocation
if not applied judiciously. The reform addresses the main FSAP recommendations outlined above, including
by:

Fostering greater competition in the financial sector; this would be achieved by, inter alia,
strengthening development banks and improving the system of loan guarantees and collateral (including
streamlining the bankruptcy procedures). The latter goal would be achieved by streamlining the bankruptcy
process and easing the legal hurdles for banks to repossess collateral through the creation of specialized
courts. Competition would also be enhanced by allowing bank clients to switch banks with very low
transactions costs.

Strengthening regulatory powers and enhancing consumer protection; increased portability of
banking services is also expected to improve consumer protection.

Formalizing Basel III rules (recently adopted in early 2013) into the domestic regulatory and
supervisory frameworks.


Strengthening supervision of mixed conglomerates.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Mexico’s resilience to the recent volatility in global financial markets attests to the
confidence in its sound and predictable management of economic policies. The strong
institutional framework for policies provides assurances of the country’s commitment to
macroeconomic stability, regardless of changes in government. Exchange rate flexibility plays an
important role in helping the economy adjust to shifting global conditions, and the commitment to
open current and capital accounts gives investors confidence that the rules of the game are stable.
With this policy framework, the external current account balance and the real effective exchange
rate are in line with economic fundamentals and desired policy settings.
34.
Mexico is closely linked to the global economy, especially the U.S., heightening its
exposure to external risks. Higher interest rates in advanced economies will potentially be
associated with a reversal of capital flows and a sustained increase in risk premiums across EMs,
which in turn may trigger an intensification of liquidity strains on sovereigns and leveraged
corporations. Moreover, in the case of Mexico, the impact of policy uncertainty in the U.S. may not
only have a financial impact as in other EMs, but also a significant impact on economic activity if the
U.S. economy decelerates.
35.
The progress in advancing so many far-reaching structural reforms is impressive and
signals Mexico’s commitment to address deep-rooted impediments to growth. Few, if any,
other countries are undertaking such a broad agenda of transformative structural reforms, especially
in the context of a broad coalition of major political parties. Laws have already been approved to
upgrade public education, make labor markets more flexible, foster competition in
telecommunications, and strengthen the fiscal policy framework. Currently under discussion are
reforms to the energy and the financial sectors. These reforms are a source of optimism and upside
risk to the growth outlook over the next 5 to 10 years. Of course, there is still uncertainty about the
precise effects on growth, and it will be crucial to quickly approve all the secondary legislation and
regulations associated with the reforms to provide a clear landscape for investors.
36.
While the previous fiscal framework had worked well, the fiscal reform has put in
place a more comprehensive medium-term fiscal framework. Fiscal policy will have a more
effective anchor with a target on the PSBR that is consistent with a sustainable path for public debt.
The bias towards procyclical spending will be diminished by the cap on real growth of current
structural spending. While it would have been preferable to cap the real growth of all primary
spending, the political concerns about limiting investment are understandable, and the current
approach still represents an advance. The fiscal reform missed an opportunity to simplify the
operations of the oil stabilization funds to transform them into a more effective vehicle for saving oil
revenue windfalls. The tax reform includes important steps to enhance the efficiency of the tax
system and will help bolster non-oil revenues. However, the increase in non-oil tax revenue is
limited, which points to the need for another eventual round of reform. In this regard, it will be
essential to preserve the gains coming from the elimination of the subsidy on domestic gasoline
prices.

Staff supports the government’s proposed medium term path for the PSBR. While staff
would have preferred a somewhat tighter fiscal stance in 2014, staff agrees that it is not be advisable
to initiate fiscal tightening while the economy is still operating below capacity. Moreover, the
government is putting in place a more transparent approach to presenting expenditures in the
budget, which means that actual outturn for the PSBR should be much more in line with the one
presented in the budget. The government is also allowing for some spending related to structural
reforms, including the universal pension and unemployment insurance. Staff notes that spending in
2014 is based on a conservative projection for the world price of oil, and urges the authorities to
avoid raising spending in the event these prices turn out higher than expected. Importantly, the
government has announced that it intends to reduce the PSBR to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2017, and
consistent with this commitment, congress has approved several key legal provisions that establish
binding caps on the real growth in current structural spending in 2015–2016. It is also important to
add that Mexico’s public debt would remain on a sustainable path, even under extreme shocks.
Nonetheless, it will be essential to avoid any slippages in meeting these targets for the PSBR.
38.
The central bank’s track record in keeping inflation on target and letting the exchange
rate respond to market forces has entrenched the credibility of its policies. Staff supports the
current stance of monetary policy in view of the slack in the economy. Going forward, monetary and
exchange rate policy are well-positioned to manage tail risks from the global economy, especially
those that could arise as the U.S. moves to a less accommodative monetary policy and negotiates
the next increase in the limit on debt of the federal government. The FCL arrangement continues to
serve as a complement to reserves in the event that global tail risks materialize.
39.
The financial sector remains sound, and the recent reform should promote
competition and enhance access to the financial system. The financial sector reform is widely
expected to foster competition and increase financial inclusion, while at the same time
strengthening the regulatory powers of regulators and enhancing consumer protection. The
supervision of financial conglomerates is also expected to be bolstered, but concentration risk
remains largely unaddressed. The new CNBV powers to establish bank-specific benchmarks to
increase lending to non-financial firms and households should be exercised judiciously.
40.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Mexico will take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Annex. External Sector Assessment1
Mexico’s current account deficit and exchange rate level appear broadly in line with
fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The country’s floating exchange rate has been a
key shock absorber in the context of a volatile external environment. Despite the rise in
market tensions in May/June 2013, authorities refrained from reactivating rule-based
intervention in the foreign exchange market. Foreign investment in peso-denominated
government debt remained at record high levels, even as yields increased. Reserve
accumulation (from PEMEX’s foreign exchange balance) has allowed Mexico to maintain
adequate reserve buffers. However, the large stock of foreign portfolio investment can pose
risk in an unsettled external environment. In this context, Mexico’s FCL arrangement is an
important complement to reserve buffers against global tail risks.

Current Account
1.

Mexico’s current account (CA) deficit has remained relatively stable at about 1 percent of

GDP in 2012, similar to 2011. The oil CA surplus narrowed, as petroleum-related exports declined
somewhat. This was offset by a narrower non-oil CA deficit, driven by robust merchandise exports
particularly in vehicle and parts-related exports to
the U.S. Mexico is highly integrated into the U.S.
manufacturing supply chain. Remittance inflows,
particularly from the U.S., remained large and
steady, but this was more than offset by the net
factor income deficit (driven primarily by interest
payments to foreign holders of Mexican debt)
and the non-factor services deficit. The external
balance assessment (EBA) results suggest that the

cyclically-adjusted balance is about 1 percentage point of GDP narrower than the model’s CA norm.
Comparing the 2013 projection for the CA deficit, which is slightly wider than in 2012, suggests that the
gap between the model and the projection is narrower than 1 percent of GDP.
2.

Over the medium term, the current account deficit is expected to widen modestly to

between one and a half and two percent of GDP. The widening is largely attributed to larger

the 2012 Article IV staff report.

factor income deficit, as foreign holding of Mexican portfolio and direct investments increase. We
project a deterioration in the oil trade balance, which will somewhat offset by modest improvements in
the non-oil trade balance (led by robust manufactured exports). Macro policy continuity and growthpromoting structural reforms introduce upside potential for exports and direct investment, in
manufacturing, energy, and telecommunications. However, this is likely to be associated with wider CA
deficits in the short-run, after reforms and projects are in place, as foreign services and equipment are
employed to achieve the goals of the reforms.

Exchange Rate
3.

Mexico’s flexible exchange rate has served as an important buffer against heightened

external risks and uncertainties. The nominal exchange rate has shown significant volatility during the
recent periods of global risk aversion, but without posing major difficulties for the balance sheets of
households, corporates and financial institutions. This volatility is due to significant hedging activity of
foreign exchange risk by foreign holders of Mexican assets. Additionally, the peso market is highly
liquid, open around-the-clock, and therefore used by market participants as a proxy against broader
emerging market risks in reaction to external developments. Despite this the heightened volatility,
exchange rate markets functioned relatively well, and the Mexican authorities did not revive the use of
its rule-based intervention strategy (which has been used sparingly in the past when markets became
dysfunctional).
4.

A range of metrics and methodologies indicate that Mexico’s exchange rate is broadly in

line with fundamentals. The analyses in

the EBA using the equilibrium real

undervalued at the end of 2012. However, about 6 percentage points of the result represents an
unexplained residual between the outturn and the model. Also an analysis using October 2013 WEO
data and a Consultative Group on Exchange Rate Issues (CGER)-like REER model suggests that Mexico’s
REER is 11 percent overvalued. Given these conflicting results, it is important to rely on the alternative
approaches—the macrobalance and external sustainability methods—which suggest that Mexico’s real
effective exchange rate broadly is in line with fundamentals. Also this exchange rate assessment appears
to be consistent with the CA assessment, since the gap between the EBA model estimates and the

42

MEXICO

actual is modest. If the currency were significantly misaligned, one would expect the CA gap to be wider.
5.

Mexico experienced historically large portfolio capital inflows in full-year 2012

($48 billion) and Q1 2013, continuing a trend seen in recent years. This has been associated with lax
global monetary conditions, very strong
domestic macro fundamentals, and expectations
of significant structural reforms. Foreign holdings

amortization led to a decline in their share during that period. However, foreign demand has gradually
returned and holding are at record levels once again.
6.

Given the impact that a surge in global risk aversion could have on emerging markets as

an asset class, including sound countries like Mexico, the large portfolio exposure of foreign
market participants represents significant risks. The risk of a disorderly unwinding of risk positions
associated with reduced monetary accommodation in the U.S. or a fiscal shock is a particular risk to
Mexico, given the large participation of U.S. investors in Mexican assets and the significant correlation of
Mexican external financing conditions to the U.S. rates.
7.

International reserves are adequate

relative to some standard metrics, but have lesser
coverage for broad money and foreign portfolio
liabilities. While gross international reserves
increased in 2012 to $167 billion (13.6 percent of
GDP), the change in reserve coverage since last
year’s assessment has been mixed. Reserves were
within the recommended range of coverage of the
IMF metric at 119 percent, but the coverage ratio
declined relative to last year’s assessment of

125 percent. Coverage of broad money and foreign portfolio liabilities also declined since last year to
19 and 39 percent respectively. In contrast, coverage of the imports, imports plus interest payments, and
short-term debt at residual maturities all increased somewhat to 4.5 months, 4.9 months, and 209
percent respectively.
8.

Mexico’s net foreign liability position remains moderate, but has been growing. As of the

end-2012, which does not reflect market turbulence in mid-2013, Mexico’s net foreign liability position
stood at about negative 42 percent of GDP, higher than the recent high of 40 percent at the end of
2010. Gross portfolio liabilities, particularly debt, has grown substantially to 22 percent of GDP reflecting
the strong foreign demand for government bonds. Over the medium-term, however, the NFA is
expected to remain broadly stable as the current account deficit is projected to be in line with the NFAstabilizing level of 1.6 percent.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK AND BANKFUND COLLABORATION UNDER THE JMAP
A. Relations with the World Bank
Mexico has had a longstanding partnership with the World Bank Group. A new Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) covering FY14–19—which has been jointly prepared with the Government of
Mexico—is now ready for Board discussion in December 2013. This new CPS is fully aligned with the
goals of Mexico's National Development Plan (NDP) for 2013–18 and describes the Bank’s
engagement with Mexico as a partnership to achieve development results through a tailored
package of financial, knowledge, and convening services. IBRD lending has remained an important
part of this engagement throughout the years.
As a member of the OECD and the G20, Mexico has maintained economic stability through times of
recent crisis, and increased economic and social well-being over the last two decades. Yet, Mexico is
approaching the single borrower limit (SBL) of US$16.5 billion. After pre-paying some US$5 billion
during FY07 to bring down its exposure to US$4.1 billion by end FY07, Mexico's exposure increased
rapidly from FY08 with the unleashing of the global financial crisis and surge in IBRD lending:
US$10.6 billion commitments in FY10–12 and decline in the size of repayments of loans following
prepayment of loans in FY07.
As of September 30, 2013, Bank’s exposure was US$14.78 billion which positioned Mexico as the
WBG first largest borrower in terms of debt outstanding. The active portfolio consisted of 12 IBRD
projects for a net commitment of US$4.08 billion, placing Mexico amongst the top 10 countries with
the largest portfolio under supervision in the World Bank. For FY14 total lending is envisaged at a
low range of US$350 million.

B. Bank-Fund Collaboration under the JMAP
The Bank and Fund teams have discussed the following priorities:


Need for non-oil revenue mobilization. These efforts are important to address Mexico’s longerterm fiscal challenges from gradually diminishing oil revenues and rising age-related spending.



Structural reforms. Boosting potential growth will require a comprehensive approach to
structural reforms to ensure that productivity gains accrue to all sectors and thus entrench the
recent remarkable gains of Mexico’s manufacturing sector.



Addressing climate change. Support authorities’ efforts to reduce Mexico’s carbon footprint,
including increasing renewable energy sources, and improving efficiency of lighting and
appliances.



Financial sector surveillance. The Fund will continue with the surveillance of the financial sector.
The FSAP update took place in the second half of 2011, a joint Bank-Fund effort.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Mexico observes the Special Data Dissemination
Standards (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB). In a number of cases, the periodicity and timeliness of disseminated data exceed SDDS
requirements. A data ROSC update was completed on October 8, 2010 and was published as IMF
Country Report No. 10/330. There are various areas where improvements could be made. The
authorities are aware of this situation and are continuing work in this regard.
Although some items of the balance of payments statistics conform to the Fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual, a full transition has not yet been completed.1 Several measures to
improve external debt statistics have been carried out, including the compilation of data on external
liabilities of the private sector and publicly traded companies registered with the Mexican stock
exchange (external debt outstanding, annual amortization schedule for the next four years broken
down by maturity, and type of instrument).
The national accounts statistics generally follow the recommendations of the System of National
Accounts, 1993 (1993 SNA). Source data and statistical techniques are sound and most statistical
outputs sufficiently portray reality. A broad range of source data are available, with economic
censuses every five years and a vast program of monthly and annual surveys. For most surveys,
scientific sampling techniques are used. Nonetheless, most samples exclude a random sample of
small enterprises. Some statistical techniques need enhancement. For example, taxes and subsidies
on products at constant prices are estimated by applying the GDP growth rate, a deviation from best
practice.
The concepts and definitions for both the CPI and PPI meet international standards. The PPI is only
compiled by product and not by economic activity. A ROSC mission on prices was conducted in
November 2012.
The authorities compile fiscal statistics following national concepts, definitions, and classifications
that make international comparison difficult. The statistics are comprehensive and timely, except for
states and municipalities. The new government accounting law mandates accounting standards that
follow international standards for all levels of government, and that take into account the
information needs of international organizations and national accounts.
The authorities are committed to reporting government financial statistics in GFSM 2001 format, as
well as data for the GFS Yearbook.

Since the release of the balance of payments figures for the second quarter of 2010 (August, 25, 2010), Banco de
Mexico has been publishing a new format that follows the guidelines of the Fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual.

The methodological foundations of monetary statistics are generally sound. However, the recording
of financial derivative and, to a lesser extent, repurchase agreements transactions are overstating the
aggregated other depository corporations (ODC) balance sheet and survey. Availability of data on
other financial intermediaries such as insurance companies and pension funds allow for the
construction of a financial corporations survey with full coverage of the Mexican financial system,
which is published on a monthly basis in International Financial Statistics.
Mexico is reporting Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) for Deposit Takers on a monthly basis.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Gross debt levels in Mexico, at 45 percent of GDP projected by end-2013, remain
moderate. The broad institutional coverage of Mexico’s public debt, which includes
development banks and other key public entities such as PEMEX, the state oil company,
provide reassurance that gross liabilities of the public sector are well captured in this new
DSA assessment.1,2 Although gross financing needs are slightly above 11 percent of GDP
in 2013 and 2014, they are on average below 10 percent of GDP for the whole
forecasting period. Against this background, the different DSA scenarios presented here
suggest that Mexico’s public debt is sustainable even under the most extreme shocks.
Given Mexico’s debt structure, the pass-through of either interest rates or exchange rate
shocks to the budget is relatively small over the projection period. Only the impact of
lower GDP growth shifts the debt trajectory up significantly, but even under such scenario
gross debt remains moderate and below 55 percent of GDP. While public debt profile
indicators are below early warning benchmarks, there is a large share of debt held by
non-residents—about 48 percent of total debt.

Realism of Baseline Scenario


Debt level. Mexico’s increase in gross debt levels in 2013 relative to 2012 is explained by a
combination of a slight increase in the primary deficit and a much slower pace of growth,
without major changes in sovereign yields. As fiscal consolidation plans kick in from 2015
onwards, gross debt levels are projected to decline from the peak of 47.7 percent of GDP in
2016 to 46.8 of GDP by 2018. This follows from the projected improvement in the primary
balance, which is expected to reach the debt-stabilizing level—0.2 percent of GDP—in 2016.
Staff projects that gross financing needs will decrease over time from 11.4 percent in 2013 to
7.3 percent of GDP by 2018.



Growth. Past projections of growth outcomes suggest moderate forecast errors, with the only
exceptions of 2009 and 2010, years influenced by the global crisis and the stronger-thanexpected recovery that followed afterwards. In this context, there is no apparent systematic bias
that could undermine the DSA assessment due to the growth outlook. Staff’s current growth
projections at 1.2 percent for 2013 have been severely revised downwards, which could result in
a positive impact on debt if growth turns out to be higher than expected. Still, Mexico’s debt
dynamics are sensitive to sudden changes in GDP growth, as indicated by the relevance of
growth shocks under the DSA stress tests.

Although Mexico does not provide consolidated fiscal accounts including subnational government data, latest
available information indicate that consolidated subnational gross debt remains low and below 3 percent of GDP by
end-2013. This debt is only held by residents.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MEXICO



Sovereign yields. Despite the volatility observed in recent months, Mexico’s sovereign yields
remain at historical low levels, with the 10-year local currency bond yield at around 575 basis
points as of October 23. For this bond, the spread against the U.S. 10-year Treasury bill during
September remained on average at 340 bps, about the same level observed in January 2013.
However, given upward projections for the U.S. Treasury bills and Libor rates over the medium
term, the effective nominal interest rate on Mexico’s sovereign debt is forecast to increase from
6.3 percent in 2012 to 7.2 percent by 2018. This level is consistent with the average effective rate
observed between 2002 and 2010.



Fiscal adjustment. Under the baseline, there is an important adjustment in the cyclically
adjusted primary balance between 2013 and 2018. This adjustment is explained by better
structural oil and non-oil revenues that follow from the effects of the 2013 tax and energy
reforms, with primary spending being capped by a spending growth ceiling applying from 2014
onwards. Also, amendments to the Fiscal Responsibility Law approved in 2013, which introduce
a new fiscal target on the broader public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR), provide an
additional anchor to the medium-term fiscal scenario projected by the staff. Considering the
distribution of fiscal adjustment episodes provided in the DSA template and pre-2009 Mexican
historical evidence, the projected adjustment of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance over
3 years during the projection horizon, at around 1.5 percent of GDP, does not provide warning
signals of being infeasible.

Debt Profile


Maturity and rollover. Given the current debt structure (average maturity of almost 8 years by
end-2012 with more than 80 percent of total debt at fixed interest rates) the direct pass-through
of interest rate increases to the budget is limited in any given year. A 100 basis points positive
shock to the yield curve across maturities is estimated to raise the interest bill by about
0.1 percentage points (ppts) of GDP per year. Similarly, given the large share of local-currency
denominated debt (about 76 percent of total debt), the real exchange rate depreciation shock
has a very minor effect on debt dynamics. Although around 46 percent of total gross debt is
held by non-residents on average during the whole projection period, rollover risks are kept at
reasonable levels, reflecting that approximately ¾ of non-resident holdings are held at
maturities longer than one year. This is a consequence of the well diversified base of debt
holders—which includes a large fraction of institutional investors with long-term holding
strategies and a significant share of official creditors.

Stress Tests


Primary balance shock. A deterioration of 0.8 ppts of GDP in the primary balance in 2014–15
shifts up public debt by a similar amount, reaching 48 percent of GDP by the end of the
projection period—1 ppt of GDP above the baseline. Consequently, gross financing needs also

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

3

MEXICO

increase moderately; however, effective interest rates on public debt do not show significant
differences relative to the baseline.


Growth shock. A one standard deviation shock to GDP growth rates lowers the growth rate by
2.8 percent, for 2 years starting in 2014. The nominal primary balance deteriorates significantly
due to the associated fall in revenue, reaching -2.5 percent of GDP by 2015 (relative to
-0.8 percent under the baseline). Accordingly, the debt-to-GDP ratio peaks at 53.4 percent of
GDP in 2015 and falls back to 52.5 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period. Gross
financing needs increase accordingly to 8.6 percent of GDP by 2018.



Interest rate shock. This shock involves a permanent increase in the nominal interest rate by
200 bps starting in 2014. The government’s interest bill climbs accordingly, giving rise to an
average interest rate of 8.2 percent by 2018, about 1 percent higher than in the baseline. The
debt-to-GDP ratio and gross financing needs similarly increase, reaching 48 percent and
8 percent of GDP, respectively.



Combined shock. A combined shock incorporates the largest effect of individual shocks on all
relevant variables (real GDP growth, inflation, primary balance, exchange rate and interest rate).
In this case, debt would stabilize at about 57 percent of GDP by 2018, without showing signals
of any unsustainable trajectory when inspecting the underlying debt dynamics over the whole
forecasting horizon.

Stochastic simulations


4

Fan Charts. The fan charts included in the template help to assess the sustainability of public
debt incorporating uncertainty over the medium term. Under a constellation of possible random
shocks for growth, effective interest rates, primary balances, and real exchange rates, alternative
paths for public debt are generated. The underlying probability distribution given by the
spectrum of possible random outcomes suggest an equally-distributed probability for debt to
become larger than in the baseline, yet there is a 75 percent probability that debt will be below
50 percent over the medium term. If restrictions are imposed to the maximum size of the
primary balance—for instance, by assuming that there are no positive shocks to the primary
balance in a given year—the debt path is still projected to remain below 58 percent of GDP with
90 percent probability. To complement the analysis, an alternative stochastic simulation
prepared by the staff is discussed below, which includes a larger data sample covering more
than 30 years of quarterly data to make the assessment more comprehensive (the fan chart
included in the DSA template is calculated based on annual data for the period 2002–12). Over
the projection period, the distribution of the debt path projections generated by the alternative
approach falls within the range of the distribution given by the fan chart from the DSA template.

1/ Public sector is defined as central government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ EMBI.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
8/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Alternative Stochastic Simulations
To further assess the sustainability of the baseline scenario discussed in the staff report, stochastic
simulations were performed to develop a probabilistic path for the public debt. Using Mexican data,
an unrestricted VAR was estimated to assess the impact of shocks in non-fiscal determinants of public debt
dynamics—output gap, real exchange rate, domestic real interest rate, commodity gap, and U.S. real
interest rates.3 Then, a sequence of random shocks was used to generate conditional forecasts around the
baseline. Paths for revenue, expenditure, the fiscal balance and public debt were estimated. The path for
the evolution of public debt is presented using a fan chart, which illustrates the confidence bands of the
probability of each scenario around the median path.
The results from the stochastic simulations suggest that in the baseline scenario, public debt would
begin a downward trajectory starting in 2017. Under the scenario, the median debt path suggests that
public debt would fall to 45½ percent of GDP by 2022, and that there is a close to 50 percent probability
that debt would be lower than in 2013. The baseline scenario puts the median of the public debt path on a
declining trend in 2017. Given the more gradual consolidation path, there is a small probability—less than
5 percent—that public debt will reach 50 percent of GDP in 2015–2016.

The output gap is calculated using a Hodrick-Prescott filter over 1980–2013. The commodity gap is expressed in
percent of the structural price, defined as the 7-year moving-average of the price of the Mexican oil mix. For the real
domestic interest rate, the one-year CETES rate was used, adjusted by CPI. The foreign interest rate is the 10-year
Treasury bond yield. The VAR uses quarterly data for 1990–2012 to calibrate the distribution of shocks. The variancecovariance matrix of the residuals characterizes the joint statistical properties of the contemporaneous disturbances.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Mexico’s external-debt-to GDP ratio continues to be low and sustainable (29 percent
projected for end-2013), and is expected to remain stable over the medium-term. With the
most extreme shock—a 30 percent real exchange rate depreciation—the debt-to-GDP ratio would
increase to 40 percent, which is still a moderate level. Mitigating factors include the fact that a larger
share of Mexico’s (public) debt is now denominated in pesos, and Mexico has taken advantage of
low interest rates and the recognition of its strong macroeconomic fundamentals to lengthen the
maturity structure of its external debt. Other shocks, including to interest rates, current account and
growth, have only a marginal impact on Mexico’s debt-to-GDP ratio.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Mexico
On November 25, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Mexico.
Over the past year, Mexico has maintained macroeconomic policy continuity, while pursuing an
ambitious agenda of growth-enhancing reforms. Reforms have already been approved to upgrade
education, make labor markets more flexible, and foster competition in telecommunications.
Congress is currently debating a fundamental reform of the energy sector and is in the final stages
of approving a financial sector reform. In October 2013, Congress modified the fiscal framework,
reformed the main taxes and introduced a universal pension scheme and unemployment insurance.
In 2013, the economy has begun to operate well below capacity, with real GDP growth expected to
slow to 1.2 percent (down from 3.6 percent in 2012). In the first semester, activity declined sharply,
opening a sizable output gap estimated at -1.5 percent of potential GDP in the second quarter.
Projected growth for 2013 assumes a strong rebound in the second semester, with manufacturing
recovering in response to a pick-up in U.S. manufacturing, and public spending regaining its lost
momentum. However, this projection assumes a gradual recovery in construction. The storms that
hit both coasts in September are expected to have only a modest effect on growth.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

The slack in the economy is helping to contain price pressures, with headline inflation now
projected at 3½ percent by the end of the year—close to the 3 percent inflation target. Supply
shocks had driven up food prices and pushed headline inflation above 4 percent earlier this year.
However, since mid-year these pressures on food prices have subsided, and core inflation has stayed
at historical lows of 2½ percent y/y since July. Medium-term inflation expectations have remained
firmly anchored at 3½ percent— albeit still above the 3 percent target.
Demand policies are supporting a recovery in growth. The public sector borrowing requirement
(PSBR) is expected to reach 4.1 percent of GDP this year, compared with 3.7 percent of GDP in
2012. This stance would imply a considerable fiscal stimulus in the second semester, as the PSBR
amounted to only 1.0 percent of GDP in the first semester. The central bank has reduced its policy
rate so far this year by a total of 100 basis points to 3.50 percent in response to the widening of the
negative output gap and in the absence of significant inflationary pressures.
The external current account deficit is projected to widen to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2013. The nonoil trade deficit would remain at 1 percent of GDP, while the oil trade surplus would fall to 0.6
percent of GDP, reflecting weaker production and exports of oil. The Fund’s current account model
and a range of exchange rate metrics in the External Balance Assessment (EBA) suggest that the
current account balance and real exchange rate are broadly in line with fundamentals and desirable
policy settings.
Mexico’s financial asset markets showed more resilience than many other emerging markets after
the Fed initiated its discussion of tapering on May 22. In this context, net capital inflows are
projected to remain steady at about 4 percent of GDP in 2013. Through April, investor appetite for
Mexican assets was underpinned by heightened prospects for further structural reforms, as well as
the ample global supply of liquidity, generating a strong appreciation of the peso and a compression
in sovereign debt yields. After the Fed initiated the discussion on the tapering of quantitative easing,
asset markets reversed course for several months. In the second quarter, gross capital inflows,
especially portfolio investment from non-residents fell sharply from a peak in the first quarter.
Residents helped cushion the effects of this shift by keeping more of their funds within Mexico,
leading to a smaller decline in overall net capital inflows. The recent delay in tapering announced
by the Fed in mid-September has led to signs of a recovery in capital inflows in recent months.

The banking system—which accounts for about 60 percent of financial system assets—has
remained resilient. The annual expansion in bank credit to the private sector has slowed from about
15 percent in nominal terms in mid-2012 to 10 percent as of August 2013. As of July 2013, the
system’s capital adequacy ratio stood at 15.6 percent, largely unchanged from a year ago. However,
NPLs have increased to 4 percent of total loans in July 2013, from 3.1 percent at end-2012,
although provisions still amounted to 174 percent of NPLs.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that Mexico’s very strong fundamentals, sound policy framework, and
skillful macroeconomic management have allowed Mexico to deal with global volatility
exceptionally well in recent months. At the same time, they noted that growth this year will be
below potential, and downside risks remain from unsettled external conditions. Directors welcomed
the authorities’ commitment to maintain prudent macroeconomic policies and continue to
implement far-reaching structural reforms.
Directors supported the moderately expansionary fiscal stance. They emphasized nonetheless that
medium-term consolidation will be important as growth recovers. In this regard, Directors
welcomed legislation that would facilitate achieving the medium-term fiscal targets and a
sustainable path for the public debt. More broadly, Directors welcomed the more comprehensive
medium-term fiscal framework recently put in place, which will provide a more effective anchor for
policy and reduce procyclicality. They encouraged the authorities to consider further efforts to
simplify the operations of the oil stabilization funds, bolster collection of nonoil tax revenues, and
preserve the gains from the elimination of the subsidy on domestic gasoline prices.
Directors agreed that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate, and that monetary and
exchange rate policies are well positioned to manage tail risks from the global economy. Directors

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used

noted that the Flexible Credit Line continues to serve as a complement to foreign reserves if global
tail risks materialize.
Directors noted the resilience of Mexico’s financial system. They mentioned that recent reforms
should promote competition and access in the financial sector while strengthening regulation and
consumer protection. Directors also encouraged the authorities to monitor private sector
indebtedness and the rise in nonperforming construction loans.
Directors welcomed the progress in structural reforms aimed at upgrading public education,
increasing labor market flexibility, and fostering competition in telecommunications. Together with
other reforms currently under discussion, these reforms will provide an important, if gradual,
impetus to medium-term growth. Implementation will be key, and Directors underscored the
benefits of a prompt approval of the secondary legislation and regulations.
