STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FIRST POST PROGRAM MONITORING

KEY ISSUES
Context: Having made considerable progress toward macroeconomic stabilization in the
context of the recent SBA, the authorities are seeking to build a more resilient and
diversified economy. This will require stepped-up investments in human and physical
capital. Oil revenue accounts for some three-quarters of budgetary revenue and is the main
driver of reserves accumulation.
Growth prospects and risks: Overall growth is projected to accelerate to 6.8 percent in
2012. Oil prices, though declining, remain higher than budgeted and oil production is
projected to rebound. There are downside risks if oil prices were to decline further or if the
turmoil in Europe deepens.
Focus: Discussions centered on a comprehensive medium-term fiscal framework to shield
the economy and protect priority spending from volatile oil prices and production, and the
unpredictability of oil revenue transfers from the state-owned oil company, Sonangol. Staff
and the authorities agreed on the need to continue accumulating international reserves in
light of elevated external risks and Angola’s continued dependence on oil. Building on
existing efforts, discussions also focused on economic and financial policies that would lay
the basis for enabling the structural transformation and diversification of the economy.
Financial sector: The FSAP noted that Angola’s financial system faces vulnerabilities given
the risky domestic and external environment in which it operates. This is due to capacity
constraints in banking supervision, inadequate bank corporate governance, high
dollarization, and liquidity shifts linked to large oil sector transactions. Staff welcomes the
initial steps taken by the authorities to address these risks and recommends that banking
supervision be enhanced as a matter of priority.

OUTLOOK, RISKS, AND POLICY CHALLENGES
10.

The outlook for 2012 is relatively

favorable, but affected by the recent
decline in oil prices and other
uncertainties. The pace of economic activity
is expected to accelerate with overall growth
at 6.8 percent in real terms. Oil production is
rebounding. Non-oil sector growth is
expected to moderate somewhat compared
to 2011. The energy, transportation, and
construction sectors are likely to benefit from
a gradual scaling up of public investment
programs and from the settlement of past
government arrears. However, agricultural
output and food-related prices are affected
by a drought. Inflation is expected to

continue declining slowly, to 9.6 percent by
end-2012.
11.

On the fiscal front, the authorities

are assessing the realism of the 2012
budget, also in light of the 2011 outcome.
The budget was predicated on a conservative
oil price assumption (US$77 per barrel) but it
did not take into account the higher level of
spending implied by the progressive
incorporation of QFOs. Because the 2011
overrun reflects in part ongoing priority
QFOs, and in light of the decision to
incorporate these QFOs in the fiscal
accounts, the authorities are weighing the
need for a supplementary budget. This
would allow for a more accurate reflection of

The monetary policy operational

framework was recently overhauled (Box 1.)


The new framework introduces the BNA’s
“reference rate” as a key monetary policy
signal.

ANGOLA

Box 1. The BNA’s New Monetary Policy Operational Framework
In August 2011, the BNA approved its new monetary policy operational framework, upgrading
and expanding instruments available to achieve its monetary policy objectives. This framework
became operational in January 2012.
The new framework introduces the concept of “Reference Interest Rate” (RIR) which is used to
signal the policy orientation of the BNA. It also distinguishes between instruments targeting
monetary policy objectives and those related to lender of last resort objectives.
The LUIBOR is the rate at which financial institutions trade uncollateralized liquidity in the
interbank market. It is calculated as a weighted average of interest rates in the interbank market
and regularly published by the BNA.
The permanent liquidity facility (PLF) is intended to absorb or provide banks with overnight
liquidity. Such liquidity is offered at the BNA’s RIR plus a spread, to ensure that overnight liquidity
is traded preferably in the interbank market. The BNA has also established an intraday PLF.
The new open market operational framework, includes: (i) a short-term refinancing facility for
periods up to 7 days, which can be rolled over by the BNA on banks’ request, and are offered on a
weekly basis; (ii) a longer-term refinancing facility, for maturities up to 28 days, offered monthly;
(iii) an unsecured, ad-hoc liquidity absorption and provision facility, for maturities ranging from
1 to 28 days, to address sharp and unanticipated changes in liquidity conditions; and (iv) a
structural operation, which implies a non-reversible, ad hoc provision of liquidity by the BNA
against eligible securities (government securities with residual maturities of less than 3 months).
The BNA has also adopted lender of last resort facilities. They include: (i) the rediscount facility of
first level, targeting financial institutions facing cash flow imbalances; and (ii) the rediscount
facility of second level, for financial institutions facing restructuring needs.

the transfer of oil revenues from Sonangol to
the budget is critical to macroeconomic
stability. To this effect, it is unfortunate that
the work on the 2007-2010 Reconciliation
Report could not be completed within the
envisaged timeframe. It is critical that the
authorities continue this work in time to be
discussed during the second PPM mission.
56.

Fully funding OIF will be another

key step to protect Angola from future
shocks. The OIF should be used as a fiscal
buffer. To be effective in this regard, the OIF
would need to be fully funded, and
withdrawals judiciously managed until
absorption capacity is strengthened. This
would allow a gradual scaling up of
investment, and protect priority projects from
detrimental stops and starts. The OIF could
also help sterilize liquidity.
57.

A prudent level of international

reserves is also warranted to support the
continuity of import-intensive
investments, while the economy remains
reliant on a single commodity. The
authorities aim at reaching the equivalent of
at least 9 months of imports. Given Angola’s
dependence on volatile oil revenue, this level
appears appropriate, and in combination with

58.

Further progress in reducing

inflation requires a tighter monetary
stance. Inflation has slowly declined, aided by
a stable exchange rate. However, it remains in
the double-digit territory. To reach its
objective of bringing inflation to the single
digits by 2013, the BNA should mop up
excess liquidity through the issuance of BNA
bills, and allow rates to adjust upward.
59.

Given the risks identified in the

FSAP, the authorities should continue to
step-up banking supervision and improve
the enforcement of prudential standards
and creditor rights. Non-performing loans
should be better recognized and adequately
provisioned, and bank capital strengthened.
The steps taken by the BNA to implement
FSAP recommendations and to enhance
cooperation with supervisors in Europe are in
the right direction.
60.

The authorities’ multi-year

development agenda will help to realize
Angola’s economic potential and improve
the living conditions of its population. This
will require sustained efforts to (i) improve
human and physical capital, by rebalancing
budget allocations toward social and
infrastructure spending; (ii) lower inflation and

The macroeconomic balance approach (MB)
estimates a current account norm consistent with the
country’s macroeconomic fundamentals. The
purchasing power parity approach (PPP) is based on
the assumption that nominal exchange rates are
related to national price levels, and changes in the
former should be in line with changes in relative price
levels. The external sustainability approach (ES)
estimates the current account to GDP ratio required to
stabilize net foreign assets (NFA) at a certain

A scenario derived from Angola’s

Similarly, a primary balance shock would raise
debt to 57 percent of GDP, and a shock to
interest rates to 49 percent of GDP. Lastly, a
combined interest rate and growth shock would
raise debt to 56 percent of GDP. These results
suggest that Angola’s public debt dynamics are

The authorities consider the domestic

mitigated by the large foreign currency
denominated revenue flows (i.e., oil), and
interest rate risk is limited by favorable external
borrowing conditions and excess liquidity in
domestic banks. But a rollover risk may arise
because about 30 percent of domestic public
debt is of a short term nature (by contrast less
than 1 percent of external public debt is short
term). The authorities aim to gradually extend
the average maturity of domestic debt,
balancing the tradeoff with interest costs.

1/ Gross debt. Coverage: general government plus major SOEs (Sonangol and TAAG).
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g  - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Safeguards Assessments:1 The
first-time safeguards assessment, which was
finalized in May 2010, found that the National
Bank of Angola (BNA) is subject to annual
external audits by a reputable firm and has
taken steps to address the audit qualifications.
The assessment confirmed, however, weak
governance and transparency practices at the
BNA, including lack of timely publication of
annual financial statements. The assessment
also made recommendations to enhance the
legal framework and independence of the
central bank, and to strengthen the control
framework in the reserves management and
internal audit areas. Since this assessment, the
BNA has adopted measures to enhance
governance and accountability, including the
production of its financial statements. The
2009 statements were audited and published
together with the auditors’ report; the 2010
audit has been completed and the results will
be published on the BNA website mid-October
2011. The Board of the BNA has strengthened
its internal audit function, and in January 2011,
it reconstituted its Audit Board. It also adopted
in December 2010 guidelines for the
management of international reserves and in
May 2011 conducted a first semi-annual
internal audit of their implementation. While
IMF staff has received the audited financial
statements for 2010, the relevant management
letter on internal controls issued by the
external auditors for that year has not yet been
shared with Fund staff. Provision of this
information is required under the safeguards
policy.

Exchange Arrangements: Angola’s de
facto exchange arrangement has been

2009. The Banco Nacional de Angola (BNA)
intervenes actively in the foreign exchange
market in order to stabilize the exchange rate
by selling part of the oil-revenue related
foreign exchange in auctions to banks.
Auctions were temporarily suspended from
April 20 to October 1, 2009 leading to the
establishment of a formal peg. Since the
resumption of auctions, the kwanza has
depreciated. However, the authorities maintain
strong control over the exchange rate, which is
the main anchor for the monetary policy. The
BNA publishes a daily reference rate, which is
computed as the transaction-weighted
average of the previous day’s rates of
successful bids by commercial banks. Banks
and exchange bureaus may deal among
themselves and with their customers at rates
that can be freely negotiated provided they do
not exceed the reference rate by more than
4 percent.
Angola continues to avail itself of the
transitional arrangements under the provisions
of Article XIV, Section 2 and maintains two
exchange measures, namely, (i) limits on the
availability of foreign exchange for invisible
transactions, such as travel, medical, or
educational allowances and (ii) limits on
unrequited transfers to foreign-based
individuals and institutions. In addition, Angola
maintains two exchange restrictions resulting
from: (i) limits on the remittances of dividends
and profits from foreign investments that do
not exceed US$1,000,000,2 and (ii) the
discriminatory application of the 0.015 percent
stamp tax on foreign exchange operations that
are subject to approval under Article VIII,
Section 2(a). Angola maintains two multiple
currency practices (i) arising from the Dutch
foreign exchange auction, and (ii) the

III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision has shortcomings, but
is broadly adequate for surveillance and
program performance. There are major
concerns about data quality and timeliness
and efforts are underway to strengthen the
statistical base, including through technical
assistance from the Fund and the World Bank.
The authorities are committed to using the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) to
improve the statistical system. Angola started
participating in the GDDS in October 2003 and
metadata were posted on the IMF’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. The
metadata need to be updated.
Angola now has several regular and
informative statistical publications; reflecting
significant progress in the provision of data
and transparency in statistical reporting since
beginning of the SBA. They include the
quarterly statistical bulletin of the National
Bank of Angola (BNA), the quarterly budget
execution reports of the Ministry of Finance,
and the quarterly economic outlook of the
National Institute of Statistics (INE). INE also
published an informative inflation report. Data
postings on the government website
(www.minfin.gv.ao), including revenues from
the oil sector, but are not as timely as
recommended in the GDDS. The BNA recently
redesigned its website, to make it more
accessible and timely.
National accounts and price statistics
2.
Official GDP estimates are published
annually and generally only by sector, with no
disaggregation by industry and the
government sector is not identified. Annual
GDP at constant prices is estimated using 2002
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

prices. There are no estimates of GDP by
expenditure. A quarterly GDP series is in
production, and publication will begin in 2012.
Apart from oil production, sectoral data are
calculated using indicators with weights based
on incomplete surveys conducted in 2001 or
earlier. A lack of statistical offices in the
provinces significantly limits data coverage.
The CPI is based on a basket of goods and
services for which prices are collected in
Luanda. The geographical coverage of price
collection was extended to five more provinces
and an unofficial quarterly index has been
compiled commencing in 2005, but a
September 2006 STA CPI Mission did not
regard these data as sufficiently reliable for
publication. The CPI weights were revised in
January 2002 based on a household survey
conducted in 2001. CPI data are produced
monthly, normally with a lag of two weeks.
There are no wholesale or producer price
indices.
Monetary and financial statistics
3.
Data for the depository corporation
survey and the balance sheet of the central
bank are timely but still based on old report
forms. There are concerns about the quality
and timeliness of reports from some
commercial banks. A March 2006 STA mission
assisted the BNA in starting compilation of
monthly monetary statistics using the new
standardized report forms (SRFs). The mission
made several recommendations for improving
monetary statistics and finalizing the SRFs,
including the classification of bank holdings of
treasury bills and bonds and central bank bills,
and the valuation of foreign
currency-denominated accounts. A May 2007

ANGOLA

follow-up mission assisted the BNA in
finalizing the SRFs for the central bank, but
further work is needed to finalize the SRF for
the other depository corporations. The mission
also focused on the intersectoral consistency
of the monetary and the government finance
and balance of payments statistics, and
provided on-the-job training. Once the link
between the SRFs and the new accounting
data of the other depository corporations is
finalized, the SRFs will be used to derive an
integrated monetary database to meet the
needs of the BNA, as well as AFR and STA.
Government finance statistics
4.
The timeliness and quality of
government finance statistics needs to be
improved. Budget execution reports reflect
liabilities for tax payments as estimated in the
budget (budget basis), rather than revenues
collected (cash basis); and expenditures reflect
only expenditures on a cash basis rather than
expenditure on a commitment basis. Data
from the SIGFE management information
system are still limited in coverage and
reliability, and subject to revisions. Monthly
government accounts tend to rely on
estimates based on the budget rather than on
actual execution figures. The MoF does not
report a significant number of series for
government finance data for publication in the
GFS Yearbook or in International Financial
Statistics.
External sector statistics
5.
The balance of payments and
international investment position are compiled
in line with the recommendations of the fifth
edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments
Manual. These statistics are compiled and
disseminated annually, with a lag of nine
months after the reference period. A technical
assistance mission on external sector statistics

was conducted in July 2010. It noted that few
of the recommendations made by the previous
missions had been implemented and that little
progress had been made in strengthening the
compilation framework, the technical units are
understaffed and there are problems of
non-compliance with data reporting
requirements by resident enterprises. A
thorough review of the balance of payments
and IIP for 2008 and 2009 was conducted. The
authorities have made progress regarding the
methodological soundness of classification of
balance of payments transactions.
Nonetheless, some inconsistencies have been
found, especially regarding the classification of
transactions involving arrears and SDRs. The
IIP showed important inconsistencies with the
balance of payments and the external debt
statement. Coverage and timeliness of source
data remain a major shortcoming. The
development of the BNA’s International
Transactions Reporting System (ITRS), known
as SIOBE, was halted due both to lack of staff
and the uncertainty regarding its replacement
by a similar ITRS being developed by the BNA.
6.
In addition, the mission also noted that
the continued improvement in the quality of
statistics depends on: (1) an increase in the
rate of response to the surveys, including the
adoption of administrative measures to curb
noncompliance with reporting requirements;
(2) implementation of tools and mechanisms
for the organization, analysis and validation of
ITRS data; (3) compliance with commitments in
the agreements signed with the National
Statistics Institute, and the MoF for access to
their databases; and (4) integration of more
data sources.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION AND FIRST POST-PROGRAM
MONITORING—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
AND DRAFT PUBLIC INFORMATION NOTICE
Approved By

Seán Nolan and Dhaneshwar Ghura

This note is to update the Executive Board on material developments that have
occurred since the issuance of the staff report (EBS/12/88).
On July 3, 2012, the Angolan authorities provided staff with a first reconciliation report
covering the period 2007-2010, that analyzes the factors contributing to the large
residual in the fiscal accounts identified over the course of the recent Stand-By
Arrangement. The draft report provides revised data on the domestic and external
financing of the budget, along with information on higher spending levels across a
range of categories, stemming in the main from the incorporation into the fiscal
accounts of previously unaccounted-for quasi-fiscal operations conducted by the state
oil company on behalf of the government.
Staff is in the process of discussing the draft report with the authorities, seeking further
clarification on the sources for, and accuracy of, some of the revisions. Staff is also
examining the implications of these revisions for the assessment of fiscal developments
during 2007-2010, discussed in EBS/12/88, Appendix II.
Staff welcomes the production of this draft reconciliation report, which is still work in
progress, and looks forward to discussing the finalized report at the time of the second
post-program monitoring mission, set for late 2012.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation and First
Post Program Monitoring with Angola
On July 11 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the 2012
Article IV Consultation and First Post Program Monitoring with Angola.1
Background
Angola has emerged from more than four decades of war to become Africa’s second largest oil
exporter and its third largest economy. During the oil price boom of 2003–08 Angola began to
rebuild its infrastructure, the oil and non-oil sectors grew substantially, and per capita gross
domestic product (GDP) reached middle-income levels. Nonetheless, the economy remained
highly vulnerable to oil revenue volatility.
With highly expansionary policies backing a full-steam reconstruction effort, Angola faced
severe macroeconomic imbalances after the collapse in oil prices in 2008–09. In response, the
authorities put in place a stabilization program supported by the 2009–2012 Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA). Under the program considerable progress was made toward regaining
macroeconomic stability. Angola attained an improved fiscal position, a more comfortable level
of international reserves, a stable exchange rate, and lower inflation. Large domestic arrears
were settled, and progress was made in strengthening fiscal transparency and accountability.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2
Macroeconomic conditions continued to improve in 2011. Oil production problems constrained
real growth to 3.9 percent. Headline inflation declined, helped by a stable exchange rate. The
overall fiscal surplus increased, mainly due to high oil prices. The external current account
improved, and international reserves rose to the equivalent of almost 7 months of next year’s
imports of goods and services.
Fiscal consolidation was critical in supporting stabilization in the wake of the 2009 crisis: a sharp
reduction in the non-oil primary deficit was achieved in 2009–2010, albeit with some reversal in
2011. Larger-than-expected spending on goods and services, surging subsidies, and the
incorporation of quasi-fiscal operations conducted by the state-owned oil company on behalf of
the government contributed to widen the non-oil primary deficit, from 43.6 to 48.2 percent of
non-oil GDP. The monetary stance was also relaxed starting in mid-2011.
The outlook for 2012 remains favorable, notwithstanding the recent decline in oil prices. The
pace of economic activity is expected to accelerate, with overall growth close to 7 percent as oil
production rebounds. The energy, transportation, and construction sectors are likely to benefit
from a gradual scaling up of public investment programs. However, agricultural output and
food-prices are affected by a drought.
Over the medium term the authorities are focusing on creating the fiscal space to support the
scaling up of investment spending within a reduced revenue envelope. While non-oil tax
revenue is set to increase as a result of tax administration reforms, it will not fully offset the
decline in oil revenue implied by oil price and production projections. Current spending is
expected to remain broadly unchanged as a share of GDP, but capital spending will gradually
increase as the authorities implement their development plans. As a result, the overall fiscal
balance is projected to move to a modest deficit by 2016. The debt profile is expected to remain
manageable, albeit vulnerable to oil revenue shocks. The gradual pace of the scaling-up effort
will provide the authorities with time to further strengthen capacity and reinforce fiscal buffers
and institutions. Against this backdrop, the authorities are confronting several policy challenges,
including (i) putting in place a comprehensive medium-term fiscal framework; (ii) accumulating
further international reserves in an environment of elevated external risks; and (iii) enabling the
structural transformation and diversification of the economy to promote more inclusive growth.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities’ progress in stabilizing the economy under their
SBA-supported program. The fiscal position has improved, international reserves have been
rebuilt, the exchange rate has stabilized, and inflation is on a gradually declining path. Although
Angola’s growth outlook is favorable, the country remains vulnerable to oil revenue shocks, a
large infrastructure gap persists, and poverty remains widespread. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ focus on medium-term priorities to address these challenges, calling for sustained
efforts to further strengthen policy buffers, safeguard financial sector stability, and diversify the
economy.

3
Directors underscored the importance of maintaining a prudent fiscal stance, anchored by a
realistic spending envelope. They encouraged the authorities to consider a supplementary
budget to put the non-oil primary deficit ratio back on a declining path and rebalance
expenditure towards social and infrastructure spending. Directors called on the authorities to
continue phasing out quasi-fiscal operations conducted by the state-owned oil company,
incorporating them into budgetary operations. They welcomed the draft reconciliation report
aimed at explaining inconsistencies in the fiscal accounts for 2007-2010, and looked forward to
receiving a full assessment for the complete reconciliation exercise at the next Board review of
post-program performance in Angola.
Directors stressed the importance of establishing a robust medium-term fiscal framework to
shield the economy from oil revenue volatility, and welcomed the authorities’ plans in this
regard. They called for strengthened governance of oil revenue, including by setting clear rules
for the accumulation and use of the resources of the Oil for Infrastructure Fund. Directors
encouraged steps to continue improving non-oil tax revenue collection and contain fuel
subsidies. They also saw merit in further strengthening the international reserves buffer.
Directors welcomed recent initiatives to reform the monetary policy framework and strengthen
liquidity management. They encouraged the authorities to mop up excess liquidity to support
continued disinflation. Directors underscored the need to manage the risks associated with the
new foreign exchange law for the oil sector carefully, including by taking timely steps to
strengthen the central bank’s supervisory capacity.
Directors concurred with the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) findings.
They noted the vulnerability of the financial system to external shocks, the constraints to
banking supervision capacity, and the difficulty in managing liquidity shifts linked to large oil
sector transactions. Directors welcomed the steps being taken to mitigate these risks, and
encouraged the central bank to strengthen the enforcement of prudential standards and creditor
rights. They supported continued efforts to comply with international Anti-money laundering combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards. Directors also encouraged the
authorities to remove remaining exchange restrictions.
Directors underscored the importance of structural reforms to improve the business
environment, enhance competitiveness, and diversify the economy. They supported the
authorities’ focus on improving human and physical capital and strengthening the regulatory
environment, and looked forward to sustained progress on their development strategy.

Statement by Momodou Saho, Alternate Executive Director for Angola
July 11, 2012

My Angolan authorities have demonstrated strong commitment to sustained economic
growth in tandem with their long-term development strategy – “Angola 2025.’’ The strategy
envisions strengthened public financial management, expansion of physical and economic
infrastructures, heightened job creation and enhanced quality of life for the population as
prerequisites to achieving their development objectives. While my authorities are aware of
the immense challenges ahead, their bi-annual economic program strives to build on sound
fiscal and monetary policies as well as human and institutional capacity developments which
should in turn support the structural transformation and diversification of the economy.
Since the last Article IV consultation in 2009, my authorities have successfully concluded a
27 - month Stand-By Arrangement in March 2012. The current discussions with staff were,
therefore, focused on candid assessments of Angola’s economic strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and potential threats in the short and medium-term. My authorities broadly
agree with the findings of the staff report, including the joint Fund/World Bank Financial
Sector Assessment Program, and the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA). Going forward,
they are determined to further consolidate the democratic environment and to strengthen the
sociopolitical stability which is expected to facilitate the conduct of the upcoming general
elections in late August, 2012. This is a step in the right direction towards increased political
stability and edification of the rule of law.
Recent economic developments and medium term outlook
Angola’s economic performance has been impressive in the recent period. While growth
moderated in the oil and diamond sectors in the last two years due to external shocks and
operational concerns, it remained robust in the non-extractive sector, particularly in
agriculture, manufacturing, construction, transportation, and services. Real GDP growth is
expected to accelerate in 2012 to about 9.8 percent but the exposure to the external financial
and economic environment remains a source of concern. End period inflation declined to
about 11 percent in December 2011from 15.3 percent a year earlier, particularly due to lower
than envisaged demand pressures. Net International Reserves (NIR) more than doubled from
2010 figures reaching about 8 months of imports of non-oil goods and services. The recovery
in oil and diamond exports in 2011 led to further improvement in the external current account
surplus.
The near to medium-term economic prospects remains favorable. Developments in the
advanced economies, particularly the demand for crude oil, trends in oil prices, and the levels
of international food and commodity prices strongly influence the Angolan medium-term
prospect. Real GDP growth in the medium term will be driven by the boom of the nonmineral economy and contribution of the newly established infrastructures, lower costs of
power and water supply, and improved transportation networks. New production of liquefied
natural gas will also further increase the country’s financial capacity.

2

Fiscal policy
My Angolan authorities intend to continue reducing unpredictability in oil revenue transfers
and enhancing accountability in public spending. To this end, the corrective actions
undertaken have contributed to the phasing out of the quasi-fiscal activities of the state oil
company, Sonangol, and the gradual inclusion of these activities in the budget. Steady
progress has been made in monitoring and reconciling oil revenue flows to the treasury and
my authorities have submitted to staff the first draft of the 2007 – 2010 reconciliation report.
This has helped in resolving, to a large extent, the discrepancies and strengthened the
integration of the quasi fiscal operations in the budget. In addition, my authorities intend to
design and implement in 2013 fiscal policies with a medium term outlook to avoid boombust cycles given the fluctuations in international oil prices that require sudden adjustments
in macroeconomic policies. The aim of a multi-year fiscal framework is to ensure that fiscal
and external sector positions remain sustainable while improved management of oil revenues
allows a scaling-up in public investment.
In the same vein, efforts to strengthen the Oil for Infrastructure Fund are being undertaken
with a view to enhancing the public financial investment capacity. My authorities also
continue to strengthen tax administration and subsidies reforms in order to rebuild fiscal
buffers and make more resources available to priority social and developments needs. They
maintain that an increase in infrastructure and social sector spending is needed to enhance
efficiency and competitiveness of the economy and further reduce poverty. The authorities
are considering the merits of moving to a different fiscal anchor, the non-oil current primary
balance to better accommodate capital expenditure and would like to have further discussions
going forward.
According to the DSA, Angola’s public debt remains sustainable. The authorities embarked
in 2010 on a package of structural measures with the aim of enhancing their debt
management capacity and improving debt statistics. These measures have allowed the
creation of the debt management unit at the Ministry of Finance which is currently provided
with clear channels of communication, independent access and reporting lines to the
economic ministries. In addition, a medium-term debt strategy is in preparation and will be
expeditiously integrated in the budget in order to ensure that the macroeconomic policies are
consistent with the 2001 IMF Government Finance Statistics Manual.
Monetary and financial sector developments
The National Bank of Angola (BNA) remains committed to price stability. However, given
the nature of Angola’s high import-dependent economy with limited non-oil exports
products, high government spending and massive demand for foreign exchange transactions,
BNA is focusing on a prudent monetary stance attuned to further reduce inflation, stabilize
the exchange rate, and increase the level of NIR. Inflation is projected to decline further in
2012 to single digits while NIR, at about U$32 billion in June 2012, was equivalent to 8
months of imports, in line with similar oil export economies.

3

My Angolan authorities have also undertaken far-reaching reforms on the monetary front. In
their view, the implementation of sound monetary policy with the aim of pursuing financial
sector stability, continuing with the de-dollarization of the economy and developing
appropriate Kwanza-denominated savings instruments is crucial to maintaining a sustainable
monetary policy. BNA is also actively strengthening prudential regulation for short-term
credit denominated in foreign currency and tightening net open positions of commercial
banks.
My authorities recognize that financial sector deepening is crucial to sustain their monetary
and financial stance. To this end, the BNA has integrated in its short-term monetary policy
operational framework risk-based and cross-border supervision measures to improve its
micro and macro prudential policies. It intends to continue efforts to strengthen banking
supervision and comply with AML/CFT standards. The BNA will also prudently manage the
implementation of the new foreign exchange law for the oil sector, by enhancing supervisory
capacity prior to the full implementation of the law and pursuing efforts to reinforce the legal
and institutional framework for financial sector regulation that will ensure transparency and
efficiency of the monetary instruments.
Structural reforms
My authorities’ vision, as expressed in the structural reforms agenda is a balanced,
comprehensive, and sustained development that builds on the country’s considerable
resources and potential, with a view to reducing poverty and creating employment
opportunities. They are of the view that the growth momentum needs to be conducive to a
more diversified economy with reduced dependence on the extractive industries.
As emphasized in the economic program, the principal engine for growth has to be the
private sector. As such, my authorities consider further reducing the cost of doing business
through streamlined legislation, strengthening the judicial system and simplifying tax
compliance. The dissemination of one-stop-shops is an important step towards the
achievement of these goals. Also, substantial progress in roads and railways and
communication networks are facilitating transportation of goods and services and have
considerably reduced delays and costs smoothing the creation and registration of new private
companies.
First post program monitoring
While noting the strong capacity to totally reimburse the Fund, my authorities are committed
to persevere with the macroeconomic gains of the last few years and the need to protect and
consolidate it through continued expenditure discipline, strengthening of the fiscal accounts,
decreasing reliance on oil and diamond based revenues, and sound management of the public
debt. In addition, for growth and enhanced competitiveness, my authorities are committed to
take bold actions to promote a sound financial system, eliminate barriers against private
capital flows, enforce competition-friendly regulations, to continue to undertake structural
reforms in various sectors, and deal with specific cases of market failures.

4

Conclusion
My Angolan authorities have shown determination in their efforts to attain and sustain
macroeconomic stability, and would like to reiterate their commitment to implementing
prudent fiscal and monetary policies with the aim of achieving strengthened public financial
management and inclusive growth. They value the continued support provided by
Management and Executive Directors, and thank staff for the helpful collaboration and
valuable technical advice.
