IMF Executive Board Completes Fifth PSI Review, Approves US$282.9 Million Credit
Facility and Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Mozambique
On December 18, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the
fifth review of Mozambique’s economic performance under the program supported by the Policy
Support Instrument (PSI)1.
In completing the review, the Executive Board approved the authorities request for waiver and
modification of three assessment criteria for December 2015 to account for the changed
environment and revised microeconomic projections.
The Board also approved Mozambique’s request for an SDR 204.5 million, (about US$282.9 million)
Standby Credit Facility to supplement the PSI to augment reserves and maintain macroeconomic
stability, with a first SDR 85.2 million disbursement (about US$117.9 million) available immediately.
The SCF aims to alleviate the external balance of payments shocks, and through strengthening
macroeconomic stability, to achieve the government’s goals on poverty reduction and inclusive
growth.
The Executive Board approved the PSI for Mozambique on June 24, 2013 (see Press Release No.
13/231).
Following the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director and Acting
Chair, issued the following statement:
“Despite challenges, Mozambique’s economic growth continues to be robust and inflation remains
low. However, lower commodity prices and a decline in foreign exchange inflows have generated a
temporary balance of payments gap. The authorities have taken strong policy measures to preserve
1

The PSI is an instrument of the IMF designed for countries that do not need balance of payments financial support.
The PSI helps countries design effective economic programs that, once approved by the IMF's Executive Board,
signal to donors, multilateral development banks, and markets the Fund's endorsement of a member's policies (see
http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/psi.htm). Details on Mozambique’s PSI program are available at
http://www.imf.org/mozambique.

macroeconomic stability. Continued implementation of prudent policies under the standby credit
facility will be essential to ensure debt sustainability, safeguard against external shocks, as well as
promote strong and inclusive growth.
“The authorities’ front-loaded corrective measures, including a tightening of the 2016 budget deficit
and of the monetary policy stance in 2015, as well as a reform of the foreign exchange market should
help to stabilize the economy. Rigorous implementation of the budget, enhanced VAT management,
close monitoring of fiscal risks, and allowing for continued exchange rate flexibility will be key to
restoring macroeconomic stability. The central bank should stand ready to further tighten liquidity
conditions as needed. Work on an action plan to improve the profitability of the EMATUM fishing
company should be fast tracked to reduce its risk to the government budget.
“Significant progress has been made on structural reforms. To make Mozambique’s strong growth
performance more inclusive and broad based, the reform agenda needs to focus on enhancing
public financial management, including budget controls and fiscal transparency, and developing the
institutional framework and building capacity to prepare for the management of natural resource
wealth. Priority should also be given to reforming the energy sector, improving access to financial
services, and strengthening the business environment. A vigorous debt management strategy will be
crucial to address the challenges of significant infrastructure gaps at a time when debt vulnerabilities
have been rising.”
The Executive Board also completed the 2015 Article IV Consultation with Mozambique.
Despite lower commodity prices and a weaker global environment, Mozambique’s economic
prospects remain positive given planned massive investment in natural resources. While GDP growth
averaged 7 percent over the last five years, Mozambique’s per-capita income ($624 in 2014) and
human development index (178 out of 187 countries) remain low. There is a need to continue
implementing policies that support fiscal sustainability, infrastructure investment, and inclusive
growth.
Mozambique’s economic outlook remains robust. Growth of 6.3 percent is expected in 2015, and
remains below potential at 6.5 percent in 2016, mainly due to a stagnant mining sector and
substantially tighter fiscal and monetary policies. Over the medium term, growth is projected to
recover to 7.5–8 percent, supported by massive investment in natural gas projects and higher coal
production if key agreements can be reached for coal and gas sector development. Inflation is
expected to increase towards the BM’s medium target of 5–6 percent, due to the recent depreciation
of the metical and adjustments in administered prices.
Balance of payments pressures are increasing and the exchange rate has depreciated substantially.
While the overall current account is improving due to a decline in import-intensive megaproject
investments (given the end of the gas exploration phase), the non-megaproject current account has
continued to worsen, intensifying pressures in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange

3
market pressures, first experienced in late 2014 and early 2015, subsided during April–July but have
since re-emerged. The non-megaproject current account deficit largely drives these pressures in the
domestic foreign exchange market. During July 2014–June 2015, this deficit worsened by $1.7 billion
compared to the previous 12 months. This deterioration was caused by lower commodity prices and
declining FDI and external aid, while imports remained dynamic owing to strong domestic demand
fueled by expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. The depreciation of the metical has so far not
had a noticeable impact on import demand.
The fiscal consolidation agreed under the PSI program has been implemented by the new
administration. Following election-related fiscal slippages in 2014, the 2015 budget started to place
public finances on a more sustainable path through a reduction of about 1.5 percent of GDP
(excluding one-off factors in 2014) in public spending. The main objective of fiscal policy in 2016 is to
ensure debt sustainability and contribute to the required external adjustment.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that while Mozambique’s economic growth remains robust, lower
commodity prices and a decline in foreign direct investment and donor support have adversely
affected the economy and generated a temporary balance of payments gap. Directors commended
the actions taken by the authorities to maintain macroeconomic stability and agreed that continued
strong commitment to prudent policies and deeper structural reforms under the Fund-supported
program is essential to reduce vulnerabilities and foster sustainable and inclusive growth.
Directors supported the tighter monetary policy stance and encouraged the authorities to take
further action, as needed, to curb inflationary pressures and improve the foreign exchange market.
Continued exchange rate flexibility would help safeguard foreign reserves and absorb the impact of
external shocks. Directors supported the efforts to strengthen the financial sector and encouraged
the authorities to fully implement their Financial Sector Development Strategy so as to improve
access to small and medium-sized enterprises.
Directors commended the authorities for substantially scaling back external borrowing in light of
rising risks of debt distress. Going forward, they called for rigorous budget implementation by
strengthening the management of VAT, reducing wage bill growth, and closely monitoring fiscal
risks, especially those arising from government guarantees and public enterprises. Directors
highlighted the urgent need to develop an action plan to improve the profitability of the EMATUM
fishing company.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

4
Directors commended the progress on structural reforms, including on the mining and hydrocarbon
legislation which should facilitate further investments in the large natural gas projects. They
encouraged a renewed focus on enhancing budget controls and fiscal transparency and developing
the institutional framework and building capacity to prepare for the management of natural resource
wealth. Directors welcomed the recent adjustments in electricity tariffs and advised the authorities to
accelerate fuel subsidy reforms, while protecting the most vulnerable segments of the population.
Directors emphasized that fostering financial inclusion and improving the business environment
would help make Mozambique’s strong growth more inclusive and broad-based. They called for
greater emphasis on the effective use of public resources, transparent investment project analysis
and prioritization, and vigorous debt management strategy, given the significant infrastructure gaps
and rising debt vulnerabilities.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
FIFTH REVIEW UNDER THE POLICY SUPPORT INSTRUMENT,
REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION OF ASSESSMENT CRITERIA,
AND REQUEST FOR AN 18-MONTH ARRANGEMENT UNDER
THE STANDBY CREDIT FACILITY

KEY ISSUES
Context and short-term policy challenges. Despite some deceleration, growth is still
robust (in the 6-7 percent range in 2015-16) and inflation remains low. However, the
economy has been increasingly affected by lower commodity prices and a decline in
foreign exchange inflows. As a result, a balance of payments gap has emerged and the
exchange rate has depreciated substantially. While policy commitments undertaken at the
time of the 4th review were followed, performance under the PSI has been less than
satisfactory, NIR declined significantly as a result of external shocks and three quantitative
assessment criteria missed at end-June 2015. The monetary policy stance was tightened
with delays despite the loss in NIR and proved to be too accommodating. Greater
progress has been achieved on structural reforms, despite some implementation delays.
Against this backdrop, the authorities requested an arrangement under the standby credit
facility (SCF) supported by a strong policy package of corrective measures that includes
further fiscal adjustment, continued exchange rate flexibility, and tight liquidity
management. These measures are essential in the short term to preserve macroeconomic
stability, improve the international reserve position, and continue to attract foreign
investment (including in the oil and gas sectors) to support growth. Key structural reform
priorities include improving VAT administration, strengthening capacity for transparent
public investment management, and deepening financial sector reforms.
Medium-term reforms. Maintaining fiscal discipline will be essential to preserve debt
sustainability. This will require measures to contain current spending pressures and
greater rigor and transparency in the analysis and selection of public investment projects.
Structural reforms focusing on public financial management, managing natural resources,
modernization of the framework for monetary policy, and further improving the business
environment should be implemented vigorously to sustain growth and render it more
inclusive.
Staff supports completion of the review and the request for the SCF arrangement
(180 percent of quota or approximately $285 million, with a first disbursement of
75 percent of quota or about $120 million). While quantitative performance was less
than satisfactory, the implementation of the structural reform agenda is adequate given

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

existing capacity constraints. The new government has also demonstrated strong
commitment to policy adjustment, including through fiscal consolidation in the 2016
budget, adjustments in monetary policy instruments in late 2015, and new commitments
to further structural reforms.

CONTEXT
1.
Despite lower commodity prices and a weaker global environment, Mozambique’s
economic prospects remain positive given planned massive investment in natural resources.
While GDP growth averaged 7 percent over the last five years, Mozambique’s per-capita income
($624 in 2014) and human development index (178 out of 187 countries) remain low. There is a need
to continue implementing policies that support fiscal sustainability, infrastructure investment, and
inclusive growth. Over the medium term, efforts to develop a sound framework to manage natural
resource wealth should be stepped up.
2.
Political tension remains a risk factor. Failure to find a permanent solution to the growing
tension between the ruling Frelimo party and the main opposition party (Renamo), which is calling
for greater political decentralization, could negatively affect the business environment. While the risk
of a return to an outright civil war is low, the government’s attempt to disarm Renamo has resulted
in violent clashes with the police. Peaceful negotiations are essential to preserve macroeconomic
stability and investor confidence at a time when Mozambique is facing new economic challenges.
3.
Following policy slippages in 2014, the economy has been significantly affected by
lower commodity prices and a decline in foreign exchange inflows. This has resulted in slower
export growth, lower net international reserves (NIR), and a marked depreciation of the metical vis-àvis the dollar. While the authorities tightened the fiscal stance and monetary policy following the 4th
review under the PSI, renewed market pressures since the summer have led to a further depreciation
of the metical (see para 7) and lower NIR. As a result, the authorities have requested a standby credit
facility (SCF) to supplement the PSI to address the present balance of payments (BOP) need and
shore up reserves, which will also provide a strong signal to markets of their intent to stabilize the
economic and financial situation.

depreciation of the metical against the US
-2
dollar, 12-month inflation stood at 2.4
percent in September because of a more
moderate depreciation against the South
African rand, low food prices, and stable administered prices (fuels, public transportation, and
utilities). The depreciation and increases in administered prices (bread and electricity) in OctoberNovember are likely to push end-2015 inflation to around 5 percent.

5.
The new administration has been implementing the fiscal consolidation agreed under
the PSI program. Following election-related fiscal slippages in 2014, the 2015 budget started to
place public finances on a more sustainable path through a reduction of about 1½ percent of GDP
(excluding one-off factors in 2014) in public spending. For the first nine months of the year, spending
was broadly in line with program targets while revenues underperformed by a small margin.
However, in June, the government made a lump sum payment of about $100 million (0.6 percent of
GDP) to fuel distributors to compensate them for past losses generated by regulated fuel prices,
which reflected under-budgeting for

fuel subsidies. In addition, delays in

largely drives these pressures in the

During July 2014-June 2015, this deficit
worsened by $1.7 billion compared to
the previous 12 months. This
deterioration was caused by lower commodity prices and declining FDI and external aid, while
imports remained dynamic owing to strong domestic demand fueled by expansionary fiscal and
monetary policies. The depreciation of the metical has so far not had a noticeable impact on import
demand.
7.
The net international reserves (NIR) of the Bank of Mozambique (BM) continued to
decline. In an attempt to stabilize the foreign exchange market, the BM intervened heavily during
late 2014 to early 2015, resulting in a $700 million decline in NIR. The BM has virtually stopped
discretionary intervention since April and allowed the exchange rate to adjust (with a 33 percent
year-on-year depreciation against the US dollar by mid-November 2015, the second largest
depreciation in sub-Saharan African countries during the same period), but its longstanding
commitment to supply US dollars to cover fuel imports2 and the government’s payment of EMATUM
debt service falling due in September drove NIR down to $2.1 billion by end-October. 3 The BM kept
reserve money growth in line with commitments in the 4th PSI review, resulting in a gradual
deceleration of credit growth, to 23 percent in September compared to 28 percent in end-2014.

Capital flows associated with megaprojects are often used to finance imports. Megaprojects are often exempt from
FX legislation and are also allowed in some cases to keep a large share of their dollar earnings offshore.
2

This is a commitment made by the BM at the time of the 2008-09 global crisis to inject confidence in the thin
foreign exchange market.
3

The government guaranteed the $850 million bond issued in 2013 by the state-owned enterprise EMATUM. This
borrowing financed the purchase of tuna fishing boats and maritime security equipment. Subsequently, $500 million
out of the total $850 million was incorporated into the budget and became public debt under the responsibility of the
treasury. The remaining amount ($350 million) remains on EMATUM’s balance sheet.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on a policy adjustment package underpinning an 18-month SCF arrangement
in response to the temporary external shocks and BOP needs. The SCF would supplement but not
replace the current PSI. As regards surveillance issues, the discussions focused on medium-term
policies to achieve fiscal consolidation, maintain an adequate level of international reserves,
strengthen the capacity for managing natural resource wealth, and reinvigorate the structural
reform agenda to promote inclusive growth and financial sector development.

agreements can be
reached for coal and gas sector development.4 Inflation is expected to increase towards the BM’s
medium target of 5-6 percent, due to the recent depreciation of the metical and adjustments in
administered prices.5
10.
Economic risks are substantial. In the short term, construction of liquefied natural gas
(LNG) plants could be significantly delayed if the ongoing negotiations between the authorities
and gas companies are not completed by the end of the year. Over the longer run, persistently
weak international commodity prices and significant slowdowns in China and other key
economies might delay the expansion of coal mining projects and dampen growth. If these risks
materialize, the recovery of growth to 7-8 percent could be delayed by a few years, while the
growth rate would remain above 6 percent owing to the expected growth of non-mining sectors.
4

In the natural gas sector, such agreements between the government and concessionaries would trigger massive
FDI in LNG processing facilities (starting from the second half of 2016) and pave the way for LNG exports by
2021. In the coal sector, agreements need to be reached to unlock financing for the completion of the Nacala rail
corridor, which would triple coal export volumes by 2017. In the latter part of October, negotiations between the
government and the investors were in full swing.
5

Bread prices were adjusted in October and electricity prices in November, with an estimated average increase of
about 20 percent in the latter case.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

As a tail risk event, low international gas prices could cause significant delays in the gas projects
for several years, although the oil and gas companies still remain confident in the feasibility of
their projects.6 In addition, new concessions awarded in October 2015 could generate additional
investment in the oil and gas sector.
11.
The depreciation of the metical has heightened Mozambique’s debt vulnerability,
implying a need for cautious future borrowing. With most public debt issued in foreign
currency, the depreciation raised the present value of external debt to almost 40 percent of GDP
at end-2015 (from 30 percent at end-2014). The updated DSA shows that Mozambique’s external
debt rating remains moderate, but debt level indicators are now closer to a high risk rating, and
the risk to overall public debt is now heightened.7 Maintaining debt sustainability will require
vigorous fiscal discipline in line with the authorities’ program, a strong focus on contracting debt
mostly on concessional terms, and increased prioritization among investment projects. Such
prioritization is also important as debt service has started to increase sharply with the start of
repayments on EMATUM debt, even if it remains manageable overall. The present value of debt
is expected to decrease somewhat below 40 percent of GDP during 2016-19 before declining to
less than 20 percent by the mid-2020s because of a higher GDP (LNG production).

6

The sizable current account deficits projected in the medium term are driven by large gas projects financed by
FDI and private debt. It will not pose a significant BOP risk to the extent that the implied imports are financed
directly by these inflows.
7

The Debt Sustainability Framework applies a method based on probabilities of default to borderline cases
within a range of +/- 5 percent of the threshold values. According to this alternative method, Mozambique’s
probability of default is clearly moderate, implying that its overall moderate rating is maintained.

B. Short-Term Challenge: Responding to Balance of Payments Shocks
12.
The central bank’s NIR have declined markedly in 2015, mostly due to a series of
external shocks. Cumulative losses in NIR amounted to $1.1 billion between September 2014
and October 2015 as foreign exchange inflows declined substantially due to: (i) Mozambique’s
exports being hit by sharp declines in international commodity prices from late 2014, both for
commodity and traditional exports; (ii) foreign direct investment in the natural gas sector coming
to a halt, with the exploration phase concluded and investment in processing facilities awaiting
finalization of key production agreements between the government and concessionaires;
(iii) absence of revenues from capital gain taxes in 2015 (which had supported the budget and
NIR levels in 2013-14) and (iv) declines in external aid flows. Unforeseen renewed pressures since
June (Box 2) have rendered the end-2015 target agreed at the time of the fourth review
unattainable (see paragraphs 6, 7).
13.
While significant policy adjustment is now underway to ensure that reserves are
safeguarded, a more timely policy reaction would have been preferable. The authorities
implemented measures agreed in the fourth review; in particular, the fiscal deficit is projected to
decline to 6.0 percent of GDP in 2015 from 10.4 percent in 2014. However, import demand has
thus far remained high—partly due to a lingering impact of the major 2014 fiscal policy
slippages—although the authorities let the exchange rate depreciate (see above) and the metical
is now being broadly fairly valued (Annex 1). Given the adverse shocks to external inflows, import
levels have become unsustainable and a more immediate policy reaction would have been
preferable to redress the situation. Especially, a tighter monetary stance than agreed at the time
of the fourth review would have been desirable to counteract NIR losses. Adherence to the initial
reserve money targets meant that the central bank was reinjecting through open market
operations part of the domestic currency liquidity that was being withdrawn through foreign
exchange sales. This impaired the automatic adjustment mechanism to the balance of payment
pressures.



Foreign direct investment for megaprojects has come to a halt—halving during the first semester of
2015—with finalization of key production agreements between the government and concessionaires
taking longer than expected previously, delaying investments in coal infrastructure in LNG
processing facilities.1



Aid disbursements have continued their longer-term downward trend in 2015, in contrast to fourth
review projections which proved too optimistic in projecting a slight rebound.

Finally, the BM’s international reserves, when evaluated in US dollars, suffered from further valuation
losses after June as a result of continued dollar strength.

Although only a relatively small proportion of this investment spent on procurement of domestic value added,
the additional impact is notable, given the sheer size of such investment and its steep decline.

14.
Further policy adjustments are required to stabilize the BOP and start rebuilding
international reserves. Policy adjustment is most critical to stabilize the BOP, with Fund
financing filling the remaining financing gap and ensuring that other donor support proceeds as
planned. Policy adjustment is projected to reduce imports by about $1 billion per year and will
make the BOP sustainable after its full impact has materialized by the end of the 18-month SCF
program. Fund financing amounts to SDR 204.5 million (approximately $285 million) over the
course of the program and is expected to serve a catalytic role. In the near term, the authorities’
ongoing engagement with the Fund ensures that planned World Bank disbursements, including
for budget support, go ahead as planned. In 2016 and beyond, the engagement will continue to
underpin confidence of the broader donor community.
15.
Staff and the authorities agreed on a policy mix based on three interrelated pillars
designed to allow rebuilding of reserves to commence in 2016. These three pillars are
(1) further fiscal adjustment of two percent of GDP, which will generate a reduction in the overall
fiscal deficit to 4 percent of GDP in 2016 (the projected 6.0 percent of GDP in 2015 is already
significantly lower than programmed); (2) the monetary policy tightening cycle initiated in
October and intensified in November; and (3) reforming the FX market and allow for continued
exchange rate flexibility. These policies will be supported by a gradual phasing out of the
guaranteed sales of US dollars for fuel imports8 and minimal discretionary intervention to
smooth out exchange rate volatility, with the authorities standing ready to undertake further
policy adjustment to safeguard reserves in case BOP pressures remain higher than expected. The
front-loaded implementation of this corrective policy package, with the planned adoption of the
2016 budget by mid-December 2015 and the implementation of the monetary and foreign
exchange market measures in November 2015, aim at providing support to the shoring up of
reserves right from the start of the program. The policy mix will be supported by an ambitious
structural reform agenda with an added emphasis on critical PFM reforms and managing fiscal
risks on public enterprises (including EMATUM).
16.
As a result of the policy adjustment under the SCF/PSI, NIR are expected to bottom
out during the first half of 2016 before resuming a path of gradual recovery that would
return import coverage ratios back to comfortable levels. Given the level of NIR in October
2015 and projected foreign disbursements for the remainder of the year, the end-2015 NIR level
is projected to be just above $2 billion. The tightening of monetary and fiscal policies should
restrain imports significantly in 2016, adding to the lagged impact of the substantial depreciation
of the metical. Policy adjustment, together with an expected modest resumption of FDI, should
result in sufficient dollar liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market by mid-2016 to allow
the BM to discontinue interventions for fuel imports and gradually start purchasing dollars to
rebuild reserves. Import coverage of gross international reserves is projected to increase to

8

The phasing out results from the impact of the corrective policy package on imports demand, which will
materialize with some lags. In the meantime, the BM needs to continue to stand ready to provide sufficient
foreign exchange to the commercial banks to avoid any interruption in fuel supplies.

4.5 months of non-megaproject imports by end-2016 (from 4.2 months of imports at end-2015).9
The shallowness and current illiquidity of the interbank foreign exchange market impair the
central bank’s ability to purchase significant amounts of foreign exchange in the market and to
pursue significantly more ambitious NIR targets in 2016.
Fiscal Policy
17.
The main objective of fiscal policy in 2016 is to ensure debt sustainability and
contribute to the required external adjustment. In 2016, net domestic financing will be
slightly negative (0.2 percent of GDP), which will contribute negatively to money creation and
help prevent crowding out pressures. Beyond 2016, the main objective will be to put debt
accumulation on a downward path. In that regard, the authorities concurred with staff’s
recommendation on a more rapid fiscal consolidation in the medium term than envisaged in the
4th review. With regards to external borrowing, the program targets are set based on the
authorities’ appropriately prudent 2016 borrowing plan Reflecting the Fund’s updated debt limits
policy, targets are now present-value based and cover total external borrowing instead of nonconcessional borrowing only (see the authorities’ borrowing plan in Tables 8. 9). By eliminating a
rigid concessionality threshold, they should afford the authorities more flexibility in loan
negotiations.

In light of rising debt levels and persistent BOP pressures,
MEFP ¶9
staff and the authorities agreed on a significantly tighter fiscal
stance in 2016 (see text table below) to underpin the SCF. The overall
fiscal deficit (after grants) is projected to decline by 2 percentage points of GDP to 4 percent of
GDP in 2016 and the domestic primary balance would improve by about 2¼ percent of GDP,
significantly more than previously envisaged.
19.
Total revenues are projected to expand by 1 percent of GDP in 2016. This increase is
expected to be generated by (i) strong performance in international trade taxes—as the

¹ IMF Neutral adjusts for one-off receipts and expenses. Revenues exclude USD 520 million capital gain taxes for the natural resource sector
(or 3.1 percent of GDP), while expenditures exclude one-off maritime security spending of 2.8 percent of GDP (EMATUM), and temporary
election-related expenditures (0.8 percent of GDP).

20.
Fiscal adjustment is driven by a reduction of about 1½ percent of GDP in public
spending relative to 2015. A substantial part of the fiscal adjustment will fall on current
spending, including subsidies and the wage bill, but public investment will be adjusted
downward as well in line with implementation capacity and more rigorous selection criteria.


The government is committed to further reducing the wage bill by 0.2 percentage
point of GDP in 2016 through a deceleration in the pace of new hiring and by stronger
administrative controls on salary payments. The latter will involve (i) requirements to
regularly produce "proofs of life" statements for all civil servants, and (ii) strict limits on new
hiring in non priority sectors (i.e., excluding the health, education, agriculture and police
sectors).



At current international oil prices, no provision for fuel subsidies is required in the
2016 budget. Should international oil prices increase, the government indicated that they
will consider adjustments in the price setting formula to prevent the need for new subsidies.
If the formula cannot be adjusted in a timely manner for political economy reasons, any
subsidies accrued would be financed through downward adjustments in other non-priority
spending to ensure the achievement of the budget target.



Public investment projects will be subject to more rigorous evaluation procedures to
enhance investment efficiency and ensure greater value for money. No project
exceeding $50 million will be authorized for inclusion in the multi-year list of priority

investment without a prior feasibility study from the sectors and a technical evaluation by the
Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF).

The mission and the authorities agreed that the envisaged fiscal adjustment should be
implemented without negatively affecting critical social programs.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
21.
Decisive action is required to curb inflationary pressures and help stabilize the
foreign exchange market. Staff commended the BM on its decision to initiate a cycle of
monetary tightening in its October Monetary Policy Committee meeting. Staff and the authorities
agreed on the need to further tighten monetary policy, given the
worsening foreign exchange market conditions and the loss of NIR
MEFP ¶5
and to attempt to reduce dollar hoarding behavior by increasing the
attractiveness of holding deposits in domestic currency. Depreciation is
being passed through to domestic prices, which, together with several expected adjustments in
administered prices, is expected to push inflation above the BM’s target range of 5-6 percent by
end-2016. The BM raised the required reserve requirement by 100 basis points in October and
again by 150 basis points in November. It also increased its standing lending (FPC) rate by
25 basis points and its standing deposit (FPD) rates by 50 basis points in October, with a further
50 basis point increase in the FPC rate and 75 basis point increase in the FPD rate in November. It
is expected that this tightening will reduce credit growth and the demand for dollars in the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

foreign exchange market. The mission and BM also agreed on the need to keep reserve money
growth at 12 percent in 2016, somewhat below nominal GDP growth, representing a significant
deceleration compared to previous years, and tightening monetary policy further in 2016 should
the pressures on the foreign exchange market and inflation persist.
22.
The BM took action to remove the distortion in the foreign
exchange market (MCI), which had previously skewed commercial
MEFP ¶33
banks’ demand for interventions by the BM. The BM intervenes in
the market through the MCI computer screen, based on buying and selling quotes posted by 16
participating banks. Besides the MCI system, these banks also negotiated and traded outside the
system, at exchange rates that did not always correspond to the MCI rates due to the
shallowness and illiquidity of the interbank foreign exchange market. The spread between the
BM’s intervention rate and the interbank rate increased since the last review under the PSI,
generating incentives for commercial banks to mobilize foreign exchange from the BM instead of
purchasing them from their clients. In November, banks quoted buy and sale rates on the MCI
computer screen consistent with the interbank rate, hence bringing this spread to zero.

C. Medium-Term Reforms: Strengthening Institutions and Preparing for
Managing Natural Resource Wealth
Fiscal Reforms
23.
The authorities need to continue strengthening budget controls and fiscal
transparency. The government has expanded gradually the coverage
of its integrated information management systems for expenditure
MEFP ¶15-19
tracking (e-SISTAFE) and wage payments (e-Folha), as well as the
treasury single account. However, e-SISTAFE is still not used adequately. Most budgetary
transactions, in particular commitments and verifications, are not entered in the system in real
time, which weakens budgetary controls and may result in line ministries exceeding their budget
appropriations and accumulating extra-budgetary spending. To this end, staff stressed the
importance of aligning the three traditional stages of expenditure recording (commitment,
verification, issuance of the payment order) with the actual timing of the various budgetary
transactions by June 2016 (structural benchmark).
24.
Although the 2015 budget projected revenues on a net basis and current VAT
collections are recorded net of refund payments, the implementation of the net VAT
system has encountered difficulties. This has led to the accumulation of
around $50 million of arrears by end-October 2015. The authorities
MEFP ¶23
agreed on the importance of securing enough funds to reimburse the
taxpayers in due time, by creating a dedicated subaccount to be regularly
replenished with an amount equivalent to the refund claims received. This should be operational
from the beginning of 2016 (proposed structural benchmark). Staff welcomes the authorities’
prudent decision to start recording net VAT collections on the basis of the refund claims
received, even if these have not yet been verified and paid, by end-2015.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

25.
Staff urged the authorities to closely monitor fiscal risks
MEFP ¶20, 32
and public enterprises, and to adopt an action plan to improve
the profitability of EMATUM. In November, the government
published a fiscal risks statement to ensure greater transparency and better informed fiscal
decisions (structural benchmark). The statement pays special attention to risks associated with
government guarantees and public enterprises. Staff is encouraged by the authorities’ intention
to create a fiscal risk unit in the MEF to provide strategic advice to the minister in a timely
manner. The government also intends to adopt an action plan which aims at improving
profitability of EMATUM by April 2016 (structural benchmark).
26.
Staff urged the authorities to continue to strengthen debt
management. Staff commended the new government on the measures
MEFP ¶13
taken to slow down new external borrowing, but cautioned on the
negative effect of the depreciation of the metical on Mozambique’s capacity to service its
external debt, as shown in the DSA update (see above). The government is revising its Debt
Management Strategy with emphasis on fostering the development of the domestic capital
markets, and is regularly producing annual domestic borrowing plans and debt reports. Staff
stressed that the government needs to continue to strengthen debt management to avoid
further external debt arrears, in particular by improving reconciliation with creditors.
27.
Enhancing public investment efficiency and ensuring greater
MEFP ¶12
value for money remains crucial, but reform implementation efforts
should be stepped up. Staff welcomed the requirement for mandatory
assessments by the Investment Evaluation Committee of all public investment projects exceeding
$50 million in the 2016 budget, but stressed the need for the application of more rigorous
evaluation procedures to select public investment projects and the improvement of project
implementation monitoring and evaluation. The government is expecting to benefit from a
forthcoming FAD mission to introduce PIMA, a new tool to assess public investment.
Energy Sector Reforms
28.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the importance of
MEFP ¶11
taking steps to initiate crucial reforms in the energy sector. Staff
welcomed the long overdue increase in electricity tariffs in November,
which should help contain the operational losses of the National Electricity Company (EDM).10
Fuel prices have not been adjusted since 2011 and the fuel subsidy paid in 2014 showed that the
current price mechanism can be costly and inefficient.11 At current international prices, retail fuel
prices are no longer subsidized, which provides an opportunity for reform. Following a recent

10

The tariff increase ranges from 18 percent (domestic/household tariff) to close to 50 percent (large consumers).
The “social” and “agriculture” tariffs have not been changed. It is estimated that the weighted average tariff
increase is approximately 20 percent.
11

About half of the subsidy in 2014 was mis-targeted and only two percent reached the poorest 10 percent of
the population.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

FAD TA mission, staff recommended streamlining the automatic price-setting formula through
the introduction of reference pricing and implementation of an automatic fuel pricing
mechanism with a smoothing component as early as possible in 2016. The authorities argued
that additional studies on the fuel market, including on the need to reform the centralized fuel
importing system, are needed and that they are also considering measures needed to mitigate
the impact on the most vulnerable.
Monetary and Financial Sector Reforms
29.
The BM continues to strengthen its analytical tools and
MEFP ¶34-38
monetary policy operations framework. An enhanced inflation
forecasting model has been developed and is currently being used to
inform
decisions by the Monetary Policy Committee. Efforts to improve the
liquidity forecasting model, with IMF technical assistance, are also
MEFP ¶39-44
ongoing. The law that requires 20 percent withholding tax on
interests earned on T-bills, OTs, secured and unsecured interbank transactions has been enforced
since May 2015 (structural benchmark). Allowing T-bonds as collateral in money market
operations, another important reform for developing domestic financial markets, and enhancing
the monetary policy transmission mechanism experienced some further delays due to the need
for new regulations. This reform is now expected to become operational in December 2015
(structural benchmark). Staff stressed the need for deepening domestic financial markets, as high
degrees of concentration in both the deposit base and credit have contributed to structurally
high deposit and lending rates and hampered the adjustment of market interest rates in
response to policy rate changes, a key monetary policy transmission channel.12
30.
Reforms to strengthen bank supervision, crisis management tools, and financial
sector development are ongoing. Despite the depreciation of the metical, bank soundness
indicators suggest that banks are well capitalized and profitable, with low non-performing loans
(NPLs). This could be due to the limited open positions that most banks have in dollars, and the
high provisioning requirements for foreign currency loans to non-exporters that discourages
dollar-denominated lending. Stress tests also point to a resilient banking system, with credit
concentration remaining the main source of risk. The monetary tightening cycle just initiated
should help to slow down the trend of rapid credit expansion.13 As NPLs could rise during the
expected downturn of the credit cycle, staff urged the BM to monitor credit risks closely and
require the banks to maintain adequate capitals. Staff welcomed the continued effort in
implementing the Financial Sector Contingency Plan, including the BM’s intention to adopt an
Action Plan aimed at addressing the issues observed during the simulation exercise by March
2016 (proposed structural benchmark). Vigorous implementation of the Financial Sector
Development Strategy 2013-22 is required to solve the perennial difficulty of access to credit by
12

Selected Issued paper.

13

Given the less developed financial markets, the interaction between the financial cycle and the real economy
appears to be limited. While booming credit could have contributed to growth, the risk of problem loans also
increased.

24

small and medium-sized enterprises and foster financial inclusion. In this regard, the Law on the
Creation of Private Credit Registry Bureaus has been adopted in July, while the launch of the
National Financial Inclusion Strategy is expected this year.
Managing Natural Resource Wealth
31.
Negotiations between the authorities and the oil and gas companies should
continue to move forward to allow final investment decisions in near future. Even with
recent subdued commodity prices, including LNG prices, gas development companies remain
confident in the viability of the LNG projects. However, further delays in the negotiations would
result in lower FDI inflows in the short run and delay the expected benefits on growth and fiscal
revenues.
32.
Staff updated the analysis on the macroeconomic implication of the LNG projects. If
the LNG projects are implemented along the current schedule, the LNG
sector will significantly contribute to growth during the early-2020s and
MEFP ¶27-30
output from the sector will account for more than half of GDP in the mid2020s. However, the fiscal revenues from the projects would become significant only by the mid2020s, and current account balance would turn into surplus only in 2025, due to cost recovery of
investment. The authorities should initiate work to develop a medium-term fiscal framework and
a formal fiscal rule to (i) inform future saving and investment decisions, (ii) manage volatility, and
(iii) address exhaustibility concerns. They should take into consideration various risk factors
including lower gas prices when the spending and borrowing plans are constructed and
implemented. Staff welcomed the ex-ante rule for the use of windfall revenue in the 2015 Budget
Law (structural benchmark), which seeks to limit the use of these resources only for public
investment, debt repayment, and national emergencies.
33.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s analysis and remain committed to further
strengthening capacity building and enhancing transparency in natural resource wealth
management. With technical assistance from the Fund, the authorities have been strengthening
the legal framework for the natural resource sector and the capacity of tax authorities in revenue
collection and forecasts. Mozambique has compiled EITI reports and has been enhanced
transparency of its natural resource management. The authorities should further strengthen their
capacity for developing and operationalizing the medium-term fiscal strategy.
Other Reforms and Issues
34.
Improving the business environment remains crucial to promote enterprises and
job creation. Mozambique’s performance has edged down in the 2016 World Bank’s Doing
Business index, being ranked at the 133th position (128th in the previous report). Decisive action is
necessary to address difficulties in obtaining credit by SMEs and reduce the excessive time
prospective investors devote to starting a new business. Nevertheless, staff commends the
authorities for integrating eight provinces into e-BAU, an IT platform aimed at providing online
services to the business community. The authorities estimate that, as a result of this reform, the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

number of days taken for licensing economic activities was reduced from fifteen to a maximum
of three on average in all the affected provinces. By July 2016, the remaining three provinces
(Manica, Zambezia, and Niassa) and all municipalities and provincial capitals should also be
integrated into the e-BAU platform.
35.
Statistics and data availability. While the statistical system is broadly adequate to
support surveillance and program monitoring, enhanced dissemination and regular transmission
of data to the Fund are required. Weaknesses exist, particularly in the areas of national accounts,
government finance, balance of payments, and external debt statistics. The authorities should
further enhance the quality and frequency of data dissemination, supported by technical
assistances from the Fund and other agencies.

PROGRAM ISSUES
36.
The SCF would have an 18-month duration. Its objective will be to alleviate the
external shock through the first part of 2017, while maintaining the PSI’s existing objectives of
strengthening macroeconomic stability, investing in infrastructure and social sectors, fostering
inclusive growth, and building capacity in investment planning and debt management and
management of natural resource wealth. The monitoring of the program would be synchronized
with the PSI.
37.
Frontloading. The BOP need will be highest in 2015 (Table 7) and the beginning of 2016,
as imports will gradually adjust to policy tightening and exchange rate depreciation. This justifies
a front-loading of the SCF disbursements. Adjustment in 2016 and the tripling of coal export
capacity in 2017 (Nacala railways project) will gradually phase out the BOP need in 2017.
38.
The requested access is in line with the new SCF norms, which provide an
adequately-sized buffer of 180 percent of quota (approximately $285 million). The
proposed first disbursement (75 percent of quota or about $120 million) is proposed to become
available upon approval of the arrangement in late 2015, followed by three semi-annual
disbursements of 35 percent (about $55 million) of quota each. A safeguards assessment,
required under the Fund’s safeguards policy, will be completed before the first review under the
SCF arrangement.
39.
The main risks to the program are: (i) political instability eroding program ownership;
(ii) further deterioration of the external environment; (iii) delays in the negotiation of large
investment projects in the natural resource sector; (iv) adverse weather conditions which would
significantly affect agricultural production; and (v) capacity constraints that can delay reform
implementation (including on revenue administration and budget execution).
40.
Small external arrears (totaling about US$ 1 million) to three different bilateral
creditors emerged. They occurred as a result of imperfect debt reconciliation with creditors and
a lapse in debt recording. These arrears have been promptly addressed by the authorities in
October after they became aware of their existence. The authorities furthermore envisage taking
measures to strengthen debt reconciliation with creditors to prevent any recurrence.

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

41.
Waivers are requested for the non-observance of three assessment criteria (ACs) for
June 2015 and modifications are proposed for four ACs for December 2015, to reflect
recent developments. A waiver for the non-observance of the AC on net credit to the
government at end-June 2015 is requested on the basis that the deviation is expected to be
temporary and has not affected the achievement of the program’s objectives, and the
government is implementing expenditure restraint measures to meet the December target.14 A
waiver for the non-observance of the AC on NIR is requested in light of the authorities’ corrective
actions. These comprise foreign exchange market reforms and monetary and fiscal tightening,
which will contain imports and allow a return to gradual reserve accumulation by mid 2016.
Together, these actions are expected to ensure that NIR only temporarily undercut and promptly
return to a prudent range of 4-4½ months of non-megaproject imports. A waiver for the nonobservance of the AC on external arrears is requested because the deviation has been minor and
temporary. Revised ACs on NCG, reserve money, and NIR for December 2015 are proposed to
reflect recent developments.
42.
Two structural benchmarks (SBs) are proposed to be rescheduled. The November
benchmark on the submission of the draft law on the establishment of a movable collateral
registry is proposed for rescheduling to March 2016 due to the complexity of this reform, which
may require the change of some other legislation. The January benchmark on the mandatory
requirement on the real-time recording of the commitment and verification of expenditures for
all units operating within e-SISTAFE is proposed for rescheduling to June 2016 due to technical
limitations.
43.
Performance criteria (PCs) (for end-June 2016), indicative targets (ITs) and new SBs
through end-2016 are proposed (MEFP Tables 1 and 2). The five new SBs proposed are aimed
at further strengthening public financial management and deepening financial sector reforms.

STAFF APPRAISAL
44.
Mozambique’s economic performance has been adversely affected by a series of
external shocks in 2015 and the lingering effects of the 2014 fiscal slippage. Lower
commodity prices, a decline in external aid, and markedly lower foreign direct investment
resulted in a worsening of the (non-megaproject) current account deficit and generated intense
balance of payment pressures. Excessively expansionary policies in 2014 (especially on the fiscal
side) and a late start in the monetary tightening cycle when BOP pressures intensified over the
summer also contributed to the current difficulties. While policy commitments at the time of the
4th review temporarily stopped the loss in NIR, renewed BOP pressures over the summer resulted
in a further significant drop in NIR and further depreciation in the metical. While reserve money
targets were met, monetary policy should have tightened liquidity conditions further at an earlier

14

The end-2015 NCG target includes a technical adjustment to incorporate the estimated discounting of the
treasury securities that were issued for clearing VAT backlogs (MT 8.2 billion, see paragraph 5) as it does not
represent new fiscal stimulus beyond the program. The underlying NCG target is MT 3.6 billion, compared to MT
th
4.9 billion in the 4 review.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

stage given the continuous drain in international reserves. In addition, payment by the
government in September of the first installments of guaranteed debt of the EMATUM company
and constraints on institutional capacity also contributed to weaker program performance.
45.
At the same time, staff commends the authorities for adopting a strong package of
corrective policy measures aimed at restoring external sustainability and preserving
adequate reserve levels. The government’s 2016 budget approved by Parliament envisages a
reduction in the overall fiscal deficit of 2 percent of GDP, returning to the prudent deficit levels
observed prior to the 2014 fiscal slippages (around 4 percent of GDP). The authorities are also to
be commended for their steps to reintroduce a more prudent borrowing policy and for taking
steps to ensure the return to a strong fiscal position. Similarly, the BM’s adjustments of reserve
requirements and key interest rates, in October and in November, help tighten liquidity
conditions and reduce FX pressures. The recent convergence of rates in the foreign exchange
market is crucial to prevent further losses of international reserves. The front-loaded
implementation of this corrective policy package will provide support to the shoring up of
reserves right from the start of the program.
46.
Despite these temporary difficulties, the medium-term macroeconomic outlook
remains positive. Mozambique’s strong track record of high growth is expected to continue
over the medium term on account of massive planned investment in natural resources. In that
regard, the successful conclusion of the negotiations between the government and the leading
concessionaires is of paramount importance. Delays in concluding the negotiations could be
quite costly and exacerbate balance of payment pressures in 2016-17 (as capital inflows would
be lower than currently projected). The positive medium-term outlook raises challenges of its
own, including the need for inclusive policies focusing public spending on social and pro-poor
programs and bridging infrastructure gaps. The staff is encouraged by the authorities’
commitment to further strengthen capacity building and enhance transparency in natural
resource wealth management.
47.
Given the strength of the authorities’ package of corrective policy measures, staff
recommends the completion of the fifth PSI review and supports the authorities’ request
for an eighteen-month SCF arrangement. While program performance has been less than
satisfactory, the authorities have taken corrective measures and committed to a strong policy
adjustment package which would help achieve the objectives of the SCF-supported program. In
particular, the government submitted a revised 2016 budget to the parliament in line with
program commitments, and the BM tightened the monetary policy stance in October and
November through increases in reserve requirements and key policy interest rates. The BM also
removed the distortions in the foreign exchange market. The authorities also committed to
medium term fiscal consolidation to ensure debt sustainability, further liquidity tightening if
pressures persist, exchange rate flexibility, and structural reforms aimed at strengthening fiscal
management and facilitating financial stability and development.
48.
Staff supports the request for waivers for the non-observance of three ACs at endJune 2015 on the basis that either the deviations were temporary and have not harmed the
achievement of the program objectives and that the authorities have made a strong
commitment to remedial actions. Staff also supports the authorities’ request to modify the

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

end-December 2015 ACs, the modification of three structural benchmarks, and the setting of PCs

Annex I. Mozambique: External Balance Assessment1
Data limitations surrounding megaproject-related activities imply that external stability
assessments for Mozambique are subject to considerable uncertainty. These limitations
relate in particular to identifying a current account and net international investment position
unrelated to megaprojects, which would describe accurately the country’s core economy. While
the Mozambican authorities produce accurate external sector data for megaprojects, only
exploratory data is available on domestic firms whose operations exclusively relate to
megaprojects.2 Based on this exploratory data and other considerations, staff has estimated
current account and IIP balances excluding all megaproject-related activities.3
Staff estimates on a non-megaproject-related external position illustrate that the current
account deteriorated after 2013. Like many LIDCs, Mozambique has traditionally run a current
account deficit, which stood at around 5 percent of GDP during 2006-09 and around 10 percent
of GDP more recently during 2010-13. The latter has been broadly consistent with a stable net
international investment position (IIP), while Mozambique’s IIP improved considerably during the
earlier period. However, there has been a considerable recent worsening of non-MP-related
current account deficits to 13½ and 14 percent of GDP in 2014 and 2015, respectively.
In absence of high megaproject investment activity, such higher non-megaproject-related
current account deficits are not sustainable. Megaproject inflows have collapsed and are
projected at less than $1 billion in 2015, given temporarily lower investment in the coal and gas
sectors while agreements between the government and private sector are negotiated. Although
the vast majority of these FDI inflows go into imports, their sheer size (of $4 billion on average
during 2012-14) implied that the even small leakage into domestic goods and services
constituted significant financing.

For instance, there are domestic firms engaged in extraction and processing steps for coal and exclusively sell
their services to megaprojects. The available data relates only to the coal sector for 2013 and suggests that, in
light of high outsourcing, the imports by MP-related domestic firms was likely larger than that of the coal MPs
themselves.
3

These other considerations include a doubling of “unclassified” non-MP imports between 2011 and 2012, as
megaprojects were strongly expanding, which can hardly be explained by the traditional economy alone.

In contrast, the non-megaproject financial account has remained comparably resilient.
Although they are expected to slow going forward, private sector FDI and loan inflows have thus
far maintained their pace of 2014, offsetting lower disbursements for public investment projects,
partly resulting from a slower pace of contracting external debt in the recent past. The nonmegaproject financial account in 2015 is therefore expected to net over $3.2 billion in inflows,
outstripping the 2012 ($3.2 billion) and 2013 totals ($2.7 billion)4 but falling short in magnitude
relative to 2014 ($3.7 billion).
Notably, there is no evidence of capital flight. Domestic agents retained their savings in the
country, although they have reportedly been keen to retain existing dollar deposits, possibly in
anticipation of further metical depreciation. While this has made the domestic foreign exchange
market more illiquid, there has not been capital flight. Capital flight would typically occur
through acquisition of portfolio investments or bank deposits abroad and would be registered
under “other” financial account flows (in Table 5). Rather, these “other” flows continue to be
heavily driven my megaprojects’ transactions (and changes in their trade credit positions in
particular). Of $1.1 billion in net outflows in this category in 2014, the non-megaproject economy
accounted for only for $100 million.5 This pattern has persisted in the first half of 2015 with the
non-megaproject economy only accounting for $16 million of the total $370 million in such
outflows.6
During 2016, macroeconomic adjustment is projected to reverse the current account
deterioration and thereby halt the decline in Mozambique’s non-megaproject-related IIP.
The current account deterioration has put the non-MP-related IIP on a declining path starting
from its peak of -47 percent of GDP in 2013. The deterioration resulted from overly expansive
fiscal policies in the run up to the 2014 elections, an overvalued exchange rate in the recent past,
and relatively loose monetary policy. With large capital gains tax windfalls and related boosts to
international reserves allowing considerable FX intervention, adjustment has been delayed.
However, the decisive adjustment started by the authorities in late 2015 is expected to return the
current account to below 10 percent of GDP from 2016 onwards and drive a gradual recovery in
the IIP from a projected 2016 level of -78 percent of GDP.

Adjusted to exclude the disbursement of the EMATUM bond of $782 million.

5

In each 2012 and 2013, the non-megaproject economy registered large inflows exceeding $1 billion in this
category, but this was driven by special factors: the contracting of the $780 million EMATUM bond in 2013 and
data issues in 2012, related to the ramping up of (MP-related) imports by domestic firms supplying exclusively
megaprojects. Meanwhile, in the decade up to 2011 the non-MP economy registered relatively stable inflows in
this category of about $100 million per year.
6

A reduction in such “other” outflows had already been projected previously, with net trade credits given by
megaprojects to importers of their products expanding at a much more moderate pace given lower commodity
prices. Nonetheless, such flows are difficult to project as they can be driven by lumpy transactions by
megaprojects. Thereby the magnitude of the reversal has thus far not been as strong as expected at the time of
the fourth review (which expected inflows in 2015), partly because reductions in megaprojects’ investment
activity would lead to a reduction in trade credit liabilities.

The metical depreciation since late 2014 is expected to assist the rebalancing. After having
been mostly stable during 2012-14, the nominal and real effective exchange rates depreciated by
about 10 percent between end-December 2014 and end-September 2015. Depreciation through
mid-November was more pronounced vis-à-vis the US dollar (25 percent), but more limited
versus the South African Rand (13 percent) in which many imports are invoiced. Impacts on
imports are still expected to materialize, including because some of the depreciation has
occurred in recent months.7
The External Balance Assessment (EBA) concludes that the metical is broadly fairly valued.
Although data limitations impose some uncertainty, the latest metical depreciation and effects of
adjustment measures are likely to have corrected much of the 5-10 percent overvaluation
assessed at the last review. Once their effects pass fully through into trade flows, the current
account deficit (excluding megaproject-related flows) is projected to contract from its 2015 level
of 14 percent of GDP to 9.8 percent in 2016 and remain in that range over the medium term. This
is in line with the current account norms derived under EBA-lite’s Current Account and External
Sustainability Approaches of 10 and 11½ percent of GDP, respectively. The Index REER Approach,
which is more responsive by directly evaluating exchange rates, supports this conclusion by
suggesting that the metical is at present broadly fairly valued.

7

During May to mid-November, depreciation was 19 percent versus the US dollar and 2½ percent versus the
Rand. The real effective exchange rate depreciated by 4 percent during May to September.

1/ The EBA considers a non-megaproject current account, which is further adjusted by indirect megaproject
imports related to services supplied to megaprojects by other domestic firms. This amount is estimated, while
BM continues to work on official statistics quantifying these imports.
2/ As in past analyses, the Tokarick (2010) elasticity is used to translate the current account gap into the implied
valuation, because it is derived on a small country assumption (see EBS/13/76, p. 81).

The Fund-supported program is designed to ensure that international reserves remain at
comfortable levels. The conclusions of the 4th review’s reserve adequacy assessment continue to
hold. This assessment judged 4.5 month of non-megaproject imports to be a prudent reserve
cover. End-2015 reserves are projected to cover 4.2 months of prospective imports, down from
5.0 months at end-2014. Under the program, reserves are projected to bottom out at 3.8 months
in early 2016, before recovering to 4.5 months by end-2016. More importantly, the program sets
the stage for Mozambique to return to a path of gradual long-run reserve accumulation to
withstand increasing amplitude of shocks that may result as its exports continue to shift toward
natural resources.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
Maputo, Mozambique
December 2, 2015
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
Since late 2014, the Mozambican economy has been increasingly affected by the decline in
international commodity prices, resulting in falling export receipts and FDI, significant
depreciation of the metical, and loss of international reserves. Despite severe challenges, the
growth outlook is robust and inflation remains low, and the Government of Mozambique is
taking policy measures to cope with the external shocks, including through fiscal adjustment and
tightening of monetary policy stance. To support our effort, we are requesting an eighteenmonth standby credit facility (SCF) arrangement to supplement the Policy Support Instrument
(PSI) to augment reserves and provide a strong signal of our intention to maintain
macroeconomic stability. The main objective of the SCF arrangement will be to alleviate the
external balance of payments shocks, and through strengthening macroeconomic stability, to
achieve the Government’s goals on poverty reduction and inclusive growth.
The Government of Mozambique requests the completion of the fifth review under the PSI and
the approval of the SCF arrangement. We also request the modification of three assessment
criteria for December 2015 to account for the changed environment and our revised
macroeconomic projections: the substantial decline in net international reserves amid strong
balance of payment pressures, the impact of private companies’ discounting of the treasury
securities for clearing VAT refund backlog on net credit to government, and the effects of the
increase in reserve requirement on reserve money. We also request (i) to set performance criteria
and indicative targets for end-June 2016, and indicative targets for end-March, end-September,
and end-December, (ii) to reschedule two existing structural benchmark and set new structural
benchmarks for 2015-16, in part reflecting the complexities in the implementation of structural
benchmarks. In support of this request, we are transmitting the attached Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), which reviews the implementation of the program
supported by the current PSI and establishes policy objectives and assessment criteria and
indicative targets for the short and medium term.
The Government is of the view that the policies outlined in the MEFP are adequate to achieve the
objectives of the PSI/SCF-supported program. We stand ready to take any further measures that
may become appropriate for this purpose.
48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

The Government will consult with the IMF on the adoption of these measures—at its own
initiative or whenever the Managing Director requests such a consultation—in advance of any
revision to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such
consultation.
The Government will provide the IMF with such information as the IMF may request to be able to
assess the progress made in implementing the economic and financial policies and achieving the
objectives of the program.
The Government authorizes the publication of this Letter of Intent, its attachments and the
associated staff report.

This MEFP (i) describes recent developments and performance of the Government‘s
economic program under the three-year Policy Support instrument (PSI) to date, and
(ii) elaborates on economic and structural policy intentions. It builds on the MEFP
underlying the Fourth PSI Review of June 2015.

I.

Recent Economic Developments and Performance Under the
Program

2.

In 2015, the performance of the Mozambican economy has remained robust.
However, the economy is facing in the short term growing challenges arising from lower
commodity prices, temporarily subdued foreign direct investments, and sharp
appreciation of the US dollar internationally.



Economic growth has moderated in 2015. Real GDP grew by 6.3 percent in the first
half of 2015, compared to an average 8 percent in the same period in the last two
years. This deceleration was partly driven by the floods in early 2015 and the slower
execution of fiscal expenditure due to the delay in the budget approval, although growth
in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors was better than anticipated. Mining sector
growth decelerated to 17 percent in the first half of 2015 from 29 percent in the first half
of 2014, reflecting lower international commodity prices and transportation constraints
that prevented the scaling up in coal production and exports. Performance also
weakened in the commerce and transport sectors due to the impact of the floods on
traffic flows of people and merchandise along the north-south highway in early 2015.



Inflation and monetary policy. In the past nine months, inflation has remained stable
and low, with a year-on-year rate of 2.4 percent in September 2015. The low inflationary
pressure reflects the increase in domestic food supply, the decline in the international
commodity prices and the relatively stable exchange rate of the Metical vis-à-vis the
South African Rand. Sound liquidity management in the banking system and unchanged
administered prices were other key drivers of low inflation by September.



Exchange rate. Since the last quarter of 2014, the Metical-dollar exchange rate has been
under pressure because of the strengthening of the US dollar in international markets, a
widening of the current account deficit exacerbated by the decline in commodity prices,
and continuously strong domestic demand for foreign currency, including for external
debt payment and fuel imports. Depreciation pressures were aggravated by lower
foreign aid and foreign direct investment in the context of an uncertain political
environment that followed the elections in late 2014.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

50

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE



External current account. In the first half of 2015, the current account deficit excluding
megaprojects deteriorated to $2.2 billion from $1.2 billion compared to the same period
last year, due to a 17 percent increase in imports and an absence of capital gains tax
inflows which contained the current account deficit in the first half of 2014. In light of the
international environment, traditional exports, which remained stable, could not provide
a counterweight. Including megaproject operations, the current account deficit
deteriorated only slightly. Total exports declined by 4.2 percent to $1.8 billion reflecting
the impact of lower commodity prices, including for heavy sands, coal and gas. Total
imports fell by 4.5 percent to $3.5 billion due to imports of megaprojects declining
steeply in line with a slowdown in their investment activities. This investment slowdown is
driving a decline in FDI and other financing inflows weighing on the external balance.



FDI, aid/loan disbursements, reserves. FDI flows into the country registered a year-onyear decline of 17 percent in the first half of 2015, mainly related to the slowdown of
investments in the mining industry, particularly gas and coal. External aid inflows declined
by 14 percent in the first half of the year. As a result, net international reserves declined
to $2.2 billion at end-September 2015 (corresponding to about 3.9 months of coverage
of gross international reserves of current imports of goods and non-factor services
excluding megaprojects).

Budget implementation.


Revenues were slightly below the program target. Among other factors, this
performance was due to (i) the verification and continuous controls on annual income
statements by individuals and corporates; and (ii) increased control of investment project
tax benefits by the Tax Directorate (DGI).



Expenditures reached 84.5 percent of the program in the first semester. This underexecution is explained by the late approval (end-April 2015) of the 2015 State budget. In
the first four months the Operational Budget was implemented in compliance with the
principle of twelfths (setting monthly expenditure ceilings equal to 1/12 of the previous
year budget), and the Investment Budget was executed only for projects registered in
2014 which have continued in the financial year 2015.



The budget deficit was lower than expected by 0.3 percent of GDP as externally-financed
expenditure decreased by 50.7 percent, due to delays in aid disbursements and the late
approval of the budget. Grant and loan disbursements represented 45.3 percent and 40.3
percent, respectively, of the initially committed amounts for the year.

3.

Program Performance



Quantitative targets through end-September 2015: Performance of the program at
end-June is mixed. Three assessment criteria (AC) on net credit to government (NCG),
Net International Reserves (NIR) and external arrears and an indicative target (IT) on
government revenue were missed, while all the other ACs were met. The deviation in
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

NCG reflected one-off factors and is expected to be temporary: the government made a
lump sum payment of about $100 million (0.6 percent of GDP) to fuel distributors to
compensate for past under-payments, which reflected under-budgeting. This, together
with a speedy discounting of the bulk of government securities received by companies as
reimbursements for outstanding VAT credits (MT 8.4 billion), pushed net credit to
government (NCG) above target at end-June. The NIR target was missed by a small
margin at end-June, partly reflecting valuation loss. The reserve money indicative target
was met in September 2015. Failure to meet the indicative NIR target by a substantial
amount at end-September reflects continued BOP pressures including lower export
proceeds, higher external debt service, and negative exchange rate valuation changes
resulting from a stronger US Dollar. Imperfect coordination with creditors and a legacy
lapse of debt management caused small external arrears, but these arrears have since
been resolved.


Structural benchmarks (SB): The end-June SB on inclusion in the draft 2016 budget of
a fiscal rule on the use of windfall revenue was met. The SB on the operationalization of
an IT application for payments of VAT, ISPC, corporate and personal income taxes
through banks was not met, though considerable progress was achieved and this SB was
met by end-November. The end-July benchmark on the issuance of budget guidelines
making mandatory the technical assessment by the Investment Evaluation Committee for
new public investment projects to be included in the 2016 and subsequent budgets of a
value of $50 million or more was met. The SB on allowing the use of T-bonds as collateral
in money market operations was not met by end-September as envisaged. However, the
related IT issues have been resolved and related draft regulations have been approved by
the BM Board and the SB was fully met in November 2015. The remaining benchmarks
for December 2015 and January 2016 are advancing as planned and are expected to be
met.

II.

Macroeconomic Policies

A. Economic Objectives
4.

Economic outlook for 2015-19.



Macroeconomic policy. Fiscal policy will be geared toward fostering strong and
inclusive growth while preserving sustainability and supporting the external adjustment.
In this regard, the overall fiscal deficit is expected to decline from 6 percent of GDP in
2015 to 4 percent of GDP in 2016 and remain at this level over the medium term.
Revenue collection is expected to remain strong in the period and expenditures are
expected to decrease by 1.4 percent of GDP in 2016 and stabilize around 32-33 percent
of GDP over the medium term. Access to non concessional borrowing will be limited to
projects that cannot be financed through concessional loans, do not endanger debt
sustainability and have been subject to a rigorous cost benefit analysis. Monetary policy
will be consistent with the overall development of the economy, while ensuring price
stability and maintaining adequate reserve levels.

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE



GDP growth in 2015 is expected to reach 7 percent though there are downside risks that
might warrant a further reduction of about 0.7 percentage points depending on the
performance in the second half of the year.1 Downward revisions could be needed if the
weaker performances of the mining, commerce, financial, transport and tourism sectors
continue until the end of the year. Nevertheless, growth will accelerate towards the
7-8 percent range during 2016-2020, supported by agriculture, construction and financial
services, and spearheaded by expanding coal production and construction works for LNG
projects.



Inflation. Based on recent developments, inflation is expected to rise to about 5 percent
by end-2015 (2 percent in average terms) due to the recent adjustment of some
administered prices and depreciation of the metical, although it remains below the yearon-year target of 5.5 percent. In 2016-17, inflation is expected to rise somewhat to our
medium-term objective of an annual average of 5-6 percent per annum.



External Current account. The balance of payments 2015-17 will remain characterized
by the negative impact of persistently low international commodity prices, which keeps
exports subdued. Our macroeconomic adjustment measures are thereby designed to
retain sustainability by containing non-megaproject imports. New investment inflows for
coal infrastructure and LNG processing facilities, which could start in 2016, are expected
to underpin the external position further, including over the medium term. These
measures will halt declines in international reserves and return them to a path of gradual
expansion. For end 2015, we expect a gross reserve cover ratio of about 4.2 months of
projected imports of goods and services excluding megaprojects. After bottoming out in
the first half of 2016, the ratio is projected to recover to 4.5 months at end 2016 and
further to 4.9 by end 2017.



Fiscal policy. The overall fiscal deficit will continue to narrow in 2016 to support external
adjustment to 4 percent of GDP. The budget deficit is expected to remain at the same
level over the medium term.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
5.

The monetary policy stance will be less accommodative in the last quarter of 2015
and remain tight in 2016. Given a rising inflation outlook (partly driven by the depreciation of
the metical), the Bank of Mozambique (BM) has already started to tighten its monetary policy
stance in the Monetary Policy Committee meeting in October. It will continue to intervene in the
interbank markets in order to ensure reserve money growth consistent with our price stability
objective and the policy adjustments to preserve adequate levels of net international reserves.
The BM will devote efforts toward containing reserve money growth around 12 percent in 2016.

1

To be prudent, the program is based on the more conservative growth assumption.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

The BM will also stand ready to monitoring risks internally and abroad, and to take appropriate
actions to maintain overall price stability.
6.
We remain committed to a flexible exchange rate regime. The BM will allow the
exchange rate to adjust freely to evolving patterns of trade and financial flows.
7.
The Mozambican authorities remain committed to their obligations under Article
VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The BM will continue to
monitor the implementation of the new foreign exchange regulations, its implementation norms,
as well as the functioning of the foreign exchange market, with a view to avoiding practices that
could turn out to be inconsistent with Article VIII principles. We will keep IMF staff informed of
any developments that could potentially run against those principles. The Bank of Mozambique
confirms that it will ensure that the exchange rates at which the central bank sells foreign
exchange to commercial banks for oil imports, or any official exchange rates used by the Bank of
Mozambique for any other spot transactions, and the interbank market rates, will not deviate by
more than two percent at any given time and will take any measures necessary to that effect.

C. Fiscal Policy
8.

Budget execution in 2015. We will execute the 2015 budget consistent with the
program. In particular, we will offset fuel subsidy payment of MT 3.8 billion by reducing
expenditures in other categories.
9.
Fiscal policy objectives. In 2016, the government will ensure that he overall fiscal deficit
after grants will decline to 4 percent of GDP, while the domestic primary surplus reaches
1.6 percent of GDP. Revenues are expected to reach 26.2 percent of GDP, an increase of
1 percent of GDP compared to the 2015 target. This increase in revenues is expected to result
from: a strong performance in international trade taxes (derived from the combination of a
higher volume of goods imports in US dollars and a more depreciated exchange rate vis-à-vis
the US dollar), increase in gas in-kind royalties, as well as administrative reforms in key areas, for
instance, stamp taxes for alcoholic beverages and cigarettes, common custom tariffs and excise
duties. Expenditures are expected to decline by 1.4 percent of GDP, to 33.9 percent of GDP
consistent with the consolidation path over the medium term that was set up in early 2015.
10.
Revenue outlook. We will continue our efforts to improve revenue performance through
reforms in tax and customs administration. The state budget for 2016 does not consider inflows
from capital gain taxes, however if they are reported during the financial year, Article 5 of the
Budget Law authorizes the government to use them for the realization of investment expenses,
debt reduction and mitigate effects of emergencies.
11.
Expenditure policy. Even though expenditures are expected to decline to 33.9 percent
of GDP, the budget will continue to contribute to poverty reduction by prioritizing the resource
allocation to economic and social infrastructure, human capital and diversification of public
goods and services, and public sector reforms.

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE



Wage bill policy. We will reduce the wage bill by 0.2 percent of GDP in 2016, compared
to 2015. This will be achieved through measures to contain the pressure on salaries, such
as: (i) the implementation of the "Proof of Life" for all employees and State agents, and
(ii) the limitation of new hiring, excluding the health, education, agriculture and police
sectors.



Strengthening social protection. Social Protection Programmes are planned to reach
around 0.5 percent of GDP in 2016, which will cover 507,902 beneficiaries, or 16 percent
higher than 2014.



Subsidies for petroleum products. Subsidies paid in 2015 amounted Mt 3.8 billion, or
0.6 percent of GDP that would be accounted for in the 2015 executed budget. The
government is considering a reform of the fuel pricing mechanism and a rationalization
of the fuel subsidies. At current international oil prices, no fuel subsidies exist. In the
mean time, the government deems that no fuel subsidies will be necessary in 2016. If
subsidies were needed, the government would take offsetting budgetary measures to
achieve its budget target.



Other subsidies. We will continue to allocate resources to subsidize non-fuel prices, such
as wheat, flour, and transport to minimize the cost of living of the population. Therefore,
we expect to spend roughly 0.4 percent of GDP on non-fuel price subsidies and
enterprises.



Electricity tariffs. The revised tariff proposal is still under consideration by the
Government. It is envisaged that the new tariff has become effective in November.



EDM performance contract. The performance contract was not signed in July as
envisaged due to the high financing need for investment projects, which cannot be
secured by the budget. The performance contract is under revision by the company and
is expected to be signed by June 2016.

III.

Public Finance Structural Reforms

Investment Planning and Debt Management
12.

Public Investment Management. We issued budget guidelines through a notice to all
line ministries to make mandatory the technical assessment for investment projects exceeding
the $50 million in the 2016 and subsequent budgets in July 2015 (4th review structural
benchmark). We also developed the manual for project selection to be included in the Integrated
Investment Program (IIP) and we expect to organize training activities to line ministries on the
use of the manual. The Government will continue to improve public investment management,
including through a closer analysis of the relationship between public investment and debt
sustainability. In addition, institutions in charge of the design and implementation of public
investment projects will be strengthened so that public investment project selection and
evaluation conforms to sound practices.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

13.
Strengthening public debt management: Despite the adverse effect of the US dollar
appreciation on debt-to-GDP ratios, Mozambique’s external debt remains sustainable and the
country risk of debt vulnerability continues to be moderate. We revised our Debt Management
Strategy with technical assistance from the World Bank and IMF, which include considerations on
how to help the development of the domestic capital markets. This strategy was submitted to the
Cabinet in November 2015. The 2015 domestic borrowing plan was finalized by end June 2015.
The annual debt reports include the analysis of the cost and risk associated with the public debt
portfolio.
14.
Guarantee management policy. The projects that benefit from guarantees are regularly
monitored by the Ministry of Economy and Finance to minimize the risk of default. We have built
a database to manage all guarantees and we plan to develop capacity to assess the probability
and impact of potential default of this exposure with technical assistance from the World Bank
and IMF. A comprehensive list of all the guarantees outstanding has been communicated to IMF.

Public Financial Management (PFM)
15.

Expenditure coverage and tracking. We made progress in the coverage of the
integrated financial management system (e-SISTAFE). By end-August 2015 the share of
expenditures paid through e-SISTAFE directly to the beneficiary reached 70.7 percent of total
spending from the target of 70 percent for 2015. Coverage is expected to reach 75 percent in
2016.
16.
Real time registration of commitments. The reform is expected to allow greater
control of budget execution through greater efficiency in the use of e-SISTAFE. We implemented
the procedures set out in the Ministerial Diploma No 210/2014, of December 9, for wage
processing and payment to all civil servants and State Agents observing the three stages of
expenditure execution in June 2015. We are conducting training and awareness campaigns for
the users of e-SISTAFE to facilitate the implementation of the mandatory real-time recording of
the commitment and verification of expenditures for all units operating within e-SISTAFE by endJune 2016 (Structural benchmark)..
17.
Wage bill management. We remain committed to expanding the e-Folha to all State
agencies and institutions that have e-SISTAFE. By end-September 2015, from the total of
302,800 civil servants and State agents registered in e-CAF, 270,612 had their wages and salaries
processed and paid by e-Folha, which corresponds to 89.3%. From July to September 2015 we
carried out 245,607 proof of life in the country, corresponding to 81.1% of civil servants and
State agents registered in e-CAF.
18.
Cash management. We remain committed to extending the use of the treasury single
account (CUT). We concluded the identification and evaluation of the accounts held outside the
CUT in order to reduce the number of bank accounts outside the CUT (Circular No. 02/GABMF/2014). A new Budget Circular was issued in November 2015 to ensure that all revenues are
transferred into the CUT, including own revenues of budgetary institutions.
56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

19.
Scope of the public sector. The revision of the SISTAFE Law which is expected to take
place by December 2016 will broaden the scope of the public sector and make it consistent with
international standards. In addition, a new law defining the statute of public funds and
autonomous entities has been drafted and is under revision and expected to be submitted to
Cabinet by May 2016.
20.
Fiscal risk management. The National Directorate of Economic and Financial Studies
was established in the new structure of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The Directorate
incorporates a fiscal risk management unit and will be responsible to deal with all fiscal risk
related matters. We drafted the initial statement of fiscal risks with IMF technical assistance, and
published it on the website of MEF in November 2015 (4th review structural benchmark for
October 2015). The statement highlighted general risks to the budget stemming from possible
changes in macroeconomic assumptions, and possible risks associated with state guarantees,
PPPs, and large public sector, or public sector participated corporations to. We remain
committed to implement the recommendations of the 2014 fiscal transparency evaluation report
with technical assistance from the IMF.
21.
Fiscal rule for windfall revenue. Large and regular influx of natural resource revenue
from LNG is expected to start in a decade. But we expect that additional capital gain taxes
associated with transactions involving transfers of ownership stakes in large natural resource
projects might occur in the next few years. To ensure the use of these resources only for public
investment, debt repayment, and national emergencies2, the above fiscal rule will be included in
the 2016 budget law. We intend to develop a medium-term fiscal framework and a formal fiscal
rule to (i) inform future saving and investment decisions, (ii) manage volatility, and (iii) address
exhaustibility concerns before significant natural resource revenues materialize.
22.
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA). We carried out the PEFA
evaluation this year based on the current PEFA methodology using information over the period
2012-2014 and comparing the results with the 2011 last PEFA exercise. The main findings of the
report suggested that Mozambique is being successful in consolidating progress achieved on
PFM reforms since 2010, particularly in the areas of budget execution, accounting, e-SISTAFE
system coverage, reporting and internal and external audit. At the same time, the report
recommended improvements, especially in the area of public procurement.

Revenue administration
23.

VAT administration. The 2015 budget projected VAT revenues on a net basis. In
addition, VAT arrears from previous budget years amounting to 8.2 billion Mt were securitized.
These were two key components of the VAT reform. However, implementation of the net VAT
system has encountered some difficulties, which have led to the accumulation of new arrears
2

In case of temporary severe cash constraints generated by unexpected shortfalls in budget support, windfall
deposits could be used on a temporary basis.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

projected at 6.5-7 billion Mt by end-2015, of which part are claims from years before 2015. To
prevent these problems in the execution of the 2016 budget, we will create in the TSA a
dedicated subaccount to pay VAT refunds, by end-December 2015. This account will be regularly
replenished by an amount equivalent to the amount of claims received. In addition, to compute
net VAT collections, we will adjust gross VAT collections by the amount of refund claims received
minus any claims that have been rejected.
24.
Implementation of e-Tax. The registration of taxpayers into the new electronic system
advanced considerably, reaching so far 76 percent of all VAT taxpayers more than the 65 percent
of the target for end-December 2015. The e-tax collection system for VAT and ISPC currently
covers 19 of the tax offices. Progress was registered towards the launch of the online taxpayers’
portal connected to e-tax, which is expected to be fully operational by end-2015.
25.
Tax payment through banks. We made progress to facilitate tax payments through
banks by developing an IT application and signing agreements with 13 commercial banks. The
whole reform process was finalized by end-November 2015. (Structural Benchmark)
26.
Modernizing the Revenue Authority (AT) to improve revenue collection. We
assessed the revenue administration using the TADAT diagnostic tool with technical assistance
from the IMF and a report was concluded in May 2015. The recommendations of the TADAT
diagnosis were included in the AT Strategic Plan 2015-2019. The main weaknesses are related to
the integrity of the data base of registered taxpayers, and delays in filing tax returns.

Natural Resource Management
27.

Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). The 6th Report is expected to be
completed by end-December 2015 and will cover information on the extractive industry and the
payments made by companies in the mining sector, oil and gas, as well as the revenue collected
by government agencies in the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013 and 1 January
2014 to 31 December 2014. The 6th EITI report will be the basis for the next Validation of
Mozambique as Country Compliant or not the EITI.
28.
Mining and Hydrocarbon Legislation. The Regulation of the Mining Law was approved
by the cabinet in October 2015 and the Regulation of the Petroleum Law was approved in
November 2015.
29.
Strengthening the Mining and Hydrocarbon Tax Regime. The regulations of the
mining and hydrocarbon fiscal regimes which benefited from IMF technical assistance were
submitted to the Cabinet and approved in October 2015.
30.
Development of natural gas liquefaction. After the Decree-Law was approved to
operationalize the development of natural gas liquefaction plants in the Rovuma Basin,
negotiations continue to amend the Exploration, Production and Concession Contracts (EPCC), as
requested by the Concessionaires of Area 1 and 4. With respect to the Concessionaire for Area 1,
58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

negotiations are in the final stage, and preliminary agreement has been reached on modalities
for the financing of the participation of ENH, amount of gas to be reserved for domestic
purposes and the structure of marketing activities. A unitization agreement for the exploration of
the greatest gas field that straddles Areas 1 and 4 (Prosperidade/Mamba) has also been reached.
The government expects that recent progress will allow the concessionaires for Areas 1 and 4 to
reach a final investment decision in 2016.

Public Enterprises and Enterprises with State Participation
31.

Strengthening supervision of public enterprises.


The 2014 Annual Reports and audited financial accounts of the 8 largest State Owned
Enterprises (SOE’s) were published, and the summary report on the operations and fiscal
risks of all 14 SOEs was elaborated, is under harmonization and then will be submitted to
the Council of Ministers.



The proposal for a Law on the Corporate Sector of the State, with a focus on the
companies where the state has a participation below 100 percent, was submitted to the
Ministry of Finance at end-2014, then it will be submitted to the Council of Ministers by
end-March 2016.



Regarding the process to consolidate the State´s portfolio of enterprises, by October
2015 the following activities were completed (i) Sale of State Shares reserved for
managers, technicians and workers in 4 SOE´s, (ii) preparation for the sale of state
participation in 2 more entities are in advanced stages, (iii) 4 are on the stage of getting
the approval from respective line Ministers, (iv) 6 are on negotiation process with private
investors.



The new software to report financial information on state corporations became
operational in July 2015, with the financial information of the pilot companies. Since July
IGEPE is monitoring and managing the challenges of shifting from the previous process
of presenting financial information to the current one (software – SIMAP). At this stage, a
significant number of SOE´s have submitted their financial information regarding 2014
and 2015 (second submission cycle). Note that each cycle has 4 months.



Portfolio managers have been trained on the SIMAP tool with a view to improve the
monitoring of the state portfolio and enhance its performance.

32.
EMATUM. The EMATUM business plan was revised and is under consideration by the
Ministry of Economy and Finance. Work is ongoing to restructure the EMATUM debt. An action
plan which aims at improving profitability of EMATUM will be adopted by end-April 2016
(structural benchmark).

IV. Financial Sector Policies
Enhance the Functioning of Foreign Exchange Market
33.

The BM will enhance the intervention mechanism in the MCI market by trading
foreign exchange at a rate that better reflects interbank market conditions. From
November, for its interventions in the market, the BM will intervene at the prices that the
commercial banks are actually trading.
Strengthen Monetary Policy Formulation and Implementation
34.
Monetary policy framework. The BM will continue to strengthen the monetary policy
framework and to improve the analytical capacity and communication in the monetary policy
decision-making process, including by improving its inflation forecast model with technical
assistance from IMF.
35.
Inflation forecasting model. Under the new forecasting system, two forecasting rounds
have been implemented and further model refinements are in place. As a complement, the BM is
working on communication issues aiming at improving the degree of monetary policy
transparency and communication with markets and the public.
36.
The BM has made considerable progress towards improving its liquidity
management framework. All steps recommended by the technical assistance mission to
improve the forecasts of currency in circulation and government cash flow, as well as deepening
the money markets were fully observed within the considered time. It includes (i) compilation of
a new database under the new liquidity management spreadsheet; (ii) effective use of the new
liquidity forecast spreadsheet; (iii) data collection on factors related to Government and Notes
and Coins in Circulation; and (iv) initiating contacts with the MEF aiming at making more effective
the information sharing mechanism. Initially, the liquidity forecasting horizon will be bounded to
one day and, as the forecasting accuracy of the model improves, the time horizon will be
enlarged.
38.
Money market management. The remaining IT tests on the SAP platform toward
allowing the use of T-bonds as collateral in the money market (Structural Benchmark for endSeptember) were completed by September. A regulatory amendment allowing the use of Tbonds as collateral has been issued in November 2015 under the BM Notice No. 8/GBM/2015.
The equalization of fiscal treatment between secured and unsecured interbank transactions is in
implementation since May 2015, under the Law No. 19/2013 (structural benchmark for endJanuary 2016). We expect this measure to help increasing the level of trading activity in the
monetary market, especially for the secured transactions.

Financial Sector Surveillance
39.

Stress testing and non-performing loans (NPLs). The terms of reference for data
collection process under the stress testing framework have been elaborated and incorporated
60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

into the Bank’s Business Intelligence Plan. The BM has conducted new rounds of stress testing
exercises in June and September 2015. The latest results indicate that the largest banking system
vulnerabilities include high credit concentration and insufficient capital buffer to cope with
potential failure of the largest borrowers. The system is also vulnerable to funding liquidity risk,
as the sources of funds are concentrated in large depositors. Other vulnerabilities are associated
with the negative impact on NPLs of the metical-dollar exchange rate depreciation in cases
where borrowers are not exporters. However, the overall NPL ratio remains relatively low at 4.3 at
end-September.
40.
Risk-based supervision and Basel II implementation. All inspections planned for the
first half of 2015 were finalized. In addition, one institution was subject to an ad-hoc inspection.
As for the second half of 2015, the inspection of one bank with high systemic relevance is
underway. Two small and one medium size institutions were subject to inspection based on each
bank’s risk profile. The process will continue throughout the year, on a regular basis.
41.
Financial Sector Contingency Plan. The World Bank draft report on the results of the
simulation exercise has been discussed with the BM in a workshop held in September 2015. As
the result of the workshop, a joint BM-World Bank proposal to elaborate an Action Plan
addressing the issues observed during the simulation exercise and improving the legal and
operational framework of crisis management was proposed. The approval of the Action Plan by
the Board of BM is envisaged by end-March 2016.
42.
Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). In the first half of 2015, participating institutions and the
government have already deposited the initial contribution (105 million MT) on behalf of the
Fund. In August 2015 the Board of BM approved the Steering Committee Report of FGD. The
Steering Committee will make further effort to work with KfW to secure its contribution in order
to begin the operation of the FGD.

Financial Sector Development
43.

Financial Sector Development. The main objectives of the Financial Sector
Development Strategy (FSDS) 2013-2022 are to: (i) maintain financial sector stability; (ii) increase
access to financial services and products, eliminating structural constraints in the economy,
specifically those that limit financial intermediation and access to financial services; and
(iii) increase the supply of private capital to support private sector development.


Promoting financial inclusion. A public consultation workshop on the National
Financial Inclusion Strategy (FINS) took place in July 2015 which allowed the BM to
gathering contributions to the draft FINS from stakeholders. The draft FINS was further
submitted to the peer review and discussed during the Financial Inclusion Strategy Peer
Learning Group (FISPLG) under the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI) forum, held in
Maputo, in September 2015. The process of encompassing the contribution from both
meetings in the document, as well as the experiences learnt from other countries, is
underway, before its submission to the Cabinet (Structural Benchmark for endINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

December). The notice on cash recirculation is in the process of submission to the Board
for appreciation.


Establishing credit registry bureaus (CRB). The Law on the creation of private credit
registry bureaus was approved by Parliament in July 2015. Its implementation of
regulation is expected to be approved by end-March 2016.



Promotion of mobile banking. The Notice No.6/GBM/2015 which establishes the rules
on the protection of funds from the issuance of electronic money was approved in July
2015, awaiting its publication in the State Gazette.



Promotion of competition within the banking sector. The draft Notice on the list and
denomination of prices and commissions for financial products and services was
concluded in December 2014 and is expected to be submitted to the BM Board for
approval by December 2015.



Capital Market Development. The Stock Exchange (BVM) has been implementing a
financial education program.



Moveable collateral framework. Preparation work on the draft law is ongoing.
(structural benchmark for November 2015 proposed to be rescheduled to March 2016).

Payment System
44.

Reforms of the Payment System



Developing the retail payments network (SIMO). As of October 15, thirteen banks out
of eighteen have been connected to the single national electronic payment network.
Work is in progress in the remaining five banks aiming at completing the transition by
end-April 2016, within the migration schedule established in the Notice 02/GBM/2015.

Business Environment
45.

Improving the business environment:



The e-BAU platform aims to providing quality online services to all segments of society,
with greater focus on the citizens and business community, through automation and reuse of data and systems, improving provision of services and the business environment in
the country. So they were integrated into electronic platform eight (8) Single Service
desks in the provinces of Maputo City, Maputo Province, Gaza, Inhambane, Sofala,
Nampula, Tete and Cabo Delgado. This action will have an impact on the reduction of
procedures, costs and time.

62

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE



As a direct result of the implementation of the Platform, the number of days for licensing
of economic activity was reduced from fifteen days and currently it can be done within
three days on average for all computerized e-BAU´s.



The revision of the Policy and Strategy for the Industry is under public consultation phase
for its harmonization and submission to the Cabinet by end-December 2015. The
Strategy for Small and Medium Enterprises was presented to the Cabinet in November
2014, and recommended further consultations with relevant stakeholders for subsequent
submission to the Economic Committee. The process of interoperability between
institutions has been produced and is being tested.



By July 2016 we expect to (i) Integrate the e-BAU´s missing in the Electronic Platform
(sectors of Commerce, Industry, and Simplified Touring in Manica, Zambezia and Niassa);
(ii) Enter the Application System on line; and Integrate all organic Provincial Capital,
including the municipalities that intervening in the licensing process, the Electronic
Platform e-BAU nationwide.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
December 2, 2015

1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) defines the quantitative
assessment criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks on the basis of which the
implementation of the Fund-supported program under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) will
be monitored. In addition, the TMU establishes the terms and timeframe for transmitting the
data that will enable Fund staff to monitor program implementation.

Definitions
A. Net credit to the central government
2.
Net credit to the central government (NCG) by the banking system is defined as the
difference between the outstanding amount of bank credits to the central government and the
central government's deposits with the banking system, excluding deposits in project accounts
with the banking system, recapitalization bonds issued to the Bank of Mozambique (BM), and
proceeds from the signing fee for mineral resource exploration. Credits comprise bank loans,
advances to the central government and holdings of central government securities and
promissory notes. NCG will be calculated based on data from balance sheets of the monetary
authority and commercial banks as per the monetary survey. The limits on the change in NCG by
the banking system will be cumulative from end-December of the previous year.
3.
The central government encompasses all institutions whose revenue and expenditure are
included in the state budget (Orçamento do Estado): central government ministries, agencies
without financial autonomy, and the administration of 11 provinces. Although local governments
(43 municipalities or autarquias) are not included in the definition because they are independent,
part of their revenue is registered in the state budget as transfers to local governments.
4.
For program purposes, net disbursements on the nonconcessional Portuguese credit line
are excluded from the assessment criterion of NCG since the corresponding expenditure is not
covered under the definition of central government specified in paragraph 3.

B. Government revenue and financing
5.
Revenue is defined to include all receipts of the General Directorate of Tax (Direcção
Geral dos Impostos, DGI), the General Directorate of Customs (Direcção Geral das Alfândegas,
DGA), and nontax revenue, including certain own-generated revenues of districts and some line
ministries, as defined in the budget. Revenue is gross revenue net of verified VAT refund requests
(pedidos verificadas de reembolsos solicitados). Net receipts from privatization received by the
National Directorate of State Assets (Direcção Nacional do Património do Estado) and unrealized
profits transferred by the central bank to the treasury will not be considered as revenue (above
the line) and will be accounted for as other domestic financing (below the line).
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

69

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

6.
For the purpose of program monitoring, revenue is considered as collected at the time
when it is received by the relevant government collecting agencies, in cash or checks, or through
transfers into the respective bank account.

C. Priority social spending
7.
Priority social spending is based on the PARPA program categories expanded to
incorporate all areas under the new PARP. Accordingly, it will include total spending in the
following sectors: (i) education; (ii) health; (iii) HIV/AIDS; (iv) infrastructure development;
(v) agriculture; (vi) rural development; a (vii) governance and judicial system, and (viii) social
action, labor and employment.

D. Reserve money
8.
For the purposes of program monitoring reserve money is defined as the sum of
currency issued by the BM and commercial banks’ holdings at the BM. The target is defined in
terms of the average of the daily end-of-day stocks in the month of the test date, and its foreign
currency component is evaluated at the program exchange rate specified in Table 1. The reserve
money stock will be monitored and reported by the BM.

E. Net international reserves
9.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the BM are defined as reserve assets minus reserve
liabilities. The BM’s reserve assets include (a) monetary gold; (b) holdings of SDRs; (c) reserve
position at the IMF; (d) holdings of foreign exchange; and (e) claims on nonresidents, such as
deposits abroad (excluding the central government’s savings accounts related to mineral
resource extraction concessions). Reserve assets exclude assets pledged or otherwise
encumbered (such as swaps) and include but are not limited to assets used as collateral or
guarantee for a third–party external liability (assets not readily available). The BM’s reserve
liabilities include: (a) all short-term foreign exchange liabilities to nonresidents with original
maturity of up to and including one year; and (b) all liabilities to the IMF.

F. Debt

Definition of debt
For program purposes, the definition of debt is set out in paragraph 8(a) of the Guidelines on
Public Debt Conditionality in Fund Arrangements attached to Executive Board Decision
No. 15688-(14/107), adopted December 5, 2014.1
(a)
For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a
current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the
provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the
1

www.imf.org.

70

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at
some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as
follows:
(i)
loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the
basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future
(including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits)
and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized
loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay
interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as
repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);
(ii)
suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to
defer payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered
or services are provided; and
(iii)
leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the
lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are
usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the
lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt
is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected
to be made during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that
cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
(b)
Under the definition of debt set out in this paragraph, arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual
obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not
considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.

Coverage of debt
10.
For the purposes of this debt limit ceiling, public sector debt covers public and publicly
guaranteed debt contracted or guaranteed by the public sector. Contracting of credit lines with
no predetermined disbursement schedules or with multiple disbursements will be also
considered as contracting of debt.
11.
The public sector comprises the central government, the BM, the Road Fund, the water
authorities (FIPAG), the electricity company (EDM), and the hydrocarbon company (ENH), or by
enterprises and agencies in which the above entities hold a majority stake. The debt limit ceiling
also applies to debt contracted by these four state-owned enterprises from domestic banks or
from other state-owned enterprises that is contractually inter-related to external
nonconcessional loans.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

71

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

12.
For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal or
contractual obligation of the public sector to service a debt owed by a third party debtor
(involving payments in cash or in kind).

Concessionality
For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at least 35 percent,
calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between the present value
(PV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the debt.
The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by discounting the future stream of
payments of debt service due on this debt.2 For debts with a grant element equal or below zero,
the PV will be set equal to the nominal value of the debt. The discount rate used for this purpose
is the unified discount rate of 5 percent set forth in Executive Board Decision No. 15248-(13/97).
13.
For debts carrying a variable interest rate in the form of a benchmark interest rate plus a
fixed spread, the PV of the debt would be calculated using a program reference rate plus the
fixed spread (in basis points) specified in the debt contract. The program reference rate for the
six-month USD LIBOR is 3.02 percent and will remain fixed for the duration of the program.
Where the variable rate is linked to a benchmark interest rate other than the six-month USD
LIBOR, a spread reflecting the difference between the benchmark rate and the six-month USD
LIBOR (rounded to the nearest 50 bps) will be added. Specifically, the spread of six-month Euro
LIBOR over six-month USD LIBOR is -250 basis points. The spread of six-month JPY LIBOR over
six-month USD LIBOR is -250 basis points. The spread of six-month GBP LIBOR over six-month
USD LIBOR is -100 basis points. For interest rates on currencies other than Euro, JPY, and GDP,
the spread over six-month USD LIBOR is -200 basis points.3228
27

Assessment criterion on the PV of new external debt
14.
An assessment criterion (ceiling) applies to the PV of new external debt. The concept of
external debt is defined on the basis of the residency of the creditor. The ceiling also applies to
debt contracted or guaranteed for which value has not yet been received, including private debt
for which official guarantees have been extended. This assessment criterion will be assessed on a
continuous basis. The ceiling is subject to an adjustor defined below.

Stock of short-term external debt contracted or guaranteed by the
central government
15.
The central government will not contract or guarantee external debt with original
maturity of less than one year. The concept of external debt is defined on the basis of the

2

The calculation of concessionality takes into account all aspects of the debt agreement, including maturity,
grace period, payment schedule, upfront commissions, and management fees.
27

3

The program reference rate and spreads are based on the “average projected rate” for the six-month USD LIBOR
over the following 10 years from the Fall 2015 World Economic Outlook (WEO).
28

72

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

residency of the creditor. Excluded from this assessment criterion are short-term, import-related
trade credits. This assessment criterion will be assessed on a continuous basis.

External payments arrears of the central government
16.
The government undertakes not to incur payments arrears on external debt contracted or
guaranteed by the central government, with the exception of external payments arrears arising
from central government debt that is being renegotiated with creditors. This assessment criterion
will be assessed on a continuous basis.

G. Foreign program assistance
17.
Foreign program assistance is defined as grants and loans received by the Ministry of
Finance through BM accounts excluding those related to projects (Table 1).

H. Actual external debt service payments
18.
Actual external debt service payments are defined as cash payments on external debt
service obligations of the central government and central bank, including obligations to Paris
Club and other bilateral creditors rescheduled under enhanced HIPC Initiative completion point
terms, multilateral creditors, and private creditors, but excluding obligations to the IMF (Table 1).

Adjusters
I. Net international reserves
19.

The quantitative targets (floors) for net international reserves (NIR) will be adjusted:



downward by the shortfall in external program aid less debt service payments (up to
US$200 million), compared to the program baseline (Table 1);



upward by any windfall capital gain tax receipts in excess of US$30 million collected during
the program period;



downward/upward for any revision made to the end-year figures corresponding to the
previous year; and



downward to accommodate higher external outlays because of natural disasters, up to
US$20 million.



Upward for any implicit or explicit reimbursement of past public or publicly guaranteed debt
service as a result of refinancing of obligations. This in particular applies to a potential
refinancing of the international bond originally issued by EMATUM.

J. Net credit to central government
20.
The quantitative targets (ceilings) for net credit to the central government (NCG) will be
adjusted:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

73

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE



upward by the shortfall in the MT value of external program aid receipts less debt service
payments (up to the MT equivalent of US$200 million at exchange rates prevailing at the
respective test dates), compared to the program baseline (Table 1);



downward by any windfall capital gain tax receipts in excess of US$ 30 million collected
during the program period;



downward by privatization proceeds in excess of those envisaged in the program, unless
these proceeds are deposited in the government’s savings accounts abroad;



downward (upward) for any increase (decrease) in the discounted amount of the
government securities issued for VAT refund backlogs compared to the program baseline
(MT 8,200 million) for December 2015;



downward (upward) for any increase (decrease) in domestic financing from the nonfinancial
private sector; and



upward to accommodate the higher locally-financed outlays because of natural disasters, up
to the MT equivalent of US$20 million at exchange rates prevailing at the respective test
dates.

K. Reserve money
21.
The ceiling on reserve money for every test date will be adjusted downward/upward to
reflect decreases/increases in the legal reserve requirement on the liabilities in commercial banks.
The adjuster will be calculated as the change in the reserve requirement coefficient multiplied by
the amount of commercial banks’ liabilities subject to reserve requirement, considered at the end
of the period of constitution of the required reserves prior to the change in regulation.

L. Government revenue
22.
The quantitative targets (floors) for government revenue will be adjusted upward by any
windfall capital gain tax receipts in excess of US$ 30 million collected during the program period.

M. Debt
23.
An adjustor of up to 5 percent of the external debt ceiling set in PV terms applies to this
ceiling, in case deviations from the performance criterion on the PV of new external debt are
prompted by a change in the financing terms (interest, maturity, grace period, payment schedule,
upfront commissions, management fees) of a debt or debts. The adjustor cannot be applied
when deviations are prompted by an increase in the nominal amount of total debt contracted or
guaranteed.

Data and other Reporting
24.

74

The Government will provide Fund staff with:
monthly and quarterly data needed to monitor program implementation in relation to the
program’s quantitative targets and broader economic developments;

25.
The monetary survey made available by the BM will clearly identify donor-financed
project deposits (with a breakdown between foreign and domestic currency) included in net
credit to the government in both the central bank’s and commercial banks’ balance sheets.
26.
The Government will provide Fund staff with documentation concerning external loan
agreements once these have been signed and become effective.
27.
The Government will provide Fund staff with an annual borrowing plan for external debt
contraction for the upcoming year as well as any updates to the borrowing plan for the ongoing
year. The annual borrowing plan should list individually all new loans that are planned to be

Safeguards assessment
As required under the safeguards policy, the Bank of Mozambique (BM) will be subject to an update
safeguards assessment. The previous assessment, completed in 2010, found improvements in financial
reporting practices. However, vulnerabilities in the oversight mechanism for external and internal
auditing, controls, and in the BM’s legal structure were noted. It recommended amendments to the law
to address the need for independent oversight, including through the establishment of an Audit
Committee comprising non-executive Board members and external experts.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
Mozambique has a de jure and de facto floating exchange rate arrangement. The exchange rate is
largely determined in the interbank foreign exchange market (MCI). The BM regularly intervenes in the
market to smooth seasonal fluctuations, provide foreign exchange liquidity received by the government
in the form of aid, and sterilize domestic liquidity as part of its monetary policy operations.
On May 20, 2011, Mozambique accepted its obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the
Fund’s Articles of Agreement (www.imf.org). A new foreign exchange law—“Foreign Exchange Law” Law
No. 11/2009—came into effect on March 11, 2009. A new foreign exchange regulation to implement the
foreign exchange law—the “Regulation for the Foreign Exchange Law” (the “Regulation”) (Decreto No.
83/2010)—was issued on December 31, 2010. The Regulation, in conjunction with the implementing
norms subsequently issued by the BM, fully removed the existing exchange restrictions subject to Article
4

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries qualified for the assistance. Grant
assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt owed to
the Fund as of end-2004 outstanding at the time the member qualifies for debt relief.

VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement as of July 11, 2011. The two existing
multiple currency practices (MCP) were also removed. The MCP arising from the foreign exchange
auction system was removed on April 27, 2011 through the adoption of a new regulation on the
interbank exchange market and that discontinued the previous multiple price foreign exchange auction
system, which in any case had not been used since 2009. The MCP arising from the absence of a
mechanism to prevent potential deviations between the rate used by the BM in its foreign exchange
transactions in the interbank foreign exchange market and in its transactions with the government,
public entities and the World Bank was removed on July 1, 2011 through the adoption of a new
mechanism for the determination of the exchange rate for such transactions of which the relevant
parties have been notified on August 11, 2011.

AML/CFT framework
Mozambique has taken a number of steps to address the deficiencies identified in its 2011 mutual
evaluation report. With assistance from the Fund, it enacted a new AML/CFT law and regulations in
2013 and 2014 respectively. A new Penal code which increases the number of predicate offences for ML
was enacted in December 2014. The Bank of Mozambique further strengthened the regulatory
framework by issuing enforceable guidelines for financial institutions in May 2015. Draft amendments to
the FIU law which are designed, in part, to strengthen its operational independence have been
approved by Cabinet and are scheduled to be tabled in Parliament in the session commencing October
2015. The Financial Intelligence Unit (GIFIM) continues to work towards membership of the Egmont
Group of Financial Intelligence Units. The IMF is currently providing assistance in developing a
supervisory framework for real estate agents and dealers in precious metals and stones. Going forward,
the authorities should build on progress achieved and focus their attention on strengthening their
capacity to effectively implement the legal and regulatory framework.

Article IV Consultation
Mozambique is on a 24-month consultation cycle, in accordance with Decision No. 14747-(10/96).
The 2013 Article IV consultation was completed by the Executive Board on June 24, 2013 (Country
Report No. 13/200).
In concluding the 2013 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors commended the authorities for their
policies, which have translated into a strong macroeconomic performance in recent years. While the
medium-term growth outlook is favorable, it will be important to manage risks stemming from the
external and internal environments. Directors called for continued commitment to sound policies and
structural reforms to preserve macroeconomic stability, foster inclusive growth, and reduce poverty.
Recognizing the need to support public investment and social development, Directors emphasized the
importance of fiscal prudence as revenues from extractive industries will remain modest in the near
term. To limit fiscal risks, they advised prioritization of current spending, in particular containing the
wage bill. They also called for steps to modernize revenue administration, strengthen public financial
management, and ensure timely settlement of VAT refunds. Directors also saw merit in developing a
fiscal policy framework that incorporates the anticipated natural resource receipts over the medium
term. Directors acknowledged that the current high level of public investment can make an important

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

contribution to improving infrastructure and enabling Mozambique to access its natural resource
wealth. However, they recommended careful monitoring of the pace and effectiveness of these
investments in order to maximize returns, avoid hitting absorptive capacity constraints, and preserve
debt sustainability. In this context, Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to strengthen their
medium-term debt strategy as well as project selection and monitoring. Directors encouraged the
authorities to continue to implement their Poverty Reduction Strategy. A renewed focus on job creation,
improvements in agricultural productivity, and economic diversification hold the key to more inclusive
growth in the period ahead.

Ex post assessment of performance under Fund-supported programs
An ex post assessment (EPA) of Mozambique’s performance under Fund-Supported Programs since
1987 was undertaken in December 2003 under the guidelines on assessments of countries with a
longer-term program engagement. The EPA was circulated to the Executive Board on November 21,
2003 (Country Report No. 04/53).
Directors commended the authorities for their pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies and wide
ranging structural reforms over the past fifteen years which contributed to strong growth of the
economy, and a steady decline in poverty rates. Noting that despite considerable progress Mozambique
remains a very poor and vulnerable country, Directors urged the authorities to persevere in their efforts
to consolidate macroeconomic stability and accelerate and deepen structural reforms with a view to
sustaining economic growth, encouraging employment creation, and further reducing poverty.

FSAP participation and ROSCs
A Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for Mozambique was undertaken during the first quarter
of 2003. The related Financial Sector Stability Assessment was circulated to the Executive Board on
November 19, 2003 (Country Report No. 04/52). An update to the FSAP took place in February 2009 and
the related Financial Sector Stability Assessment circulated to the Board on June 19, 2009 (Country
Report No. 10/12). A ROSC on fiscal transparency was issued on February 22, 2001. This ROSC was
updated in the context of the 2002 Article IV consultation (Country Report No. 02/140) and the 2003
Article IV Consultation (Country Report No. 04/50). The ROSC on fiscal transparency was updated in
May 2008. A Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) data module was prepared in
June 2002 and issued on March 5, 2003. This data module was updated in August 2005.

Management’s visit
At the invitation of the authorities, Mr. Kato, Deputy Managing Director, visited Maputo, Mozambique in
July 2005. Mr. de Rato, Managing Director, visited Mozambique on August 2007 for a meeting with the
African Consultative Group on Quotas, Voice, and Representation. Mr. Lipton, Deputy Managing
Director, visited Maputo, in May 2013. Ms. Lagarde, Managing Director, visited Mozambique on May
2014 for the Africa Rising conference.

Resident representative
Mr. Alex Segura-Ubiergo has been the IMF’s resident representative to Mozambique since
August 1, 2013.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
(As of November 9, 2015)
1.
The Fund Mozambique team met with the World Bank Mozambique team in Maputo
during the fifth PSI review mission in October 2015. The objective was to identify macro-critical
structural reforms and to coordinate the two teams' work for the period May 2015 to April 2016.
2.
The teams agreed that Mozambique's main macroeconomic challenge is to sustain
higher and more inclusive economic growth going forward. To meet this challenge, Mozambique
needs to enable broader-based economic activity led by the private sector, in particular in areas
where it has competitive advantages, such as agriculture, trade-related services in support of
booming commodity export sectors, labor-intensive manufacturing, and tourism. Given the low level
of infrastructure, this will entail policies and reforms to boost public investment, coupled with
enhancements in the business environment. As traditional aid is on a gradual declining trend,
increasing public investment may require resorting to non concessional financing and stepping up
capacity in the investment selection and debt management areas.
3.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified seven structural reform areas as
macro-critical, in view of their central role in achieving higher and more inclusive growth:
Debt management and investment planning. The authorities’ ambitious investment program will
need to be backed by a strong reform agenda to enhance capacity to manage fiscal risks and ensure
value for money. In the field of investment selection, several measures are being implemented to
improve the investment pipeline and the project selection process. Debt management will be
strengthened to ensure that borrowing and investment decisions entail value for money. This is
underpinned by a new medium-term debt strategy.
Public financial management. The focus will be on consolidating PFM achievements, while
enhancing the capacity to manage risks outside the central government, including in the area of
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and decentralized administrative units. To achieve this objective, the
authorities will step up a framework to identify, monitor and mitigate fiscal risks, continue rolling out
their new PFM system, and enhance budget execution and monitoring reports. Other critical
measures aim at enhancing control of public spending to ensure budget appropriations remain
within the limits, arrears are properly tracked and reduced. These reforms are macro-critical since
they will protect fiscal space needed to reduce poverty and increase priority spending, while
managing risks related to SOE’s large-scale investment plans and enhancing the government’s
oversight.
Tax administration. Despite the strong increase in revenue collections, the tax system is still
complex to administer and comply with. It is marked by numerous tax benefits and an overall low
contribution from the mega-project sectors. Going forward, the government plans to facilitate tax
compliance through electronic tax payment and continue to expand the tax base to cover the large

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

informal sector. The revenue management system will be enhanced, in line with a set of agreed
performance indicators.
Social safety nets. Two decades of high GDP growth have not yet resulted in significant poverty
reduction. This, in turn, undermines the country’s long-term growth potential. To address this, the
authorities have started to strengthen their safety nets. Measures include: (i) rationalizing and
expanding health insurance coverage; (ii) strengthening higher education and vocational training;
(iii) strengthening the financial sustainability and administration of the National Social Security Fund,
and creating a new pension system for private sector workers; and (iv) improving the targeting of
social protection systems to the most needy. These measures are macro-critical, as better health and
education services, stronger pensions systems, and a more effective social safety net can enhance the
productivity of the workforce and support social cohesion.
Natural resource wealth. Mozambique is endowed with rich natural resource reserves which are
largely not exploited so far. With the recently started coal and gas projects and a series of other
projects in the coming years, the extractive sector is slated for a boom which could make significant
contributions to the country’s economic growth and government revenues. This poses challenges for
economic management, the sector’s legal and regulatory frameworks and the government’s capacity
in managing contracts and revenues. Mozambique remains full membership of the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
Investment climate. Mozambique's private sector is held back by the high costs of doing business.
These arise mainly from weaknesses in governance, access to finance, power supply, tax and
regulatory systems, and contract enforcement. Wide-ranging reforms are needed to address these
issues. They are macro-critical because a better investment climate is conducive to supporting
private sector activities, thereby broadening the country’s productive and export base, creating jobs,
and thus helping reduce poverty.
Financial sector stability and development. Strong past growth of credit to the private sector, the
expansion of the banking system and its potential exposure to cross-border risks call for
strengthening the continuous supervision of the financial sector, as well as the capacity to identity
and address potential sources of vulnerabilities. In this context, a financial distress simulation exercise
was carried out in April 2015 by the WB and the BOM, and the results will inform an action plan to
address potential vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, improving financial intermediation and access to credit
remains a top priority. To this end, the authorities have prepared the 2013-22 Financial Sector
Development Strategy which includes a wide-ranging and clearly sequenced action plan, covering
ways to, among other things, enhance financial inclusion, competition, consumer protection, and
financial literacy.

4.

The teams agreed on the following division of labor:
Debt management and investment planning reforms. The Fund will continue to play a key role in
building government capacity to assess debt sustainability and define a coherent debt strategy
through TA and continued support from HQ. Both institutions will assist the authorities in
strengthening their debt management capacity, with TA support from the Fund and on-site

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE

assistance from the Bank. The Fund will continue to play a key role in helping the authorities
improving debt management and public investment selection process. The Bank will continue
providing technical assistance for enhancing project investment management and medium-term
debt strategy.
Public financial management reform. The Bank and the Fund will cooperate in the field of rolling
out the PFM system and improve financial management practices. The Fund will secure its support
through regular TA missions from FAD and its AFRITAC South regional office in Mauritius. The Bank
will provide ongoing consultation from its local office and supervision missions of projects under
implementation in this area. The Fund program review missions will provide further opportunities to
assess progress in this field.
Tax administration reforms. The Fund will take the lead in this area and provide support through
ongoing advice based on regular TA missions from FAD and AFRITAC South. The Bank will advance
reforms in this area in the context of its business environment policies and portfolio, and its program
on natural resources (MAGTAP).
Social safety net reform. The Bank will take the lead in this field through continued TA in the design
of more comprehensive and performing safety nets, in cooperation with other development partners
and international organizations (including UNICEF and ILO). The Fund will play its role in identifying
the fiscal space for the safety nets. The results will be discussed among the collaborators on a regular
basis, so as to inform policy discussions with the authorities. The Bank is also taking the lead in
public pension reforms.
Natural resource wealth. The Fund will provide TA under the Topical Trust Fund for Managing
Natural Resource Wealth (TTF-MNRW), relating to the fiscal regime of the extractive sector, revenue
forecasting, and natural resource statistics, all being crucial to increase the sector’s contribution to
the budget and support the country’s development agenda. The Bank is supporting Mozambique’s
implementation of EITI through its Multi-donor Trust Fund (MDTF). The Bank also funds s through
the MAGTAP project.
Investment climate reform. The Bank will take the lead in working with government to enhance the
investment climate, by deepening its agenda to help the authorities cut red tape and simplify the
legal and regulatory framework. The results will be shared on an ongoing basis and discussed during
the Fund program review missions.
Financial sector stability and development. The Fund will continue to help the Bank of
Mozambique to build its capacity to assess risks to financial stability of the banking sector, while the
Bank will take the lead in supporting financial sector development and reforms, including through
enhanced financial inclusion, competition, consumer protection, and financial literacy. The results of
their respective work will be shared and discussed regularly.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The
authorities are making efforts to improve the quality and timeliness of economic and financial
data through participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and in the
Enhanced Data Dissemination Initiative (EDDI) funded by the U.K. Department for International
Development (DFID). Weaknesses exist, particularly in the areas of national accounts,
government finance, balance of payments, and external debt statistics.
Real sector statistics: The national accounts are prepared by the INE in accordance with the 1993
System of National Accounts (1993 SNA). In July 2014, the INE released a revised annual GDP series
for the period 1991-2013 with a switch from 2003 to 2009 as the base year. A partly revised GDP
series was released in July 2015, in which the measurement of investments and imports for natural
resource projects improved. The authorities are working to strengthen quarterly national accounts
compilation at current prices. The INE’s new household income and expenditure survey being
conducted in 2015-2016 still need to be incorporated to strengthen the national accounts. A
revamped consumer price index for Maputo based on weights derived from the 2008–09
household survey was released in February 2011. A national index obtained by integrating the
indices for Maputo, Beira, and Nampula was released in April 2006. Several issues remain
outstanding, however, including how to improve the housing market rent sample and expand
coverage to include the Quelimane and Greater Maputo areas. There are insufficient sectoral labor
market and employment data, and where available, they have limited coverage. A one-year labor
market survey of the entire country, undertaken by INE in collaboration with the Labor Ministry,
was launched in October 2004.

Monetary and financial statistics: A 2004 work plan was developed to implement the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) and develop an integrated monetary database (IMD) to
meet the needs of the Bank of Mozambique (BM), AFR, and STA. In November 2007 the IMD was
completed and allows the derivation of accurate and timely monthly monetary statistics, while
reducing BM’s reporting burden.
Balance of payments: With assistance from STA, provided in the context of the GDDS regional
project, the BM has made significant progress toward compiling and disseminating balance of
payments (BOP) and international investment position (IIP) statistics. The migration process from
the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5) to the Balance of Payments Manual, sixth
edition (BPM6) has been progressed substantially. BOP and IIP statistics are now disseminated
based on BPM6, with only detailed data on megaprojects remaining to be migrated. The BM has
an adequate institutional framework for the compilation of BOP and IIP statistics. However,
further strengthening of external sector statistics needs to focus on: strengthening information
technology (especially to apply data warehouse and on-line analytical processing tools);

improving accuracy and consistency with BPM6 methodology for several specific areas (especially
in the services account); starting the compilation of quarterly IIP while improving data quality
especially for foreign liability positions of non-megaprojects; and improving the compilation of
imports of domestic enterprises supplying megaprojects. Joint work with other institutions to
improve the quality of external trade data, especially with regard to price and volume indices,
also merits attention. Work is currently ongoing to identify imports of domestic firms that are
directly related to providing services to megaprojects. When this work is completed (currently
expected in mid-2016), it is expected to allow enhanced analysis of the impact of megaprojects
and allow improved estimation of the economy’s underlying (non-megaproject) current account
position.

aimed to address weaknesses in the

Methodological soundness, accuracy, and

III. Reporting to STA

Mozambique does not report fiscal data for publication in the IFS or the Government Finance
Statistic Yearbook (GFSY). Mozambique now reports monthly monetary data to STA using the
standardized reporting forms (SRFs). As a result, these enhanced data are being published in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS) Supplement. In 2007, the BM started to compile and report
comprehensive IIP data in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.

Association (IDA)

This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) provides a further update to the joint IMF/IDA
DSA from April 2014 and June 2015 update.1 Mozambique remains at moderate risk of
external public debt distress, but risks have heightened considerably as the metical
depreciation vis-à-vis the US dollar of about 25 percent between end-2014 and midNovember 2015 has increased debt level indicators.2 Relative to GDP and exports, debt
levels stand only barely below thresholds in 2015 and will remain elevated in the next
few years, though debt service remains manageable. Going forward, downward
trajectories in debt ratios should be ensured by the authorities’ commendable policy
response to strictly limit external and non-concessional borrowing and fiscal
consolidation agreed under the program. Meanwhile, improvements in investment
planning capacity are important to identify those projects most important for
development. In light of upwardly-revised assumptions on the size of investments in the
natural gas sector, private external debt will peak above 150 percent of GDP in the early

The DSA presented in this document is based on the standard low-income countries (LIC) DSA
framework. See “Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability
Framework for Low-Income Countries” (http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4827) and
World Bank Report No. ACS6956, 10/23/13). Under the World Bank Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA); updated on July 25, 2014 with the 2013 CPIA rating, Mozambique maintains the
medium policy performer rating, albeit close to the threshold of 3.75 for strong performers, with an
average rating of 3.64 during 2012–14; the DSA uses the indicative thresholds for medium
performers.

UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
1.
There have been significant changes in assumptions compared to the previous DSA. This
DSA is consistent with the macroeconomic framework outlined in the Staff Report for the Fifth Review
under the PSI (Box 1). Compared to the previous DSA,3 the main changes are threefold. First, the continued
depreciation of the metical has led to a significant upward shift in debt and debt service ratios in the short
term. Second, updated assumptions reflect considerably larger planned investments in the natural gas
sector (Box 1 provides details). Third, following the government’s new policy, there has been a considerable
scaling back of public sector external borrowing plans, which is projected to result in a lower profile of
external disbursement over the next years.
a. The medium-term macroeconomic framework has been updated, including to reflect the
metical’s depreciation and larger planned size of investments in the natural gas sector
(Text Table 1). The economic outlook remains robust, although somewhat less buoyant than
previously projected, with economic growth projected at 6.3 percent in 2015 and 6.5 percent in
2015 (compared to 7.0 and 8.2 percent respectively in the last DSA). The main reasons being
slower-than-expected increases in coal production and substantial tightening of fiscal and
monetary policies to address external imbalances. Nevertheless, growth is expected to
accelerate over the medium term on the back of extractive industries and infrastructure
investments. To ensure debt sustainability and alleviate external imbalances, substantial fiscal
consolidation is underway and programmed to continue in 2016. After an election-year deficit of
over 10 percent of GDP, the fiscal deficit is expected to contract to 6 percent in 2015 and further
to 4 percent in 2016—the level at which it would stabilize over the medium term. The current
account deficit is projected to increase to 90 percent of GDP by 2020 reflecting significant
imports of goods and services, mainly related to construction of processing facilities for liquefied
natural gas (LNG). Approximately one third of these imports are financed by FDI with the
remainder financed by private debt.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions 2015–35
The medium-term assumptions in the baseline scenario for 2015-35 are consistent with the medium-term macroeconomic
framework underlying the Staff Report for the Fifth Review under the Policy Support Instrument and the request for a new
arrangement under the Stand By Credit Facility.
Real GDP growth is expected to accelerate to 7-8 percent range over the medium term, supported by the expansion in
coal mining and infrastructure investments, including support for coal exports and LNG manufacturing. A sharp increase
in growth in 2021 reflects the assumed coming on line of the first natural gas production plant (“train”) and related
exports in that year. While growth of the non-LNG sector is sustained in the long term by strong population/labor force
growth, continued infrastructure investment, and related productivity gains, overall GDP growth rate will moderate once
the LNG production reaches its full capacity in 2028. Risks to growth include public and private investment not
achieving expected payoffs and thus limiting productivity gains, and the possibility of Dutch disease.
LNG sector. LNG plants are assumed to be under construction during 2016–27. The projection has significantly
updated assumptions on this investment in line with information from the private developers and now assumes that 13
onshore LNG manufacturing units (“trains”) and 4 floating trains (FLNG) would be built (versus only 4 onshore trains
assumed in the previous DSA). The first onshore train and the first floating train are assumed to start production in
2021, followed by remaining trains sequentially starting production. The final train will start production in 2028. Total
investment from 2016 is projected at $110 billion. The sector’s contribution to GDP is expected to be small during the
construction period due to high import content. Annual LNG output will reach 89 million tons in 2028, constituting
more than 50 percent of nominal GDP by then. The schedule and size of the projects depend on the timing and content
of final investment decisions expected to be made by the investors by end-2016.
Consumer price inflation is projected to remain in the authorities’ target range of 5–6 percent over the medium term.4
Export value growth is considerably higher than in the previous DSA due to revised assumptions on the size of LNG
production facilities. On average exports are projected to be 18 percent on average over the projection period, but
show large intertemporal variation. Exports are expected to resume modest growth in 2016 before increasing to around
14 percent during 2017-20 as coal exports expand with completion of the Nacala rail corridor. Average annual growth
rates are then projected peak around 50 percent during 2021-25 as LNG exports come onstream, before falling back to
around 4½ percent when traditional export growth (of 13 percent) becomes their main driver.
Imports are projected to contract in the near term in response to metical depreciation and economic adjustment
measures, before recovering gradually and reaching 18 percent annual growth during 2023-27, as LNG production
increases available resources. Subsequently, import value growth is projected to return to around 10½ percent.
The non-interest external current account balance is projected to record a deficit of over 80 percent of GDP in the
medium term largely driven by imports for LNG investment.5 The deficit will be primarily financed through FDI and
private external borrowing. The large size of LNG exports under the revised baseline implies it would subsequently turn
into surplus, projected to exceed 10 percent of GDP during the late 2020s and early 2030s.
The non-interest primary fiscal deficit is projected to contract in 2015 to 4¾ percent of GDP and further to a range of
2-2½ percent during 2016-20 in response to the fiscal consolidation envisaged under the authorities’ program. The
fiscal balance is expected to improve further beyond 2020 as LNG revenue ramps up. The total fiscal revenues from the
LNG project throughout the entire project period until 2045 could reach about $500 billion.6 Even though the gas
production would rapidly scale up during the early 2020s, fiscal revenues during the first few years are limited, because
of the large cost recovery for continuous investments in building liquefaction plants. By the late 2020s, the fiscal
revenues from the gas projects would account for more than half of total fiscal revenues.

4

Gas and coal prices, which are important determinants of export receipts, are throughout the projection period
expected to remain relatively subdued relative to recent peaks in line with Fall 2015 WEO assumptions.
5

Meanwhile, the non-megaproject current account is expected to remain on the order of 11-12 percent during the
next years.
6

Main sources of the fiscal revenues are (i) the government’s share of gas profits, (ii) the corporate income tax
on the concessionaires, and (iii) the dividends paid by the state-owned hydrocarbon company (ENH), which
owns 10 and 15 percent stakes in the two exploration areas where gas has been found.

b. The external borrowing profile is now considerably more benign, as the authorities have
taken strong measures to slow contracting of new debt. These measures more than offset
decreasing donor support, which continues its steady downward trend.7 In 2015, new borrowing
has continued to be limited with face value of new external debt contraction expected to total
less than US$750 million by year-end, of which US$200 million are non-concessional borrowing.8
Moreover, the authorities have suspended negotiations on the vast majority of loans, which
were considered in the pipeline by the last DSA and totaled US$ 2.2 billion. These loans have
been sent back to line ministries for reevaluation and prioritization. There is currently no clear
timeline when (some of) these pipeline loan negotiations may recommence, but any contraction
is expected only in 2017 or later and at a more measured pace than in the last DSA. As a result,
the external borrowing plan for 2016 envisages lower contraction than in 2015 with loans
amounting to US$400 million, of which about 80 percent are expected at concessional terms
(see Staff Report Tables 8, 9). Finally, the updated profile of future disbursements is further
reduced by the authorities’ decisions to delay implementation of a few projects for which
financing has already been obtained (Text Figure 1).
c. Private sector medium-term borrowing has been considerably revised further upwards, in
line with the higher assumptions on LNG investment. The International Investment Position
data now puts private external debt at 31 per-cent of GDP in 2014. It is projected to rise to some
132 percent by 2020, compared to 85 percent in the previous DSA. Debt will also increase
further until its peak in 2022 as net repayments commence. The ratio is expected to fall back
quickly to below 50 percent by 2030 as LNG revenues are utilized to amortize this private
borrowing. This debt is mobilized and repaid entirely through offshore SPVs, which limits risk to
the domestic financial system.

Thereby, total non-concessional borrowing under the PSI program has reached US$ 1,498 million.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
2.
Total external debt is projected to rise more rapidly during this decade than previously
projected, reflecting higher private sector investment in the natural gas sector. External debt
(both public and private) is expected to peak at 232 percent of GDP in 2022. By that time private
sector debt will represent more than 80 percent of total external debt with its increase mostly driven
by investments in the natural gas sector. In the near term, coal sector investment to complete the
Nacala rail corridor project will also have a small impact as it is now expected to be financed by debt
rather than FDI. The significant build up of private sector external debt needs to be monitored by
the authorities to contain vulnerabilities, though risks (as noted above) are limited due to the
financing structures through SPVs offshore. With renowned global companies leading investments
in the natural resource sector, vulnerabilities are expected to be limited to those specific to the
natural resource operations. Likewise, the risk for government contingent liabilities is deemed
modest, though the authorities are well advised to remain vigilant, including in complex negotiation
with private sector concessionaires and their prospective lenders.
3.
All public external debt indicators remain below their respective thresholds in the baseline,
but two indicators relating to debt levels barely so (Figure 1).9 These level indicators are those of
external debt relative to GDP and exports. Meanwhile, debt service indicators remain benign although debt
service which has started on the US$850 million EMATUM bond will amount to approximately
US$200 million per year from 2016, effectively doubling public debt service and weighing on
Mozambique’s international reserves.10


The PV of debt in terms of GDP now stands at 39.9 percent in 2015 (Table 1),11 compared
to 31.9 percent in the previous DSA and a threshold of 40 percent. This increase is
completely attributable to the depreciation of the metical, as external disbursements during
2015 have been lower than expected in the last DSA. In contrast, its medium-term trajectory
is now more benign as a result of public borrowing restraint with ratios projected to
consistently decrease to 36½ percent by 2020, while the previous DSA forecasted increases
throughout the remainder of the 2010s. Thereafter, strong GDP expansion related to LNG
production is expected to stabilize the ratio at a lower level of around 20 percent of GDP.

9

As in the previous DSAs, the historical scenario has been excluded from Figures 1 and 3. The reason for the
exclusion is that such a scenario shows unrealistically fast declines of public debt ratios over the medium term,
because it fixes the non-interest current account deficit at a historical average of 19.3 percent of GDP. This is much
lower than the average projected deficit of 67 percent of GDP during 2017-22. With private debt accumulation
assumed to remain unchanged compared to the baseline, this assumption then results in unrealistically fast declines
of public debt ratios.
10

The government is currently exploring options for refinancing this debt with an aim to inter alia lengthen its
maturity, which could reduce near term debt service requirements.
11

Large residuals in Table 1 after 2020 result from large debt service and dividend payments on LNG investment,
which are not included in the identified net debt-creating flows. They ramp up in line with LNG production and
increasing from about 20 percent of GDP per year in the mid-2020s to over 25 percent of GDP in the early 2030s.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE



The PV of debt in terms of exports in 2015 has increased considerably relative to the
previous DSA (143 percent versus 112 percent) as a result of downward revisions to exports
on account of weak commodity prices, which is also slowing expansion in export volumes,
particularly with regards to coal. Nonetheless, exports are expected to recover over the
medium term, partly as the delayed completion of the Nacala rail corridor project underpins
coal exports. This should return the ratio to below 120 percent during the next years, with
further considerable declines and stabilization below 40 percent as a result of LNG
production.

4.
Mozambique’s risk of debt distress remains moderate. In cases such as Mozambique, whose
debt ratios are within 5 percent of thresholds, it is useful to consider also an alternate methodology in
determining the final classification.12 Instead of specifying thresholds based on past experiences of debt
distress across LIDCs, this methodology takes into account Mozambique-specific factors such as higher
than average GDP growth and a CPIA rating toward the upper end of the medium range. Its results provide
support for Mozambique’s risk of debt distress indeed remaining moderate at this juncture (Figure 3).
Nonetheless, the authorities are well advised to retain their current prudent borrowing strategy, while
continuing to make progress in investment selection to ensure that those projects with high development
impacts are appropriately prioritized.
5.
External debt ratios are sensitive to exchange rate shocks and terms of trade shocks.13
The thresholds for the PV of debt relative to GDP, exports and revenues are breached under various
stress tests for a sustained period.14 A combination shock consisting of reductions in non-debt
creating flows such as FDI, export prices and growth in 2016-2017 would push ratios well above
their prudent thresholds in the near term, with peaks of about 70 percent in the debt-to-GDP and
260 percent in the debt-to-export ratio (Figure 1).15 Apart from this combination shock, a further
sharp depreciation of the metical in 2016 could push the debt-to-GDP ratio well above the
50 percent mark in the medium term. Unlike in the previous DSA, ratios in all the stress scenarios
would return below the thresholds during the early 2020s in light of the now higher increases in
GDP and exports because of larger size of the LNG facilities. A shock to FDI is also shown to lead to
considerable breaches of thresholds; however, this scenario should not be overemphasized as a fall in FDI,
and particularly megaproject FDI, would mainly be linked to lower imports rather than higher borrowing as
implicitly assumed in this shock scenario.
6.
Ensuring that LNG production materializes remains important to underpin
Mozambique’s long-run debt sustainability. The same applies for completion of coal investment.
12

For more information see IMF (2013), “Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries”.
13

The impact the of the standard shocks in the DSA template is heightened by the fact that the standard stress tests
revert to historical values, which are significantly different from current and expected values because of the structural
change in the Mozambican economy resulting from the large-scale exploitation of coal and natural gas since 2011.
14

The scenario in which variables are at their historical levels has been omitted given that it generates negative debt
as a result of the large changes in variables in the baseline arising from LNG activities.

The authorities have made significant progress in establishing legal frameworks for the sector.
Negotiations with private operators on outstanding issues recently regained momentum after some
delays. It is crucial that jointly satisfactory agreements are reached soon to ensure that LNG
investment can move forward.

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
7.
Risks to total public debt have heightened in line with external debt (Table 3 and Figure
2). With over 80 percent of public debt being external, the evolution of total public debt mirrors its
trajectory. PV of public debt is expected to stand at 50 percent of GDP at end 2015. Debt-to-GDP
and debt-to-revenue ratios are expected to consistently decline over the projection period, in line
with external debt, and reinforced by envisaged fiscal consolidation leading to a reduction in net
domestic debt. Under the baseline scenario, the PV of public debt remains below the indicative
56 percent of GDP benchmark that research has linked to increased probability of debt distress.
However, and in contrast to the previous DSA, public debt ratios would now exceed the benchmark briefly
during 2016 and 2017, if the metical were to suffer another sharp depreciation in the upcoming year.
Thereby Mozambique’s overall risk of public debt distress is now considered heightened. The debt serviceto-revenue ratio experiences a pronounced upward shift starting in 2016 as a result of debt service having
commenced on the $850 million commercial borrowing related to defense spending and the state-owned
tuna fishing company EMATUM.
8.
These increased risks underline the importance of the authorities’ planned fiscal
consolidation, including to safeguard future borrowing space for priority public investment.
In light of the tighter constraints, rigorous evaluation and prioritization of investment projects and
building increased capacity in this area is becoming even more important. Over the medium and
long term, underpinning development will require considerable further public investment, including
in the energy sector. With prospective revenue increases tied to LNG production only expected to
materialize from the mid to late 2020s, careful resource management is needed to create space for such
investments while safeguarding macroeconomic stability.

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
9.
The authorities, were in broad agreement with the DSA’s results, but emphasized that an
elevation of debt vulnerability rating should not result from purely external factors, such as
exchange rate devaluation. They were mindful that a degradation of Mozambique’s rating could arise in
the future, particularly if the metical were to depreciate further. They emphasized that any changes in risk of
debt distress rating should not occur purely in response to such exogenous factors beyond the authorities’
control. In addition, they expressed that the government’s capacity to service its debt should be the main
factor in making the assessment.

CONCLUSION
10.
Debt remains manageable, but heightened vigilance—as demonstrated by the
authorities—is indeed essential. Not surprisingly, exchange rate depreciation has had a sizable
adverse impact on public debt ratios, given that most public debt is external and denominated in
foreign currency. Debt service has become more challenging as the beginning of repayments on the
EMATUM bond has doubled debt service commitments in nominal terms, placing some strain on a
balance of payments already weakened by commodity price shocks and a temporary slowdown in
investment inflows. It is thus important to exercise caution in contraction of new external debt,
particularly on non-concessional terms, as well as limit domestic debt issuance to ensure that the
fiscal sector supports the external adjustment, as envisaged in the program. In addition, limiting
issuance of public guarantees and enhancing monitoring of financial positions of state-owned
enterprises are crucial. Shock scenarios highlight that Mozambique’s debt remains vulnerable to a
general deterioration in economic conditions and the terms-of-trade as well as to further currency
depreciation. As some further currency depreciation could be a possibility in light of the balance of
payments position, it is comforting that—despite recent increases—public debt service overall
remains manageable, given that the vast majority of Mozambique’s debt features concessional
terms.
11.
The conclusions for strategic debt management are fourfold and similar to those of
the previous DSA. First, debt management and investment planning capacity should continue to be
improved to ensure that the most deserving public investment projects are selected and yield their
desired payoff. This has become more important as higher debt level ratios resulting from
depreciation prescribe a more cautious borrowing path, which the authorities have already charted
out, underpinned by sending many projects back to line ministries for reevaluation and
prioritization. Second, it is important for the authorities to implement the fiscal consolidation
envisaged in their program, both to address the economy’s external imbalance and to place public
debt on a gradual downward trajectory over the medium term while addressing key public
investment priorities. Third, it remains crucial—including from a debt sustainability perspective—to
bring the negotiations with the private gas companies to a jointly satisfactory conclusion to ensure
that LNG investment moves forward, so that production and its beneficial effects on GDP and fiscal
revenue can be realized. They would ensure that, even in case of further adverse shocks explored in
the stress scenarios, Mozambique’s debt indicators would revert to prudent levels soon thereafter.
Fourth, while Mozambique had made substantial progress in debt management under the previous
PSI-supported program and debt management capacity has been adequate, reinvigorating
improvements in this area is becoming more important in light of heightened risks.

2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by the Staff Representative on the Republic of Mozambique
December 18, 2015

1.
Since the issuance of the staff report (www.imf.org) the following information has
become available. This information does not alter the thrust of the report’s Staff Appraisal.
2.
Inflation has increased in November largely as expected. Annual inflation for the
12 months ending in November rose to 5.7 percent, reflecting the expected pass through of
the depreciation of the metical during the year on imported food prices and the impact of the
increase in electricity tariffs in November.
3.
After weakening significantly in late November/early December, the exchange
rate has been recovering in recent days. Reflecting uncertainties surrounding the
negotiations on large natural gas projects and a seasonal peak in import demand, the
exchange rate depreciated further by about 20 percent (to reach about 56-57 meticals per US
dollar in the first days of December). Since then, in part as a result of positive developments
in the energy sector (below) and as a sign that the corrective policy measures are starting to
bear fruit, the meticals appreciated by about 18 percent (to 48-49 meticals per dollar).
Preliminary data suggest that the end-December target for net international reserves is within
reach.
4.
The authorities have completed all the front-loaded corrective measures. On
December 14, the 2016 budget that is consistent with the fiscal framework agreed in the
program was formally approved by the National Assembly, thus completing all the corrective
measures set out in Table 3 of the MEFP.
5.
The December 14, 2015 Monetary Policy Committee meeting of the Banco de
Mozambique took additional policy tightening actions. In line with the policy advice, it
raised the interest rate on the standing lending facility (FPC) by a further 150 basis points and
the rate on the standing deposit facility (FPD) rate by a further 100 basis points.
6.
Favorable developments in megaproject negotiations bode well for FDI in the
coming years. The authorities, ENI and Anadarko, the two largest companies investing in
Mozambique’s massive offshore natural gas resources, reached an agreement in November
for the joint development of the natural gas resources that straddle two offshore blocks. In
addition, a preliminary Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was reached to provide
natural gas for domestic use. These agreements pave the way for final investment decisions
in 2016 and will help improve the supply of foreign exchange in 2016.

Introduction

The Mozambican authorities are appreciative of the Fund’s continued engagement and
support in advancing their economic reform agenda aimed at safeguarding macroeconomic
stability, gradually removing binding constraints to economic competitiveness, and
strengthening policy institutions. Economic performance has remained broadly in line with
the targets envisaged under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI), amidst heightened downside
risks related to protracted low commodity prices, the slowdown in FDI inflows, restrained
donor support, and the weakened global demand. However, in spite of timely actions to
contain increased depreciation pressures that have emerged since completion of the Fourth
PSI Review, BOP pressures have remained significant. This has led to a draw down in
reserve buffers and a robust adjustment of the macroeconomic policy stance to address short
term vulnerabilities while accelerating the pace of external adjustment. In view of this, the
authorities seek the Executive Board’s approval for completion of the fifth review under the
PSI and modification of assessment criteria, as well as the request for an 18-month
arrangement under the Standby Credit Facility.

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook

The challenging environment, primarily related to the protracted commodity price slump
coupled with the adverse impact of floods earlier in 2015, prompted a slight downward
revision of the macroeconomic policy objectives set for 2015-2017. GDP growth receded to
6.3 percent in the first half of 2015, compared to an average of 8 percent over the past two
years. This slowdown is primarily attributed to a significant decline of mining sector growth
from 29 percent in the first half of 2014 to 17 percent during the same period of 2015. There
was also weak performance in the commerce, transportation and agriculture sectors, the latter
mostly reflecting the impact of the floods. Recent developments indicate that in the first three
quarters of the year, real GDP grew by 6.2 percent, broadly in line with the projected growth
of 6.3 percent in 2015. Real GDP growth is forecast to reach on average 7-8 percent over the
medium term, in consonance with the goal set forth in the Five-Year Government Plan. This
performance improvement will be driven by projected increases in infrastructure investments
to boost competitiveness in labor intensive sectors including agriculture and manufacturing,
and by massive logistic investments in preparation of the exploration phase in the
hydrocarbon sector.
Consumer price inflation is forecast to average 2.4 percent in 2015, and is expected to remain
at the Bank of Mozambique’s (BM) target of 5-6 percent, in the short and medium term. To
lessen the impact of heightened depreciation pressures on the economy, the Monetary Policy
Committee increased its reserve requirements by 100 basis points in October and by 150
basis points in November 2015. The BM also raised both its standing lending facility rate and
its standing deposit facility rate by 225 basis points, cumulatively in October, November and

2

December, 2015, in an effort to further tighten the monetary policy stance. This should help
achieve a rapid adjustment of the external position, while preserving net international
reserves, consistent with the goal of maintaining comfortable levels of 4.5-5 month of import
cover over the near term.
The current account deficit excluding megaprojects deteriorated slightly in the first half of
2015, on account of weaker performance of traditional exports, lower commodity prices and
declining FDI and external aid. In the medium term, the current account deficit including
mega projects is expected to increase significantly, from around 42 percent of GDP in 2015,
to 55.5 and 81 percent of GDP, in 2017 and 2019, respectively, due to large projected
imports to support logistic investment in extractive sector. In the longer-term, however, once
the gas production begins, the current account balance could steadily improve and reach a
surplus of around 10 percent of GDP, in 2025.

Program Performance

The authorities have stepped up efforts to mitigate the adverse impact of short term
vulnerabilities arising from the lingering low commodity prices and terms of trade shocks,
coupled with weather related shocks, with mixed program performance under the PSI
through September 2015. Performance on three AC related to net credit to the government
(NCG), net international reserves (NIR), and external payment of arrears was mixed, while
government revenue fell short of the indicative target. Deviation in the NCG reflected
transitory factors, particularly the need to clear payment arrears (0.6 percent of GDP) of
subsidies to fuel distributors to compensate for the past losses, which have been underestimated in the budget, coupled with accelerated pace of discounting of bulk of government
securities issued to clear outstanding VAT arrears. The NIR was missed by a small margin
mostly reflecting significant BOP pressures and continued valuation losses due to a stronger
US Dollar. Coordination constraints in reconciling information with donors led to small
amount of arrears, which has since been resolved. On the structural front, significant progress
has been achieved; all measures have been implemented broadly as planned.

Fiscal Policy

The implementation of the authorities’ fiscal strategy in the short and medium term aims to
foster fiscal consolidation, support the needed external adjustment, and rebalance expenditure
towards growth-enhancing sectors, while safeguarding debt sustainability. Total revenue for
2015 is projected to reach 25.2 percent of GDP, the total expenditure including net lending to
amount to 35.3 percent of GDP, with the implied overall fiscal deficit projected around 6.0
percent of GDP. The targeted 2015 fiscal adjustment is expected to lead to a reduction of
around 1.5 percent of GDP, through containment of current expenditure, mostly the wage
bill, and subsidies, while scaling back public investment based on implementation capacity.

The authorities will continue to step up fiscal structural reforms to broaden the tax base,
enhancing the efficiency of tax administration, and set a robust legal framework to enable an
optimal intergenerational redistribution of the revenues from natural resource taxes. In
addition, strengthening of institutional capacity to monitor implementation of investment
programs, and upgrading the selection criteria to ensure adequate value for money of capital
expenditures will continue.
While cognizant of the risks posed by heightened depreciation pressures to debt
sustainability, the authorities remain committed to invigorate the implementation of policy
measures to improve debt management, and upgrade the institutional capacity on financial
oversight of public enterprises. This set of policy priorities will contribute to prevent
escalation of fiscal risks, and safeguard debt sustainability, over the medium and long term.
At the same time, an elevation of the debt vulnerability rating should not result purely from
external factors, such as exchange rate depreciation. Changes in the risk of debt distress
rating should also take into account exogenous factors which are beyond the authorities’
control.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies

The monetary and exchange rate policies continues to be geared towards achieving price
stability and smoothening exchange rate volatility in the short and medium term. The BM
will gradually fine tune its policy instruments to contain the current depreciation pressures,
while curbing the second round effects exerted on inflation expectations prompted by
adjustment in administered electricity, bread and water prices in October 2015. More
specifically, measures directed to enhance the monetary policy framework, particularly
through improved analytical capacity on inflation forecasting and liquidity management will
be given a priority. Swift implementation of policy measures aimed at strengthening crisis
management tools to contain risks for financial stability, stemming from significant
concentration of loans in the banking system, will also be critical.
Restoring reserve buffers is paramount to improve the ability of the economy to absorb future
external shocks. In this regard, the BM will continue to pursue actions directed at rebuilding
international reserves while allowing exchange rate flexibility.

Financial Sector Development Policies

Enhancing financial deepening and inclusion remain a critical challenge to address the
limited access to financial services in the economy. The authorities remain committed to
foster the implementation of ongoing reforms aimed at achieving the main objectives of the
Financial Sector Development Strategy (FSDS 2013-2022): (i) maintain financial stability;
(ii) increase access to financial services and products, and eliminating structural constraints
to the economy; and (iii) increase the supply of private capital to support private
development. To this end, a set of measures have been deployed, including the establishment

of credit registry bureaus, promotion of mobile banking and implementation of a moveable
collateral registry.

Structural Reforms

Fostering broad based-growth and achieving productivity gains in traditional sectors of the
economy such as agriculture and manufacturing, remain a challenge for Mozambique in the
next decade. The weak growth elasticity of poverty reduction, estimated at 0.1 percent, side
by side with still sub-optimal patterns of income distribution, call for accelerating structural
reforms to reinforce the growth-poverty- nexus, while addressing the outstanding bottlenecks
to economic competitiveness and productivity. The implementation of the authorities’ reform
agenda going forward, as stated in their Five Year Government Plan (2014-2019), seek to
foster economic transformation and diversification and swiftly deploy a set of policy
measures to tackle binding constraints to growth, through continued investment in
infrastructure projects to unlock the country’s growth potential and augment job creation.
Further, to improve the business climate, the authorities will revamp steps underway to
expedite the process of starting up a new business, particularly through improved online
provision of integrated services for facilitating “start ups”, in addition to expanding the
geographical coverage of one-stop shops.

Conclusion

Going forward the authorities stand ready to advance the implementation of policy reforms
aimed at restoring market confidence and safeguarding macroeconomic stability. They will
continue to implement measures which mitigate the adverse impact of short term
vulnerabilities. In line with these commitments, the authorities look forward to continued
constructive engagement with the Fund in order to support enhanced institutional capacity on
policy design and implementation.
