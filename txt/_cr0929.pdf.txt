REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
and Request for a Three-Year Arrangement under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
Prepared by the Middle East and Central Asia Department
(in consultation with other departments)
Approved by Lorenzo L. Pérez and Adnan Mazarei

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: Under the 2005–08 PRGF-supported program, Armenia achieved a marked
reduction in poverty within a high-growth and low-inflation macroeconomic environment.
The new (low-access) PRGF-supported program builds on these achievements and addresses
unfinished reform issues. Article IV discussions focused on the policy adjustments needed to
maintain macroeconomic stability in the face of a more challenging economic environment.
So far the policy mix has appropriately combined sound fiscal and monetary policies with
exchange rate flexibility, but macroeconomic imbalances are growing.
Staff views: Rising inflation, high credit growth, and a widening current account deficit have
raised concerns about overheating. But the downward risks from the global economic
downturn could help unwind existing macroeconomic imbalances. Policy adjustments may
be called for if economic conditions deteriorate more than anticipated. With no evidence of a
significant exchange rate misalignment, productivity-enhancing structural reforms are needed
to safeguard external sustainability and support medium-term growth prospects.
The authorities’ views: The authorities shared staff’s concerns about the risks associated
with rising inflation, but were not convinced that these reflected overheating. They saw
merit, however, in withdrawing fiscal stimulus during 2008–09, and recognized the
importance of boosting productivity, improving the business environment, strengthening
policy frameworks, and enhancing policy coordination. Given Armenia’s size and marginal
links with the global financial system, they saw limited downside risks for growth in the
short term, but stressed that medium-term risks have increased with the potential for a global
economic downturn.
New low-access PRGF arrangement: The program focuses on strengthening the fiscal and
monetary policy frameworks and their coordination, while deepening productivity-enhancing
structural reforms, and improving governance. Reforms in the areas of tax administration and
tax policy, where progress has been insufficient, are key to the success of the program.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Under the 2005-08 PRGF-supported program, Armenia achieved a marked reduction
in poverty within a high-growth and low-inflation macroeconomic environment. This strong
performance was underpinned by sustained macroeconomic discipline, but also reflected a
favorable global environment, and large-scale foreign exchange inflows. Meanwhile,
progress with structural reforms was uneven: reforms in the financial area, where ownership
was strong, were more successful than in tax policy and tax/customs administration, where
vested interests resisted the comprehensive approach necessary to create an efficient and fair
tax system (Box 1).
Box 1: Armenia’s Third PRGF-supported Program—Objectives and Achievements
Objectives: (i) maintain macroeconomic stability through prudent monetary and fiscal policies; (ii) generate
additional domestic resources to finance poverty-reducing and growth-enhancing expenditures, in particular by
strengthening tax and customs administration; and (iii) boost private sector activities by fostering financial
sector development, and improving public and corporate governance.
Achievements: These objectives have been achieved to a large extent. Program conditionality and staff policy
advice helped the authorities to implement prudent monetary and fiscal policies and make progress on structural
reforms in an environment of strong growth, low inflation, rising real incomes, and declining poverty rates.
Nominal revenue targets were consistently exceeded, and the tax-to-GDP ratio increased by two percentage
points amid double-digit GDP growth. Financial sector infrastructure, regulation, and supervision improved
markedly during the program period. Financial intermediation almost doubled in relation to GDP, and progress
was made in money and capital market development.
It can be argued, however, that structural conditionality—constrained by political limitations and ownership
considerations—could have been more ambitious and comprehensive, in particular regarding tax policy, and
tax/customs administration. While the piecemeal approach adopted in these areas addressed specific
shortcomings, it failed to create an efficient and fair tax system.

2.
On the surveillance side, response to Fund advice has been generally positive (Box
2). In particular, the new government (in office since April) has demonstrated strong impetus
for reform. In line with previous staff recommendations, the authorities are moving ahead
with several initiatives aimed at strengthening tax and customs administration, addressing tax
policy weaknesses, and improving the business environment.
3.
The recent war in neighboring Georgia and the global financial turmoil are unlikely to
affect the short-term growth outlook significantly, but downside risks are rising. While the
conflict demonstrated Armenia’s vulnerability to disruptions in transport (70 percent of
Armenian imports are shipped through Georgia), fuel shortages and trade interruptions were
temporary and had limited impact on production, consumer confidence, and domestic prices.
At the same time, the conflict served as a catalyst for preliminary talks with Turkey, which
could eventually lead to the opening of the border between the two countries—a highly
desirable scenario for land-locked Armenia. Given its limited integration with the

5
Box 2. Armenia: Response to Fund Advice
Fiscal Policy: The authorities followed Fund recommendations to achieve lower-thanbudgeted deficits during the past two years by prudent expenditure execution and saving of
revenue overperformance. Response to Fund advice in tax policy and administration—notably
regarding presumptive tax regimes, tax incentives for companies listing in the stock market,
and modernizing tax administration—has been mixed, but recent moves are encouraging.
Monetary Policy: In line with Fund advice, the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) committed to
a preannounced three-year inflation target and tightened monetary policy in response to
heightened inflationary pressures. The fiscal and monetary authorities improved policy
coordination in monetary operations and debt management following Fund recommendations.
Financial Sector: Bank corporate governance was strengthened in line with the 2005 FSAP
update, and the financial sector infrastructure was bolstered through improved market
transparency, creditor rights, and consumer protection. The authorities also introduced riskbased supervision.

international financial system, Armenia is not directly affected by the recent turmoil, but is
likely to suffer from any serious deterioration in Russia’s economic prospects.
4.
The authorities have requested a low-access PRGF arrangement to support their
ambitious reform agenda. A new Fund program is seen as crucial to safeguard
macroeconomic stability, and signal to donors, creditors, and foreign investors that policy
implementation is on track—especially in light of increasing risks. Importantly, the new
program will support the completion of politically difficult tax reforms, essential to improve
the business environment and promote broad-based growth. Moreover, Armenia’s narrow
export base and heavy reliance on remittances suggest that additional Fund resources could
be needed even in the absence of a significant exogenous shock. While the authorities have
been successful in reducing poverty, the overall poverty level is still high, and more progress
is needed to reach the Millennium Development Goals (Table 1).
II. BACKGROUND
5.
Armenia is poised for another year of double-digit growth, but inflation and external
imbalances are growing (Figure 1). Notwithstanding the temporary trade disruptions during
the Georgia conflict, annual real GDP grew by 10.4 percent in the nine months to September,
and is projected to remain around 10 percent this year, assuming continued strong activity in
construction and services. Annual inflation has remained high but, at 11.3 percent in
September, is still lower than in neighboring countries, thanks to a gradual tightening of
monetary policy, exchange rate flexibility, and a moderate fiscal stance. While inflation was
driven mainly by the global spike in food and energy prices (including the elimination of the
off-budget subsidy to end-users of natural gas last May), demand pressures have played an
increasing role. Indeed, rising wages, persistently large foreign exchange inflows, rapid
credit growth, and a sharply widening current account deficit have raised concerns about
overheating (Table 2).

6.
Budget execution in 2008 has been prudent (Table 3). Tax collection has been well
above expectations, driven by a surge in VAT revenue partly associated with high import
growth (Figure 2). Limited implementation capacity for capital projects and the
postponement of a $50 million disbursement from the Millennium Challenge Corporation
(MCC) resulted in significant spending underexecution, notwithstanding a 60-percent
increase in average pensions included in the 2008 budget. The shortfall in MCC-financed
rural road construction was partly offset with domestic resources within the same budgetary
envelope. As a result, the overall budget remained close to balance through July. This may
reverse the previous deterioration in the underlying fiscal balance (including the gas subsidy,
but excluding grants and external interest payments), which provides a better measure of the
impact of fiscal policy on domestic demand (Box 3).
7.
Monetary policy has been tightened to address rising inflationary pressures. To limit
the second-round effects of higher food and energy prices, the CBA raised the repurchase
rate gradually from 4.5 percent in June 2007 to 7.75 percent in September 2008, but left the
rate unchanged in October, in response to the uncertain external economic environment.
Broad money growth has remained robust, reflecting continued remonetization and surging
private sector credit (Table 4). Reserve money growth moderated slightly during the first
eight months of 2008 on account of larger government deposits with the CBA and higherthan-usual foreign exchange sales during the first half of the year (Figure 3).
8.
Despite large private transfers, the current account has continued to deteriorate.
Imports have surged on the back of high international food and energy prices and buoyant
demand, while export performance has been disappointing (Table 5). Weak exports reflect
declining competitiveness in diamond-processing, and temporary shortfalls in base metals
output, but also the high cost of doing business in Armenia. With appreciation pressures
dampened by rising import demand, the dram/dollar exchange rate has been broadly stable
since December 2007. International reserve coverage dropped somewhat, but remains
adequate, at 3½ months of imports.

Box 3. Armenia: Evolving Fiscal Stance 1/
Fiscal policy can be used as an effective demand management tool in Armenia, as demonstrated by
the impressive fiscal adjustment of 1999–2004. During this period, the underlying fiscal deficit was
slashed from 8 to about 2 percent of GDP, significantly contributing to macroeconomic stability, and
paving the way for double-digit growth.
This trend has been reversed. Since 2004, the underlying balance has steadily deteriorated and fiscal
policy has become moderately pro-cyclical—the cyclically-adjusted underlying balance has
deteriorated even further, at a time when output was above potential. Given Armenia’s weak
automatic stabilizers and looming macroeconomic risks (including the planned pension reform), fiscal
policy should be used more effectively as a countercyclical tool going forward.

The new government has given clear priority to reforms in tax policy and
administration:
o To address tax policy deficiencies, a VAT threshold and a simplified tax regime
below the threshold have been approved, becoming effective from January 2009.
o A comprehensive and well-targeted plan for modernizing the tax administration (in
line with Fund advice) has been adopted.
o The recent merger of tax and customs administrations in a single State Revenue
Committee (SRC) is expected to yield efficiency gains in administrative and

On balance, the short-run outlook remains favorable, although staff projections are
subject to a higher-than-usual degree of uncertainty. Growth is projected to moderate to
around 8 percent in 2009, reflecting a slowdown in Russia and in residential construction in
Armenia. Monetary and fiscal policy tightening and the expected easing of commodity prices

12
in international markets should bring inflation back to the CBA’s target range (4 ±1.5
percent) by end-2009. Under a new contract with Gazprom, gas prices will be raised from
$110 to $154 per 1,000 m3 from April 2009, a price that remains significantly lower than
those paid by neighboring countries. Credit growth is projected to slow down on account of
rising interest rates and banks’ limited capacity to secure long-term funding for lending,
particularly in the current uncertain global environment. On the downside, the current
account deficit is set to widen further, reflecting continued buoyant imports, and poor export
performance, although import demand could be dampened if inflows lose pace faster than
currently anticipated.

The medium-term outlook is also benign (Table 6). With several investment projects
underway and relatively stable remittance inflows, growth rates of around 6–8 percent seem
within reach. Inflation is expected to stabilize around the CBA’s target rate of 4 percent,
assuming supportive macroeconomic policies. Monetary policy is expected to become more
effective with financial deepening and the move to full-fledged inflation targeting, while the
planned improvements in the fiscal framework should lead to a more active stabilization role
for fiscal policy. This would require a sustained revenue effort and better spending
prioritization to make room for infrastructure and social needs, especially in view of
prospects for lower grants and GDP growth rates in the medium term. The widening external
current account deficit calls for accelerated structural reforms to diversify production, raise
productivity, and boost the export potential.
13.
Nevertheless, an escalation of external risks cannot be ruled out. With a potential
global recession in sight amid a financial turmoil, the international economic environment
has become increasingly challenging. Importantly, a collapse in world oil prices could lead to
a protracted downturn in Russia and negatively affect private transfers and FDI inflows to
Armenia, depressing economic activity, and damaging growth prospects. Moreover, the
outlook for international commodity prices is uncertain, and the geopolitical landscape
remains fragile.
14.
Current debt levels and borrowing plans do not raise major sustainability concerns.
The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) suggests that Armenia is at low risk of debt distress,
with all debt indicators well below the relevant country-specific debt burden thresholds in the
baseline scenario. An alternative scenario including financing for a planned new nuclear
power plant would result in a sharp but temporary worsening of debt indicators. The
authorities agreed with the analysis and the underlying assumptions, but noted that
government debt financing for the potential nuclear power plant is currently not under
consideration. To finance several large infrastructure projects in the medium term, they are
considering increasing external borrowing (partly on noncessional terms) from the World
Bank and other international financial institutions, but these plans still need to be firmed up.

13
B. The Policy Mix
The current policy mix has appropriately combined sound fiscal and monetary policies with
exchange rate flexibility. As long as the risks of overheating outweigh the risks of a sharp
drop in foreign exchange inflows, monetary and fiscal policies will need to remain tight.
Fiscal policy
15.
Fiscal policy should balance the need for a more countercyclical stance with the
spending requirements for further poverty reduction. To that end, continued strong revenue
performance would be crucial to finance infrastructure investment and social programs,
highlighting the importance of tax reforms. On balance, staff viewed some fiscal tightening
as appropriate, given the existing signs of overheating. Against the background of persistent
inflationary pressures and the uncertain outlook for commodity prices, the authorities saw
merit in withdrawing fiscal stimulus during 2008-09 (MEFP ¶19 and ¶20), but noted that the
policy stance in 2009 might need to be revised in light of the rapidly-changing external
environment.
•

For 2008, the ‘underlying’ deficit will be limited to 1.9 percent of GDP, compared
with 3.5 percent of GDP with full budget execution.1 The lower deficit will be
achieved by saving revenue over-performance and curtailing non-priority spending.
This should be feasible, given revenue performance to date.

•

For 2009, the underlying deficit will be further reduced to 1.7 percent of GDP
(corresponding to an overall deficit of 1.0 percent of GDP). The budget
accommodates higher spending on wages, pensions, infrastructure, and targeted
benefits to mitigate the impact of higher food and fuel costs. The revenue target is
ambitious, considering that the improvement in tax collection in 2007 was
accompanied by a significant build-up of tax credits that have not yet been cleared.2
Increasing domestic financing would contribute to the development of the securities
market.

These figures include the off-budget gas subsidy in place until May 2008.

These credits appear to result from irregular requests for advanced tax payments or negotiated payments
between businesses and tax inspectors struggling to meet collection targets.

16.
Rising medium-term risks call for continued fiscal prudence. Plans to increase
pension outlays, introduce a funded pension pillar, and build a new nuclear power plant,
together with the lack of effective monitoring and controls of noncommercial organizations
(NCOs) that are mainly financed through the budget, are expected to put pressure on the
budget in the coming years.
•

The introduction of a funded pillar by January 2010, together with the envisaged
increases in state-funded pensions, need to be carefully assessed. Preliminary
estimates suggest that the cost of the funded pillar could be relatively small (around
0.4 percent of GDP per year). But plans to raise average pensions to the level of the
minimum consumption basket (MCB) by 2012 could add up to 1.4 percent of GDP to
total annual spending. Staff reiterated earlier concerns about keeping the costs of the
reform within manageable levels, implementing the pension reform gradually, and
containing the risks associated with the planned unification of the personal income
tax with social insurance contributions to a funded pillar. The planned temporary
transfer of legal ownership from employees to the state budget of half of the amount
to be accumulated in individual accounts (the 5 percent state participation) is
particularly worrisome, since future governments may decide to change the law and
not return to employees this part of their contributions. The authorities noted that
pension reform in Armenia will have an important poverty-reduction aspect.

•

The new monitoring and control systems for NCOs, elaborated with World Bank
assistance, will be piloted in four sectors. While the pilot project will be implemented
with World Bank funding, staff stressed—and the authorities agreed—that full
program implementation will require significant additional resources at the NCO unit
of the Ministry of Finance (MoF), in line ministries, and in individual NCOs.

15
•

The construction of a new nuclear power plant, planned to begin in 2011, would cost
about $4–6 billion, according to current estimates. Depending on final financing
decisions taken by the authorities, the project has the potential to significantly raise
public or publicly-guaranteed debt. Staff cautioned that any financing decision needs
to be consistent with long-term debt sustainability.

17.
A more comprehensive approach to analyzing fiscal risks is needed to strengthen the
budget process and enhance fiscal policy credibility. The current three-year Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) establishes priorities and expenditure envelopes, but is
short on risk analysis and related policy responses. Moreover, some policy decisions
affecting medium- and long-term fiscal sustainability (such as the recent increase in basic
pensions) have been taken outside the MTEF. The authorities recognize the importance of
strengthening the fiscal framework and are committed to stepping up fiscal analysis during
the program period (MEFP ¶26 and ¶29).
Monetary and exchange rate policies
18.
The CBA is committed to further tightening monetary policy to bring down inflation
if signs of overheating persist. While commodity price increases were the initial drivers of
inflation, demand factors have increasingly added to inflationary pressures. Against this
background, the CBA considered bolder interest rate hikes, but eventually settled for a more
cautious approach due to the heightened uncertainties created by the conflict in Georgia. If
inflationary pressures linger, the CBA plans to continue raising the repo rate gradually, but is
ready to move faster if needed (MEFP ¶21). While the pass-through of policy rate changes
has been limited so far, commercial banks have slowly begun to adjust loan and deposit
interest rates in response to tighter funding conditions resulting from rapid credit growth and
limited availability of external resources.
19.
The key elements for successful inflation targeting (IT) are already in place, but the
IT framework is new and untested, and the monetary transmission mechanism remains weak.
To enhance monetary operations and debt management, the CBA will discontinue issuing its
own securities and will instead focus on conducting repo operations, while the treasury will
recommence issuing short-term T-bills (MEFP ¶24). Close coordination of debt issuance will
be crucial, taking into account both budget financing and liquidity management needs. The
CBA also plans to increase its holdings of treasury securities over the medium term in order
to strengthen its capacity to conduct reverse repo operations. To improve banks’ liquidity
management, the CBA is considering lengthening the reference period for reserve
requirements, introducing an overnight credit facility, and establishing an electronic
interbank trading platform (MEFP ¶25).
20.
The authorities intend to maintain a flexible exchange rate regime, consistent with the
IT framework (MEFP ¶23). Since 2003, the CBA has increasingly engaged in foreign
exchange interventions to smooth exchange rate volatility and accommodate capital inflows,

16
remonetization, and dedollarization. Empirical analysis suggests that the impact of this policy
on both the level and the volatility of the exchange rate has been limited (Box 4).
Box 4. Armenia: Effectiveness of Foreign Exchange Market Interventions 1/
Armenia maintains a managed floating exchange rate regime, and the CBA regularly intervenes in the
foreign exchange market. Interventions aim at ensuring orderly conditions in a thin market—with a
small number of participants, lumpy foreign exchange inflows, and vulnerability to external shocks.
Managing banking system liquidity and accumulating foreign exchange reserves have at times been
secondary objectives of CBA interventions.
The effectiveness of interventions—measured in terms of their impact on the level and volatility of
the exchange rate—was analyzed for the period January 2001-May 2008 using a GARCH framework.
A two-step procedure was employed to address the identification problem resulting from the two-way
causality between intervention activity and exchange rate movements.
Preliminary results from various GARCH specifications over different sub-periods suggest that
interventions have had little impact on slowing dram appreciation and on lowering exchange rate
volatility. There is only some limited evidence that foreign exchange sales have been associated with
lower exchange rate volatility. However, only daily data are available, and it may well be that foreign
exchange interventions have had stabilizing intra-day effects—in particular in the context of lumpy
foreign exchange inflows.
The authorities stress that a significant part of interventions was conducted to accommodate cash
dedollarization. But since the extent of dedollarization is difficult to quantify, large-scale unsterilized
foreign exchange purchases may have added to inflationary pressures. Foreign exchange sales in the
first half of 2008 have been more in line with the tightening of monetary policy needed to curb
inflation. More broadly, allowing two-way exchange rate flexibility would be important to avoid oneway bets.
1/ For details, see Selected Issues, Chapter 2:“Smoothing Exchange Rate or Fuelling Inflation: What Are the
Effects of Foreign Exchange Market Intervention in Armenia.”

In 2008, out of concern for the
potential destabilizing effects of
political uncertainty and the
Russian-Georgian conflict, the
authorities reduced their tolerance
for exchange rate volatility, and
the dram fluctuated within a
narrower band. Intervention,
however, has not been targeted at
the level of the exchange rate.

The current exchange rate level does not raise serious concerns about external
stability. The marked nominal appreciation of the dram in recent years has helped keep
inflation well below the regional average, while real appreciation has been far above that of
similar countries. Based on a range of different estimates, the authorities and staff agreed that
there may have been a slight overvaluation in 2007 (Box 5), which the authorities believe is
likely to have been reduced by developments during 2008. The authorities also agreed with
staff that competitiveness issues should be addressed by structural policies, in particular by
promoting a business-friendly environment.
Box 5. Exchange Rate Assessment 1/
The steady dram appreciation in recent years has raised concerns about external competitiveness and
the appropriate level of the exchange rate. Staff’s current assessment, based on various approaches,
indicates moderate deviations from equilibrium, which are not sufficiently large to generate future
external instability. The authorities’ own findings are broadly consistent with staff’s assessment.
Staff estimates suggest that the recent appreciation has reversed the previous undervaluation of the
dram. Both the behavioral equilibrium exchange rate approach and the purchasing power parity
approach (pictured below) indicate that the exchange rate is currently slightly above its equilibrium
value. The External Sustainability Approach (ES) suggests that the previous undervaluation from
the benchmark growth (6 percent) was reversed in 2007, when a slight overvaluation was observed.
Armenia's sustainable external current account deficit norm is estimated to range between 2 and 14
percent of GDP, assuming that the NFA position will stabilize at about 25 percent of GDP.

Recent developments in external price and cost competitiveness indicators are mixed. Armenia’s
export market shares have remained relatively stable for all major export destinations. Nominal unit
labor costs (ULC) have continued to edge upward, indicating a decline in wage competitiveness,
particularly in agriculture and industry. Despite this trend, foreign-investor interest in Armenia
remains relatively strong.
1/ For details, see: Selected Issues, Chapter 3: “Exchange Rate Appreciation and External Competitiveness in
Armenia.”

18
Financial sector issues
22.
Armenia’s financial sector infrastructure, regulation, and supervision have improved
significantly, but a number of unresolved issues remain. The banking sector still suffers from
a lack of sufficient long-term funding, unsatisfactory level of risk management, market
segmentation, and high interest rate spreads. Although deposits are increasing at a healthy
pace, deposit growth has lagged credit growth during the past three years. In line with earlier
Fund recommendations, the authorities have bolstered their efforts to foster commercial bank
risk management capacity and improve market transparency and consumer protection.
Several legislative measures have been implemented, and currently the CBA is preparing an
extensive financial service consumer education campaign. The supervisory system is
effective, and the share of foreign bank ownership is on the rise. A number of banks have
benefited from technical assistance provided by international banks or through the USAID
financial sector deepening project.
23.
Financial soundness indicators do not yet indicate significant vulnerabilities (Table
7). Banks continue to be profitable, and nonperforming loans, have remained low and
concentrated in a couple of banks. Yet, the sharp pickup in credit growth since mid-2007—
while a welcome boost to financial intermediation—could potentially impact negatively on
financial sector stability. Although large-scale equity capital inflows into the banking system
are continuing, limited access to external borrowing is becoming an increasing constraint to
credit expansion. This will eventually trigger a welcome moderation in credit growth. At the
same time, due to the limited external exposure of local banks, the international financial
turmoil is not expected to have a direct impact on the stability of the Armenian financial
system. Looking ahead, a potential downward correction in real estate prices could add to
credit risk, although the mortgage share in total credit is still comparatively low.
C. Structural Reforms
While Armenia has made significant strides in financial sector reform, additional efforts are
needed to boost competitiveness, notably by improving the business environment.
24.
Sustained growth requires a more diversified and competitive economy. While some
progress has been made, the cost of doing business in Armenia remains high, and a large part
of economic activity remains underground. The World Bank’s “Doing Business 2009” report
shows a slight deterioration in Armenia’s position (from 41st to 44th rank), notably in
categories such as ‘starting a business’ and ‘trading across borders.’ Yet, ‘paying taxes’
remains the worst category by far, with Armenia slipping from 147th to 150th place (Figure
4).
25.
The authorities acknowledged the need and urgency to buttress competitiveness by
enhancing the business climate. The planned overhaul in tax and customs administration is a
major step in this direction, since it should contribute to scaling down the shadow economy

19
and discouraging tax evasion (thus promoting financial deepening), while creating room for
productivity-enhancing infrastructure and capital investments. External competitiveness
would also be boosted by fostering domestic competition, notably by tackling import
monopolies. World Bank support in various areas (including regulatory changes,
infrastructure development, competition policy, and customs reform) should contribute to
enhance competitiveness.
D. The New Program
Program objectives and design
26.
The PRGF-supported program builds on recent policy discussions and on the updated
PRSP, renamed Sustainable Development Program (SDP).3 The new arrangement will cover
the three-year period starting from Board approval. Access is limited to 10 percent of quota
(SDR 9.2 million), with seven disbursements (Table 8). Since Armenia has large repurchases
falling due in 2008–11, outstanding Fund credit is projected to decline during this period
(Table 9).
27.
The main goals of the new program are to sustain and broaden economic growth, and
further reduce poverty, consistent with SDP priorities. Appropriate fiscal and monetary
policies will underpin the macroeconomic objectives of the program. Its main focus will be
on strengthening the fiscal and monetary policy frameworks and their coordination, while
deepening productivity-enhancing structural reforms, and improving governance. To this
end, the program will aim at having in place a fully-developed fiscal framework and a full-

fledged IT framework by the end of the three-year period. This will require, among other
things, strengthening the institutional and analytical capacity at the MOF,4 and adopting a
Forecasting and Policy Analysis System for inflation targeting at the CBA. The current
global crisis highlights the need to minimize Armenia’s vulnerabilities by stepping up efforts
to diversify production and reduce dependence on remittances.
Program monitoring
28.
Program implementation will be monitored on a semi-annual basis. The first review is
expected to be completed by June 2009, based on December 2008 quantitative performance
criteria (MEFP Table 1). To reflect changed circumstances, conditionality was modified
compared to previous programs:
•

The overall balance of the central government was replaced by the underlying fiscal
balance (excluding grants and external interest payments). Given Armenia’s low debt
levels, it is difficult to anchor short-term fiscal policy to long-term fiscal
sustainability. Against that background, the underlying balance provides a better
measure of the impact of fiscal policy on domestic demand.

•

The zero limit on contracting/guaranteeing new nonconcessional external debt was
replaced by a small positive amount ($50 million), making room for the authorities’
debt issuance plans and projects financed by the World Bank and Asian Development
Bank, consistent with the fiscal program and domestic capacity.

•

While monetary aggregates will still be used as indicative targets in the transition
period to full-fledged IT, during the program period conditionality will switch to a
periodic assessment of a defined set of monetary indicators, together with a
requirement for consultation with Fund staff if the inflation target is missed.

Structural conditionality
29.
Structural conditionality focuses mainly on tax administration/policy reforms, given
their positive impact on the business environment, financial intermediation, and economic
growth. The reasons why the specific structural measures to be adopted during the first year
of the program are macro-critical are presented in Box 6.
30.
The tax-to-GDP ratio in Armenia is lower than in most transition countries, and well
below potential. Weaknesses in tax policy and administration (including customs) are at the
heart of Armenia’s poor revenue performance. Customs reforms, largely supported by the
World Bank, will focus on establishing risk-based processes to minimize the interaction
4

For details, see Chapter 1 of the Selected Issues Paper.

Box 6. Armenia: Structural Conditionality, 2008–09
Structural Measure

Rationale for Macro-Criticality
Tax administration is perceived as the biggest constraint on businesses in
Armenia. Without significant reform, further improvements in tax collection
will be difficult, and recent ones may not be sustainable.

(i) implementing a modern function-based structure;

Remove inefficiencies (such as duplicated activity) and ensure better use of tax
administration resources.

(ii) merging the four specialist inspectorates into a single large taxpayer
inspectorate (LTI);

Focus on large taxpayer segment, where contributions to total tax revenues
have been declining in recent years.

(iii) significantly reducing the number of tax inspectorates.

Redirect tax administration resources to higher revenue-yielding activities.

2. Introduce best practices in VAT refund processing to exporters by:

Denied refunds in Armenia cause considerable tension between tax
administration and businesses, effectively taxing exports.

(i) clearing backlog of refund claims; meeting statutory 90-day processing
deadline for all claims filed in 2009;

Reduce the stock of refund claims, which has been increasing since late 2006
because of pressure to meet collection targets and concerns about VAT fraud.

(ii) implementing risk-management approaches;

Introduce best practice in modern tax administration in Armenia, which should
be feasible given small number of claims.

(iii) implementing forecasting system for refund levels;

Ensure that funds are available to pay legitimate refund claims as they occur.

(iv) strengthening penalties for false refund claims and paying interest on
legitimate refunds not paid on time.
3. Strengthen domestic debt market by signing an agreement between MoF
and CBA on coordination of government securities auctions, including:

Enhance the integrity of VAT system by strengthening incentives for both tax
payers and tax administration.
The domestic debt market remains underdeveloped, and there have been
coordination failures between monetary policy and debt management.

(i) discontinuation of CBA security issuance;

Remove market segmentation.

(ii) commitment to avoid using cut-off yields at treasury auctions, except to
reject clearly speculative bids that lie outside normal range of bidding.

Strengthen monetary transmission mechanism, boost credibility of the
government’s macroeconomic framework, and encourage development of
treasury securities market.

4. Improve CBA recapitalization mechanism following best practice, using
marketable government securities.

Current modalities (non-marketable, non-interest bearing promissory notes)
lack transparency, hinder monetary policy implementation, and discourage
debt market development.
Fiscal policy should become a more effective and credible demand
management tool.

5. Strengthen fiscal framework with analytical reports, identifying fiscal
challenges, risks, policy responses.

22

1. Restructure the tax administration by:

23
between customs officials and importers (MEFP ¶17). Program conditionality targets several
well-pointed measures aimed at significantly improving Armenia’s tax environment, in line
with FAD recommendations (MEFP Table 2):
•

Significant reform in the system for VAT refund processing (structural performance
criterion, MEFP ¶27).

•

Modernization of the tax administration, including adoption of a function-based
organizational structure, merger of the large taxpayer inspectorates, and a significant
cut in the number of regional offices (structural benchmark, MEFP ¶28).

•

Abolishment of current presumptive tax regimes (notably those related to fuel and
tobacco) during the program period (MEFP ¶27).

31.
The program includes measures to strengthen the fiscal framework. To enhance fiscal
policy credibility and strengthen the budget process, the authorities will publish an annual
report on medium-term fiscal risks and contingency plans (structural benchmark, MEFP
¶29).
32.
The program also includes measures to improve the coordination of monetary and
fiscal policies:
•

Agreement on the coordination of government securities auctions, including (i) the
discontinuation of CBA security issuance, and (ii) a commitment to avoid using cutoff yields in treasury auctions (structural performance criterion, MEFP ¶24).

•

Revamped recapitalization mechanism for the central bank, using marketable
government securities (structural benchmark, MEFP ¶31).

Risks to the program
33.
In the midst of unprecedented uncertainty, risks to the program have intensified. The
main short-term risk is that a protracted economic downturn in Russia will significantly cut
back inflows of remittances and FDI. This could offset the main concern to date—the risk of
overheating. On the home front, lack of political support could jeopardize the authorities’
ambitious reform program. In the medium term, the economic vulnerabilities described in
paragraphs 13 (global economic environment), 14 (debt sustainability), and 23 (financial
sector), and Box 4 (dedollarization) are compounded by lingering geopolitical risks
(unresolved conflict with Azerbaijan and closed borders with Turkey), which hamper market
access and economic diversification. Moreover, the recent hostilities in neighboring Georgia
have exposed Armenia’s vulnerability to disruptions in trade. Given its good debt servicing
record and strong commitment to macroeconomic discipline, Armenia is not expected to
experience difficulties in repaying the Fund.

24
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Armenia made significant strides during the last PRGF-supported program. Prudent
monetary and fiscal policies, together with a flexible exchange rate regime, delivered doubledigit growth and low inflation, and a notable reduction in poverty. This impressive
performance was supported by large-scale foreign exchange inflows and a favorable external
environment. The short-term outlook remains favorable although tempered by regional
instability and rising uncertainties about the global economy.
35.
But macroeconomic imbalances have widened recently. During the past year, rising
inflation, a widening current account deficit, and rapid credit growth have raised concerns
about overheating. While supply shocks ignited inflation, buoyant demand kept inflationary
pressures high and fueled import growth. At the same time, Armenia’s export potential
remains weak, the production base is undiversified, and the economy continues to be heavily
dependant on remittances to finance its large trade deficit and a construction boom.
36.
Sluggish structural reforms are at the heart of these rising imbalances. The resulting
weak business environment discourages economic diversification, hinders export growth, and
accentuates Armenia’s dependence on foreign exchange inflows and vulnerability to external
shocks. The government’s intention to press ahead with overdue reforms is a welcome step to
make the economy more resilient to future terms of trade shocks and disruptions in foreign
exchange inflows.
37.
The current global financial turmoil and the threat of a severe economic downturn
compound the significant challenges ahead. While the current tightening financial conditions
are unlikely to impact directly on Armenia, a regional slowdown would affect FDI and
remittance inflows, undermining growth prospects. At the same time, a moderation in these
inflows would help unwind the accumulated macroeconomic imbalances and mitigate the
risk of overheating. It would be crucial to take this opportunity to complete the unfinished
reform agenda and pave the way for broad-based growth.
38.
Sustained policy adjustments will be needed to maintain macroeconomic stability in
the face of a more challenging economic environment. Unless the risks of overheating
dissipate on the heels of weakening world demand, monetary and fiscal policies will need to
remain tight. While the monetary framework is well-designed, fiscal management needs to be
strengthened to support the inflation targeting regime and enhance policy effectiveness.
o With monetary policy effectiveness constrained by large foreign exchange inflows
and a weak transmission mechanism, supportive fiscal policy will be essential to
ensure that inflation targets are met. To that end, the authorities’ decision to withdraw
fiscal stimulus in 2008-09 is commendable. Over the medium term, fiscal policy
should balance the need for a more countercyclical fiscal stance with the spending
requirements for further poverty reduction.

25
o Monetary policy will have to be tightened further in case inflationary pressures do not
recede. To support inflation control, the authorities should refrain from extensive
unsterilized foreign exchange purchases in response to large foreign exchange
inflows. A conservative prudential approach would help mitigate risks from the sharp
pick-up in credit growth.
o Exchange rate flexibility will continue to be the best option for Armenia. While real
appreciation pressures will be inevitable if large foreign exchange inflows persist, a
tight fiscal policy and structural reforms would guard against loss of competitiveness.
39.
Statistical data are adequate for surveillance purposes. The authorities are encouraged
to implement the recommendations of the recent data ROSC to address remaining
weaknesses.
40.
Armenia’s request for a new PRGF arrangement comes at a time of unprecedented
uncertainty in the world economy. Policy adjustments may be required if economic
conditions in Armenia deteriorate more than anticipated. The program’s focus on
strengthening the fiscal and monetary frameworks and on completing tax reforms adequately
addresses the significant challenges ahead. Achieving the program’s objectives will require a
concerted effort to fully implement structural policies, while maintaining financial stability.
Monetary and fiscal policies will need to remain prudent, responding flexibly to new
developments. In particular, the authorities will need to balance the need to boost social
spending to meet SDP objectives with the need to limit the fiscal impulse in order to control
inflation, which mostly affects the poor.
41.
Structural conditionality under the new program will focus on tax administration and
tax policy reform, given their positive impact on the business environment and economic
growth. Tax administration needs to be more transparent and fair to encourage compliance
and ensure a level playing field for business. Major tax administration reforms are needed to
ensure that the recent improvement in tax collection is sustainable. The implementation of
these measures is likely to be resisted by vested interests, and will thus be a test of the
government’s resolve to move ahead with reforms.
42.
Based on the authorities’ good track record and the strong policy and structural
program envisaged for 2009, staff supports the authorities’ request for a new PRGF
arrangement. However, in view of increasing global risks, Armenia’s external financial
requirements may increase as well, possibly calling for higher access than under the current
PRGF arrangement. In these circumstances, staff would support a prompt review of access
and modalities of Fund support. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultations be held
on the standard 24-month cycle.

Goal 2: Ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling.
Goal 3: Eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education preferably by 2005 and to all levels of education no later than 2015.
Goal 4: Reduce by two-thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality rate.
Goal 5: Reduce by three-quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio.
Goal 6: Have halted by 2015, and begun to reverse, the spread of HIV/AIDS. Have halted by 2015, and begun to reverse, the incidence of
malaria and other major diseases.
Goal 7: Integrate the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programs and reverse the loss of environmental resources.
Halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water.
Goal 8: Develop further an open, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory trading and financial system. Address the special needs of
landlocked countries and small island developing states. Deal comprehensively with the debt problems of developing countries through national
and international measures in order to make debt sustainable in the long term. In cooperation with developing countries, develop and implement
strategies for decent and productive work for youth.

ATTACHMENT I. ARMENIA: LETTER OF INTENT
September 16, 2008

Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:

In support of its economic reform program, the Government of the Republic of Armenia
requests a three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
in an amount equivalent to SDR 9.2 million (10 percent of quota). The low access for this
arrangement intends to signal Armenia’s status as a mature stabilizer.
Under the three-year PRGF program that expired on May 24, 2008, we have achieved
important results. The implementation of prudent monetary and fiscal policies and farreaching structural reforms have supported strong economic growth, low inflation, rising real
incomes, and declining poverty rates. The challenge before us is how to consolidate these
gains. While stability is necessary for growth, it is only by boosting the productive potential
of the economy that we can make growth sustainable. The new program addresses the
unfinished structural reform agenda to fully equip policy frameworks and institutions for the
next challenges facing the Armenian economy.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) outlines our broad
macroeconomic objectives for 2008-11 and provides specific measures for 2008-09. The
focus will be on strengthening the fiscal and monetary policy frameworks, deepening
productivity-enhancing structural reforms, reducing barriers to competition, and improving
governance. Fiscal reforms aimed at strengthening tax and customs administration are
particularly important for the success of these efforts.
The Government believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to
achieve the objectives of the program, but it will take other measures that may become
necessary for this purpose. The Government will consult with the Fund on the adoption of
these measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in
accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultation. Moreover, after the period of the

38
PRGF arrangement, and while Armenia has outstanding financial obligations to the Fund
from loans on earlier arrangements, the Government will consult with the Fund on Armenia’s
economic and financial policies from time to time, at the initiative of the Government or at
the request of the Managing Director. We expect to complete the first semi-annual review
under the proposed arrangement by June 2009.

Very truly yours,

ATTACHMENT II. ARMENIA: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
(SEPTEMBER 16, 2008)
1.
This Memorandum sets out the economic and financial policies of the Armenian
government for 2009–11, which are aimed at sustaining economic growth and reducing
poverty. These policies form the basis for a new three-year Fund-supported program under a
low-access PRGF arrangement, signaling Armenia’s status as a mature stabilizer.
2.
The new program will build on the substantial progress already achieved under the
PRGF-supported arrangement that expired on May 24, 2008. The focus will be on
strengthening the fiscal and monetary policy frameworks, deepening productivity-enhancing
structural reforms, reducing barriers to competition, and improving governance. Fiscal
reforms aimed at strengthening tax and customs administration are critical for the success of
these efforts.
3.
This Memorandum presents a summary of the performance under the government’s
2005–08 program, outlines the medium-term objectives and policy framework for 2009–11,
and sets out specific economic and financial policies for 2008-09. We have reached
understandings with Fund staff on a set of macroeconomic targets and structural benchmarks
for 2008-09, which are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Policies described in the Memorandum
are consistent with our updated Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), renamed
Sustainable Development Program (SDP), and the government’s Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework for 2009–11. We expect to complete the first semi-annual review under the
proposed arrangement by end-June 2009; the second review by end-November 2009, and the
third review by end-June 2010.
I. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE 2005–08 PROGRAM
4.
The 2005–08 program focused primarily on three objectives: a) maintaining
macroeconomic stability through prudent monetary and fiscal policies; b) generating
additional domestic resources to finance poverty-reducing and growth-enhancing
expenditures; and c) boosting private sector activities by fostering financial sector
development, and improving public and corporate governance. To a large measure, these
objectives have been achieved.
5.
Prudent monetary and fiscal policies and far-reaching structural reforms supported
strong economic growth, low inflation, rising real incomes, and declining poverty rates. Over
the period 2005–07, GDP growth averaged 13.7 percent per year, and inflation remained
below 3 percent on average. At the same time, the overall poverty rate declined from 34.6
percent in 2004 to 26.5 percent in 2006. Despite a rising external current account deficit,
which reflected double-digit growth and strong investment activity, gross international
reserves increased from 3.1 to 4.3 months of import coverage between 2004 and 2007. Large
capital inflows, mostly in the form of FDI, provided the necessary financing, reflecting

40
improved investment opportunities in the Armenian economy. The increase in external
borrowing led to a slight deterioration in external debt indicators, which, however, remain
comfortably low.
6.
Fiscal prudence was crucial for the success of our program. The overall fiscal deficit
was kept at about 2 percent of GDP. The progress achieved with revenue mobilization was
used to finance poverty-reducing and growth-enhancing expenditures. The tax revenue ratio
was raised from 14 percent of GDP in 2004 to 16 percent of GDP in 2007, and grants and
non-tax revenues increased as well. This allowed us to increase expenditure from 17.1
percent of GDP to 22.4 percent of GDP (including the gas subsidy)1 over the same period,
while government debt was reduced from 32.4 percent of GDP to 17.4 percent of GDP.
7.
The monetary framework was strengthened with the adoption of an implicit inflation
targeting regime in 2006. Moreover, by committing to a preannounced three-year target in
2008, the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) took an important step toward full-fledged
inflation-targeting. Together with a flexible exchange rate, the new framework contributed to
our success in maintaining moderate inflation, providing an anchor to inflation expectations
in the face of significant external shocks. Monetary policy implementation was greatly
enhanced by a more extensive use of indirect instruments, particularly open market
operations, which helped improve liquidity management and fostered the development of the
money market.
8.
Our tax policy during the program period was focused on reducing the scope of tax
exemptions. We limited access to the simplified tax regime, with the final objective of
eliminating it, and reduced the number of goods exempt from VAT at the border.
Presumptive taxes were indexed to the CPI. Additionally, we completed and submitted to
Parliament the general part of the tax code. Tax administration reform concentrated on
strengthening IT capacity, limiting the interaction between taxpayers and tax officials by
eliminating recording commissions, and introducing risk-based audit selection systems.
Moreover, we have recently adopted a comprehensive and ambitious medium-term tax
reform plan.
9.
Structural reforms have improved the financial sector infrastructure and the
regulatory and supervisory framework, promoting private sector activity and financial
deepening. As a result, financial intermediation almost doubled in relation to GDP since end2006.

Key weaknesses in banks’ corporate governance were addressed early on in the
program, improving accountability and confidence in the banking system. Market
transparency, creditor rights, and consumer protection were enhanced through new

41
legislation and the establishment of a credit registry at the CBA as well as a private
credit bureau. Financial institutions were strengthened through increased minimum
capital requirements, the implementation of the first pillar of Basel II Accord
provisions, investments in banks’ risk management capacity, and the entry of
reputable international commercial banks. Most recently, we adopted legislation on
asset securitization and mortgage-backed securities to promote the development of
the mortgage market, on Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of
Terrorism, on the disclosure of financial terms of consumer loans and bank deposits,
and on the establishment of financial ombudsperson services.
•

Financial sector regulation and supervision was strengthened markedly through
consolidation and introduction of risk-based supervision, and the recent move to a
functional or process-oriented structure, separating the main functions of (i)
prudential requirements, (ii) market conduct, and (iii) consumer protection.

•

With a view to containing activities in the informal economy and strengthening
monetary policy effectiveness, we introduced several measures limiting cash
operations and the use of foreign currency. These include improved regulation and
supervision of foreign exchange offices, introduction of mandatory point of sales
outlets at larger retail establishments, acceptance of credit cards transaction receipts
for tax verification purposes, and legislation on cash transaction limits and the
electronic payment of salaries.

•

In the insurance sector, we adopted legislation fully compliant with the standards of
the International Association of Insurance Supervisors. We also implemented by-laws
and regulations to improve accounting, auditing, and financial reporting; solvency
and reserves; reinsurance; oversight of insurance companies; and procedures for the
liquidation of insurance companies. An insurance registry at the CBA was established
and is now operational.

•

Progress has been achieved in money and capital market development with the
adoption of a new securities market law corresponding to the standards of the
International Organization of Securities Commissions, the conversion of the
Armenian stock exchange (Armex) from a self-regulatory body into a joint stock
company, and the takeover of Armex and the central depository by Nasdaq-OMX.

10.
The second phase of public sector reform was completed in August 2007. To improve
the efficiency and the accountability of the public sector, we introduced new management
structures; improved procedures of human resource management and development in civil
service; regulated and decentralized service delivery; encouraged public participation in
decision-making; and improved communication with the public. Moreover, we have finalized
a strategy for the third phase of reforms, which will focus on streamlining the civil service.
We have made progress on the development of a new anti-corruption strategy that identifies

42
specific objectives and performance indicators, with an action plan expected to be finalized
in November 2008.
11.
Following the reforms initiated in 2000, our efforts to restructure the energy sector
have continued. Efficiency gains, lower distribution losses, and improved collection have led
to further financial consolidation of privatized companies, contributing to contain tariff
adjustments and reducing the need for government support. At the same time, the reliability
of electricity, gas, water, and irrigation flows has improved. Plans for the replacement of the
nuclear power plant, to be decommissioned in 2016, are under way.
II. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY FOR 2009–11
12.
The new program builds on our past achievements and our strategy to implement the
SDP. Armenia has achieved remarkable results in terms of growth and poverty reduction by
opening up its economy, removing barriers to competition, and following sound
macroeconomic policies. The challenge before us is how to consolidate these gains. While
stability is necessary for growth, it is only by boosting the productive potential of the
economy that we can make growth sustainable. The new program addresses the unfinished
structural reform agenda to fully equip policy frameworks and institutions for the next
challenges facing the Armenian economy.
13.
With the past program, we have achieved important results in many areas, but we are
aware that additional efforts are needed in several other areas. As we prepare for the
transition to full-fledged inflation targeting, the fiscal framework needs to be refined to be
more attuned to the needs of stabilization policy and to facilitate the formulation of
appropriate policy responses to key fiscal risks. Reforms aimed at enhancing productivity
and improving the business climate are necessary to boost the competitiveness of Armenian
companies and encourage the emersion of the underground economic activities. In this
context, reforms in tax policy and administration are particularly important. Despite our past
efforts, the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio in Armenia still remains low, limiting the use of
resources for productivity-enhancing and poverty-reducing expenditures. We will continue
our efforts to deepen financial intermediation, which remains low by international standards.
14.
Continuation of sound macroeconomic policies and effective implementation of
structural reforms would support real growth rates of at least 8 percent on average over the
next three years. The underlying fiscal balance, which better measures the fiscal impact on
domestic demand by excluding grants and external interest payments, is projected to be
below 2 percent of GDP during 2010-11, after an initial improvement in 2009. Hence, fiscal
policy will contribute to achieve sustainable growth while maintaining macroeconomic
stability. Tax collection improvements will be underpinned by tax reforms, and will allow
additional spending for infrastructure, pension reform, and poverty reduction. These policies
are expected to achieve a further reduction in the poverty rate, a key objective of the SDP.
The external current account deficit will decline only gradually to about 8 percent of GDP in

43
2011, reflecting strong demand for imported capital and intermediate goods needed to
support growth. External debt ratios are projected to decline to about 9 percent of GDP.
15.
Macroeconomic stability will remain the main objective of fiscal policy, as it is key to
sustain and broaden economic growth, and further reduce poverty. In light of rising inflation,
the fiscal stance will be tightened to mitigate demand pressures. Furthermore, the Ministry of
Finance (MoF) will strengthen the fiscal framework to enhance fiscal policy credibility by
analyzing and disclosing fiscal risks and associated policy responses, and by improving
economic modeling and projection capacity. We will also enhance our capacity to assess and
implement investment projects; this will allow us to carry out high-return projects with partly
non-concessional financing.
16.
Price stability will remain the main focus of monetary policy. During the program
period, the CBA will complete the transition to full-fledged inflation targeting (IT) in the
context of a flexible exchange rate regime by strengthening the policy transmission
mechanism. Monetary policy implementation will benefit from the expansion of open market
operations in the context of closer coordination with MoF on debt and liquidity management.
Structural measures aimed at developing the interbank and foreign exchange markets will
help improve the effectiveness of monetary policy instruments.
17.
Strengthening tax policy and administration is a top priority over the next three years.
Removing remaining weaknesses in this area is crucial to improve the business environment
and boost competitiveness. The tax policy framework will be streamlined and simplified to
make it easy to comply with and administer. The establishment of a VAT threshold with a
simple regime for small businesses below the threshold is a step in this direction. Tax
administration reform aims at increasing voluntary compliance and establishing a selfassessment system in which the direct interaction between taxpayers and tax officials is
eliminated to reduce corruption risks. Similarly, customs reforms will focus on establishing
risk-based processes to minimize the interaction between customs officials and importers.
18.
Financial sector reforms in the period ahead will focus on further deepening financial
intermediation and broadening the range of financial services available in Armenia, while at
the same time safeguarding financial sector stability. We will also adopt an extensive
package of capital market development measures in collaboration with Nasdaq-OMX.
III. THE NEW PROGRAM FOR 2008-09
A. Fiscal Policy
19.
The fiscal deficit for 2008, defined according to GFSM 2001, is expected to be
limited to 1.4 percent of GDP, significantly lower than the 2.6 percent of GDP targeted in the

44
budget (including the gas subsidy),2 thanks to tax revenue overperformance and slow
expenditure execution. Tax revenues have performed well on account of rapid import growth,
better enforcement at customs, and strong VAT performance. However, the attempt to
achieve ambitious targets led to a significant increase in tax credits. Tax revenues are
expected to reach AMD 603 billion of GDP in 2008. Grants, on the other hand, were lower
than expected, in part due to the delay in the disbursement of $50 million from the
Millennium Challenge Account.
20.
For 2009, a budget deficit of 1 percent of GDP strikes the right balance between the
need to contain demand pressures and that to provide resources for high-priority and povertyreducing projects. Tax revenues would reach AMD 700 billion, reflecting the positive impact
of tax reforms, and the tax revenue ratio would rise from 16.4 percent of GDP projected for
2008 to 16.8 percent of GDP in 2009. Grants and non-tax revenues are projected to increase
by 0.4 percent of GDP. Expenditure is expected to reach AMD 919 billion, or 22.1 percent of
GDP, up from 21.6 percent of GDP in 2008, as a result of increased spending on pensions
and infrastructure. The underlying balance would improve to -1.7 percent of GDP in 2009
from -1.9 percent of GDP in 2008. A potential risk to achieving the deficit target is
represented by the large amount of outstanding tax credits (AMD 121 billion as of August 1,
2008) associated with weak tax-audit capacity. We are committed to analyzing and fixing the
systemic problems underlying these tax credits to ensure that any risks to the target are
mitigated.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
21.
Monetary conditions will continue to be tightened to achieve the CBA inflation
target. Inflationary pressures from high food and energy import prices in a context of strong
domestic demand have caused inflation to exceed the inflation target range of 4 ± 1.5
percent. We will continue with our strategy of gradually increasing the repo rate, and we
stand ready to increase it at a faster pace if inflationary pressures persist. Money supply
growth will be contained for the remainder of the year, supported by lower foreign exchange
market intervention, a lower-than-projected budget deficit, and increased net issuance of
treasury bills. The government intends to increase the stock of treasury bills by AMD 25
billion, in close coordination with the CBA. The monetary program seeks to limit reserve
money growth to around 18.5 percent and envisages a broadly stable level of foreign reserves
relative to 2007. Barring further external shocks, we are confident that these measures will
help bring inflation back to the target range in 2009.
22.
The transition to full-fledged IT will be completed during the program period. The
institutional prerequisites are largely in place. A 2007 review of our strategy and
organizational framework, conducted with the support of IMF technical assistance,
2

See footnote 1.

45
concluded that most of the key elements for successful IT are present in Armenia, including
the independence of the CBA, appropriate internal organization and sufficient capacity of the
CBA, a quarterly inflation projection model as one of the inputs in the monetary policy
decision-making process, and a well-developed communication strategy. Since 2006, the
CBA has issued quarterly inflation reports and published the minutes of its monthly board
meetings on monetary policy. We have also moved from an end-year to a continuous
inflation target.
23.
We are committed to maintaining a flexible exchange rate regime. While increased
intervention has been necessary in the face of large-scale and volatile capital inflows and
heightened uncertainty in the course of 2008, foreign exchange interventions will be used
only as an instrument to smooth out exchange rate volatility without targeting the level of the
exchange rate.
24.
The CBA will sign a memorandum of understanding with the MoF regulating the
issuance of government securities (performance criterion). As soon as an agreement is
reached, the CBA will discontinue issuing its own securities and will instead focus on
conducting repo operations. The treasury will recommence issuing short-term T- bills. Debt
issuance will be closely coordinated between the MoF and CBA to take account of both
budget financing and liquidity management needs, and the MoF will commit to avoid using
cut-off yields at its auctions, except to reject clearly speculative bids that lie outside the
normal range of bidding. Over the medium term, the CBA intends to increase its holdings of
treasury securities in order to strengthen its capacity to conduct reverse repo operations.
25.
At the same time, we recognize that the monetary transmission mechanism is still
weak. We will therefore continue following an IT “lite” regime in the period ahead, while
paying close attention to monetary aggregates. We aim at strengthening the monetary
transmission mechanism by further improving our operational framework and fostering
financial deepening and interbank money market development. To improve the functioning
of the interbank market, the CBA is considering the introduction of an electronic trading
platform. To improve bank liquidity management, we also consider introducing an overnight
credit facility, and lengthening the reference period for reserve requirements from two weeks
to four weeks against the background of high monthly volatility of government spending.
C. Structural Reforms
Fiscal reforms
26.
We are improving our fiscal framework. The State Law on Debt Management, which
introduces a ceiling on the amount of total debt (equal to 60 percent of GDP) and limits on
the size of deficits if debt is above 50 percent of GDP, has been approved. Starting in 2009,
we intend to improve the Medium Term Economic Framework by including a section on debt
management that will help align policy decisions over the medium term (next three years)

46
with their long-term fiscal implications. We plan to complete the specific part of the tax code
by June 2009.
27.
We plan to introduce several changes in tax policy. On VAT, a new streamlined
system for small traders and a registration threshold of AMD 58.35 million will become
effective on January 2009. We are also considering the introduction of an annual business
license for microbusinesses. We have amended the general presumptive tax regime by
moving trade fairs to the general VAT and income tax regimes. We plan to abolish all
presumptive tax regimes, and bring all sectors currently subject to presumptive taxation
within the regular tax regimes (excise tax, customs duties, profit tax, and VAT) during the
program period. In order for us to prepare the necessary changes, we will strengthen our
administrative capacity, especially in the areas of auditing, professional recruitment and
training, and risk analysis. A timetable for the implementation of these changes will be set
during the first program review. We intend to reform the system of VAT refunds following
best international practices. We will clear the backlog of refund claims, introduce riskmanagement approaches and a refund forecasting system, and amend the law to strengthen
penalties for false claims and pay interest on late refunds arising from claims filed after
December 31, 2009 (performance criterion). Importantly, we will process all VAT refund
claims filed after December 31, 2008 within the 90-day statutory period.
28.

We are reorganizing the tax administration:

•

We are adopting a function-based organizational structure and will merge the four
specialist inspectorates by January 1, 2009. Moreover, we plan to close a number of
regional inspectorates that are not cost effective by end-2008 and further consolidate
regional inspectorates by June 2009 (structural benchmark).

•

We are merging the State Customs Service with the State Tax Service to achieve
efficiency gains. These gains will mainly concern administrative support functions
and information systems, while the core functions of customs and tax administration
will not be integrated owing to their different nature. The merger, which has created a
new organization named State Revenue Committee (SRC), is expected to be
completed by January 2009.

29.
We plan to introduce a funded pension pillar on January 1, 2010. We have completed
a White paper including estimates of the costs of this reform and started developing an action
plan for implementation. Drafting of the legislation introducing a unified tax has started
already, and submission to parliament is expected by mid-2009. The SRC, which will assume
the task of collecting contributions, has already started preparations. In the context of the
Medium Term Economic Framework, we intend to produce an analytical report on mediumterm fiscal risks, including those associated with the introduction of the funded pillar, which
would also include the cost of the increase in basic pensions over the next few years
(structural benchmark).

47
Financial sector
30.

We will continue moving forward with banking sector reforms:
•

To complement the recently-adopted legislation on consumer protection, we are
preparing an extensive campaign to educate consumers about financial terms,
products, and services.

•

To increase the availability of credit and foster financial intermediation, we plan to
introduce a consistent credit scoring system; enhance credit analysis; and further
improve consumer rights protection, as stipulated in the recently approved law “On
Circulation of Loan Information and On Activities of Credit Bureaus.”

•

To foster the development of commercial banks’ risk management capacity, the CBA
will develop guidelines and a new system of risk assessment for banks, taking best
international practices as a basis. Moreover, the CBA is considering the introduction
of an assessment of banks’ risk management systems as part of its regular supervisory
activity.

31.

To further develop the securities market:
•

We plan to implement a comprehensive program of securities market development, as
laid out in our capital market development action plan. We have designed a new
public debt management strategy that foresees an increase of domestic debt issuance
over the medium term, bringing the stock of domestic debt to 7 percent of GDP by
2020. Benchmark bonds in 4 maturities will be issued for that purpose. To increase
the stock of government securities available for open market operations, we will
amend Article 11 of the “Law on the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia” by
mid-2009 (structural benchmark, June 2009) to allow a gradual recapitalization of the
CBA with marketable securities.

•

Having established a rating system for enterprises, the CBA will continue to produce
ratings for companies that are potential candidates for initial public offerings at
Nasdaq-OMX. The rating system developed at the CBA will be handed over
eventually to the private sector.

32.

Regarding insurance sector reforms:
•

We plan to finalize the classification of insurance companies’ assets.

•

We will introduce a new minimum capital requirement of AMD 500 million for
newly established insurance companies in January 2009. Over time, we plan to
increase this requirement to AMD 1 billion for non-life insurance companies and
AMD 1.5 billion for life insurance companies.

48
•

We will introduce legislation on the introduction of mandatory third-party liability
auto insurance by January 2010. This will provide a major push for insurance market
development in Armenia and is expected to attract new reputable market entrants.

Other structural reforms
33.
We intend to continue our efforts to improve governance and reduce corruption. We
plan to finalize the new anti-corruption strategy action plan by November 2008, and we are
strongly committed to continue its implementation over the program period. We intend to
implement the third phase of public sector reform, which is expected to improve performance
and ethical standards in the civil service.
34.
We have approved a five year strategy to develop Armenia into a center for
excellence of doing business and investments. The 2008 action plan approved by the
Government and the decision of the Prime Minister to address impediments to the SME
sector are major first steps in this direction. The reforms will accelerate in 2009, targeting
improvements of the Doing Business indicators significantly.
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING
35.
Progress in implementing the program will be monitored through quantitative
performance criteria and indicative targets set forth in Table 1 as well as structural
performance criteria and benchmarks as listed in Table 2. The Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU) attached to this Memorandum defines the quantitative targets of Table
1, and specifies reporting requirements. Semiannual performance criteria will be monitored
under two reviews. The quantitative targets include targets for the underlying fiscal balance
(excluding grants and external interest payments, and including any new subsidies) and limits
on contracting/guaranteeing external debt (see Table 1). Monetary aggregates will continue
to be used as indicative targets during the transition to full-fledged IT. Once the transition has
taken place, a defined set of monetary indicators will be used to assess compliance with the
inflation target.

Introduce best practices in VAT refund processing to exporters by (i) clearing the stock of late refund claims,
while meeting the statutory 90-day processing deadline for all claims filed in 2009; (ii) implementing riskmanagement approaches (i.e. taxpayers with good compliance histories to get fast-track refunds, while risky
cases face pre-refund audits); (iii) implementing a forecasting system to anticipate refund levels so that
funds are available to pay legitimate refund claims as they occur; and (iv) submitting legislation to parliament
to strengthen penalties for false refund claims and pay interest on legitimate refunds not paid on time (interest
will apply only to new claims filed after December 31, 2009). Interest will be paid out of VAT revenues.

ATTACHMENT III. ARMENIA: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

This memorandum defines the benchmarks, performance criteria, indicative targets,
adjustors, and reporting modalities referred to in the Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies (MEFP).
I.

QUANTITATIVE TARGETS

1.
The program targets a minimum level of net official international reserves (NIR) of
the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA). The stock of such reserves will be calculated as the
difference between total official gross international reserves (excluding reserve money
denominated in foreign currencies) and official gross reserve liabilities. Total gross official
international reserves are defined as the CBA’s holdings of monetary gold (excluding
amounts pledged as collateral or in swaps), holdings of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), any
reserve position in the IMF, and holdings of convertible currencies in cash or in nonresident
financial institutions (deposits, securities, or other financial instruments). Gross reserves held
in the form of securities and other financial instruments are marked to market. Gross reserves
are reported separate from the balance on the government’s Special Privatization Account
(SPA) and the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) and exclude capital subscriptions in
foreign financial institutions and illiquid foreign assets. Official reserve liabilities shall be
defined as outstanding liabilities to the IMF, and convertible currency liabilities of the CBA
to nonresidents with an original maturity of up to and including one year. NIR is monitored
in U.S. dollars, and, for program monitoring purposes, assets and liabilities in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar shall be converted into dollar-equivalent values using the exchange
rates as specified in Table 1.
2.
The program targets a maximum level of net domestic assets (NDA) of the CBA.
For program purposes, NDA is defined as reserve money minus NIR, minus reserve money
denominated in foreign currencies, and plus medium- and long-term liabilities (i.e. liabilities
with a maturity of one year or more) of the CBA. To evaluate program targets, the dramequivalent values of NIR, medium- and long-term liabilities, and reserve money in U.S.
dollar are calculated at the program exchange rate of dram 304.22 per U.S. dollar. The dramequivalent value of reserve money in Euro is calculated at the program exchange rate
specified in Table 1. NDA is composed of net CBA credit to the general government;
outstanding credit to domestic banks by the CBA (including overdrafts) minus liabilities not
included in reserve money (exclusive of accrued interest), and other items net.

52
3.
The program’s ceiling on reserve money is an indicative target. Reserve money is
defined as the sum of currency issued, required and excess reserves, and current and time
deposit accounts of certain resident agents.1
4.
The stock of net credit from the CBA to the government includes the CBA’s
holdings of treasury bills and treasury bonds less all types of government deposits with the
CBA (including the deposits in the Treasury Single Account, deposits of donor-financed
project implementation units, the Lincy foundation, and balances of proceeds from the sale of
humanitarian assistance). Treasury bonds are valued at the purchase price and excluding
accrued interest and treasury bills are valued at the purchase price plus the implicit accrued
interest.
5.
Net credit from commercial banks to the government includes: (1) gross
commercial bank credit to the central government less government deposits with commercial
banks (including the counterpart funds of certain government on lending to the economy
financed by the Lincy Foundation and the World Bank); and (2) bank holdings of treasury
bonds (valued at the purchase price and excluding accrued interest) and treasury bills (valued
at the purchase price plus the implicit accrued interest). Net credit of the banking system to
the government is the sum of net credit from the CBA and net credit from commercial banks
to the central government.
6.
External debt ceilings apply to all forms of new nonconcessional medium- and
long-term external debt2 with original maturities of more than one year, which are contracted
or guaranteed by the government or the CBA or any other agency acting on behalf of the
government. It does include debt with maturity of one year or less. Excluded from the limits
are changes in indebtedness resulting from refinancing credits or rescheduling operations,
sales of treasury bills or treasury bonds to nonresidents (provided the sales go through the
regular auction mechanism and involve no exchange rate guarantees), concessional loans,
and credits extended by the IMF.3 Except for normal import-related credits, there is a zero
limit on short-term external debt (obligations with original maturities of up to one year)
contracted or guaranteed by the government or the CBA or any other agency acting on behalf
of the government. Transactions subject to debt ceilings shall be valued in the contracted
1

Liquidity absorbing transactions under reverse repurchase agreements, the CBA’s deposit facility, foreign
currency swaps, and securities issued by the CBA are netted out from claims on banks, i.e., they are excluded
from the reserve money definition.

2

The term “debt” shall have the meaning set forth in Section 9(a) of the Guidelines on performance criteria on
external debt, as modified by the Executive Board Decision No. 12274-(00/85) of August 24, 2000.

3

For program purposes, a loan is considered concessional if the grant element is at least 35 percent calculated
using a discount factor based on the Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs) published by the OECD
plus margins depending on the loan maturity. The margins are: 0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than
15 years, 1 percent for 15–19 years, 1.15 percent for 20–29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more. The
average of the CIRRs over the last ten years will be used for loans with a maturity of at least 15 years and the
average of the CIRRs for the preceding six months will be used for shorter maturities.

53
currencies and converted into U.S. dollars at the average monthly market exchange rate in the
month when the commitment was contracted.
7.
External arrears will consist of all overdue debt-service obligations (i.e., payments
of principal and interest) arising in respect of public sector loans contracted or guaranteed
including unpaid penalties or interest charges associated with these arrears.4
8.
The underlying balance of the central government on a cash basis is defined as
the negative of the sum of domestic banking system net financing, domestic nonbank net
financing, external net financing to the government; plus external interest payments, less
grants to the central government. Should a general subsidy be introduced off-budget, the
underlying balance will be measured including the subsidy as part of government spending.
Net banking system credit to the government equals the change during the period of net
credit to the government. Nonbank net financing equals the sum of: (1) the change during
the period of outstanding treasury bills and bonds to nonbanks (including accrued interest for
treasury bills and excluding accrued interest for treasury bonds);5 (2) any other disbursement
or transaction that increases nonbanks’ claims on the central government plus withdrawals
from the special privatization account or the treasury sub-account containing privatization
proceeds in dram, less amortizations made by the central government to private resident
nonbank agents; and less domestic net lending following the GFSM2001. External net
financing equals total debt-increasing disbursements from non-residents to the central
government less total amortizations from the central government to non-residents, and less
external net lending following the GFSM2001. Grants equal total non-debt increasing
disbursements from non-residents to the central government. External interest payments
equal interest paid from the central government to non-residents. All foreign-currency
denominated transactions are recorded in drams using the prevailing exchange rate at the
time of the transaction.
9.
The project implementation units, which carry out projects financed by the US-based
Lincy Foundation, maintain accounts at the CBA. These grants are recorded in the fiscal
accounts as external grants on the revenue side and as foreign-financed capital expenditure
on the expenditure side. In addition, any loans extended by the US-based Lincy foundation to
finance investments and that are intermediated through the banking system are recorded in
the financial accounts as a financing item below the line and are thus excluded from net
lending.
10.
Foreign currency proceeds from selling enterprises are deposited into the Special
Privatization Account (SPA). The account is held at the CBA and the proceeds are invested
abroad together with the CBA’s international reserves. These proceeds are included in the
definition of the monetary accounts of the CBA as part of net foreign assets with a counter
4

The public sector is defined following the Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFS 2001) and System of
National Accounts (1993 SNA). It includes the general government and nonfinancial public enterprises.
5

Domestic nonbank holdings of treasury bills and treasury bonds are defined as total outstanding treasury bills
and bonds less holdings by the banking system and the SFSI.

54
entry in other items net. Any budgeted withdrawal from the SPA will be accounted for as
privatization proceeds used to finance the budget and will be recorded below the line. Any
unanticipated withdrawal from the SPA will be recorded below the line as privatization
receipts; these withdrawals, however, will be replenished during the same fiscal year.
Domestic currency proceeds from selling enterprises to residents are deposited in a subaccount of the treasury single account.
11.
The program targets ceilings for the stock of domestic arrears of the central
government. Domestic arrears are defined as follows. With respect to wages, social
contributions (including for pensions), family allowances, and amortization and domestic
interest payments, the stock of arrears is defined as all unpaid claims outstanding at the end
of the month. This excludes technical arrears of up to AMD 0.5 billion that could arise
because of minor delays in the execution of these expenditures. For all other expenditure
categories, arrears are defined as the stock of unpaid claims, as verified by the recipient of
the goods and services, which has been outstanding for more than 30 days as of the end of
the month. However, at year-end all outstanding claims must be settled as required in the
budget law.
II. ADJUSTERS
12.
The quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks under the program are subject
to the following adjusters:
• World Bank budget support: the following targets will be adjusted by the full amount of
lower than programmed World Bank direct budget support: NIR (downward), NDA of the
CBA (upward), and net credit to the government (upward). The programmed amount is
shown in Table 2 below.
• KfW loan disbursements: the target on the NDA of the CBA will be adjusted upward by
the full amount of any non-programmed disbursement from KfW. The adjustment will be
made at program exchange rates. The programmed amount is shown in Table 3 below.
• Recapitalization of the CBA: the target on the net credit of the banking system to the
government will be adjusted upward by the full amount of the recapitalization of the CBA.
III. STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND BENCHMARKS
13.
Strengthen domestic debt market by signing an agreement between the Ministry of
Finance (MoF) and Central Bank (CBA) on the coordination of government securities
auctions, including (i) the discontinuation of CBA security issuance; (ii) a commitment to
avoid using cut-off yields at its auctions, except to reject clearly speculative bids that lie
outside the normal range of bidding (performance criterion, December 2008). The agreement
will specify the criterion to identify outlier bids (based on a deviation from the average yield
either in terms of a multiple of standard deviations or in absolute basis points). See paragraph
24 of the MEFP.

55
14.
Restructure the tax administration organization by (i) implementing a modern
function-based structure; (ii) merging the four specialist inspectorates into a single large
taxpayer inspectorate (LTI); and (iii) closing at least 10 tax inspectorates that are not costeffective by end-2008 (structural benchmark, December 2008). Further reduce the number of
tax inspectorates by at least 20 by June 2009 (structural benchmark, June 2009). See
paragraph 28 of the MEFP.
15.
Improve the recapitalization mechanism for the central bank by amending Article 11
of the “Law on the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia” by mid-2009 (structural
benchmark, June 2009) to allow a gradual recapitalization of the CBA with marketable
securities. See paragraph 31 of the MEFP.
16.
Introduce best practices in VAT refund processing to exporters by (i) clearing the
stock of late refund claims, while meeting the statutory 90-day processing deadline for all
claims filed in 2009; (ii) implementing risk-management approaches;6 (iii) implementing a
forecasting system to anticipate refund levels so that funds are available to pay legitimate
refund claims as they occur; and (iv) submitting legislation to parliament to strengthen
penalties for false refund claims and pay interest on legitimate refunds not paid on time
(interest will apply only to new claims filed after December 31, 2009) (performance
criterion, December 2009). See paragraph 27 of the MEFP.
17.
Strengthen the fiscal framework by producing a yearly analytical report identifying
fiscal challenges and risks over the short- and medium-term, and potential fiscal policy
responses to them (structural benchmark, December 2009). See paragraph 29 of the MEFP.

6

The implementation by the tax administration of a risk-management approach to administering VAT refunds
will be evidenced by: (i) a documented risk-based audit strategy, plan, and methodology; (ii) regular risk
assessments and maintenance of risk profiles for all exporters making VAT refund claims, using information in
tax and customs databases and from third parties; (iii) payment of refunds within 14 days to exporters assessed
as low-risk (i.e. those with sound compliance histories in relation to VAT and other taxes), supported by
selective post-refund audits; and (iv) pre-refund audits within the statutory 90-day processing period to verify
claims of exporters categorized as high-risk (i.e. those with a poor compliance history).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association

October 31, 2008

The IMF-World Bank staffs’ debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that Armenia is at a
low risk of debt distress, with all external debt indicators well below the relevant countryspecific debt-burden thresholds. An alternative scenario explores the impact of a new
nuclear power plant. The analysis highlights the importance of continued sound
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms for safeguarding the favorable debt outlook.
1.
The DSA was prepared by Fund and World Bank staffs, using the joint Bank-Fund
Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Framework.1 The macroeconomic assumptions
underlying the baseline scenario are consistent with the framework presented in the staff
report for the 2008 Article IV consultation and request for a low-access PRGF. The external
debt data used for this exercise are broadly consistent with the authorities’ medium term
borrowing plans.
I. STRUCTURE OF DEBT
2.
Armenia’s external debt stock as of end-2007 is estimated at $1,846 million
(20 percent of GDP), mostly representing public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt owed to
multilateral international organizations (Figure 1).2 The outstanding debts of the government
to the World Bank and to the Fund account for 58 percent and 10 percent of total external
debt stock, respectively. Armenia’s private sector external debt outstanding accounts for
about 14 percent of total external debt.

1

The most recent assessment of Armenia’s debt sustainability was conducted in November 2007 in the context
of the Fifth Review of the PRGF (Country Report No. 07/377).

2

The DSA covers the central government only, since other public sector debt is believed to be negligible.

3.
The total debt outlook continued to improve in 2007. Prudent debt management,
combined with favorable exchange rate dynamics and robust economic growth, contributed
to a decline in the external debt ratio from 25 percent of GDP in 2005 to 20 percent of GDP
in 2007.
4.
The share of domestic debt in the stock of public and publicly guaranteed debt is
rather small, reflecting the limited development of the domestic debt markets. In 2007, the
PPG debt owed to domestic creditors accounted for only 2.1 percent of GDP, virtually
unchanged from the previous year.
II. THE BASELINE SCENARIO
5.
The baseline scenario shows a sustainable fiscal position (Tables 1 and 2). The net
present value of public sector debt would gradually increase over the projection period from
about 10 percent of GDP in 2008 up to 20 percent of GDP in 2028, reflecting the increasing
issuance of domestic debt securities on the one hand, but a declining share of public external
debt on the other hand. The net present value of debt-to-revenue ratio would increase from
47 percent in 2008 to 67 percent in 2028, while the debt service–to-revenue ratio would edge
up somewhat but not exceed 6 percent in any given year over the projection period.
Throughout the projection period, these indicators for public debt would remain at
comfortable levels and below the indicative thresholds for external debt.3
6.
The external debt outlook remains benign, notwithstanding a notable moderation in
external concessional financing (Table 3a, Figure 2). The net present value of external debt is
expected to fall from 7 percent of GDP in 2007 to 5 percent of GDP in 2028, reflecting a
3

External debt indicator thresholds for Armenia are as follows: present value of debt to export ratio
(200 percent), present value of debt to GDP ratio (50 percent), present value of debt to revenue ratio
(300 percent), debt service to export ratio (25 percent) and debt service to revenue ratio (35 percent).

3
Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions for the DSA Baseline Scenario, 2008–28
Annual real GDP growth is projected to average around 7 percent over the medium term, gradually
declining to its long-run rate of 4 percent. The near-term growth is supported by the robust activity in
construction and services, on the back of continued private transfers and FDI inflows.
Consistent with the CBA’s target, the average inflation rate is assumed to be around 4 percent in the
long-run. The near-term inflation is projected to be somewhat higher, largely on account of higher food
and energy prices.
The external current account deficit is projected to average around 7 percent of GDP over the DSA
projection period. Somewhat higher deficits are envisaged in the near-term, against the background of
strong import growth. Exports are projected to grow robustly over the medium term, as new investments
in base metal, minerals, and food processing sectors become operational. Private transfers will grow
strongly in the near-term, financing a significant share of the trade deficit, but will gradually moderate
thereafter.
In 2008–12, net FDI is expected to average about 7.0 percent of GDP, gradually moderating from the
high levels explained by the privatization in base metal and mineral sectors. In the near term, FDI is
expected to be concentrated mostly in these two traditional sectors, but also in food processing,
telecommunication, banking and energy sectors. Improvements in business climate, however, should
yield a more diversified FDI structure, with new investment going into new industries (e.g., tourism and
IT sector). The long-run net FDI is projected to average around 5 percent of GDP.
Central government revenues (excluding grants) are projected to gradually increase from 19.6 percent of
GDP in 2008 to 22.3 percent of GDP in 2013, and will continue to improve over the long-run, in line
with government revenue targets.
The overall fiscal deficit is projected to decrease from 1.4 percent of GDP in 2008 to 1.0 percent of GDP
in 2009, in line with understandings reached under the new PRGF program, and in the long term, remain
at around 1 percent of GDP. Consistent with the staff recommendations, the gas subsidy expired on May
1st 2008 and the baseline assumes that no new subsidy will be introduced. It is also assumed that the
import prices for gas will increase in 2009 from their current level of $110 to $154 per 1,000m3.
The level of concessionality of new external borrowing is envisaged to decline in the future, as
Armenia’s income increases. The projected disbursements from the World Bank—Armenia’s largest
creditor, accounting for about 60 percent of country’s total external debt stock as of end-2007—assume
that starting from 2009 Armenia will begin receiving IBRD loans in addition to IDA credits, gradually
shifting to exclusively IBRD borrowing by 2017. Starting 2009, IDA repayment terms are hardened,
with the maturity period of 20 years. This reflects the fact that Armenia’s per capita income exceeded the
IDA eligibility threshold for two consequent years. Unidentified residual lending for 2009 and beyond is
assumed to be on IBRD terms.
Consistent with the authorities’ intention, deficit financing is assumed to be increasingly financed by
domestic, rather than external, borrowing such that the stock of domestic debt would increase from
2.1 percent of GDP in 2007 to 10.1 percent of GDP in 2021, and to 14.9 percent by 2028. Residual
borrowing from domestic sources reduces risks associated with currency mismatch of debt portfolio and
contributes to deepening of domestic financial markets.
The private sector external debt stock in 2007 is estimated as the difference between Armenia’s longterm total external debt and government’s external debt. The new external borrowing by the private
sector is assumed to match the balance of payments’ conservative assumption on commercial banks’
inflows of about 1 percent of GDP per annum. As the terms of Armenia’s private sector borrowing are
unknown, they are assumed to be similar to those in other comparable countries. Specifically, the
maturity period is assumed to be 6 years (with a 1 year grace period) and the interest rate is set at 8
percent—a compromise between the interest rate on U.S. dollar-denominated sovereign bonds of similar
maturity in Russia and Ukraine (about 6.5 percent), and the ongoing lending rate in U.S. dollars charged
by Armenian banks on long-term loans (about 15–17 percent). To the extent that most of this lending is
likely to be from foreign banks to their Armenian subsidiaries, this relatively low interest rate
assumption is justified.

4
gradual increase in the share of the fiscal deficit financed by domestic sources and
increasingly greater importance of external borrowing by the private sector. While Armenia’s
reliance on external financing gradually diminishes, the borrowing terms are projected to
harden, leaving the external debt service in percent of exports broadly stable at about
3 percent over the long-term. The net present value of public external debt in percent of
exports should fall from 46 percent in 2008 to 22 percent in 2028.
III. STRESS TESTING AND ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO
7.
The standard menu of alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that Armenia’s
public debt outlook would be most adversely affected by a lasting shock to economic growth
(Figure 2).4 Under the extreme adverse growth scenario the stress tests indicate that public
debt ratios would follow a persistent upward trend through the projection horizon. Under
permanently lower real GDP growth, the net present value of public debt-to-GDP would
exceed 50 percent from 2025 onward, even though other debt indicators would remain at
comfortable levels. Debt indicators are less prone to unfavorable debt dynamics under other
stress tests. This result reinforces the importance of maintaining prudent financial policies
and preserving macroeconomic stability in order to safeguard the debt outlook.
8.
Armenia’s external debt outlook is robust to a variety of shocks (Table 3b). Under all
standard alternative scenarios and bound tests, the external debt ratios remain well below the
relevant thresholds.
9.
In addition to the standard stress test, an alternative baseline scenario, which included
higher external debt financing for the planned construction of a power plant was also
considered. The power plant is estimated to cost about $6 billion to be constructed during the
period 2011–2017. This excludes the decommissioning of the existing nuclear power plant at
an estimated cost of $1 billion. While the financing arrangements of this project are yet to be
finalized, it is assumed as a worse case scenario that about $6 billion of the total cost will be
financed by the government through the acquisition of non-concessional loans on
commercial terms.5 The funds are assumed to be evenly disbursed over six years.
10.
The assumed increases in external borrowing associated with the power plant would
result in a sharp but temporary worsening of debt indicators. The main debt indicators would
more than double from 2011–2018, but revert to pre-power plant borrowing trend by the end
of the projection period.

4

The framework for low-income country DSA incorporates alternative scenarios and bound tests aimed at
identifying the sensitivities of the baseline projection to a range of potential shocks.

5

Assumed terms for power plant financing are as follows: interest rate of 8 percent, one year grace period, and
six years to maturity.

5
11.
The external debt service to export ratio would breach the policy dependent threshold
(25 percent) by 2013, but would quickly return to more sustainable levels and decline to less
than 5 percent by 2028. The present value of debt to export ratio would jump from 39 percent
in 2010 to 127 percent by 2014 but decline to 20 percent by the end of the projection period.
The present value of the public sector debt to GDP ratio would increase from 9 percent of
GDP and peak at 45 percent in 2016, while the debt to revenue ratio would move from
42 percent to a peak of 188 percent in 2016.
12.
The results from this DSA suggest that Armenia’s debt outlook is relatively stable.
However, the debt outlook would deteriorate if a significant proportion of nonconcessional
resources are required to finance projects such as the power plant. Given increasing external
vulnerabilities and the sensitivity of the debt outlook to long-term growth assumptions, it is
important that the authorities continue to follow a prudent borrowing strategy over the
medium term.

3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and nondebt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

When a member has overdue financial obligations outstanding for more than three months, the
amount of such arrears will be shown in this section.
VII. Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s Safeguards Assessments policy, an update safeguards assessment of the
Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) is currently underway with respect to the prospective
arrangement. An earlier update assessment completed on November 7, 2005 found that the
CBA's safeguards framework has been strengthened since the initial assessment completed in
2002.
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement
(a)

The exchange rate system can be classified as a managed float without a predetermined
path. During 2005–07, the CBA intervened heavily in the foreign exchange market to
smooth out volatility in the exchange rate. The official exchange rate is quoted daily as a
weighted average of the previous day’s interbank exchange rates.

(b)

Armenia maintains no exchange restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions except for exchange restrictions maintained for security
reasons, and notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).

ANNEX II. ARMENIA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(August 1, 2008)
Country Director: Donna Dowsett-Coirolo

Telephone: (202) 473-0121

I. IMPLEMENTATION OF STRUCTURAL REFORM MEASURES
A. Legal Framework
1.
The World Bank has supported the Armenian government to establish the core legal
framework necessary for private sector operations, including the Civil Procedure Code, the
Procurement law, the Business Registration law and the Public Auction law. The fully
restructured and enacted Bankruptcy law is now harmonized with the Civil Code and the
Civil Procedure Code, and strengthens the enforcement mechanisms for bankruptcy
procedures. The Concession law has been enacted and the National Assembly has adopted a
new Labor Code, which is compatible with the requirements of a market economy and is an
important instrument of flexible job-creation. The government also has made significant
progress in drafting the necessary legislation to improve the lending environment through
strengthening the procedures for collateral registration and for foreclosure and enhancing the
knowledge of the judiciary concerning commercial contracts. Specifically, the government
has adopted amendments to civil code, criminal code, civil procedure law, law on
compulsory enforcement, and public auction law. With support and advice through the
Judicial Reform Project (JRP) supported by the World Bank, the Judicial Leadership and the
Government were able to formulate the long term development course for the judicial system
reflected in particular in Judicial Code and consequent establishment of the Judicial
Department responsible for judicial administration and career public service in judicial
system (excluding judges). JRP made all the normative legal acts available electronically
through ARLIS legal database with free on-line access and CD/DVD versions are also
available. The number of visitors to the website of ARLIS has grown dramatically after
launching the database in end 2005. Special automated case management information
systems were developed and piloted for courts (CAST) and Enforcement Service for Judicial
Acts (AESMS). CAST has been already rolled-out across the entire judicial system. The
World Bank has also supported the rehabilitation of 13 courthouses housing 15 courts and the
installation of digital case recording audio systems.
B. Business Environment
2.
The World Bank has supported the government to make satisfactory progress in
removing administrative barriers for business and investment and has strengthened the
consultative mechanisms with the business community. The steps taken include, inter alia,
consolidating, downsizing, and clarifying mandates of various government inspections;
enacting the new law on business registration; streamlining licensing procedures; issuing new

8
accounting recommendations for small and medium-sized enterprises; establishing a
regulatory framework that allows privatization of urban land by business entities; and
adopting simplified procedures for obtaining site development and construction permits. The
capacity of the Armenian Development Agency as a focal point for government’s efforts to
promote investment and exports as well as for identifying the remaining bottlenecks in the
business environment has been strengthened. The functioning of the Business Council has
been improved and the private sector’s awareness of its activities has been enhanced.
3.
The recent business surveys of Armenian entrepreneurs suggest that these efforts
have already resulted in a more positive private sector perception of the business and
investment environment. For example, the average time necessary to get construction and
building renovation permits was reduced from 310 days in 2001 to 112 days in 2006. FDI
increased by almost 3-fold in 2007 compared with 2005. As part of the PRSC supported
programs, Customs introduced a self declaration system and reduced the role of reference
prices. It has also provided public access to customs values through the official customs
website (www.customs.am).
4.
On tax administration, the government strengthened the operation of Large Tax
Payers Unit (LTPU), which should help to reduce the stock of VAT refunds owed to
exporters and ensure that no additional VAT arrears will be incurred to exporters.
5.
The government adopted decision announcing its intention to widen participation in
the provision of international civil aviation services, raise efficiency and cut costs and
initiated policy work. Despite these improvements, there is still considerable scope for
further reforms in the areas of competition, deregulation and strengthening of business and
investment climate, especially in commercial debt recovery procedures, improvements in the
transparency and efficiency of the judicial system, tax and customs administrations,
improvements in governance and implementing the anti-corruption strategy.
6.
In addition to the above-stated, further strengthening of both tax and customs
administration were at the core of the PRSC IV, A series of measures have been adopted by
STS aimed at promoting the development of the self-assessment system. A separate division
for taxpayer service has been established within the STS headquarters designated for (i)
defining the policies and procedures of taxpayer education and assistance for tax
inspectorates, (ii) overseeing the performance of taxpayer service divisions of tax
inspectorates, and (iii) managing the taxpayer education and assistance operations throughout
the STS. The capability of this unit was built up. Under PRSC-IV, the near term agenda for
reforms was fleshed out. A work plan for improving the enforcement of the Law on
Declaring Individuals’ Property and Income was developed. Recording commissions were
abolished as of July 1st 2008.

9
7.
The administrative and audit capacity of the LTPU was strengthened under the
PRSC-supported program. Reforms focused on legislative initiatives to facilitate effective tax
audits and on development of personnel, institutional and administrative infrastructures in
support of LTU. An annual audit plan based on risk classification, priorities and targets was
introduced. Other measures, such as periodic publication of the list of 300 large taxpayers
and changes in the management practices greatly helped to increase the productivity of this
unit. PRSC supported reform agenda the Government of Armenia introduced changes to the
structure of the STS by which, the large taxpayers, banking and financial, excise, and mining
inspectorates were merged into one inspectorate - the Large Taxpayers Inspectorate.
8.
Over the PRSC program, significant structural improvements were achieved in
customs administration, such as the introduction of modern software and improved personnel
practices. The central reform was the institution of direct trader input (DTI) that currently
covers about 70 percent of imports. DTI has initiated a systemic change away from the
intimate involvement of customs officials at the declaration validation stage, where
opportunities for discretionary behavior are rife. The system has the capability to provide for
immediate validation and assessment of acceptable declarations. Under PRSC-IV, the
working of DTI was made increasingly effective through the implementation of a
comprehensive post-release review program for imports. The post-release reviews are being
increasingly effective in ensuring proper customs administration whilst minimizing the
opportunities for poor governance.
9.
PRSC-IV also supported the detailed preparatory technical work for the introduction
of a bank guarantee mechanism for approved importers to facilitate the smooth flow of
imports, strengthen the rules-based regime, reduce risks, and minimize the interface between
importers and customs officials as is the case in all advanced countries. Legislative
amendments for the implementation of guarantees were approved by the government at endSeptember 2007. Progress has also been made in selectivity of customs control. A risk-based
system was introduced under the PRSC program. Reforms in this area under the PRSC
program have led to greater automaticity and predictability in clearance of goods, reduced
discretion and lowered business costs. The reform program has introduced transparent and
swift procedures destined to facilitate trade while safeguarding revenue collection in line
with established international good practice.
C. Energy and Infrastructure
10.
Since its privatization in the second half of 2002, the Electricity Distribution
Company has remained in compliance with its licenses agreement as confirmed by making
full payments to the generation and service providers, reporting to the regulator on a timely
basis, and submitting investment plan to the regulator. Supported by the World Bank, the
government and the regulator have also made satisfactory efforts to improve the legal and
regulatory framework in the energy sector in order to establish a supportive environment for

10
the new private operator. The market rules in the energy sector have improved. The
Electricity Distribution Company is allowed to enter into direct contracts with the electricity
generators and service providers, which has enhanced sector transparency. The regulator has
adopted and enforced service quality standards for electricity supply. Despite this satisfactory
performance, continued efforts are crucial for improvements in the energy sector through
restructuring the midstream companies and strengthening the regulatory framework to ensure
adequate functioning, transparency, and reliability of this sector.
11.
There has been progress in improving fiscal discipline and reducing losses in the
irrigation and water sectors. The World Bank has been working with the government to:
(i) upgrade the management capacity of public companies in these sectors; (ii) ensure a
gradual increase in tariffs to cost recovery; (iii) provide additional investments to improve
technical efficiency; and (iv) ensure that the budget provides adequate financing for water
consumed by public sector entities. The World Bank has supported an innovative publicprivate partnership in water supply, which has substantially increased reliable water supply
throughout the country (70% of Yerevan now has 24 hour service). The government has
adopted a schedule for irrigation tariff increases in order to move closer to full cost recovery
in the irrigation system. As part of the PRSC III reforms, the Government has also developed
and now considering a step-by-step civil aviation liberalization action plan. Railway
restructuring plan and development of telecommunication regulations are also underway.
D. Education and Health
12.
The World Bank has supported reforms in education and health. The government
implemented a major rationalization program during the 2003 school year. As a result,
37 schools were merged or closed and about 9,000 teachers were made redundant. Later in
2006, during the second phase of the reforms, in the scope of the staff optimization and social
assistance program approximately 3,200 new redundant teachers have been registered and
were provided with different type of social assistance. The medium-term action plan for
improving the financial management, accounting, and financial reporting for higher
education institutions was adopted by the government on January 26, 2003. Accountants at
the higher institutions have been trained and special software has been prepared for use.
Since the second quarter of 2003, the new accounting procedures are being used. The
government increased the state budget allocation for primary and secondary education and
improved teachers’ salaries. The government also developed an action plan and cleared
arrears in the education sector and prevented further arrears in this sector. The ratio of pupils
to full-time equivalent teachers increased to over 14 and teacher salaries increased by
65 percent in 2005, by 16.1 percent in 2006, and by 27.0 percent in 2007. In addition, the
government approved a strategy on preschool education and a pilot project for its
implementation in two marzes. The government has also made initiatives to carry out the
three year implementation plan for higher education reforms. Despite these improvements,
there is scope for further reforms in education, including adoption of new curricula for upper

11
secondary education in the framework of the transition to 12-year general secondary
education, strengthening the strategy for teacher education and ongoing professional
development, enhancing capacities of IST use and its integration in teaching and learning,
introduction of new mechanisms of higher education financing and establishment of a
national quality assurance framework, enhancement of standards for higher education to
make it more responsive to employers’ needs, setting a student loan system, promoting
school readiness and equal opportunities through improved preschool education system and
increasing enrollment rate, and strengthening monitoring and financial reporting of the
noncommercial organizations (NCOs) in the education sector.
13.
The government adopted the hospital master plan for Yerevan in late 2002. As a
result, the remaining public hospitals in Yerevan were to be merged into smaller number of
hospital networks with necessary steps to be taken to restructure them. The government
adopted a decree on November 21, 2003, identifying the configuration of ten hospital
networks through consolidation of twenty-four public hospitals and thirteen outpatient health
care institutions. Significant investment has been done through the WB financed project to
upgrade physical condition, equipment and improve internal management and governance of
three hospital mergers in Yerevan , which demonstrated the biggest efficiency gains. While
the hospital merger process in capital city has been implemented with notable progress in
productivity and efficiency indicators in selected hospital networks, introduction of further
appropriate adjustments is required. In addition, in 2006 the Government adopted a regional
hospital optimization/modernization plan, aimed at improving efficiency and productivity of
outpatient services in regions. The consolidation of regional hospitals in smaller networks is
in the process. The medium-term action plan for improving financial management accounting
and reporting for the public hospitals was adopted by the government to prepare new
reporting and accounting procedures and cost accounting manuals. The Government plans to
conduct independent financial audit of all public hospitals for the next three years.
14.
Implementation progress has been satisfactory and about 200 hospital accountants
have been trained in new accounting procedures. All public hospitals use updated financial
management and accounting procedures. The government cleared all accumulated arrears in
the health sector. Furthermore, the level of public financing in health sector has been
continuously increasing as projected under the MTEF The government also adopted a
decision to introduce further reforms in the Basic Benefit Package in the health sector. The
Government strategy for increasing revenues in the short term is to not expand the benefits
package but to raise the reimbursement rates to reduce the gap with the cost of services. The
government undertook measures for increasing financing of the Primary Health Care in order
to secure access to quality basic health services, in particular for the poor and in rural areas.
Further reforms are needed in increasing the population overall health status, reducing child
and maternal mortality, increasing use of healthcare system by rural and low-income groups,
monitoring public health and promoting better health behavior, and strengthening monitoring
and financial reporting of the noncommercial organizations (NCOs) in the health sector. The

12
government developed the national strategy on combating non-communicable diseases and
plans to take necessary steps to address the public health threats from non-communicable
diseases through development and implementation of specific priority programs on
non-communicable diseases and through allocation of adequate public resources in the health
care budget.
E. Social Protection and Insurance
15.
Since 1999, the government has been replacing a range of fragmented cash and noncash benefits and privileges with better-targeted transfers to families. The government has
been supported by the World Bank to complete several important steps to enhance its
capacity for administration of transfers to families, including: (i) re-registration of poverty
benefit recipients; (ii) beneficiary assessment of the existing benefits; and (iii) establishment
of a central database for poverty benefit recipients. Data from the recent household survey
suggest that the system of benefits and transfers to the poor has become an efficient
instrument for reducing extreme poverty. The government introduced differentiation of
benefits within the family poverty benefits. Continued efforts are needed to ensure the
adequacy of the level and administrative capacity of the social protection systems to
guarantee coverage of transfers to people with special needs.
16.
The Government of Armenia is in the process of designing a new pension system. In
August 2007 the Government prepared a new Draft Framework Law on Pension Reform in
Armenia which defines benefits and beneficiaries of pillars zero and pillar one and the
accumulation phase of the mandatory accumulation system. The draft pension reform
concept would also involve the mandatory introduction of a second pillar for those above
30 years of age financed by an add-on contribution rate, a flat-benefit budget-financed first
pillar and a universal zero-pillar for those that did not contribute to the system. Prior to the
Law enactment, the fiscal and social impact of the selected design of the pension system is
being assessed and compared to alternative solutions. A Pension Task Force has been
established in the Government to analyze these issues.
II. LENDING
17.
World Bank lending to Armenia as of August 1, 2008 totals US$ 1,056.1 million,
(including 2 GEF operations) of which US$953.3 million has been disbursed. The current
Bank portfolio consists of 17 IDA credits and 2 GEF projects, for a total commitment of
$291.7 million, of which $187.5 million is disbursed. Armenia portfolio continues to be low
risk with the projects rated as satisfactory or moderately satisfactory. In FY08, one
investment operation—Irrigation Development: Additional—was approved in July 2007 for
$5 million and one development policy operation—PRSC-IV for $18.5 million – was
approved in November 2007.

13
18.
Building on the major Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper’s (PRSP) themes, the
fourth Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Armenia was discussed in the World Bank
Board of Executive Directors on June 10, 2004 and focuses on three main objectives of:
(i) promoting private sector led economic growth; (ii) making growth more pro-poor; and
(iii) reducing non-income poverty. CAS PR (Progress Report) was considered by the Board
on March 8, 2007 and reconfirmed this focus. IDA country resource envelopes are
determined annually based on the Country Policy and Institutional Assessments and
performance of the ongoing portfolio. Armenia has a very strong IDA performance rating
and as a consequence is eligible for about $56 million in FY09. In addition, based on a 2006
review of Armenia’s creditworthiness, Armenia is now eligible to receive IBRD lending,
although it has not done so yet.
19.
The CAS included four Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) for FY05, 06,
07, and 08 which focused on four main components: (i) supporting private sector
development and governance; (ii) advancing public infrastructure reforms; (iii) improving
core public sector functions; and (iv) enhancing human development and improving social
safety nets. All four have been extended and disbursed. The PRSCs’ preparation was closely
coordinated with the IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). A new economic
reform dialogue has been initiated starting in FY09.
20.
A new World Bank CPS will be prepared during FY09, which will lay out expected
lending and analytic work for the next four years. This will be based on Armenia’s
development priorities to be contained in the recent update of their Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP), renamed Sustainable Development Program (SDP).

ANNEX III. ARMENIA: RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (EBRD)
(As of May 7, 2008)
1.
As of December 31, 2007, the EBRD approved 50 projects in the power, transport,
agribusiness, textile, mining, construction and financial sectors. Total commitments amounted
to EUR 207 million.
2.
There are three sovereign projects. First, the EBRD approved a sovereign guaranteed
loan of EUR 54.8 million for construction of the Hrazdan Unit 5 thermal power plant in
March 1993, partly aimed at the eventual closure of Armenia’s nuclear plant in Medzamor.
The government is contemplating the privatization of Hrazdan Unit 5 as the completion of this
plant is constrained by limited budgetary resources. The EBRD had funded technical
assistance for the Hrazdan privatization prospectus and continues to follow the privatization
process. The Hrazdan Thermal Power Complex excluding the unfinished Unit 5 was
transferred to the Russian Federation in the context of the debt-for-equity deal. Second, in
November 1994, the agreement on a EUR 21.8 million loan to build an air cargo terminal in
Zvartnots airport was signed under a guarantee by the Armenian government. The airport was
transferred to private management in 2002. The new management has prepared a master plan
for the development of the airport, which is expected to generate further cargo traffic for the
cargo terminal. Third, the EBRD approved a 7 million EUR loan to the State Committee for
Water Systems, owner of the water and wastewater assets located in the small municipalities
outside of Yerevan, in April 2007. The proceeds of this loan will be used to improve
wastewater treatment in five municipalities located near Lake Sevan.
3.
Most of the Bank’s projects in Armenia are in the private sector. The EBRD has
provided a loan to the Yerevan Brandy Company owned by Pernod Ricard of France
(EUR 16.5 million). In the banking sector, a first equity participation in the Commercial Bank
of Greece-Armenia (EUR 1.1 million) was approved in late 1999 and a second equity
participation in Armeconombank was approved in 2004. The Bank also acquired an equity
stake in an Armenian non-bank financial intermediary, CIRCO, an insurance subsidiary of
Cascade Capital. Moreover, a multi-bank on-lending facility of EUR 10 million was activated
in early 2000. Within the framework of multi-bank facility the Bank currently has credit lines
for micro and small enterprises with three local banks (a total of EUR 8.0 million). The EBRD
is committed to further expanding lending under this facility to other banks. A Trade
Facilitation Program with the purpose to facilitate access of Armenian banks to trade financing
was also made available to four Armenian banks. In 2002, a loan to finance EUR 2.9 million
in working capital expansion was signed with the Armenian Copper Program (the only copper
smelter in the region), and a new loan (EUR 4.3 million), including the refinancing of the
existing loan, was signed in August 2004. Moreover, the EBRD has launched the Turn Around
Management (TAM) and Business Advisory Service programs in Armenia in 2003, originally
funded by the EU-Tacis program but now funded from the ETC Fund, to support micro, small,
and medium-sized enterprises. There were seven new projects completed during 2004 for a
total amount of EUR 6.7 million. Two of them are in the banking sector (including equity
investment), one in general industry sector (direct investment in equity of a local enterprise),
one pre-export finance facility with a local company in the extractive industry and three trade

17
facilitation programs with local commercial banks. Commitments during 2005 include a trade
facilitation project with a local bank, two direct lending facility with a small hydro power
plant and gold mining company, three new SME loans, three equity investment projects with a
pharmaceutical company, plastic preform manufacturer (under Direct Investment Facility), an
insurance and reinsurance company, and two medium-sized co-financing facility allowing
local banks to share the risk of their selected clients with EBRD. During 2006 the EBRD
signed 2 projects with the total commitments of Euro 20 million—one of them an on-lending
long-term loan to support renewable energy projects, and the other one to Armenian
International Airports CJSC to complete the construction of a new international passenger
terminal. In the financial sector EBRD undertook two equity investments in 2007 with foreign
strategic co-investors (ProCredit and ITB-Byblos) and two further A/B syndications with
international commercial banks for ACBA-Credit Agricole and Armeconbank. Additionally,
two new Trade facilitation program (TFP) facilities were launched.
4.
The key priorities of the EBRD for the coming years are: (i) financial sector; (ii)
enterprise sector, particularly SME and micro-enterprise financing through credit lines to
Armenian banks or direct loans and equity investments, (iii) infrastructure investments in the
development of alternative energy sources and municipal infrastructure projects and
(iv) portfolio monitoring and implementation support. The EBRD’s current country strategy
was approved in February 2006.

18
ANNEX IV. ARMENIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Further improvements in real, fiscal, and external sector statistics would be desirable in order
to facilitate enhanced design and monitoring of economic policies. The overall quality,
timeliness, and coverage of macroeconomic statistics have improved significantly over the
past few years. The Fund has substantially facilitated this process through technical
assistance from the Statistics Department, the Fiscal Affairs Department, and the Monetary
and Capital Markets Department. On November 7, 2003 Armenia subscribed to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). The April 2008 data ROSC mission prepared a
detailed evaluation of the quality of the macroeconomic statistics.
Real sector statistics
2.
The National Statistics Service (NSS) has made significant changes to the national
accounts methodology to bring it in line with best international practices although some
shortcomings on data sources and methods remain. Progress has been made in developing
estimates of monthly and (constant price) quarterly GDP that are now published. Basic data
collection procedures have also partially improved. The national accounts statistics are
compiled following the conceptual frameworks of the 1993 SNA and ESA 95. The
classification of value added by economic activity follows the ESA 95 directions and data are
published grouped accordingly to the A3, A6, A17 and A60 codes of the EU nomenclature of
economic activities.
3.
Annual and quarterly GDP estimates are compiled at current prices, at comparable
previous year’s prices, and at average annual prices of the base year (1998) for the series up
to the year 2006. Since 2007, GDP at constant prices is computed at average annual 2005
prices. The April 2008 ROSC mission found that compilation techniques for the estimates of
GDP by production at constant prices are sound, however there is still need for
improvements in the corresponding estimates of GDP by expenditure, particularly regarding
the deflators of imports and exports. The mission also found that government expenditures
and some transactions with the rest of the world are recorded on a cash basis rather than the
required accrual method. Moreover, quarterly data are still collected on a cumulative basis,
which are likely to undermine their accuracy. Additionally, statistical techniques need
improvements regarding the estimates of the imputed rental services for owner-occupied
dwellings, consumption of fixed assets, and work in progress in agriculture.
4.
The CPI covers 11 large population centers and the capital city. Since January 2006
the CPI has been computed using 2005 weights. Concepts and definitions used in the
compilation of the CPI are broadly in line with international standards; source data and
compilation techniques are generally adequate. The NSS compiles a ten-day and a monthly
CPI. The ten-day index and the monthly index are disseminated jointly.

19
Government finance statistics
5.
The budget execution reporting system compiles data on a cash basis supplemented
with monthly reports on arrears and quarterly reports on receivables and payables. Daily
revenue and cash expenditure data for the central government are available with a lag of one
to two days. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) is undertaking a comprehensive reform of the
treasury system, including the introduction of an internal auditing system in line ministries
and their budgetary institutions. A single treasury account (TSA) was introduced in 1996,
and all bank accounts held by budgetary institutions were closed, except for Project
Implementation Units that are required by donors to operate with commercial banks’
accounts. Starting in 2002, some budgetary institutions have been converted into
“noncommercial organizations” (NCOs). These units have been taken out of the treasury
system and have their own bank accounts but report data on cash flows and balances to the
MoF since 2003. These exceptions notwithstanding, all government receipts and payments
are processed through the TSA, although there are still shortcomings on the timeliness and
quality of data on the operations of local governments. Classification of government
transactions by function and economic category are generally in line with the Manual on
Government Finance Statistics 1986, and monthly data on central government operations are
disseminated one month after the reporting period.
6.
By law, expenditures are classified and presented in the budget in accordance with the
1986 GFSM, but the MoF is working to implement the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). The budget presentation and the classification of items under
the economic and functional classification of expenditures needs to be made more
transparent; for instance, the data have been subject to frequent reclassifications, and wages
for military personnel are reported in the broader category of “other” goods and services
rather than as a wage item. The reconciliation of central government with general
government operations is done by the NSS in cooperation with the MoF.
7.
The authorities submitted cash data, converted to the framework of the GFSM 2001
for publication in the 2007 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. The authorities began
providing data for publication in the IFS in July 2007. The GFSM 2001 implementation plan
is currently limited to bringing the classification of budgetary central government revenue,
expense, and transactions in nonfinancial assets in line with international practices.
Monetary and financial statistics
8.
Monetary and financial statistics are provided on a timely basis. Daily data on the
accounts of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) are provided weekly with a one-day lag,
while weekly data on the monetary survey are provided with a one-week lag. The balance
sheets of the CBA and of the deposit money banks follow IAS methodology. Monthly
interest rate data are provided with an one-week lag.

20
9.
Responding to a STA request, the CBA has compiled and submitted a complete set of
monetary data beginning from December 2001 using Standardized Report Forms (SRF). STA
validated the resulting monetary aggregates and the data have been published since the
December 2006 issue of IFS Supplement and are used to update IFS. An Integrated Monetary
Database (IMD) has also been established by STA to share the SRF data with MCD.
External sector statistics
10.
The coverage of external sector data has improved in recent years. Trade statistics are
provided on a timely basis, and trade data by origin, destination, and commodity are
generally available within a month. Price data for exports and imports are less readily
available. Quarterly balance of payments statistics are generally available with a three-month
lag. However, on remittances, which account for a significant part of the inflows, there are
considerable discrepancies among available source data. Survey data are considerably lower
than data obtained through the money transfer system. The NSS and CBA are working on
establishing a compilation program that would enable proper measurement of remittances.
The absence of a comprehensive, continuously updated business register hampers the
coverage of transactions and institutional units; in particular, the coverage of the financial
account items for the private nonbank sector.
11.
Quarterly data on international investment position are published by the NSS within
one quarter after the reference period, and the annual data within two quarters; and are also
provided for publication in IFS.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Republic of Armenia
November 17, 2008
1.
This statement reports on economic and policy developments in Armenia since the
staff report was issued. These developments do not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.

Recent economic data are consistent with staff projections for 2008.
•

Year-on-year headline inflation decreased as expected, from 11.3 percent in
September to 8.6 percent in October, mainly due to a decline in food inflation.

•

Net international reserves were lower than projected in September 2008, owing to
foreign exchange intervention by the CBA in support of the dram. The end-year target
is still within reach, as large-scale FDI inflows are expected in the next several weeks.

•

Preliminary third-quarter data on budget execution show a lower-than-projected
deficit through September 2008. Tax revenues were slightly higher than projected,
whereas expenditures were on target.

3.
The short-term impact of the global financial crisis is expected to be contained, given
Armenia’s limited integration with the international financial system. But longer-term risks
to growth have increased with the prospects of a global recession. In the best-case scenario,
the global slowdown could help unwind the accumulated macroeconomic imbalances and
dampen the pre-crisis risk of overheating. But a hard landing cannot be ruled out in case of a
drastic decline in remittances and FDI, given Armenia’s strong dependence on these inflows.
4.
In reaction to the worsened international outlook, the CBA has kept its policy rate
unchanged since September, putting on hold its policy of gradual monetary tightening. In
addition, the authorities are temporarily supporting the exchange rate to reduce the risk of
redollarization and currency destabilization. Staff has advised the authorities to allow twoway exchange rate flexibility to avoid one-way bets and a reduction of international reserves.
Given current policies and the stable financial sector, a moderate depreciation is unlikely to
cause a loss of confidence in the dram. But it would help improve external competitiveness
and reduce the large current account deficit.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 20, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Armenia
On November 17, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Armenia. 1
Background
Armenia’s recent economic performance has remained strong, and the economy is poised for
another year of double-digit growth. But macroeconomic imbalances have widened. Rising
inflation, a widening current account deficit, and rapid credit growth have raised concerns about
overheating. While the impact of the current international financial turmoil is expected to remain
limited, the threat of a severe global economic downturn could undermine growth prospects.
The Armenian economy continues to register strong growth underpinned by sound
macroeconomic policies and ongoing structural reforms. Real GDP increased by 13.8 percent in
2007, the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth, and remained strong through
September 2008 (10.4 percent), on the back of continued buoyant activity in construction and
services. Inflationary pressures have increased on account of surging food and energy import
prices. The end-year inflation rate, at 6.6 percent, exceeded the target band for 2007 (4 ±1.5
percent), and inflation reached 8.6 percent in October 2008. However, inflation is still lower than
in neighboring countries, thanks to a gradual tightening of monetary policy, exchange rate

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
flexibility, and a moderate fiscal stance. Inflationary pressures will remain strong in the period
ahead, given significant demand pressures and an announced hike in gas import prices.
Despite strong growth in private transfers, the external current account has continued to
deteriorate. Imports have surged on the back of high international food and energy prices and
buoyant demand. Export performance has been disappointing, reflecting declining
competitiveness in diamond-processing and temporary shortfalls in base metals output, but also
the high cost of doing business in Armenia. With appreciation pressures dampened by rising
import demand, the dram/dollar exchange rate has been broadly stable since December 2007.
Fiscal policy has remained prudent. Tax collection has been well above expectations, driven by
a surge in value added tax (VAT) revenue partly associated with high import growth. Together
with expenditure underexecution, this resulted in a lower-than budgeted overall deficit in 2007
and an overall budget close to balance through July 2008. However, the underlying fiscal
balance (including the gas subsidy, but excluding grants and external interest payments) has
been deteriorating.
Monetary policy has been tightened to address inflationary pressures and limit second-round
effects of higher food and energy prices. In 2007-08, the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA)
gradually increased the repo rate to currently 7.75 percent.
Armenia’s financial sector infrastructure, regulation, and supervision have improved
significantly, and financial soundness indicators do not yet indicate significant vulnerabilities.
Banks continue to be profitable, well-capitalized, and nonperforming loans are still low.
Exposure to the international financial turmoil is limited due to low external commercial
borrowing. Yet, the sharp pickup in credit growth since mid-2007—while a welcome boost to
financial intermediation—could potentially impact negatively on financial sector stability.
The government’s program emphasizes the authorities’ commitment to policy continuity and
accelerated implementation of reforms along the lines of Fund advice, with a particular focus on
improving tax policy and administration, and the business environment. The authorities have
requested a low-access Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement to support
their ambitious reform agenda. A new Fund program is seen as crucial to safeguard
macroeconomic stability and as a signal of the authorities’ continued reform drive.
The authorities intend to continue publishing all documents related to the Article IV consultation.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the successful implementation of
macroeconomic policies under the PRGF-supported program that expired in May 2008. These
policies, supported by large-scale foreign exchange flows, have contributed to a period of strong
economic growth, low inflation, rising real incomes, and declining poverty rates.

3
Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ commitment to continued prudent monetary and fiscal
policies and far-reaching structural reforms. These actions are necessary to consolidate past gains
and to strengthen the economy’s resilience against external shocks. Vigorous implementation of
structural reforms will be key to address Armenia’s weak business environment, limited export
potential, and undiversified production base.
While Armenia’s short-term outlook remains favorable, inflationary pressures, a widening external
current account deficit, and rapid credit growth have raised concerns about overheating. However,
the current global financial turmoil and the unfolding economic downturn—as well as regional
instability—could affect foreign direct investment (FDI) and remittance inflows and undermine growth
prospects, while at the same time also dampening risks of overheating.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to withdraw fiscal stimulus during 2008-09 in order to
address current imbalances. Going forward, fiscal policy should balance the need for a
countercyclical stance with the spending requirements for poverty-reducing and infrastructure
spending. Directors therefore welcomed the authorities’ strong efforts to strengthen revenues by
addressing weaknesses in tax policy and administration. The envisaged tax reform will also bring
important benefits in terms of containing the shadow economy and discouraging tax evasion;
reducing significantly the cost of doing business, particularly in the export sector; contributing to
leveling the playing field; and, ultimately, promoting private sector development. Directors
commended the plans to strengthen the medium-term expenditure framework and debt
management policy.
Directors welcomed the commitment of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) to tighten monetary
policy further if signs of overheating persist. The CBA also intends to continue the preparation for a
full-fledged inflation targeting regime. Some Directors thought that a more gradual transition might
be preferable as the monetary policy transmission mechanism remains weak.
Directors considered that exchange rate flexibility will continue to be the best option for Armenia,
and that it should facilitate adjustment of the external balance. The authorities should refrain from
extensive unsterilized foreign exchange intervention to lend credibility to the inflation targeting
regime. Several Directors underscored the importance of allowing two-way exchange rate flexibility
to avoid one-way bets. Directors noted the staff assessment that, despite the notable appreciation of
the exchange rate in previous years, there is no evidence of a significant exchange rate
misalignment. This highlights the importance of accelerating key structural reforms aimed at
improving external competitiveness through a more favorable business environment.
Directors noted that Armenia’s financial sector infrastructure, regulation, and supervision have
improved significantly. Relevant indicators do not point to significant vulnerabilities nor are there
signs that the global financial crisis has affected financial institutions in Armenia. Nevertheless, in
view of the continuing areas of weakness as well as the rapid credit growth, the authorities should
further strengthen the financial system—in particular, the supervisory framework and risk
management—and prepare contingency plans in case of financial system stress.

4

Directors endorsed the authorities’ request for a low-access PRGF arrangement, given Armenia’s
good track record and strong policy and structural program for 2009. They acknowledged that the
program’s focus on further strengthening the fiscal and monetary policy frameworks and their
coordination, while deepening productivity-enhancing structural reforms, is appropriate to address
the significant challenges ahead. Some Directors recognized, however, that Armenia’s financing
needs might increase with rising global risks, and supported an early review of the situation if
needed. Directors also welcomed the authorities’ readiness to take additional policy measures as
needed.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 18, 2008

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves Three Year, US$13.6 Million Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility Arrangement for the Republic of Armenia
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a three year,
SDR 9.2 million (about US$13.6 million) arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) for the Republic of Armenia to support the government's economic
program through 2011. The decision will enable the Republic of Armenia to draw an amount
equivalent to SDR 1.31 million (about US$1.9 million) from the IMF immediately.
Following the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, stated:
“After the successful conclusion of its third PRGF-supported program in May 2008,
Armenia's economic performance has remained very strong. High growth has been
maintained and has contributed significantly to the marked reduction in poverty. Inflation has
increased in the wake of rising international food and fuel prices and growing domestic
demand pressures, although it remains lower than in other CIS countries. Adherence to
prudent macroeconomic policies and the progress made in structural reforms has helped to
achieve these results.
“The worsened global macroeconomic outlook has increased uncertainty, but Armenia is in a
strong position to withstand the impact of the global economic downturn. A gradual
deceleration of growth in Armenia may help dampen inflationary pressures. It may also
contribute to reducing the external current account deficit, which has increased on the back
of rising imports and sluggish exports, despite strong remittance inflows. Medium-term
prospects, although highly uncertain, remain benign in view of favorable investment
opportunities.
“Continued sound fiscal and monetary policies remain key to maintaining macroeconomic
stability. Prudent policies are necessary to reduce the current macroeconomic imbalances.
Current challenges highlight the need to strengthen policy frameworks. The floating
exchange rate regime continues to be the best option for Armenia, and the authorities are
encouraged to complete the transition to full-fledged inflation targeting. At the same time,
building capacity for fiscal policy analysis will help strengthen the budgetary process and

2

enhance fiscal policy credibility, increasing its effectiveness as a demand management tool.
In addition, the authorities must be prepared to adjust swiftly to a rapidly changing economic
environment. A weakening external environment might also increase Armenia’s financing
needs and possibly call for an early review of the situation.
“Improving external competitiveness requires a renewed push for structural reforms. Focus
should be on enhancing productivity, improving the business environment, and boosting
domestic competition. In this regard, the completion of the unfinished tax policy and
administration reform agenda is particularly important. These reforms would significantly
reduce the cost of doing business, particularly in the export sector, and contribute to leveling
the playing field, ultimately promoting private sector development,“ Mr. Portugal said.

ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
Armenia is poised for another year of double-digit growth, but inflation and external
imbalances have been growing. Notwithstanding the temporary trade disruptions during the
Georgia conflict, annual real GDP grew by 10.4 percent in the nine months to September
2008, and is projected to remain around 10 percent this year, assuming continued strong
activity in construction and services. Annual inflation remained high through September at
11.3 percent, but dropped to 8.6 percent in October on the heels of falling food prices,
remaining lower than in some neighboring countries.
While inflation was driven mainly by the global spike in food and energy prices (including
the elimination of a natural gas subsidy last May), demand pressures have played an
increasing role. Indeed, rising wages, persistently large foreign exchange inflows, rapid
credit growth, and a sharply widening current account deficit have raised concerns about
overheating. But the downward risks from the global economic downturn could help unwind
accumulated macroeconomic imbalances.
Budget execution in 2008 has been prudent. Tax collection has been well above expectations,
driven by a surge in VAT revenue partly associated with high import growth. The overall
deficit remained lower than projected through September 2008, at 0.5 percent of projected
annual GDP.
Monetary policy has been tightened to address rising inflationary pressures. To limit the
second-round effects of higher food and energy prices, the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA)
raised the repurchase rate gradually from 4.5 percent in June 2007 to 7.75 percent in
September 2008, but left the rate unchanged since, in response to the uncertain external
economic environment.
Despite large private transfers, the current account has continued to deteriorate. Imports have
surged on the back of high international food and energy prices and buoyant demand, while
export performance has been disappointing. With appreciation pressures dampened by rising
import demand, the dram/dollar exchange rate has been broadly stable since December 2007.
International reserve coverage dropped somewhat, but remains adequate, at about 3 ½
months of imports.
Program Summary
Armenia's PRGF-supported economic program builds on the authorities’ Sustainable
Development Program (SDP). The main goals of the new program are to sustain and broaden
economic growth, and further reduce poverty, consistent with SDP priorities.
Appropriate fiscal and monetary policies will underpin the macroeconomic objectives of the
program. Its main focus will be on strengthening the fiscal and monetary policy frameworks
and their coordination, while deepening productivity-enhancing structural reforms, and
improving governance. In particular, reforms in tax policy and tax administration will be
essential for the success of the program.

4

Strengthening the policy frameworks will require, among other things, strengthening the
institutional and analytical capacity at the Ministry of Finance, and adopting a Forecasting
and Policy Analysis System for inflation targeting at the Central Bank of Armenia. The
current global crisis highlights the need to minimize Armenia’s vulnerabilities by stepping up
efforts to diversify production and reduce dependence on remittances. In view of increasing
global risks, Armenia's external financial requirements may increase as well, possibly calling
for higher access than under the current PRGF arrangement.

Statement by Yuriy G. Yakusha, Alternate Executive Director
for the Republic of Armenia
November 17, 2008

My Armenian authorities sincerely appreciate staff’s advice and would like to emphasize that
Armenia followed the course of macroeconomic policy advocated by the Fund.
Revenue overperformance was largely saved, tax administration reform has been launched,
monetary policy was gradually, but persistently tightened in response to inflationary
pressures. The authorities also implemented recommendations of the FSAP update.
Downside risks from the global economic slowdown will dampen risks of overheating even
further. Since monetary policy in Armenia has been assessed as rather a success story of
previous programs’ implementation, I would like to concentrate on some of the underlying
fiscal challenges that have become persistent in Armenia despite the prudent fiscal stance
overall.
So far, the extremely high growth rates demonstrated by Armenia were accompanied and
supported by the extremely low role of government redistribution of GDP. The revenue
collection has improved only marginally in recent years, and not always in a way that could
be confidently sustained (owing to dependence on growing import prices, tax credits, etc.).
Additionally, an inefficient tax administration is perceived as an important constraint on
business. Being ahead of many its peers in the Doing Business Report’s overall rankings,
Armenia definitely lags behind on tax administration issues.
Armenia is hoping to become a middle income country by the time the current program is
implemented and will also likely feel a more pronounced business cycle. The authorities are
cognizant of the need for a more countercyclical role of fiscal policy. In order for fiscal
policy to become a more effective and credible demand management tool, the authorities
have recently developed and adopted a comprehensive medium-term tax reform plan. To this
effect, the authorities have implemented important policy measures for the new program,
targeting existing inadequacies in the tax administration. Some of these measures were
contemplated by staff as a part of future program conditionality, but were adopted by the
authorities before the program negotiations started in earnest. Tax policy is going to be
firmly anchored around the need to reduce the scope of tax exemptions and to address
governance problems. In the case of Armenia, one needs not only to overcome deeply
entrenched vested interests, but also to gain trust from businesses and households, whose
perception of tax inspectors is rather negative. Massive retraining efforts and personnel
changes are, therefore, expected. Modern auditing capabilities are also still lacking in the
country, limiting the scope for risk-based tax compliance enforcement.

2
The new tax code is now with the Parliament. Program performance criteria are directly
related to the progress of tax reform. On the expenditure side, the authorities intend to
concentrate on the productivity-enhancing and poverty-reducing expenditures. Urgently
needed sizeable increases in spending on infrastructure and on pension reform will only be
possible when tax reform succeeds. Before more pronounced effects from the tax reform
materialize, the authorities are limiting their deficit to 1.4 percent of GDP instead of the
originally planned 2.6 percent. Next year, the intention is to keep the deficit t under 1
percent of GDP in order to improve the underlying fiscal balance. These measures are not
easy to implement politically, given the pressing need to continue to address poverty in
Armenia, especially the rural poverty: geographically, Armenia is mostly a mountainous arid
area, where agriculture is challenging and risky. Despite notable progress in bringing overall
poverty levels down, rural poverty is still high.
Another timely pillar of the reform program to be supported by the PRGF is based on the
past achievements in improving banks’ corporate governance. It is targeting further
enhancement of the financial sector infrastructure, its regulatory and supervisory framework,
promoting financial sector deepening, and addressing related risks. Credit growth has been
very high in the past two years (though from a very low base); it moderated somewhat only
recently. Financial sector risks are, nevertheless, probably lower than in many other
countries, given that the banking sector assets to GDP ratio is currently still at only around 15
percent, even after the recent surge in domestic credit. The share of deposits and assets
denominated in foreign currencies is also among the lowest among the CIS countries.
On the monetary side, exchange rate flexibility will be maintained. The authorities will aim
at bringing inflation back to the target range in 2009 and will continue their preparation for a
fully-fledged inflation targeting regime. The most important challenge, to this end, will be
the development of the domestic debt market, which will require close coordination between
the CBA and the Government as well as external technical assistance. The monetary
program envisages broadly stable level of the foreign reserves, relative to 2007.
So far, the authorities see the new program with the Fund as predominantly a signaling
device and a tool to enhance internal policy coordination and boost confidence in the reform
agenda of the new government. Until now, the balance of payments challenges have been
manageable. The authorities acknowledge that external imbalances have grown somewhat,
because of energy and food price pressures, persistent foreign exchange inflows, incomes and
credit growth. In the case of Armenia, the common price pressures have been, unfortunately,
magnified by effects of the conflict in the neighboring Georgia: 70 percent of Armenian trade
passes through Georgia. Trade interruption, temporary shortages of fuel, notable increase in
the cost of transportation and insurance, other lost opportunities (including FDI, tourism,
others) have all contributed to additional pressures on the economy. In addition, on the
export side the country experienced some confidence-related temporary shortfalls in
important industries. It is probably too early to judge whether the effect on Armenia will be

3
prolonged, since it is only three months that the hostilities ended in Georgia, though
immediate losses and lost opportunities are estimated by the Armenian business community
in hundreds of millions of dollars.
Weakening global demand may eventually pose additional challenges, and the authorities
committed themselves to additional measures, if needed. They cannot exclude that additional
adjustment in response to materializing global risks may also require additional financing,
including from the Fund. They also expect Fund’s staff to keep external risks to the program
under constant review and hope that the Fund will stand ready to augment Armenia’s access
to financing under the program, if warranted.
