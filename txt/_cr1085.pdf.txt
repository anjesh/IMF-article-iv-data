Executive Summary
The German economy is regaining the ground lost in the crisis. Policy support, restocking,
and an uptick in global demand have lifted the economy from the recession. The recovery is
likely to be moderate, however: export growth is projected to be slower than before the crisis,
continuing banking fragilities pressure credit supply, and increasing unemployment will keep
consumers cautious. And it will take time to repair the damage to potential growth after
dislocations from the crisis. Following a drop of about 5 percent in 2009, staff now projects GDP
to grow by 1.2 percent in 2010 and 1.7 percent in 2011. The recovery remains fragile because of
mostly downward risks for export and credit growth.
This leaves Germany’s policymakers with the delicate task of managing ongoing risks and
exiting extraordinary support measures. The authorities’ policy measures—providing
significant fiscal stimulus and letting automatic stabilizers work, mitigating systemic financial
stress and supporting credit, and using labor market policies to smooth employment— were
crucial to the resumption of growth. A key policy challenge now is to prepare the exit from these
crisis policies:


Fiscal consolidation. The 2010 budget continues to provide stimulus during a still fragile
recovery. With the recovery expected to firm up by 2011, the government is committed to
fiscal consolidation, not least to anchor fiscal policy in the euro area. But strong measures
will be needed to meet the SGP and national deficit rules in the medium term, and tensions in
the fiscal plans for 2011, which include sizable permanent tax cuts, need to be resolved.



Continued financial sector restructuring and reform. While the health of the banking
sector has improved in general, the Landesbanken sector remains structurally unprofitable.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s call for major consolidation of the Landesbanken
while stressing the voluntary nature of the process. The authorities also agreed on the need to
put in place an effective bank resolution regime in line with EU efforts but, unlike the staff,
they did not see reforming the fragmented deposit insurance scheme as a priority. The staff
supported the government’s plans to make the Bundesbank the sole prudential bank
supervisor as this should enhance accountability and speed up enforcement.



Structural reform. The authorities plan to withdraw gradually short-term crisis policies in
the labor market so that these do not become impediments to long-run growth. The authorities
also agree that structural policies can make the economy more flexible and strengthen
domestic sources of growth. This would allow Germany to adjust to slower foreign demand
and could help to reduce current account imbalances within the euro area and globally.

I. THE CONTEXT1
1.
Strong policy support helped Germany emerge from the deep recession.
Germany was hit exceptionally hard by the crisis. But financial sector measures mitigated
systemic stress and supported credit (Box 1). Automatic stabilizers and significant fiscal
stimulus contained the downswing and supported the recovery. And the surprisingly strong
German labor market reflected flexibility gains from past labor market reforms, together with
the expansion of the short-term subsidies (Kurzarbeit) program.
2.
With a moderate, but fragile, recovery underway, policy demands are changing.
While crisis policies need to continue in some areas, there is a need for exit in others.


Fiscal policy: The recovery continues to rely on fiscal support for one more year, but
consolidation is in order once private demand has become self sustaining. This sits
uncomfortably with plans for tax cuts in 2011.



Dealing with the crisis aftershocks: With liquidity conditions set to tighten and credit
playing a crucial role for the recovery, time is running out for solving the remaining
banking sector problems, in particular in the Landesbanken sector.



Financial stability framework: Ensuring and improving financial stability remains
important, and the authorities are proceeding—if gradually. A plan to introduce a
banking resolution regime is being discussed, and there is a commitment to increase
the Bundesbank’s role in prudential supervision. However, little progress is being
made in addressing the still fragmented deposit insurance system. An FSAP Update is
planned for late 2010.



Allowing adjustment: Short-term crisis policies in the labor market and state aid to
smooth employment could become impediments to long-run growth if continued
indefinitely. The adjustment to slower foreign demand would benefit from service
sector and labor market reforms to strengthen domestic sources of growth.

3.
Successfully tackling the crisis fallout will also help sustain the upswing in
Europe and elsewhere, with positive feedback effects for the German economy. Europe’s
tightly integrated trade and financial markets create substantial spillovers, but they also open
the door to positive feedback effects from fiscal consolidation and solving the remaining
banking sector problems. These effects are particularly strong for a large and open economy
such as Germany. Strengthening domestic sources of growth would contribute to the

reduction of both euro area and global current account imbalances and, thereby, reduce the
risk of rapid or excessive exchange rate movements which tend to hurt trade.
II. THE OUTLOOK
4.
The global forces that drove Germany’s economy into the crisis have pulled
growth back into positive territory. The uptick started in the second quarter of 2009, led by
exports and aided by policy support and restocking of inventories. Reflecting restocking and
the high import content of German exports, import growth has picked up, too, reducing the
contribution of net exports to growth. Private consumption, which held up well during the
recession against a background of surprisingly stable employment, oscillated first upward
and then downward in reaction to fiscal incentives, especially the car scrapping program.

Staff and authorities see the recovery as moderate. A number of factors are at
play. With U.S. consumers likely to show restraint for some time and global policy support
eventually fading, the scope for export growth beyond the current global inventory bounce is
limited. Continuing banking problems will put pressure on credit supply and possibly
domestic demand as the recovery matures. Unemployment is projected to increase as firms
adjust to the reality of lower post-crisis growth and government subsidies for short-time
work lose their lure, which will further limit consumption. And it will take time to repair the
damage to potential growth done by the crisis. Following an estimated drop of about
5 percent in 2009, staff now projects GDP to grow by 1.2 percent in 2010 and 1.7 in 2011.
While the government’s projections are a shade more optimistic than staff’s, there is broad
agreement that the uncertainty around the recovery path comes with a downward bias, owing
to risks to exports and the financial sector (such as a credit crunch, or spillovers from
emerging and Southern European markets). Such setbacks could have self-enforcing effects,
with additional pressures on unemployment.

5

Box 1. Main Policy Measures 2009
During 2009, the German authorities took action in a broad range of policy areas, including fiscal,
financial, and the labor market.
In the fiscal area, the authorities combined significant short-term stimulus with a strengthening of the
medium-term framework:


Reacting to the depth of the downturn, the authorities in February enacted a second stimulus
package (Konjunkturpaket II) with a fiscal cost of about 2 percent of GDP distributed across 2009
and 2010. In addition, the authorities extended the cash-for-clunkers scheme, which had a notable
impact on car sales and private consumption (Box 5). The year also saw reductions in
contribution rates to unemployment and health insurance in January and July, respectively. In
December, the new government followed up with the Wachstumsbeschleunigungsgesetz, with tax
breaks and transfers of about ¼ percent of GDP.



At the same time, the new fiscal rule (“Schuldenbremse”), anchored in the constitution in June,
now limits the structural deficit of the federal government to 0.35 percent of GDP starting in
2016—to be reached in roughly equal consolidation steps starting in 2011—and that of the
Länder to balance by 2020, setting clear limits to debt accumulation in the medium term.

In the labor market, key actions during the first half of 2009 included measures that enhanced the
generosity of the very effective short-time (Kurzarbeit) subsidy scheme, including increased subsidy
levels and longer durations of eligibility (Box 2).
A series of financial sector measures helped stabilizing the banking sector:


The Sonderfonds Finanzmarktstabilisierung (SoFFin) established in 2008 (see Box 7) helped
stabilizing the banking sector, including through recapitalizations of Commerzbank and Hypo
Real Estate (HRE) (see separate text figure).



The Finanzmarktstabilisierungsergänzungsgesetz in April introduced a temporary option for
public takeover of banks, allowing the October nationalization of HRE.



The Gesetz zur Fortentwicklung der Finanzmarktstabilisierung (Bad-Bank-Act) passed in July
allows banks to transfer impaired assets to specially created legal vehicles in return for SoFFinguaranteed government bonds and a fee. The scheme includes additional options supporting bank
consolidation, including through removing entire business areas from the core bank.

A. Export Growth
6.
Germany is tied closely to the ups
and downs of the global economy. German
recoveries traditionally start with a pick-up in
exports, reflecting the importance of the
foreign-demand-oriented manufacturing sector
in value added. The draw of demand from EU
neighbors—including from the euro area—is
particularly important, given these countries’
large share in German trade. But non-EU
export growth picked up considerably in the
run-up to the crisis, as German manufacturers
profited from strong U.S. and Asian demand.
China exports grow strongly, but f rom low levels.

7.
Export growth is likely to be lower
following the crisis. The recovery in Europe is
projected to be slow, with particular
weaknesses in the South. U.S. consumers are
likely to show some restraint relative to their
pre-crisis spending, which will moderate
global demand, especially once the effects of
global fiscal stimulus and restocking subside.
And while Chinese growth is expected to
remain high, its overall pull remains relatively
limited due to the still small share in German
exports.

7
8.
Another moderating factor could be the dent the crisis put into German
competiveness. While the euro has been depreciating more recently, it had gained in strength
against the U.S. dollar and major currencies in the course of the global crisis. In addition,
wage growth picked up markedly just prior to the crisis in early 2008, ending a period of
wage discipline. These developments, together with an increase in unit labor costs caused by
labor hoarding, have put upward pressure on the ULC-based real exchange rate.

enduring tradition of German current
account surpluses suggests that other factors
not captured by the approach (including
perhaps a preference for the accumulation of
foreign assets) play a role, which could
overstate competitiveness. The Equilibrium
Real Exchange Rate concept—which
compares the actual and a computed

small competitive disadvantage, but could
also be misleading because of it relies on

approach may be best suited for Germany. It reflects the difference between the actual
savings-investment balance and a computed equilibrium (based, among other things, on
estimated saving preferences and demographic factors), and puts Germany at a broadly
neutral level. Taking a simple average of these measures—as is customary—suggests that
Germany retains a small competitive advantage, consistent with the authorities’ analysis. In
addition, wage growth has started to moderate since mid-2008 and labor hoarding is expected
to unwind, which will lift productivity.

10.
As for the current account position,
the outlook is for a moderation of the
surpluses. Under the baseline scenario, the
current account surplus will fall significantly
from its pre-crisis heights, reflecting lower
export growth. After reaching 7½ percent of
GDP in 2007, it is projected to reach
5½ percent of GDP in 2010. This would bring
the current account surplus broadly in line
with the equilibrium level suggested by the
Macrobalances approach. However, the
current account surplus could be even lower if

downward risks for export growth were to
materialize: demand from Asia could fall
short of expectations and a sharp depreciation
of the U.S. dollar in tandem with Asian
currencies could add additional downward
momentum.

employment was astoundingly robust.

Despite the large decline in output, employment has fallen by less than ½ percent since its peak,

9.5 percent—about 2 percentage points higher than observed. (The gap could have been three times
as high if unemployment had reacted as strongly as in the United States).

Whether employment losses can be avoided
also in the medium term depends on a
number of factors. First, the flexibility offered
by Arbeitszeitkonten has been largely
exhausted, and given that firms face residual
costs on short-time work, many may be forced
to lay off workers if production levels remain
low for too long. Second, structural shifts in the
economy, which often accelerate during
recessions, may eventually require employment
adjustments. Lastly, hourly flexibility works
both ways: firms may target lower employment
levels in the future assuming that higher
demand can temporarily be accommodated by
increases in hours worked. This suggests that
deterioration in labor market outcomes may yet
occur.

Sources: Haver and OECD.

Recent statistical changes have contributed to smaller measured unemployment, but even accounting for these
changes, the overall picture of a historically mild response in unemployment remains.

the recovery matures. While losses
from securitized products have likely
reached their peak, additional losses
on non-performing loans, which
follow GDP growth with a lag, could
be significant. The Bundesbank
estimates that by end-2010 German
financial institutions are likely to
write down another €50 billion to
€75 billion from bad loans, adding to
asset-related losses of €10 billion to
€15 billion.4 This implies that about
half of total losses have been written
off, a ratio that tallies broadly with
the IMF’s October 2009 estimates
for European banks overall.5 These
losses—together with tighter capital
regulations—will constrain credit
supply during the recovery. Indeed,
empirical evidence suggests that, in
Germany, lending growth during the
crisis has been positively related to
initial bank capital, suggesting that
capital could be a constraint on
lending moving forward (Box 3).

the pre-crisis period. Moreover, the capital
constraint appears to be stronger for the large commercial banks than for other banks. The effect
of an increase in capital/assets on lending growth is economically significant, especially for the
large commercial banks.
A reduction in bank credit affects German macroeconomic activity significantly by reining
in private consumption and investment. Employing a simple time series analysis, staff assessed
the impact of a reduction in bank credit on GDP, private consumption, and gross fixed capital
formation.2/ The quantitative effects of a reduction in bank credit on private demand are large: the
estimated effects imply that a 1 percent reduction of bank lending would reduce consumption and
investment by respectively 1.2 percent and 2.8 percent (text figure).

Box 5. Car-Scrapping Program
The Cash-for-Clunkers scheme (CFC, “Umweltprämie”) offered a subsidy of €2,500 for the
purchase of new cars between January and August 2009. Following an overwhelming number of
applications, the scheme’s value was increased from the initial €1.5 billion to €5 billion (0.2 percent
of GDP). Private consumption of cars jumped in Q1 and Q2 of 2009.

Staff estimates suggest that the CFC scheme boosted private consumption growth by 1.1 and
0.4 percentage points (qoq) in 2009:Q1 and Q2, respectively. A simple model explains the

experience with the 2007 VAT increase suggests that more weakness is to come. In the run-up to
the VAT increase in January 2007, car consumption jumped in late 2006, but the sharp decline in
2007:Q1 indicates that the previous increase was mostly driven by advanced car purchases.1/
Consistent with the experience of the VAT episode, car sales have already started falling in 2009:Q3,
shaving 0.1 percentage points off private consumption growth. More recent data indicate that car
sales have continued to decline, contributing to weaker private consumption.
1/

The regression result shows that the announcement of the VAT increase raised car consumption growth by 9 percentage
points in each 2006:Q3 and Q4, before the VAT increase reduced car consumption growth by 17 percentage points in
2007:Q1.

21.
Consequently, the fiscal position has weakened markedly. Following a balanced
budget in 2008, the general government deficit reached an estimated 3.3 percent of GDP in
2009 and is projected to increase to 5½ percent in 2010—nearly twice the deficit limit set by
the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). The increased deficit reflects the
additional budget measures, the fiscal consequences of the anticipated weakening of the
labor market, and cyclically weak tax revenues. Taking into account the fiscal costs
associated with the financial sector support packages, the gross debt ratio is set to rise from
65 percent of GDP in 2007 to 77 percent in 2010.

18
22.
The authorities agree that fiscal consolidation needs to start as soon as the
recovery has firmed up—which is projected for 2011. With public debt on a rising path,
contingent liabilities associated with financial support measures, and private sector growth
expected to become self sustaining by 2011, fiscal consolidation should become a priority.
23.
The authorities are firmly committed to meeting their medium-term fiscal
targets. To fulfill the SGP requirement, the general government deficit will have to decline
to 3 percent of GDP by 2013. By 2016, the general government budget will have to be close
to balance, reflecting the limits

The constitutional rule restricts the federal structural deficit to 0.35 percent of GDP by 2016, and the MTO
implies a structural deficit limit of 0.15 percent for the Länder. The structural deficits projected for 2010 are
2.9 and 1.5 percent, respectively.

All scenarios assume that the federal government provides about 60 percent of the overall adjustment in line

19
further annual structural adjustment of ¾ percent of GDP through 2016. Both calculations
include the planned tax cuts in 2011. The required fiscal efforts are large and comparable to
the re-balancing of the public finances after German unification, and the pre-crisis drive for a
balanced budget.
25.
Formulating a credible fiscal adjustment strategy—focused on expenditures—
and implementing it starting in 2011 will be important. Expenditure-based consolidations
tend to be larger and more enduring,8 and the authorities agreed that such an approach was
preferable. International evidence also shows that fiscal adjustments cause the smallest
contractionary effects when driven by reductions in current spending.9 The authorities agreed
that measures introduced during the crisis need to be withdrawn as planned, but additional
efforts will be required. While progress has been made in reducing subsidies under the
previous government, staff stressed that the planned further systematic examination of
subsidies (for example, in agriculture or mining) can yield budgetary savings. Staff also saw
it as crucial to strictly adhere to the agreed-upon adjustment mechanisms for pension benefits
and the gradual rise in the retirement age. The ongoing effort to realize potential savings in
the health care system (for example, by limiting spending on non-generic pharmaceuticals)
should also help.
26.
But the authorities are well aware that the need for consolidation might exceed
the scope for expenditure cuts, in which case revenue measures will also be needed.
Staff suggested that a first step could be to broaden the VAT tax base by eliminating
exemptions, including those recently introduced, and increasing coverage. Staff also
recommended reviewing income tax exemptions. If tax rate increases were unavoidable,
higher VAT rates would prop up revenues at the federal and Länder levels, and a reform of
the property tax could support local finances. Also, an increase of contribution rates to the
unemployment insurance would remove the need for repeated federal government support—
a proposal that is under discussion.
27.
In this context, tensions in the fiscal plans for 2011 need to be resolved. The
coalition agreement includes a permanent income tax cut of about 1 percent of GDP. The
authorities pointed out several arguments in its favor: well-timed tax cuts can help sustain
private demand and the recovery; the implied lowering of marginal tax rates could increase
incentives to work; and the envisaged simplification of the income tax system (including a
move from the existing linearly increasing income tax schedule to one with stepwise constant

rates) promises further efficiency gains. While agreeing with these potential benefits, staff
noted that the impact on labor supply may be small and that the proposed income tax
schedule could create adverse incentive effects, such as those associated with bunching
around the tax rate steps. Moreover, the tax cuts in 2011 would add to the already elevated
debt level at a time when the recovery has likely already firmed, giving them a distinctly procyclical character. This suggests that any tax measure should be carefully designed to
maximize its intended efficiency impact and should be implemented only if compensating
budgetary measures were taken to ensure compliance with the medium-term fiscal targets.

The authorities are well aware that a successful fiscal exit will not only establish
the credibility of the new national fiscal framework, it will also help anchor fiscal policy
in the euro area. Germany’s fiscal actions matter in Europe because of the country’s relative
size and because, as in the past, they could set an example for fiscal consolidation for the rest
of Europe (Box 6). This would reduce the risk of an undesirable policy mix of tight monetary
and loose fiscal policy (which tends to increase interest rates and crowd out private demand)
in the euro area, which in turn would weaken growth in Germany. Conversely, a failure to
consolidate the public finances in Germany would damage the national and European fiscal
frameworks.
IV. FINANCIAL SECTOR
A. Completing the Banking Consolidation
29.
The health of the financial sector has improved, but time is running short for
dealing with the remaining problems and risks. The steepening yield curve, the improving
economic outlook, and the authorities’ financial sector measures have benefited banks. Some
of Germany’s larger banks have deleveraged their balance sheets and added to their capital.
Still, the remaining sizable write-downs, along with risks to the recovery and banks’
exposure to emerging and Southern European markets, create vulnerabilities. With the
expected tightening of euro area liquidity, the window for resolving remaining financial
sector problems is closing fast. The sunset clauses for new public support through the
Sonderfonds Finanzmarktstabilisierung (SoFFin) by end-2010 add to the urgency (Box 7).
30.
Recognizing capital needs at the individual bank level and acting upon it will be
key. As the authorities pointed out, the voluntary public recapitalization option offered by
SoFFin has been helpful in this regard. However, fewer institutions than initially expected
have made use of the offer, suggesting—in staff’s view—that more forceful incentives to
strengthening capital buffers might be needed. Stronger institutions could make use of the
normalization of equity markets. Weaker banks will have to accept the conditionality of
SoFFin’s support, or face resolution. In line with the principles established by SoFFin, public
support will be conditional on viable business models—a condition particularly relevant for
the Landesbanken sector.

Fiscal credibility seems to explain part of the
effect. Indeed, the pattern of country responses to Germany’s actions suggests that the wish to signal
credibility plays a role. Countries with higher political instability and more acute economic
vulnerabilities have responded more strongly to Germany’s actions. This effect was particularly
strong during periods of German fiscal consolidation.

31.
The larger public banks remain an area of particular concern. The financial
crisis has revealed serious and systemic risks to financial stability in the Landesbanken
sector. After government help in various forms for various Landesbanken (see text figure),
Germany’s largest Landesbank, West LB, will undergo more substantial restructuring. About
one third of its balance sheet (€85 billion, including structured products) will be transferred
to a “bad bank,” with the remaining core bank receiving about €3 billion public capital from
SoFFin, initially as silent participation. Bayern LB’s financial position has been weakened by
its past, and costly, ownership of Austrian Hypo Group Alde Adria.

22
Box 7. The German Financial Market Stabilization Fund (SoFFin)
The Sonderfonds Finanzmarktstabilisierung was set up in October 2008 and is administered by
the Agency for the Stabilisation of the Financial Markets (Bundesanstalt für
Finanzmarktstabilisierung, FMSA). Its purpose is to facilitate financial sector stabilization measures
supporting financial institutions (such as banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment
companies, and special purpose vehicles) based in Germany. Stabilization measures are decided by
the Ministry of Finance (which delegated certain decisions to FMSA), and the Ministry regularly
informs a special parliamentary committee. In its operations, SoFFin draws on some support from the
Bundesbank and external expertise.
The available stabilization measures comprise guarantees, recapitalizations, and the transfer of
risky assets, including “bad banks.” The total volume of these measures is capped at €480 billion,
with up to €400 billion available for guarantees for interbank loans and bank-issued debt with a
maturity of generally up to 3 years, and €80 billion for the recapitalizations and the assumption of
risk associated with certain assets. The federal government provides the funding of the SoFFin. After
the liquidation of the SoFFin, the remaining position is to be divided to 65 percent to the federal
government and 35 percent to the

institutions or exchange for government debt.

Besides Germany, the U.K. and Switzerland have established specific entities (with a temporary
mandate) to resolve the distress of its financial system. U.K. Financial Investments Limited was
established in November 2008 as a company wholly-owned by the Government. Its aim is to manage
the Government‘s equity participations in financial institutions at arm’s length and on a commercial
basis, to ensure financial stability, and to act in a way that promotes competition. Switzerland has
established a Stabilization Fund as a separate entity that is closely linked to the Swiss National Bank
to handle the illiquid assets of a large bank. Other countries that have experienced highly adverse
shocks to their financial stability have handled the crisis with existing institutions, for instance in the
U.S. through the Federal Reserve and the FDIC.

This suggests that consolidation of the Landesbanken sector should be a policy
priority. The authorities are well aware of—and staff has noted in the past—many of the
sector’s underlying problems, including the structural unprofitability, weak governance, and
insufficient risk control that are burdening many institutions.10 Staff noted that the structural
unprofitability will remain even as the outlook improves: with their high cost structure and

done to prevent the
sector from being a
continuous drain on the public finances and a source of financial instability for Germany.
While the authorities supported the need for significant consolidation of the sector, they also
stressed that the ownership of the Länder limits the influence of the federal government on
the process. The authorities and staff saw the Landesbanken’s wholesale banking function
for Sparkassen as a basis for consolidation, with staff suggesting a single institution. Any
remaining Landesbanken would need to have effective governance and viable business
models, with an alternative private ownership structure.
33.
Quickly solving the remaining financial sector problems at the individual bank
level will also allow exiting from blanket measures. Measures such as the support for bank
funding offered by SoFFin and the government’s public commitment to fully protect
household deposits can distort risk-taking incentives and prevent market normalization. This
calls for an exit as soon as all known and anticipated recapitalization needs have been met.
The forthcoming FSAP Update requested by the authorities and scheduled for late 2010 can
be helpful by shedding light on the financial sector’s health in the absence of government
support. Enhanced surveillance of the German banking sector would profit from more
comprehensive and timely data and transparent reporting.

34.
It will be important to
coordinate the exit from these
financial sector measures
internationally. For example, an
uncoordinated withdrawal or
amendment of deposit guarantees at
the national level could trigger
unwanted cross-border capital flows—
similar to the early crisis phase, when
highly liquid funds chased the highest
deposit guarantee across Europe. To
limit these risks, Germany will benefit
from (and could be part of) a
coordinated exit at the EU level.
B. The Financial Stability
Framework
35.
The authorities are moving to
overhaul the financial stability
framework. Key elements of the
reform are banking supervision and the
bank resolution regime, while further
changes to the fragmented deposit
insurance system are not on the
agenda. Ongoing EU reforms are
providing the backdrop to the German
efforts.

supervision into the Bundesbank.
Currently the Bundesanstalt fur Finanzdienstleisungsaufsicht (BaFin, the consolidated
supervisor for the German financial sector) and the Bundesbank share duties for bank
supervision. The Bundesbank performs on-site supervision under instructions issued by
BaFin, but BaFin can commission special audits of banks and has overall responsibility for
the supervision of banks. The arrangement has been criticized—including by staff—as
duplicative and creating coordination and informational issues, creating delays in taking
enforcement actions, and weakening accountability and potentially leading to poor decision
making. Against this background staff welcomed the planned reform as a step in the right
direction.

25
37.
The authorities are discussing a variety of organizational models to implement
the reform. Staff stressed that no one arrangement has worked consistently better across
countries in preventing the crisis.11 However, the crisis has also highlighted the need for any
model to ensure the incentives and capability to identify and address systemic risks. To this
end:


The authorities agreed that having one national agency with a clear mandate for
macroprudential oversight and monitoring systemic risk would have benefits. The
Bundesbank is the natural choice in this regard, given its experience in banking
supervision and financial stability analysis. The discussion about the Bundesbank’s
sectoral coverage is ongoing, however. In staff’s view, placing prudential supervision
over the entire financial sector—in particular not only banking but also insurance
given their interconnectedness in Germany—under the Bundesbank would facilitate
both this process and the Bundesbank’s ability to represent Germany on the proposed
European Systemic Risk Board. BaFin would then become the market conduct
supervisor, with responsibility for securities firms and markets and consumer
protection for the entire financial sector—an arrangements resembling the so-called
twin peaks model.



Regardless the specific responsibilities given to the Bundesbank, staff stressed the
resulting body would have to be both accountable and operationally independent to
deliver effective supervision.



The authorities stand ready to manage the transition risks to avoid supervisory lapses.
Given the possibility that the merger and reorganization could well distract personnel
from their primary mission, staff suggested it was critical to clarify early the form of
the final reorganization and prepare for speedy implementation by early 2011.

38.
The authorities also seek to strengthen the legal framework for bank resolution.
The global financial crisis has reinforced the need for countries to have strong and effective
regimes for bank resolution. Building on the temporary measures taken with the creation of
SoFFin, the authorities have begun to develop a legal framework for resolving systemically
important banks in an orderly fashion. As discussed at the European level, this framework
should allow for bridge banks and transactions involving the assumption of liabilities and the
purchase of assets. While the authorities saw little need for a special regime to allow for the
orderly exit of non-systemic banks, staff stressed the slowness and potential disruptiveness of
existing corporate insolvency procedures. The authorities agreed that having a permanent
bank resolution regime in place by early 2011 would have advantages, given the sunset
11

Lessons from the Crisis,” IMF Working Paper 09/70.

26
provisions for SoFFin. In case of a delay, staff recommended SoFFin’s powers should be
extended as long as needed.
39.
The crisis has exposed long-standing limitations of the German deposit
insurance regime, strengthening the case for more fundamental reform. As staff has
highlighted in the past, German deposit insurance is highly fragmentized, reflecting the
public-private mix of the banking system.12 Commercial banks combine a statutory scheme
providing coverage of €50,000 with additional collective arrangements. Cooperative banks
rely on collective arrangements and Sparkassen and Landesbanken on a combination of
collective arrangements and support from their public sponsors—and neither group is
currently subject to a statutory scheme. While the authorities saw the existing regime as
adequate, staff pointed out the lack of transparency and legal certainty and stressed that the
high coverage can be difficult to maintain without public support—a point vividly illustrated
by the need for a €6.7 billion SoFFin guarantee for the commercial banks’ deposit protection
scheme during the crisis. In addition, the association-sponsored deposit protection schemes
rely largely on after-the-fact contributions from members at the time of stress, which can
exacerbate a crisis. With the EU-initiated further increase of statutory deposit insurance
coverage to €100,000 next year, staff saw merit in creating a unified fund for deposit
insurance spanning the entire banking system.

longer-run growth. For example, industry
analysts argue that the car industry in Western
Europe is characterized by excess capacity
beyond the immediate effects of the crisis.13
Thus, it will be crucial to draw a line between
smoothing the impact of the shorter-term
repercussions of the global recession and
preventing what could be a necessary
adjustment to longer-term trends in demand.
Staff therefore supported the government’s
intention to adjust the conditions of the
Kurzarbeit scheme in line with the pace of the
recovery.

41.
The authorities agreed that payoffs from adjusting structural policies more
generally are high—but saw little opportunity for major additional reforms in the near
term. Given the projected increase in unemployment, the damage from the crisis to potential
growth, and the expectation of more moderate export demand, it will be essential to add to
the gains from past reforms. In particular, further increasing labor market flexibility through
decreasing both legal and labor-court based employment protection would support the
reallocation of workers across sectors, while tackling remaining obstacles to service sector
growth would boost labor demand. The product market reforms currently discussed by the
authorities—ranging from enhanced powers for the competition authority to measures to
enhance competition in network industries—will also be beneficial. Simultaneous reforms in
all areas are promising additional benefits, as firms operating in more competitive product or
services markets tend to react more strongly to labor market reforms than others. While
agreeing that there was scope for additional reforms, the authorities noted the political
window to implement had narrowed, with the current public debate focused more on the
costs than the benefits of past structural reforms.
VI. SPILLOVERS
42.
Compared to the other large European countries, Germany is a remarkably
open economy and particularly exposed to foreign shocks. Germany is highly integrated
into global trade, and even more into the intra-European and euro area flow of goods and
services. External volatility therefore adds considerably to the volatility of GDP overall.
Germany’s larger banks, too, operate globally and across Europe’s financial market. Between
2000 and the first quarter of 2008 alone, foreign claims of German banks rose by the
equivalent of 37 percentage points of GDP, and foreign exposure remains high despite the
13

28
deleveraging during the crisis period (Box 8).
Real and financial links to emerging Europe
are substantial, including through export
demand, the integration of manufacturers in
the German supply chain, and banking
exposure. German banks have close to 5
percent of their foreign portfolio invested in
Central and Eastern European countries,
which exceeds the investment by banks in the
U.S., the U.K., or France.

Germany is more exposed to EU and non-EU trade shocks than its
larger neighbors, but financial openness is average.

This reinforces the case for strengthening domestic sources of growth, which
could also contribute to lower current account imbalances—both globally and within
the euro area. Staff agreed with the authorities that the rebalancing should not occur through
policies to weaken German competitiveness—a move likely to reduce euro area
competitiveness overall. Within the euro area relative prices will have to adjust to prevent
continued imbalances and safeguard growth. For Germany, the way forward would be
additional labor reforms and efforts to bolster service sector activity to aid long-run growth.
In addition to benefiting Germany more generally, this could help to reduce Germany’s

Box 8. Foreign Exposure of German Banks
Prior the crisis, foreign claims of German banks
grew at a rapid pace. From 2000:Q1 to 2008:Q1,
foreign claims of German banks rose by 160 percent
to about $4.7 trillion (a change in the foreign claims
to GDP ratio of about 37 percentage points). About
half of the build-up of foreign claims of German
banks during this period went to the euro area and to
the U.S., while emerging markets accounted for
8 percent of the increase.

countries, in particular with the U.S. and the euro

significant part of the adjustment. At the same time, claims toward Central and Eastern Europe (CEE)
contracted only modestly, possibly as a result of the Vienna initiative or of banks’ objective to
maintain their presence in CEE countries.

But German banks remain exposed to foreign risks. Simulation exercises suggest that German

VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
The recovery underway is likely to be moderate, with predominantly downside
risks. Muted euro area expansion and the restraint of U.S. consumers will limit Germany’s
export growth, while domestically consumers will remain cautious given the expected
increase in unemployment and moderate income gains, and remaining banking problems will
contain credit supply. GDP growth could also be lower because of setbacks to world trade or
the domestic financial system.
46.
The policy challenge is managing ongoing risks while preparing to unwind the
extraordinary measures introduced during the crisis. Fiscal policy will have to transition
from supporting the recovery to credible consolidation, financial sector policies from balance
sheets repair to improvements of the stability framework, and labor market and structural
policies from employment smoothing to fostering domestic growth.
47.
Fiscal consolidation needs to start as soon as the recovery has firmed up. The
2010 budget appropriately provides stimulus for a still fragile recovery. As a consequence,
the general government deficit is estimated to rise in 2010 to nearly twice the limit set by the
SGP. Moreover, the federal structural balance is significantly below the target set by the new
constitutional rule for 2016. With public debt rising and private sector growth expected to be
self-sustaining by 2011, consolidation should become a priority.
48.
Germany’s commitment to the SGP and its new constitutional rule is welcome—
and has potential benefits for Europe. Meeting these targets would allow Germany to
regain fiscal space and prepare for the rising costs of its aging population. Moreover,
Germany’s actions also matter for Europe because, as in the past, German consolidation
could set an example for other countries. This would help avoid an undesirable policy mix of
tight monetary and loose fiscal policy in the euro area.
49.

Meeting the consolidation targets is a formidable task.



Fulfilling the government’s fiscal targets, including the SGP and the new
constitutional rule, will require sizable structural adjustment between 2011 and 2016.
Thus, a credible plan, preferably focused on expenditures, is needed fast. In this
context, the tensions in the fiscal plans for 2011 should be resolved by designing the
planned tax cuts to maximize efficiency and be implemented only with compensating
budgetary measures to meet medium-term fiscal objectives.



Expenditure savings are available including from a systematic examination of
subsidies and in the health care system. Agreed-upon adjustment mechanisms for
pension benefits and the gradual rise in the retirement age need to be implemented.

32


Should revenue measures have to be part of the solution, eliminating exemptions in
income and VAT taxes should have priority before higher VAT rates. A reform of the
property tax could support local public finances. Higher unemployment insurance
contribution rates would remove the need for repeated government support

50.
The health of the financial sector has improved, but time is running short for
dealing with the remaining problems and risks, in particular in the ailing Landesbanken
sector. Strengthening capital buffers should be a priority for most banks. Despite initial steps
towards restructuring, much more needs to be done to prevent the Landesbanken from being
a continuous drain on the public finances and source of financial instability. Major
consolidation into one wholesale bank for the Sparkassen is a priority, and remaining
institutions should have to prove their structural profitability under an alternative ownership
structure. Enhanced surveillance of the German banking sector would profit from more
comprehensive and timely data and transparent reporting.
51.
The government’s commitment to make the Bundesbank the sole prudential
bank supervisor is welcome. The reform would improve the accountability and enforcement
of banking supervision. Moreover, choosing the Bundesbank as single agency for
macroprudential oversight and monitoring systemic risk will provide for the necessary
capability and incentives to identify and address systemic risks—in particular if prudential
insurance supervision was added to its portfolio. Either way, effective supervision will
require that the resulting institution be both accountable and operationally independent. The
transition risks stemming from the reform need to be managed to avoid supervisory lapses.
52.
There is a need for a strong and effective bank resolution regime. Against the
background of the ongoing discussion at the European level, the authorities have started to
develop a legal framework for orderly resolving systemically important banks. Any such
regime should include among its tools bridge banks, transactions involving the assumption of
liabilities, and the purchase of assets. It will also be important to develop a similar solution
for non-systemic banks. The new regime should be in place before the temporary resolution
framework provided by SoFFin expires by year-end. If necessary, SoFFin’s powers should
be extended until the permanent solution is in place.
53.
The crisis also highlighted the need to overcome the well-known limitations of
Germany’s fragmented deposit insurance system. The EU-initiated increase of deposit
insurance coverage to €100,000 next year will be an opportunity to create a unified deposit
insurance fund spanning the entire banking system. This would introduce welcome
transparency and legal certainty, avoid procyclical after-the-fact contributions, and introduce
coverage that can be maintained without public support even in a crisis.
54.
Extraordinary support should be withdrawn also in the structural area. Shortterm crisis policies in the labor market and state aid have helped to preserve employment in
the recession, but they could impede long-run growth if continued well into the recovery.

33
The government’s intention to change the conditions of the Kurzarbeit scheme in line with
the recovery is as necessary as it is welcome in this regard.
55.
Additional reforms can help Germany’s adjustment to the post-crisis world—
and contribute to reducing global imbalances. Reduced potential growth and the threat of
lower export growth raise the importance of further improving the flexibility of domestic
markets. Lower legal and labor-court-based employment protection would facilitate
reallocation of workers, while simultaneously improving product market competition and
service sector development would foster labor demand. These reforms, through strengthening
domestic sources of growth, would not only benefit Germany but could also help rebalancing
euro area and global trade.
56.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

1/ Foreign claims include all international claims plus local claims of foreign affiliates in local currency. The difference between the
claims to all countries and the sum of mature and emerging market exposures is due to offshore center exposures.
2/ BIS data is based on the consolidated lending statistic compiled by the Bundesbank (as of 2009:Q2).
3/ The data are derived from the "Groß- und Millionenkreditmeldung" stipulated in §§ 13 and 14 KWG (Credit Services Act). Under
the Credit Services Act, debtors are obliged to register all loans (and other credit-like obligations) of €1.5 million or higher with the
Bundesbank on a quarterly basis. In this context, the definition of credit also included equity and counterparty risk exposure from credit
default swaps (CDS). Specific details on the obligation to register are stipulated in the Groß- und Millionenkreditverordnung (GroMikV).
Credit derivative exposures are recorded as off-shore transactions at their nominal value if available, otherwise the book value applies.

Germany’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other
currencies.
Germany is an Article VIII member and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. It maintains measures adopted
for security reasons, which have been notified to the Fund for approval in accordance with
the procedures of Decision 144 and does so solely for the preservation of national or
international security.

Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)

An assessment under the international standard for AML/CFT was conducted by the Fund's
Legal Department in May 2009. The detailed assessment report was adopted by the joint
MENAFATF-FATF Plenary Meeting held in Abu Dhabi from February 17-19, 2010. The
report concluded that, despite Germany introducing a number of measures in recent years to
strengthen its AML/CFT regime, the AML/CFT framework is not fully in line with the
standard. There are weaknesses in the legal framework and in sanctioning for noncompliance with AML/CFT requirements. The recommendations to address these include:

amending the Criminal Code to: criminalize (i) ML in a way that covers all serious
predicate offenses, and (ii) TF in a way fully consistent with international standards;

amending the AML Act to: (i) improve preventive measures notably by imposing a
reporting obligation based on suspicion rather than knowledge and that relates to the
proceeds of criminal activity; and (ii) clearly establish that the FIU should carry out more of
the core functions of an FIU as contemplated by the FATF standard;

fully and effectively implementing the UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs)
on TF;


applying sanctioning powers more effectively for breaches of AML/CFT obligations;


strengthening the effective implementation of AML/CFT obligations imposed on
designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs); and

ANNEX II. GERMANY: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Germany has a full range of statistical
publications and subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). A
ROSC Data Module report was published in January 2006. The authorities make substantial
use of the Internet to facilitate on-line access to data and press information.
Germany adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95)
in 1999. The 2005 ROSC Data Module mission found that the macroeconomic statistics
generally follow internationally accepted standards and guidelines on concepts and
definitions, scope, classification and sectorization, and basis for recording. However, the
sources for estimating value added for a few categories of service industries could be
improved. A direct source for quarterly changes in inventories, which is an important
indicator of changes in GDP over the business cycle, is lacking. There is no systematic,
proactive process to monitor the ongoing representativeness of the samples of local units and
products between rebases of the producer price index.
Comprehensive data reporting systems support the accuracy and reliability of the government
finance and balance of payments statistics. However, although explanatory documentation
exists, differences between the general government data in the ESA95 classification and the
general government cash data on an administrative basis is impairing fiscal analysis;
Germany publishes—through Eurostat—general government revenue, expenditure, and
balance on an accrual basis on a quarterly basis (ESA95) and submits annual data for
publication in the Government Financial Statistics Yearbook, in GFSM 2001 format.
Monthly data are only disseminated on a cash-basis.
Germany is participating in the Coordinated Compilation Exercise for financial soundness
indicators (FSIs). In 2006, as part of this exercise, the German authorities compiled a
comprehensive set of FSI data and metadata.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Germany
On March 29, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Germany. 1
Background
Germany was hit exceptionally hard by the global crisis, but strong policies helped to avoid an
even deeper recession. After a sharp fall in real GDP in the first half of 2009, broad-based
policy support and an uptick in global demand lifted the economy in the second half, keeping
the GDP contraction to 4.9 percent for 2009. The recovery is expected to continue at a
moderate pace, with real GDP growth projected to reach 1.2 percent in 2010 and 1.7 percent in
2011. There are substantial downside risks, however, reflecting remaining banking weaknesses
and the possibility of weaker-than-expected global trade.
The authorities used the available fiscal space to implement countercyclical policy measures.
Direct spending, tax cuts, the cash-for-clunkers scheme, and employment subsidies boosted
demand in 2009, but also increased the general government deficit to 3¼ percent of GDP from
a broadly balanced budget the year before. In 2010, implementation of remaining stimulus
measures and additional tax cuts and transfers are projected to bring the deficit to 5½ percent
of GDP, nearly twice the limit set by the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).
The deficit is large also by the standards of the new constitutional rule to secure long-term fiscal
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On

sustainability, which requires the structural federal fiscal balance to be near zero starting in
2016.
Financial sector measures helped stabilize financial markets and mitigated systemic risk, but
vulnerabilities remain. Crisis measures included recapitalizations and credit guarantees through
the Sonderfonds Finanzmarktstabilisierung (SoFFin) and public commitments to protect
household bank deposits. While the overall health of the financial sector has improved since the
crisis, several sources of vulnerabilities linger, including the credit risks from a still fragile
recovery and sizeable remaining write-downs, and banks’ exposure to emerging and Southern
European markets. The structurally unprofitable Landesbanken continue to pose systemic risks.
Unemployment has increased slowly so far—owing to past labor market reforms and crisis
policies. The Hartz IV reforms have strengthened employment going into the crisis; and the
improved possibility to adjust work time under collective wage agreements and the short-time
work scheme helped firms to avoid dismissals. However, with a diminished growth outlook,
firms will eventually adjust their work force, especially in the hard-hit manufacturing sector. This
could severely test the overall flexibility of the German labor market, which is still characterized
by high employment protection. Moreover, existing obstacles to services sector development
and product market competition increase the danger of a drawn-out structural adjustment to the
post-crisis world.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that timely and appropriate policy response and a recovery of exports
helped lift the economy from the recession. Economic recovery is likely to be moderate and
fragile, reflecting its reliance on export demand and risks from continuing financial sector
problems.
Against this background, Directors noted that the authorities face the challenge of sustaining
recovery while preparing to exit, as part of an international coordinated strategy, from the
extraordinary measures introduced during the crisis. Directors agreed that over time fiscal policy
will have to transition from support to credible consolidation. In the financial sector, repair and
restructuring of balance sheets must continue, but it is now also necessary to make more
permanent improvements to the framework of institutions designed to safeguard financial
stability and manage financial crisis in concert with ongoing EU initiatives. Special labor market
policies introduced to maintain employment during the crisis will need to be phased out and
structural reforms undertaken to raise longer-term growth and domestic demand. A few
Directors noted that designing structural policies to raise domestic demand will not be easy.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ fiscal strategy that combines short-run support for the
economy with a firm commitment to fiscal consolidation in the medium term. They supported the
continued fiscal stimulus in the 2010 budget in light of the still fragile recovery. Directors saw a
need to start fiscal consolidation once the recovery becomes self sustaining, which is projected
for 2011. Turning to the medium term, they agreed that meeting the national and European

3
fiscal goals would help Germany prepare for the challenges of its aging population and anchor
the fiscal policy consolidation in the euro area. Directors stressed that a credible consolidation
plan with strong measures, focused on expenditures, will be needed to reach the medium-term
targets. In this context, any tax cut in 2011 should be accompanied by compensating budgetary
measures. They generally welcomed the authorities’ decision to establish a new fiscal
constitutional rule that imposes limits on the government’s structural deficit.
Directors called for continued financial sector restructuring and welcomed plans to overhaul the
financial stability framework. While banking sector health has improved, vulnerabilities persist.
They considered that strengthening capital buffers should be a priority for most banks. Directors
noted that the larger public banks (the Landesbanken) will require additional restructuring and
major consolidation to enhance financial stability and reduce fiscal support for this sector. They
also welcomed the authorities’ intention to make the Bundesbank the sole prudential bank
supervisor, stressing the need to ensure accountability and operational independence. Directors
commended the efforts to install a strong and effective regime for bank resolution building on
the temporary measures introduced during the crisis. At the same time, they pointed out the
advantages of strengthening and unifying Germany’s fragmented deposit protection scheme in
light of evolving EU initiatives. Directors noted the authorities’ commitment to undertake a
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to adjust labor market policies to the pace of the
recovery and called for additional structural reforms to help Germany’s adjustment to the postcrisis world. Simultaneous measures to increase labor market flexibility and reduce obstacles to
product and service market development would enhance efficiency and foster domestic
demand. Directors noted that strengthening domestic sources of growth will help cushion the
German economy against external shocks as well as benefit the euro area countries and the
global economy by reducing trade and payments imbalances.

Statement by Klaus Stein, Executive Director for Germany
March 29, 2010
I would like to thank the staff for a well written and balanced report and to express my
authorities’ appreciation for focused and open discussions during the consultation.
My authorities broadly share the staff’s assessment of the current economic situation and the
prospects of the German economy. Because of the strong links to the world economy,
Germany was hit particularly hard by the global financial and economic crises. Germany’s
gross domestic product fell by five percent in real terms in 2009, the sharpest drop since the
founding of the Federal Republic. Both strong domestic policy support and recovering global
demand have positively affected the German economy; a moderate recovery is underway. In
January, the federal government revised its projection of real gross domestic product growth
from 1.2 percent to 1.4 percent in 2010, slightly higher than the staff’s projection.
With the changing economic situation, policy demands are changing, too. To ensure that
crisis-related state interventions and support measures do not throttle individual initiative and
forces for innovation, the German authorities will focus on a consistent exit strategy. The
right timing and design of exit strategies in fiscal policy, monetary policy and the financial
sector is important for the sustainability of the recovery and will help build positive
expectations in the markets. Most government measures to stabilize the financial system and
to support companies and consumers will expire at the end of 2010. My authorities are also
well aware of the importance of international cooperation and advocate an internationally
coordinated strategy for an orderly exiting.
Economic situation
The comprehensive measures undertaken to support the financial system and the
economy have made a marked contribution towards stabilizing the economic situation
and securing the long-term perspectives for growth in Germany. In 2009 the stimulus
measures (inter alia tax relief, car-scrapping program, stabilization of the labor market) were
implemented at the right time, as exports declined very sharply. While both private
consumption (+0.2 percent in real terms) and public consumption (+3.0 percent) have been
stabilizing factors in 2009, in 2010 the stimulus focuses on investment which will lead to an
increase in total domestic demand by 0.6 percent. Moreover, net real wages are expected to
rise. My authorities are very confident that there will be no massive increase in
unemployment as expected in the wake of the severe economic crisis.
Over the last years, the German labor market has become more dynamic, flexible, and
adaptive, and has proven to be remarkably robust during the crisis. Increased firm-level
flexibility to smooth working hours over the cycle, a stronger underlying employment trend,

2
and the very effective government program subsidizing short-time work (Kurzarbeit) played
an important role in containing job losses. However, as unit labor costs have increased
substantially, the scope for keeping the high level of short-time work is limited. The aim of a
currently ongoing debate is to find the right balance between the benefit of short-time work
as a means to stabilize employment and income and the potential negative effects of
hampering necessary structural labor market adjustments.
My authorities agree with staff that the financial and economic crisis will have a
negative impact on potential output growth in the medium term. For the time being,
potential output may only increase at a moderate pace and the current under-utilization of
industrial capacity will probably ease only gradually over time. However, looking ahead, the
recuperation process will be supported by structural reforms. Alongside the immediate
measures that have been taken to boost the economy, implementing structural reforms in
order to expand opportunities for longer-term growth and to strengthen domestic sources of
growth is a priority for my authorities.
Fiscal policy
Germany’s fiscal policy strategy is fully in line with IMF recommendations. Fiscal
support will be maintained in 2010 as the German economy has not reached a self-supporting
and stable growth path yet. The government will implement the fiscal stimulus measures as
planned and as announced internationally. Moreover, my authorities have adopted further
measures which amount to an additional stimulus of around €6 billion or ¼ percent of GDP
in 2010 with the “Economic Growth Acceleration Act” (Wachstumsbeschleunigungsgesetz)
which entered into force January 1st, 2010. Thereby, Germany set additional incentives for
investments and lowered the fiscal burden of families.
Despite the crisis and the necessary fiscal stimulus measures, the overall deficit could be
contained to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2009; only marginally above the requirement of the
European Stability and Growth Pact. For 2010, my authorities project an overall deficit of
around 5.5 percent of GDP. The cost of the automatic stabilizers, the discretionary fiscal
stimulus measures, measures taken to stabilize the financial system, and by no small means
the decline in GDP led to a substantial increase in the ratio of general government debt to
GDP to 73 percent in 2009. The debt to GDP ratio is expected to increase further to 77
percent in 2010 and to reach around 82 percent by 2013.
From 2011 onwards, the focus will be on fiscal consolidation, as called for under the
European Stability and Growth Pact as well as the new national constitutional rule
(Schuldenbremse) to limit the government deficit. My authorities continue to pursue their
medium-term goal of a close-to-balance government budget in structural terms.

3
Given my authorities’ ambitious approach with regard to expenditure cuts, sound
public finances can most likely be reached without further revenue measures.
Nevertheless, should the next tax forecast show a need for revenue measures, tax broadening
would be preferable to higher tax rates. My authorities do not intend to increase VAT rates.
Furthermore, they are of the view that the relatively low unemployment contribution rate has
considerably contributed to mitigating the effects of the current economic crisis on the
German labor market. Therefore, no further increases in the contribution rate are under
consideration at present, apart from the raise of the contribution rate from 2.8 percent to 3
percent already scheduled for January 1st, 2011.
Independent of the consolidation efforts, my authorities see a strong need for growth
enhancing tax policies contributing to an increasing motivation of consumers,
enterprises, and investors. My authorities plan to implement a simpler tax system with
lower tax rates and measures to reduce bureaucracy. Providing relief, particularly to lower
and middle income groups, will support consumption and create incentives to work. The new
tax structure is supposed to enter into force on January 1st, 2011, taking into account both
economic developments including their effects on the perspectives for the public budgets,
and structural savings. This is to create the necessary leeway in line with the budget rules set
out under European and constitutional legislation.
Spillovers
My authorities share the staff’s view that fiscal policy in Germany has a role model
function for other EU countries. Therefore, as stated earlier, my authorities are determined
to adhere to the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact and to the recommendations of
the ECOFIN Council to correct the excessive deficit in order to set an example for much
needed fiscal consolidation in Europe.
Overall, Germany played a significant role in stabilizing the world economy in 2009.
While German exports plummeted in 2009, imports dropped less and contributed to
narrowing Germany’s current account surplus. According to preliminary calculations, in
2009 the German current account surplus decreased by nearly €48 billion or about 2 percent
of GDP compared to 2008. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the German current account
surplus is not the result of policy measures explicitly aimed at promoting export performance
but rather the result of a multitude of private business decisions. Germany’s strong export
orientation stems from the openness of its economy, its long-standing manufacturing
traditions and its competitiveness in global markets.
Nevertheless, my authorities recognize that higher domestic demand would not only
contribute to reduce the current account surplus but would be beneficial for Germany.
However, means to promote domestic demand are rather limited. Wages are not a

4
macroeconomic policy tool in Germany, and income tax cuts beyond the proposed measures
would have a detrimental effect on fiscal consolidation. Having said that, my authorities
support the conclusions of the Eurogroup of March 15th, 2010, regarding intra Euro area
competitiveness and macroeconomic imbalances. As called for in the conclusions, my
authorities stand ready to identify and implement structural reforms that help strengthening
domestic demand.
Financial Sector
Stability in the financial sector has significantly improved during the last year and
systemic risks continue to subside as economic fundamentals recover. Measures as the
establishment of the Sonderfonds Finanzmarktstabilisierung (SoFFin) providing guarantees
and funding for recapitalization of financial institutions have contributed substantially to the
stabilization of the financial sector. However, there are still pressing challenges from the
crisis and reasons to remain cautious. Financial institutions faced and are still facing massive
write-downs. For securitizations, however, the vast majority of potential losses has already
been accounted for. With regard to potential adverse repercussion due to continuing stress in
the real economy and the financial sector, Germany benefits from comparatively moderate
indebtedness of both corporations and households as well as from price stability in the real
estate sector.
For the time being a credit crunch cannot be observed. However, with increasing
numbers of insolvencies in the real economy and rising unemployment rates, further pressure
on banks’ balance sheets could lead to potentially negative consequences for lending. Thus,
since March 2010, businesses facing lending problems are able to turn to a governmentappointed credit mediator who will take action to ensure that creditworthy companies –
particularly small and medium-sized firms – are able to obtain loans. Furthermore, the credit
guarantee program of the “Business Fund Germany” (Wirtschaftsfonds Deutschland)
established in March 2009 is an option for companies to secure access to credit.
The ongoing restructuring process of the Landesbanken is a necessary step and
contributes to stability in this sector. After several Landesbanken received financial aid
from states (Länder) and the SoFFin during the current financial crisis, they will have to
downsize and/or change their business model as required by state aid rules of the European
Union aiming at preventing distortions of competition due to government interventions.
Länder governments are committed to this reform process.
Regulatory and supervisory reforms of the financial sector remain a key priority for my
authorities. Ongoing work in that area is done in cooperation with regional and international
partners with the target to emerge from the current crisis with an enhanced and strengthened

5
framework ensuring that all financial institutions, instruments and markets are subject to
adequate regulation and oversight.
The reform of financial supervision envisages a consolidated banking supervision in the
Bundesbank. My authorities agree with staff that, as under the current regime, the
supervisory body has to be both accountable and operationally independent. Detailed reform
proposals taking into account existing synergies of an integrated financial supervision and the
independency of the Bundesbank will be presented in the summer. The new supervision
structure is scheduled to become effective in spring 2011.
My authorities intend to develop a legal framework for an effective bank resolution
regime which allows for timely action to prevent systemic contagion. The key objectives
of this resolution regime will be to enable early interventions as well as a managed resolution
and an orderly wind-down of systemically-important banks. Such a framework can impose
market discipline and, by providing a mechanism to ensure appropriate financial contribution
of the private sector, protect public funds. This new national framework corresponds with
conclusions on the G20 level and complements recent initiatives by the European
Commission, i.e., the advised proposal for a European Framework for Cross-Border Crisis
Management in the Banking Sector.
The deposit insurance system is a pillar of financial stability in Germany and has
proven its quality during the financial crisis. Despite several ailing banks, none of the
depositors has lost any of its protected deposits during the financial crisis, neither in the
sector of the private banks nor in the sectors of Sparkassen and mutual banks
(Kreditgenossenschaften). In the latter sectors, where the system does not only protect
deposits but also prevents insolvency of banks, no bank has become insolvent in the last five
decades. Since the establishment of the private banking sector, no depositor suffered any loss
of protected deposits in the case of an insolvency of a private bank that was a member of the
German deposit insurance system. In the current crisis, the SoFFin supported only the
voluntary scheme of the association of private banks, not any of the mandatory ones.
Nevertheless, Germany is developing its system and is actively taking part in the current
discussions at EU level to make depositor protection even more efficient.
