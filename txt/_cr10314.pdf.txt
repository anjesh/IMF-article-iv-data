PANAMA
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with Panama
Approved by Miguel A. Savastano and Jan Kees Martijn
June 25, 2010
Context and recent developments. Panama weathered the global financial crisis well.
While output growth slowed substantially in 2009, it remained positive and above the
region’s average. The banking system remained on a strong footing. The economy is
rebounding strongly, supported by more favorable external conditions, and a large
increase in public investment, notably from the Canal expansion project. Panama’s
credit rating was raised to investment grade in early 2010.

•

•

Key policy recommendations:
o A modest withdrawal of fiscal stimulus in 2010 would be broadly appropriate.
Additional stimulus is not essential given the strength of the economic recovery.
o Adherence to the fiscal consolidation targets envisaged for the medium term is
important. A rapid decline in public debt would create substantial additional room
for countercyclical fiscal policy.
o The government’s medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) can be strengthened. In
particular, the MTFF could spell out more fully the underlying macroeconomic
framework and targets for key components of the nonfinancial public sector.
o Plans to broaden the financial system’s regulatory perimeter are welcomed.
Bringing all deposit-taking institutions under the supervision of the
Superintendency of Banks would help limit risks to the financial system.
o The financial safety net can be strengthened. A formal safety net would further
bolster financial stability and reduce costs from excessive bank liquidity holdings.

•

Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly concurred with the staff’s
recommendations on fiscal policy and the financial sector. They expressed concern,
however, that a formal safety net would create moral hazard.

•

Mission: The 2010 Article IV consultation discussions were held during May 17–27.
The staff team comprised Lisandro Abrego (head), Juliana Araujo, Mario Dehesa,
Kristin Magnusson Bernard (all WHD), and Torsten Wezel (MCM). The mission met
with Minister of Finance, Alberto Vallarino; Superintendent of Banks, Alberto
Diamond; other senior officials; and private sector representatives.

I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Panama faced the global financial crisis of 2008 from a strong position. Fiscal
consolidation and rapid economic growth during 2004–08 helped reduce public debt below 40
percent of GDP. Supported by tax and social security reforms, the fiscal policy framework was
strengthened and became more resilient. Banks’ loan portfolio had expanded only moderately during
the high-growth years, and the system was on a strong footing and subject to a sound regulatory
framework. In addition, when the global crisis struck, the ambitious seven-year Canal expansion
project was already underway, providing timely support to economic activity.
2.
Economic growth slowed significantly in 2009, but remained positive and above the
region’s average. Real GDP growth fell from
20
10¾ percent in 2008 to 2½ percent in 2009, driven by 18 Real GDP Growth

higher oil and food prices, inflation has risen in
recent months, but remains low (about 3 percent in
May, y/y).
3.
The external current account improved markedly. Official estimates indicate that the current
account was close to zero in 2009 (after posting a deficit of 11½ percent in 2008), reflecting lower oil
prices and very strong export receipts from the Colon Free Zone (CFZ). 1 Trade outside the CFZ,
however, declined significantly, as in the rest of the region. Foreign direct investment flows also fell,
but remained high by historical standards and compared to the rest of the region; portfolio inflows to
the banking sector also declined. Both trade and private capital flows began to rebound in late 2009.
4.
Panama’s large banking system weathered the global financial crisis well, reflecting a
prudent stance and strong supervision. Private domestic and foreign banks were impacted
somewhat differently by the crisis (Box 1). However, financial soundness indicators remained solid
in both groups, with low NPL ratios (1.4 percent overall in March 2010) and strong capital levels
(Figure 3). As in the rest of the region, bank profits declined, but have started to recover. Recent
1

Official estimates show that the value of net exports from the CFZ rose by 8 percentage points of GDP in 2009. Most of
the increase is accounted for by a temporary surge in exports of medical products, related mainly to the A/H1N1 flu
pandemic.

Box 1. Per for mance of Domestic vs. For eign Banks Dur ing the Cr isis
While all banks in Panama were affected by the global financial crisis, private domestic and foreign
banks fared differently on several counts. Loan quality and profitability of foreign banks were
affected more severely than those of their domestic competitors. The NPL ratio declined in both
groups of banks, aided by higher-than-usual write-offs. In general, foreign banks started recognizing
delinquencies earlier than domestic banks, with their ratio of provisioning to loans peaking in 2008.
Lower income from operations, mostly due to the weakness in loan origination, led to a drop in the
return on assets of foreign banks in 2009, which now matches the lower but steady return of domestic
banks.

In late 2008, many foreign banks adopted a more cautious approach to lending. Credit by foreign
banks declined by 2 percent in 2009, while credit by private domestic banks rose by a similar
magnitude. The credit contraction at foreign banks seems to also reflect lower external funding,
notably from reduced credit lines. By contrast, domestic banks easily compensated the loss of external
funding through continued high access to domestic sources.
Liquidity increased in both groups during the crisis. Foreign banks, however, started to increase their
liquidity holdings earlier than domestic banks.

8
turmoil in European sovereign debt markets has not had any discernible impact on the banking
system, in line with the relatively weak financial linkages with that region. Pro-active bank
supervision contributed to maintaining the system on a strong footing. The Superintendency of Banks
(SBP) stepped up its monitoring activities during the crisis and, since 2008, strongly and successfully
encouraged banks to tighten lending standards in sectors that had been growing very strongly. These
efforts were supplemented, in early 2009, by the creation of the financial stimulus program (FSP),
aimed at providing resources to banks for on-lending to the private sector. In the event, however,
banks made little use of those resources, mainly because their liquidity remained ample and the cost
of FSP resources was relatively high.
5.
Growth of bank credit decelerated significantly in 2009, but has begun to pick up. The
slowdown reflected both weaker domestic demand and tighter lending standards, and was more
pronounced for foreign banks (Box 1). Deposit growth remained solid, contributing to the buildup of
very high levels of liquidity. Growth of bank lending began to recover in the first quarter of 2010,
although at a gradual pace. The lax monetary conditions in the U. S. had some effect on Panama’s
monetary conditions—although with a lag—helping support economic activity during the global
crisis (Box 2).
6.
Fiscal policy helped support domestic demand
(Figure 4). The previous government took advantage of
Panama’s relatively strong fiscal position, and, with
support from congress and the incoming administration, 2
raised the deficit ceiling in the social and fiscal
responsibility law (SFRL) to maintain an expansionary
fiscal stance during 2009. 3 In the event, the overall fiscal
deficit was substantially below the modified SFRL ceiling,
but the fiscal stimulus (in cyclically-adjusted terms and
excluding the Panama Canal Authority) was in the order of
¾ percentage points of GDP.

In its first year in office, the new government has put in place two substantive tax reforms
(Box 3). The reforms seek to raise tax revenue collections and improve the efficiency of the tax
system, with the additional revenue to be used to finance higher capital spending. The first reform,
approved in September 2009, broadened the tax base and raised dividend taxation, and is expected to
yield 1¼ percent of GDP in revenue. The second reform, passed last March, raised the value-added
tax, lowered personal and corporate income tax rates, and eliminated loopholes; altogether, the
2

Presidential elections were held in May 2009 and President Martinelli (the candidate from the opposition) took office in
July.

3

Specifically, in June 2009 the SFRL deficit ceiling was raised from 1 percent of GDP to 2½ percent of GDP during
times of global and domestic recessions. The modification allows a gradual return to the original deficit ceiling of
1 percent of GDP after four years.

Box 2. Monetary Conditions in Panama During the Global Crisis
As a fully-dollarized economy, Panama cannot conduct an independent monetary policy. However, in
principle, changes in monetary conditions in the U.S. should be transmitted to Panama and affect the
domestic economy. Depending on the degree of business-cycle synchronization between the two
economies, the monetary stance imported by Panama from the U.S. may or may not be appropriate for
its economy.

One possible explanation for the asymmetry is
that the lack of a lender of last resort induced
Panamanian banks to adopt relatively more conservative lending standards during the financial crisis.
Sustained relatively high deposit rates also likely limited the scope for decreasing lending rates.

Given lags in real business cycles and in the transmission of interest rate changes, monetary
conditions in Panama were broadly appropriate during the global crisis. To gauge the appropriateness

The real interest rate is arguably the more important variable for economic activity. However, the focus is here on nominal rates, since
the relationship between these across countries is independent of inflation. The latter affected the two economies differently in recent
years, because of the impact of commodity price inflation.

Box 3. Recent Tax Reform
In its first year in office, the government of President Martinelli has enacted two far-reaching tax
reforms. With these reforms, Panama’s tax system has increased its reliance on indirect taxes, reduced
income tax rates while broadening the tax base, improved dividend taxation, and is modernizing its tax
administration. The reforms are expected to increase government revenue by 2¼ percent of GDP on a
permanent basis.
The first tax reform, approved in September 2009,
broadened the tax base, changed tax rates on specific
sectors, increased license fees and enhanced tax
administration. The changes made the Colón Free Zone,
casinos, maritime transportation, and oil trade subject to
a more comprehensive corporate and dividend taxation
treatment, while taxing profits from some foreign
operations. In addition, the reform levied taxes on real
estate transactions—including capital gains on the sale of
property—and brought bank commissions under VAT
coverage.

financial sector. The minimum alternative tax rate was also lowered while the standard rate of the VAT
was increased from 5 percent to 7 percent. Operational and financial autonomy was granted to the tax
administration unit, and a specialized tax court was created.
Income tax rates in Panama are now below international levels. The PIT rate is slightly below the
regional average and substantially lower than the OECD average. The top CIT rate is also somewhat
lower than the regional average and broadly similar to the OECD average.

changes are expected to increase revenue by 1 percent of GDP.

Panama’s sovereign credit rating was raised to investment grade. Earlier this year, the three
main credit-rating agencies raised Panama’s sovereign debt classification by one notch to BBB-,
citing the strengthening of the public finances, prospects for further declines in public debt, and a
very favorable growth outlook.
9.
The authorities have made substantial progress towards Panama’s removal from the
OECD grey list of tax havens. In the last year, the government has concluded negotiations for 9 of
the 12 double taxation treaties required for removal from the grey list. The authorities expect to
complete the remaining agreements before end-2010, and adopt the changes to domestic legislation
needed to implement them.
II. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
Economic growth is expected to pick up rapidly: Staff projects real GDP growth of
4.8 percent in 2010, supported by an improved global environment and a large increase in public
investment, notably from the Canal expansion project. Growth is projected to rise to 6½ percent by
2012, as the Canal expansion works peak and private demand recovers fully. The recent upgrade to
investment grade is expected to have favorable effects on confidence and private investment. 4 Output
growth is then expected to hover around 6 percent, broadly in line with current potential growth
estimates by staff (estimates that are somewhat lower than those prior to the global crisis (Box 4)).
Completion of the expansion of the Canal in 2014 is expected to have a permanent positive effect on
potential growth.

from 3¾ percent per year during 1996–2002 to about 7½ per year in recent years.
Statistical tests identify 2003 as a structural break point in the GDP time series. The recent
acceleration of potential growth reflects to a great extent a large increase (6 percentage points of GDP
during 2003-08) in domestic investment, with strong contributions from public and foreign direct
investment. Productivity growth is also estimated to have risen, although more modestly. At the
sectoral level, the higher growth appears to have been driven by the outwardly-oriented services sector
(the Canal and various activities linked to it), which benefited greatly from the strong surge in global
growth and trade during 2003–07.
Output gap measures derived from these
estimates suggest that the excess demand
pressures of 2008 abated in 2009. The
estimated output gap reached 3½ percent of
potential GDP in 2008, but disappeared in
early 2009 as the effects of the global crisis
reached Panama. For 2009 as a whole, the
output gap was about –1 percent of GDP.

an adverse effect on Panama’s potential
growth. While there is considerable
uncertainty about magnitudes, most baseline scenarios assume global potential growth to be lower in
the coming years. Estimates from a multivariate analysis suggest that a fall in global growth of
1 percentage point would tend to decrease Panama’s growth by a similar magnitude.
_____

1
The univariate techniques used to calculate permanent output were: (i) piece-wise linear de-trending; (ii) filters that isolate high-frequency
from low-frequency components (HP-filter, the Baxter and King filter, and the Christiano and Fitzgerald filter); and (iii) the Beveridge and
Nelson decomposition. These techniques were applied to quarterly data for 1996-2009, and to staff projections for 2010–11 to correct for
end-of-period bias.

14
11.
The external current account is projected to weaken, while inflation would remain
subdued. The current account deficit is projected to peak at 8½ percent of GDP in 2012 with the
Canal works. Thereafter, as the project winds down and the expanded Canal becomes operational, the
deficit is expected to decline significantly. With a very large proportion of spending from the project
falling on imports, domestic demand pressures are expected to remain contained. Inflation is
projected to rise temporarily in 2010—in line with global inflation and higher oil prices—but is
expected to stabilize thereafter at 2½ percent per year.
12.
The fiscal deficit in 2010 is projected to remain well below the SFRL ceiling. The deficit
target in the 2010 budget (1.9 percent of GDP, excluding the Panama Canal Authority) is likely to be
overperformed by a significant margin. Revenues are projected to grow strongly following the recent
tax reforms, while the ambitious capital
spending plans contained in the budget are not
likely to be completed due to implementation
constraints. Staff projects an overall fiscal
deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP for 2010, broadly
unchanged from 2009. 5 For 2011, the
authorities’ newly-adopted medium-term fiscal
framework (MTFF) envisages an overall deficit
of 1¼ percent of GDP, consistent with higher
capital spending. Fiscal consolidation is
expected to continue over the medium term at a
faster pace than contemplated in the SFRL,
resulting in a decline of public debt below
30 percent of GDP by 2015.
13.
Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced. Downside risks to growth stem from a less
favorable external environment or a more sluggish recovery of credit. Domestic growth is
particularly sensitive to changes in global economic conditions. 6 Upside risks arise from stronger
private (domestic and foreign) investment, on account of positive spillovers from higher public
expenditure on infrastructure, as well as from the favorable effects of the upgrade in the sovereign
credit rating. On the fiscal side, revenue could turn out higher than projected, given ongoing efforts to
strengthen tax administration.

5

The SFRL deficit ceiling for 2010 is 2½ percent of GDP. The 2009 SFRL reform contained a carry-over provision
stating that if the fiscal outturn is below the deficit ceiling in the first year of the recession, the ceiling for the following
year may increase by up to 0.5 percent of GDP.

6

Staff’s empirical analysis finds a strong relationship between U.S. and domestic growth, and a more moderate effect on
growth from changes in domestic credit (see Chapter 2 of the Selected Issues Paper).

15
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy
14.
There was agreement that a modest withdrawal of fiscal stimulus in 2010 was appropriate.
Staff projects a slight strengthening of the primary balance in cyclically-adjusted terms in 2010 (Text
Table 1). Although there is still scope for a small positive impulse, given the negative output gap and
good access to financing, implementation constraints to investment are likely to be binding. Given
the strength of the recovery, it was agreed that the additional impulse was not essential and the
projected fiscal stance was broadly appropriate. There was also agreement that maintaining a low
overall deficit would help further strengthen fiscal credibility.
15.
Staff supported the authorities’ recent tax reforms. The reforms bolster the credibility of
Panama’s fiscal framework, will allow higher levels of capital spending, and are economically sound,
including by shifting from income to consumption taxation. Staff supported the authorities’ ongoing
efforts to strengthen tax administration, and encouraged them to take similar steps in the area of
customs. The authorities expressed an interest in receiving Fund technical assistance in both areas.

The fiscal consolidation envisaged over the
medium term is ambitious but feasible. The decline
in public debt targeted in the MTFF would provide
substantial additional scope for adopting a
countercyclical fiscal stance. The staff noted that,
given assumptions on revenue growth and economic
growth, the MTFF targets seemed conservative. To
bolster fiscal credibility further, staff advised the
authorities to adhere to the MTFF targets and
allocate any overperformance to a faster reduction of
public debt.

17.
Staff encouraged the authorities to strengthen their MTFF. In particular, it recommended
that the MTFF spells out in more detail the underlying macroeconomic framework and incorporates
explicitly the key components of the nonfinancial public sector, including the social security system.

16
The MTFF would also benefit from quantification and discussion of tax expenditures and a more
thorough discussion of contingent liabilities. The authorities noted that they are working on
enhancing the framework in some of these aspects, including by quantifying tax expenditures more
comprehensively and including them in budget documents.
18.
Staff welcomed the government’s plans to increase infrastructure investment and restrain
current spending. The authorities expect that higher public investment will help boost private-sector
led growth. The mission noted the importance of phasing in carefully the additional spending planned
for the outer years of the MTFF to ensure consistency with SFRL requirements, avoid excessive
demand pressures, and ensure an efficient execution. Staff supported the authorities’ ongoing efforts
to put in place a legal framework for public-private partnerships to help support their investment
program.
B. Financial Sector
19.
It was agreed that Panama’s banking system showed strong resilience during the global
financial crisis. The on-shore and off-shore segments of the system managed to preserve strong
financial soundness indicators. In the case of the on-shore segment, a strong regulatory framework
and banks’ own conservative practices were important factors supporting such resilience. Looking
ahead, stress tests conducted by the mission showed that capital levels in the banking system would
remain adequate under sizeable shocks to economic activity and thus asset quality.
20.
Staff noted that the slowdown in the construction sector had not had a significant impact
on banks’ balance sheets. Following a period of rapid expansion, the construction sector slowed
down sharply in 2009 and the prices of some properties fell. The effects on banks’ balance sheets
were, however, negligible. Banks’ decision to effectively limit loan-to-value ratios and set high presale requirements played a key role in containing exposure to the sector and in protecting their
balance sheets. It was agreed, however, that remaining exposure to the sector warrants close
monitoring.
21.
The mission encouraged the authorities to move forward with plans for the gradual
introduction of risk-based supervision. Staff and the authorities agreed that this step would help
further enhance bank monitoring. The mission noted that risk-based supervision would be suitable for
Panama, given the special features of its banking sector (e.g., substantial banks’ cross-border
linkages, credit concentration, and relatively high indebtedness of the private sector). The authorities
have begun taking some preparatory steps, including improved auditing.
22.
Staff supported plans to broaden the financial sector regulation perimeter. Some nonbank
deposit-taking institutions (e. g., cooperatives) are currently not regulated by the Superintendency of
Banks (SBP). Although the sector is small relative to the banking system and does not pose systemic
risk, it was agreed that bringing all deposit-taking institutions under the umbrella of the SBP was a
good practice which would limit risks going forward. The mission also welcomed the authorities’
preparations to introduce Basel II regulatory requirements, as well as their plans to strengthen the

17
regulatory framework for pensions and the insurance sector and to enhance the governance structure
of the securities commission.
23.
The authorities concurred with the staff recommendation to explore the possibility of
establishing a formal safety net. There was agreement that the current arrangement under which
banks self-insure against shocks by holding liquid assets had worked well, but had non-negligible
costs. The authorities expressed concern, however, that a formal safety net would create moral
hazard. Staff argued that a formal safety net could be designed to contain moral hazard while
reducing individual bank liquidity needs, with positive effects on the supply of credit and interest
rates. Staff also suggested exploring the possibility of establishing a limited insurance scheme for
deposits at on-shore banks, financed with risk-based bank contributions. 7 The scheme could cover a
small fraction of total deposits, but nonetheless insure the vast majority of the system’s accounts. The
authorities also indicated that they would like to explore possible arrangements for emergency
liquidity support. They expressed interest in receiving Fund technical assistance in these areas.
C. External Sector
24.
The real exchange rate is in line with fundamentals (Box 5). Panama’s real effective
exchange rate remained broadly unchanged in 2009, with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar offset
by lower domestic inflation. The mission’s estimates for 2009—which are based on a countryspecific model of the equilibrium exchange rate and the macro-balance approach—point to a very
small (less than 5 percent) overvaluation of Panama’s real exchange rate.
25.
Efforts to furthe strengthen trade links with the rest of the world have continued. In May
2010, Panama signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with Canada and the European Union, while
negotiations on a deal with Colombia are ongoing. The agreement with the U. S. (concluded in mid2007), however, is awaiting approval by the U. S. Congress. The authorities expect that the
implementation of FTAs will provide solid support to economic growth over the medium term by
improving access to key markets and strengthening the competitiveness of the domestic economy.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Supported by strong fundamentals, Panama weathered the global financial crisis of 2008
well. Although growth slowed down significantly in 2009, it remained positive and well above the
region’s average. A rapid recovery is expected, with growth projected to rise to 5–6 percent in 201011. The banking system showed strong resilience to the crisis and remains on a strong footing, with
very low NPLs and high levels of capitalization. Effective supervision and prudent lending behavior
were instrumental in limiting exposure to the sectors most affected by the slowdown.

7

The deposit insurance scheme adopted by Hong Kong in the mid-1990s contained similar features.

18

Box 5. Exchange Rate Assessment
Panama’s real effective exchange rate depreciated in the years leading up to the financial crisis,
driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar. This trend was reverted slightly in 2009, mirroring again
movements in the U.S. dollar, which offset the large decline in domestic inflation that took place in
Panama.

between the current account balance
projected over the medium term at prevailing exchange rates and an estimated current account balance
norm. With a norm of -5 percent of GDP, this approach points to an overvaluation of about 3 percent
during 2009.

_____
1

The estimates are based on a vector error correction (VEC) model using annual data for 1980–2009. The fundamentals comprise

productivity differentials, terms of trade, trade openness, net foreign liabilities, and the current account balance.

27.
Fiscal policy helped contain the impact of the adverse external conditions. A relatively
strong fiscal position allowed Panama to use fiscal policy to mitigate the effects of lower external
demand in 2009. Prudent fiscal management and the economy’s momentum, however, did not make
it necessary to fully use the scope provided by the modified SFRL to support activity. The strong
growth prospects for 2010 make it appropriate to start withdrawing fiscal stimulus.
28.
The fiscal consolidation envisaged in the government’s medium-term framework is
appropriately ambitious. The significant decline in the public-debt ratio contemplated in the
government’s MTFF would create substantial additional space for using fiscal policy to offset the
impact of exogenous shocks, which takes on added importance in Panama given its monetary regime.
Staff encourages the authorities to adhere to the MTFF targets and use any overperformance to
reduce public debt faster.
29.
Staff welcomes the sound tax reforms adopted in the last year. The reforms are expected to
increase revenues significantly and bolster the credibility of the fiscal framework. By shifting

19
taxation from income to consumption and reducing microeconomic distortions, the reforms would
also help support long-run economic growth. Staff considers it important to continue moving forward
with tax administration reforms, and broaden them to include customs. The Fund stands ready to
provide technical assistance to support these efforts.
30.
Plans to broaden the financial sector regulation perimeter and introduce riskbased supervision are welcomed. Nonbank deposit-taking institutions currently not regulated by the
SBP should be brought under its umbrella. Staff considers that risk-based supervision would be
advantageous for Panama, and help further strengthening bank monitoring. The authorities’
preparations to introduce Basel II regulatory requirements and plans to strengthen the regulatory
framework for pensions and the insurance sector are also welcomed.
31.
There is scope to strengthen the financial safety net. Bank self-insurance against shocks has
worked well thus far, but it has risks and costs. Staff is of the view that a formal safety net would
lower risks and reduce the need for individual banks to maintain high liquid balances, which are
economically costly. The authorities’ interest in exploring the possibility of establishing
arrangements for emergency liquidity support and a deposit insurance system are welcomed. The
Fund stands ready to provide technical assistance in these areas.
32.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 12-month cycle.

1/ Nonfinancial public sector, includes ACP.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

precautionary SBA expired on March 29, 2002. The last Article IV consultation was completed by
the Executive Board on June 1, 2009. Panama has received TA from the Fund in recent years,
including on national accounts statistics in March 2009. The last safeguards assessment was
completed on July 12, 2001, and concluded that the National Bank of Panama’s external-audit
mechanism was adequate at the time. There is no resident representative.
Relations with the World Bank
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2008–10 was approved in
October 2007 and consists of a mix of analytical and advisory assistance, development policy loans,
and investment operations. A new CPS for FY 2011–14 is being prepared and is expected to be
discussed by the Board later this year.
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank
For 2010, the Bank is working on four loans in the areas of urban transportation (US$600 million), road
infrastructure (US$70 million), water and sanitation (US$40 million), and education (US$30 million).
The IDB is expected to finish the country strategy for the 2010–14 period later this year.

Statistical Issues
Panama’s economic statistics and data provisions have some shortcomings, but are broadly adequate
for surveillance.

Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Panama (NBP)
was subject to the transitional procedures with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement,
which was approved on June 30, 2000, and expired on March 29, 2002. The
transitional procedures required a review of the NBP’s external audit mechanism
only. The assessment was completed on July 12, 2001 and concluded that NBP’s
external audit mechanism was at the time adequate, as reported in SM/02/160,
May 22, 2002.
B. Nonfinancial Relations

VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Panama uses the U.S. dollar as the primary means of payment in the local economy.
Its national currency (balboa) is issued in the form of coins only and serves as a unit
of account. The exchange rate of the balboa is fixed at B 1 per U.S. dollar. Panama
has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, and maintains an
exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions.

ANNEX II—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
1.
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2008–10 was approved in
October 2007 and consists of a mix of analytical and advisory assistance, development policy
loans, and investment operations. The CPS has aimed to provide selective, demand-driven
assistance to help Panama achieve its growth and poverty and inequality reduction goals. A new
CPS for FY 2011–14 is being prepared for the fall of 2010.
2.
Since the CPS became effective, about US$332.3 million has been disbursed, divided
into three Development Policy Loans (DPLs), seven new poverty-focused investment projects,
and one Technical Assistance (TA) loan. The current portfolio consists of five IBRD projects
and a GEF donation under implementation, totaling US$204.5 million, of which
US$116.4 million is undisbursed. The Protecting the Poor under Global Uncertainty DPL
(US$80 million) was approved in the spring of 2009 to support country efforts to mitigate the
impact of economic shocks on the poor through improved targeting and coverage of social sector
programs. The existing project portfolio consists of the Social Protection Project, the Health
Equity and Performance Improvement Project, the Water and Sanitation Project, the Land
Administration Project, the Rural Productivity Project, and the Global Environment Facility
Rural Productivity Project.
3.
The Bank is also providing analytical and technical assistance to Panama. A set of Policy
Notes was prepared to support the government transition with information on key development
challenges as well as policies and programs to confront them. Analytical assistance was also
provided on poverty measurement and enhancing government procurement and financial
management systems.
4.
The staffs of the World Bank and the IMF are working in close collaboration, including
frequent exchange of data and information and coordination of policy advice.

ANNEX IV—STATISTICAL ISSUES
3.
Progress has been achieved in improving the accuracy, timeliness, and publication of
economic statistics. Data provided to the Fund are generally adequate for surveillance.
However, there is a need to address methodological weaknesses in foreign trade data and to
improve the consistency between the national accounts and the external sector accounts.
Panama has participated in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
December 2000. However, the metadata and plans for improving the statistical system that
are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) need updating.
Real Sector
4.
National accounts data are released with a lag of approximately three months. The
index of monthly economic activity is released with a lag of up to two months. Although the
timeliness of real sector data provision has improved, the data are often subject to substantial
revisions. The World Bank is supporting a project for changing the base year of the national
accounts to 2007, which is scheduled to start in the second half of 2010.
5.
A population census was conducted in May 2010 and preliminary results are expected
to be published in the last quarter of 2010.
6.
The IMF national accounts technical assistance mission conducted in March 2009
noted the limited coverage of financial activity as well as the overestimation of the deflator
used to calculate the financial services output at constant prices. The revised GDP estimates
of financial activity, and the related overall GDP revision, was published in October 2009.
7.
A new Household Income and Expenditure Survey was conducted during 2007–08,
and the National Institute of Statistics and Census is in the process of updating the base,
basket, and weights of the CPI.
Government Finances
8.
The Ministry of Finance compiles budget execution data for the central government
and data on nonfinancial public sector operations (central government, public enterprises,
and agencies) on a cash basis. Monthly and quarterly data have been reported up to
December 2009 for the budgetary central government operations (www.mef.gob.pa).
9.
Further efforts are needed to improve the quality of fiscal data. Apart from timeliness,
data consistency in terms of transfers between public sector units should be improved; and
the coverage of the public enterprises should be made universal. Since September 2004, the
operational balance of the Panama Canal Authority (PCA) was excluded from the official
definition of the nonfinancial public sector used for fiscal policy purposes. Information on
the Panama Canal Authority (PCA) is only available in the Annual Report posted on its

8

website (www.pancanal.com) on a fiscal year basis. There is a need to ensure a consistent
and timely flow of PCA statistics on a calendar year basis. The authorities have received
technical assistance from STA to implement the government Finance Statistics Manual 2001
(GFSM 2001) and a FAD fiscal ROSC mission took place in October 2005. In February 2004
a STA mission undertook a comprehensive review of the coverage and methodology of fiscal
data. The authorities are preparing to migrate to the GFSM 2001 and are upgrading their
technological platform to process data and ensure data consistency between the treasury and
the government ministries.
Monetary Accounts
10.
Panama has been publishing financial sector data based on the new standardized
report forms (SRFs) for monetary statistics in the IFS Supplement since March 2007 and
participates in a regional project for harmonizing monetary and financial statistics in Central
America and the Dominican Republic. The aim is to facilitate cross-country comparison and
regional analysis. Provision of monthly data by the two public financial institutions, the
National Bank of Panama and the Savings Bank (Caja de Ahorros), is regular and prompt.
Monthly data on the operations of the domestic and international commercial and savings
banks is prepared by the Superintendency of Banks, and posted on its website
(www.superbancos.gob.pa) and reported to STA with a lag of one to two months. The stateowned development banks, the Agricultural Development Bank, and the Mortgage Bank are
not regulated by the Superintendency of Banks and no data is reported to the Fund.
Balance of Payments
11.
Weaknesses in foreign trade flows data, particularly those involving the Colon Free
Zone need to be addressed. Substantial changes in the composition of trade flows over the
last decade render the current methodology to estimate volume indices obsolete. Quarterly
data is available with a delay of about one quarter, and is subject to revisions thereafter.
Revised estimates in key trade and investment data may result in substantial revisions of the
current account of the balance of payments. These revisions may reflect improvements in
coverage, but they also suggest that there is room for improvement in quality control
procedures. Quarterly International Investment Position (IIP) data have been compiled
since 2002, and annual data are available since 1998. The most recent balance of payments
and IIP data pertain to December 2009.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 3, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Panama
On July 12, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Panama. 1
Background
Sound public finances and a strong banking system allowed Panama to face the global
financial crisis of 2008 from a strong position. While GDP growth slowed in 2009, it
remained positive at 2.5 percent and continued to surpass the region’s average. The
unwinding of global supply shocks and weaker domestic demand led to a decline in
inflation to about 2 percent. Inflation has risen somewhat in 2010, but remains low at
about 3 percent (year over year) in May. The external current account improved
markedly and was in balance, reflecting lower oil prices and very strong export growth
from the Colon Free Zone. The overall fiscal deficit (excluding the Panama Canal
Authority, PCA) was 1 percent of GDP in 2009, well below the deficit ceiling in the social
and fiscal responsibility law (SFRL) for that year (2.5 percent of GDP).
The banking system remains on a strong footing, helped by effective supervision and a
prudent stance by banks. Bank financial soundness indicators are solid, with high levels
of capitalization and low non-performing loan rates. Growth of bank credit to the private
sector decelerated in 2009, owing to tighter lending standards and weaker private
demand. Credit growth, however, started to recover in the first quarter of 2010.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

1

2

The new government has put in place two substantive tax reforms since taking office in
July 2009. The reforms, which were approved in September 2009 and March 2010,
seek to increase revenues to finance higher capital spending, while improving the
efficiency of the tax system. Among other measures, they include broadening of the tax
base, changes to dividend taxation, an increase in the value-added tax, lower personal
and corporate income tax rates, and elimination of loopholes. The changes are
expected to increase revenue by 2.25 percent of GDP on a permanent basis.
Panama’s credit rating was raised to investment grade in early 2010. The upgrade
reflected the strengthening of the public finances in recent years, good prospects for
further declines in public debt, and a very favorable growth outlook.
GDP growth is projected to pick up to 4.8 percent in 2010, supported by an improved
world economy, a large increase in public investment, notably from the Canal expansion
project, and a recovery of private demand. Inflation is expected to rise temporarily this
year, driven by global trends and higher oil prices, but would remain low. The overall
fiscal deficit is projected at 0.9 percent of GDP in 2010, well below the SFRL ceiling (2.5
percent of GDP) and the target envisaged in the budget (1.9 percent of GDP).
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their sound policies and appropriate
policy response to the global financial crisis, which had helped mitigate the effect of the
crisis on the economy and the financial sector. The timely implementation of policy
measures, particularly in the fiscal area, contributed to the rapid recovery in economic
activity and low unemployment. Directors also welcomed the improvement in Panama’s
sovereign credit rating to investment grade. They stressed that maintenance of sound
policies would provide the basis for continued strong economic growth and further
reduction in poverty.
Directors agreed that, in light of the strength of the economic recovery, some withdrawal
of fiscal stimulus in 2010 would be appropriate. They welcomed the adoption of a
medium-term fiscal framework and the government’s ambitious plans for fiscal
consolidation over the medium term. Directors noted that the targeted decline in public
debt would create additional room for using fiscal policy as a countercyclical tool. They
commended the authorities for the adoption of two comprehensive tax reforms during
the past year, which would bolster the credibility of the fiscal framework. Directors also
supported the authorities’ ongoing efforts to strengthen tax administration, and
encouraged similar steps in the area of customs.
Directors welcomed the resilience of the banking system to the global financial crisis. To
further bolster banking system stability and reduce costs to the economy from high
liquidity holdings by banks, they welcomed work toward the establishment of a formal

3
safety net, while keeping in mind moral hazard concerns. Directors supported the
authorities’ plans to introduce risk-based supervision and adopt Basel II regulatory
requirements. They also concurred with the initiative to broaden the financial regulation
perimeter by bringing nonbank deposit-taking institutions under the umbrella of the
Superintendency of Banks.
Directors welcomed the progress made toward removal from the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) gray list of tax havens. They
encouraged the completion of remaining agreements and adoption of necessary legal
changes.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Paulo Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Panama
and Alfredo Maciá, Advisor
July 12, 2010

1.
On behalf of the Panamanian authorities, we thank Mr. Abrego and his team for
the constructive and candid dialogue. We welcome the staff’s balanced and informative
set of documents.
2.
Since the beginning of President Martinelli’s administration on July 1st, 2009,
new economic and social reforms were set in motion in response to the world economic
crisis and the still uncertain strength of the recovery of Panama’s main trading partners.
The government saw a need to continue to boost economic activity for the rest of 2009
and beyond. Several measures were taken to strengthen revenues, allowing an expansion
of infrastructure investments and of social programs to protect the most vulnerable. The
new authorities jump-started fiscal revenue reforms, launched a tax moratorium to collect
tax arrears, and accelerated the start of new public investment projects. Also, the
authorities rolled-out a challenging economic and social infrastructure investment
program of over US$13 billion set out in the 2010–14 Strategic Development Plan (SDP).
In mid-July 2009, the Panama Canal Authority (PCA) awarded the locks contract of
US$3.1 billion. Moreover, the government implemented reforms to make the labor code
less rigid, streamline the public contract-law and improve the judicial system, among
others. The authorities foresee additional reforms to strengthen the overall efficiency of
the economy and of the public sector.
3.
The world economic slowdown affected most sectors of the economy in 2009.
After exceeding 10 percent in 2008, GDP growth slowed to 2.4 percent in 2009. Despite
this sharp slowdown, Panama’s growth continued to exceed the Latin American average,
thanks to domestic demand, FDI flows, and the ongoing Panama Canal expansion.
Unemployment increased by only1 percentage point to 6.6 percent at the end of 2009.
4.
As noted by the staff, economic activity rebounded strongly in the last quarter of
2009 and into the first quarter of 2010, when GDP grew 4.9 percent compared to the
same period of 2009. In that quarter, production increased considerably in sectors such as
mining, construction, commerce, energy generation, telecommunications, port activities,
and tourism. The government expects growth of 5 percent of GDP in 2010 and of more
than 6 percent in the medium term.
5.
In 2009, inflation declined rapidly on account of lower international commodity
prices and the slowdown in economic activity. The Ministry of Economics and Finance
(MEF) projects a slightly higher inflation of 3 percent for end-2010, as oil and
commodity prices rebound due to better global economic prospects.
6.
The current account improved markedly in 2009, moving to a balanced position
from a deficit of 11.6 percent of GDP in 2008. This result reflects lower commodities
import prices, a large increase in net exports from the Colon Free Zone (ZLC), and a

2
decrease in the value of imports due to the sharp slowdown of the economy. However,
the current account deficit is estimated by staff to rise to about 8 percent of GDP this year
and in 2001. This sharp increase is largely associated with the Panama Canal expansion,
the large public infrastructure program of the SDP, and continued FDI inflows, all of
which have a high import-content. FDIs and other capital inflows are expected to fully
cover the deficits on current account.
7.
Against the backdrop of the global economic crisis and the domestic economic
slowdown during 2009, the outgoing administration, in agreement with the
representatives of the elected government, augmented the social and fiscal responsibility
law’s (SFRL) deficit ceiling from 1 to 2.5 percent of GDP for 2009. In spite of the
available fiscal space, the Martinelli administration proceeded with caution. The new
government tried to balance counter-cyclical fiscal policy with control of the deficit. To
this effect, the MEF carried out a revenue reform barely three months after inauguration;
another reform followed in early 2010. Also, the already-mentioned tax moratorium was
set in place with positive effects on revenue collection. Furthermore, a clamp-down on
expenditures was enforced. These measures were crucial to keeping the nonfinancial
public sector’s deficit (excluding the PCA) at only 1 percent of GDP in 2009, well below
the 2.5 percent deficit ceiling allowed by the revised SFRL.
8.
The two recent fiscal reforms widened the tax base, increased real state and VAT
taxes, and targeted sectors that had been making relatively modest contributions to tax
revenue such as ports, banks, insurance companies, the ZLC, and casinos. These reforms
are expected to generate over 2.5 percent of GDP in additional tax revenues. As a result,
tax revenue in 2010 may reach 13 percent of GDP compared to 10.6 percent of GDP in
2007, enhancing the prospects for higher levels of capital spending. The 2010 budget
targets a deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP, which is slightly lower than the 2 percent ceiling
of the SFRL. Staff believes that the government will again over perform and that the
deficit will be 0.9 percent of GDP this year.
9.
Fiscal consolidation remains vital to the government’s debt reduction strategy,
which aims to bring public debt down to 35.8 percent of GDP by 2014. Despite the global
crisis, by end-2009 public debt stood at 45 percent of GDP unchanged from end-2008,
according to figures published by the MEF. Panama’s public debt ratio in 2010 is
expected to be slightly lower than in 2009, falling to 44 percent of GDP.
10.
The government has set in motion new social programs and expanded existing
programs. It has also pursued rigid controls against fraud and enhanced accountability
measures in the implementation of these programs. Income redistribution is a major goal.
One of the new initiatives is the “100 at 70” program, which provides a monthly cashtransfer of US$100 to people above 70 years of age that are not protected by the social
security system and have no pensions and no access to health care. Over 70,000 elderly
people are covered by this program that has a US$84 million budget for 2010. Also, a
US$5,000 bonus is now being awarded for the first-time purchase of houses not
exceeding US$30,000 in value. The bonus is provided to banks in order to permit a
reduction of the corresponding mortgage. To qualify, the buyer’s income must not exceed
US$800 a month. Also new is the US$20 monthly assistance to rural students nationwide

3
with a view to reducing drop-out rates. Furthermore, the government has maintained all
the previous social initiatives such as preferential interest rates on low-income housing
and agricultural loans, subsidized cooking gas, and the cash-transfers for extremely poor
families. In addition, the administration increased the minimum-wage, wages in the
health and security sectors, as well as the salaries of low-income public employees. It has
also reduced income-tax rates for lower incomes.
11.
Panama expects a high level of public and private investment, including a
sustained flow of FDIs in 2010 and beyond. The most relevant ongoing public projects
are the Panama Canal expansion (a US$5.3 billion project), the airport and the inner-city
highway expansion, the oil pipeline and storage facilities, an upgrade of the PanamaBay’s sewage and drainage systems, and the metropolitan bus project for public
transportation. In addition, the SDP investments plan includes the Curundú low-income
housing project, the construction of a series of new government buildings (Centro
Gubernamental), five state-of-the-art hospitals and ten primary-attention health centers, a
new penitentiary complex, a light rail metro system, a convention center, and the
expansion of the high-speed highway system. Some of these projects have already been
tendered while others are in the public bid process or at a design stage. The 2010 public
investment budget stands at US$2.5 billion. The authorities aim to attain an 80 percent
execution rate in 2010 compared to 66 percent in 2009. Private investments are expected
to increase in various sectors. There are over 19 ongoing energy projects, including
hydro, thermo, and aeolic. Also, over 20 hotels of local and international chains, port
facilities, and commercial building are under construction. Public private partnership
legislation is being prepared and will open new opportunities for private sector
participation in large public investment projects.
12.
The authorities have been actively promoting Panama as a safe investment
destination. In this regard, we note the President’s personal efforts in the international
arena, the progress in double taxation treaties to eliminate Panama from the OECD’s grey
list, and the newly negotiated free trade agreement with Canada. These agreements are
expected to enhance FDI prospects in Panama.
13.
The banking sector remained solid in 2009, partly because of high liquidity and
strong supervision. The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) for the banking sector reached
16.4 percent in 2009 compared to 14.8 percent in 2008. Statutory CAR is 8 percent.
Nonperforming loans (NPLs) actually decreased during 2009 to 1.4 percent of total loans
from 1.6 percent in the previous year, as bankers tightened lending requirements and
pursued safety in higher liquidity rather than in profitability. Accordingly, return on
assets (ROA) diminished in 2009 to 1.4 percent from 2.2 percent in 2008.
14.
The first quarter of 2010 already shows a trend of increased credit. Mortgages are
particularly strong compared to the same period in 2009. Also, net earnings in the system
are up 20 percent. The results of the staff’s stress testing of the banking sector indicate
that capital levels in the system would remain adequate under sizeable shocks to
economic activity and the quality of assets.

15.
Only a few days after inauguration, the government began to address the issue of
the OECD grey list by reactivating, in late July 2009, the Presidential Commission that
deals with international financial services. The Minister of Finance has been leading the
efforts to conclude at least 12 double-taxation treaties by the end of 2010, as agreed with
OECD. This will allow the removal of Panama from the OECD’s so-called grey list. As
of today, 9 of the 12 required agreements have been negotiated. All these treaties require
congressional approval. Panama is determined to overperform the established OECD goal
for 2010 and remains committed to eliminating any doubts about the rules governing the
country’s banking system.
16.
The recent investment grade assessments of the country’s sovereign credit by
Fitch Ratings, Standard and Poor’s, and Moody’s open new prospects for stronger growth
and investments in Panama. One of the staff’s Selected Issues papers highlights the
benefits from the new ratings. These include lower borrowing costs, new funding sources
for domestic corporates and the public sector, and new portfolio options for international
investors.
