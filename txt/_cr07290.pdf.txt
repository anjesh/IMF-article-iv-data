• Prime Minister Hun Sen’s CPP party has consolidated power ahead of the 2008
elections. The CPP’s main coalition partner, FUNCINPEC, split up in 2006 following
constitutional changes, and its long-time leader, Prince Ranariddh, formed a competitor
party. He was subsequently sentenced, in absentia, to 18 months in prison for breach of
trust for his role in selling a FUNCINPEC building. The recent local elections saw a
comprehensive CPP victory (60 percent of the vote) but also saw the main opposition
Sam Rainsy Party, emerge as a distinct force with 25 percent of the vote.
• Despite significant shortcomings in some areas, core economic and financial data
provided to the Fund are generally adequate for surveillance.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Strong macroeconomic policies have enabled Cambodia to achieve impressive
growth and make inroads into poverty. Supported by prudent fiscal and monetary
policies that have strengthened the economy’s resilience to shocks, growth has averaged
over 9 percent since 2000 and was 10¾ percent in 2006. Anchored in part by
extraordinarily high dollarization, inflation has remained low and confidence increased.
Overall poverty has declined markedly but with a rise in inequality.

•

Growth, however, remains narrowly based and rural poverty stubbornly high.
Growth has been driven by the garment and tourism sectors, with agriculture only
recently making a sustained contribution. As a consequence, poverty remains high in
rural areas and progress will have to be accelerated if Cambodia is to meet its
Millennium Development Goals.

•

Debt is on a sustainable path. This reflects continued strong economic growth and the
highly concessional structure of Cambodia’s lending. Moderate risks do remain,
particularly given the low level of government revenues and continued external arrears.

Key issues and policy discussions
•

Appropriate policies and institutions are needed to sustain growth and poverty
reduction over the medium term. The authorities remain optimistic about mediumterm prospects and are taking steps to mitigate risks that stem from the narrow growth
base, the banking sector and governance concerns. Oil production, should it occur,
would enhance prospects but there is still much uncertainty as to its scale and timing.

•

Fiscal policies focus on improving the level and quality of revenue and
expenditure. The authorities agree in principle with staff that further policy measures
would improve the efficiency and equity of the tax system. However, for the 2008
budget they intend to rely on gains from improved administration. Expenditure policy
aims to improve public services and increase investment. Staff supports these policies
and emphasizes the importance of improving fiscal planning so that revenue increases
are used to finance additional expenditure rather than build up domestic savings.

•

Monetary policy is accommodating rising money demand while exchange rate
policy targets nominal stability—the rate is in line with fundamentals, with the
underlying current account in equilibrium. Neither the authorities nor staff believe
rapid growth of monetary aggregates is currently a macroeconomic concern. It does,
however, present risks to the immature financial sector which the authorities are
responding to through better enforcement of prudential regulations. The main monetary
policy tool is unsterilized foreign exchange intervention targeted at maintaining a stable
nominal exchange rate. Staff supports this policy, which, with the current strong
demand for local currency, is adding to international reserves without fueling inflation.

•

Structural reforms in the fiscal and banking sectors are progressing well. Good
progress has been made in the authorities’ flagship public financial management reform
program while gains have also been made in improving the financial sector’s regulatory
framework. However, much needs to be done to improve the capacity of public
institutions, enhance governance and reduce corruption.

4
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Since emerging from conflict and political instability in the late 1990s, Cambodia
has rapidly attained macroeconomic stability. Supported by prudent fiscal and monetary
policies that have strengthened the economy’s resilience to shocks, growth has averaged over
9 percent since 2000 and has accelerated in recent years. Anchored in part by the
extraordinarily high degree of dollarization, inflation has remained low and the resulting
growth in confidence has encouraged re-monetization.
2.
Nevertheless, the country remains poor. Growth has been narrowly based on
garment exports and tourism and while the overall poverty rate has declined—from
47 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004—there has been a rise in inequality. Encouragingly,
the increase in inequality occurred primarily in the early part of the decade (1994-97) and
mostly within rural areas.1 During the second half of the period (1997-2004), the benefits of
growth were shared reasonably equally between the rich and the poor but rural poverty
remains high. Despite the progress reported in the recently completed Annual Update of the
National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP), the authorities’ PRSP, some Cambodian
Millennium Development Goals appear beyond
World Bank Doing business indicators in 2006
reach (Box 1 and Table 6).
(Ranking among 175 countries in the world)
3.
Poor governance weakens the
environment for broad-based development.
Human and institutional capacity remains very
weak, constraining the ability of the public
sector to contribute to poverty reduction.
Cambodia ranks very poorly on indicators of
economic governance, hindering gains in
external competitiveness. Corruption is endemic
and human rights problems continue. Land
grabbing and illegal logging with damaging
economic, social and environmental effects are
widely reported.

A proposed PRGF arrangement remains stalled as negotiations on outstanding
debt obligations to the United States and Russia continue. 2 An in-principle deal has been
struck with the United States but is still to be finalized. Russian debt rescheduling
negotiations continue. At the authorities’ request, staff is maintaining an intensive policy

dialogue until a formal program can be presented to the Board. This dialogue includes
monitoring progress against the authorities’ quarterly macroeconomic targets and annual
structural reform priorities.
Box 1: The National Strategic Development Program 2006 -10 (NSDP)
The NSDP focuses on broadening growth, particularly in rural areas. Staffs concluded that
it provided a good road map for tackling poverty, although some critical elements of the
sectoral strategies needed to be finalized and costing improved.*
The recent annual progress report (APR) is positive about achievements in the first year
of implementation. Although it reports some progress in aligning objectives and financing, the
linkages between NSDP priorities, the budget and the public investment program still would
benefit from strengthening. The APR was discussed at the Cambodia Development
Cooperation Forum (CDCF) in June 2007 where aid pledges of around US$700 million
annually over 2007–09 indicate that the NSDP’s investment framework would be fully
financed over this period. Of note, China was included for the first time in the medium-term
indicative financing framework.
The authorities stress the importance of aligning aid delivery with NSDP priorities. A
recent report on aid effectiveness found that while assistance was broadly aligned with the
NSDP, it is too fragmented and excessively focused on technical assistance thus reducing the
resources available for much needed capital investment. The authorities and development
partners agreed a new set of Joint Monitoring Indicators at the CDCF to assist in monitoring
progress against NSDP objectives in a framework of mutual responsibility and accountability.
Development partners, particularly the World Bank, are aligning their programs with these
indicators.
* IMF Country Reports: 06/267 (the NSDP); and 06/267 (the Joint Staff Advisory Note).

5.
Emerging creditors are playing a more prominent role. Officials publicly contrast
the ease of official financing from China and Korea with the conditionality applied by donors
such as the World Bank—who, amid much publicity and dispute, suspended a number of
projects in mid-2006 due to corruption. The projects have since resumed and with a recent
agreement on a repayment schedule for the misprocured amounts, the first in a series of
Poverty Reduction and Growth Operations (PRGOs) will be considered by the Bank’s Board
in mid-July. At the Cambodia Development Cooperation Forum (CDCF) in Phnom Penh in
June, aid pledges were of the order of $700 million annually, notwithstanding considerable
donor concerns about governance.

6
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
6.
Macroeconomic performance in 2006 continued to be impressive and the nearterm outlook is favorable (Figure 1). Growth in 2006 was 10¾ percent and, with first
quarter growth of 10 percent, is projected to be around 9 percent in 2007.

but is expected to remain around
4 percent, assuming broadly stable international oil prices for the rest of the year.
•
Exports remain buoyant. Garments and tourism grew by around 20 percent in 2006
and continued growing rapidly in early 2007. Imports are increasing on the back of strong
GDP growth and high oil prices—an external current account deficit (excluding official
transfers) of around 7 percent of GDP is projected in 2007. External financing comes mainly
from aid and FDI focused on garments, tourism, agriculture and construction.
•
Fiscal policy continues to be prudent. The overall fiscal deficit in 2007 is expected
to be similar to 2006, at 3¼ percent of GDP (excluding MDRI receipts). Revenue collection
in 2007 is again exceeding expectations, with tax department revenues in the year to April up
by around 60 percent and customs department revenues also performing strongly.
Expenditure restraint in 2006 and slow spending in early 2007 has led to further increases in
government bank deposits and significant reductions in domestic arrears— from
CR471 billion at end-2004 to CR77 billion at end-March 2007.
•
Money demand is rising. Broad money grew by around 40 percent in 2006, mainly
reflecting increases in bank deposits, almost entirely in dollars. Credit to the private sector,
also in dollars, grew even more rapidly but the level remains very low (only 12 percent of
GDP). These trends continued in early 2007.

•
The exchange rate is stable and reserve growth is healthy. The riel has remained
broadly stable in bilateral and real effective terms with some small nominal appreciation in
early-2007. Increased demand for riel, in part as a result of improved tax compliance, has
allowed the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) to make greater-than-expected dollar
purchases from the market. NBC’s reserves now exceed US$1.2 billion. However, they are
not keeping pace with the growth in banks’ foreign currency deposits and there is a continued
small build up of external arrears to the United States and Russia.
7.
Progress has been made on structural reforms but much remains to be done.
Efforts in the fiscal and financial sectors are bearing fruit, boding well for the remaining
broad agenda. However, legal and judicial reform progress has been much slower. Efforts to
strengthen the draft anti-corruption law halted pending review of the penal code and an anticorruption unit in the Council of Ministers was created in the interim. The Anti-Money
Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism Law passed but drafts of the Insolvency
Law and the Law on the Status of Judges and Prosecutors are still being debated at Ministry
level.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
Discussions focused on establishing appropriate policies and institutions to
sustain growth and poverty reduction over the medium term in the context of NSDP.
Weak institutions continue to limit the authorities’ ability to respond to evolving economic
conditions.
•
Fiscal policy is currently the authorities’ main policy lever for adjusting to
economic shocks and contributing to poverty reduction.
•
Monetary and exchange rate policy aims to promote confidence in the nascent
financial sector. Deepening and strengthening the banking sector are critical for continued
modernization of the economy.
•
Broad-based improvement in governance is needed to increase investor
confidence and enhance public sector performance. Establishing a comprehensive and
independent legal and judicial system will take many years. Policy discussions focused on
macroeconomic aspects of governance, especially public financial management, trade
facilitation and financial sector supervision.
9.
Strengthening economic institutions continues to require substantial technical
assistance. The authorities broadly agreed with the Fund’s strategy for future technical
assistance. They noted that, resource constraints notwithstanding, in some situations resident
advice would continue to be important in designing and implementing policies and
monitoring progress through improved statistics.

11.
Continued prudent macroeconomic policies underlie the positive outlook. The
authorities expressed a strong commitment to maintain prudent policies in the lead up to the
2008 general elections and beyond.
•
Inflation is expected to remain in the low single digits, reflecting prudent fiscal policy
even as monetary policy accommodates rapidly rising money demand against the background
of high dollarization.
•
The external current account deficit (excluding transfers) will stabilize at around
8 percent of GDP (Table 4) as increased domestic demand increases imports and export
diversification gathers momentum. The deficit is admittedly large but financing will come
from FDI and, consistent with pledges made at the CDCF and past flows, annual aid of
around 6 percent of GDP.
•
Steady accumulation of international reserves remains an important policy objective
for the authorities. Import coverage is well below the 3-month benchmark and maintaining
adequate coverage of rapidly increasing dollars in the banking system is challenging. The
latter is a more relevant indicator in Cambodia’s highly dollarized environment where the
NBC would be reliant on its international reserves to provide liquidity to the financial sector.
12.
Oil production, should it occur, could significantly increase national income, and
the fiscal revenues it yields would provide vital financing for development spending as
well as allowing saving for future generations. Given the substantial uncertainty still
surrounding the level of reserves and the timing of production, staff agreed with the
authorities that the principal macroeconomic framework should not include any estimates of

11
the impact of oil production. The DSA does, however, include an alternative scenario that
illustrates the significant but not overwhelming impact of a moderate oil sector—fiscal
revenues from oil would peak at around 5 percent of GDP (Chapter II of the Selected Issues
paper).
13.
Staff stressed the importance of a clear institutional framework for the oil sector
in reducing uncertainty and facilitating early commercial production. The authorities
agreed and pointed to the comprehensive petroleum law that is currently being drafted. The
authorities’ main current priority is to set a taxation regime that promotes exploitation of the
resources while maximizing the government’s take. Although covering taxation within the
petroleum law was considered, the authorities are now committed to placing taxation
provisions within the existing Law on Taxation to ensure transparency and consistency, as
the IMF had recommended. The authorities have publicly committed that all future oil
revenues will pass through the budget and be directed towards the goals of the NSDP. They
are currently considering whether to formally endorse the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI) stressing that irrespective of formal adoption, the PFM reform program
already embodies the principles of EITI.
Risks
14.

Narrowly based growth increases the economy’s exposure to shocks.

•
Agricultural growth, vital for the majority of the population, remains vulnerable
to weather conditions. The authorities are attempting to counter this through investment in
rural irrigation and improvements in extension services.
•
Garments, which dominate exports, are vulnerable to domestic and external
developments. Although demand appears to be holding up well in the face of strong regional
competition, the recent accession of Vietnam to the WTO and the prospect of safeguards
measures on China being lifted threaten future competitiveness. The authorities are therefore
seeking improved access in existing (United States) and new (Russia) markets. They have
also recently passed legislation that reduces the premium paid to night shift workers.
Garment producers see this as important in increasing productivity and potentially bringing
upstream garment activities into Cambodia. The move has, however, been strongly opposed
by the trade unions.
15.
The rapidly growing financial sector continues to be an area of vulnerability.
Bank lending would be exposed were recent land price hikes and real estate speculation to
reverse, eroding the growing confidence in the banking system. The absence of any state
involvement in the banking sector would limit direct the fiscal impact of banking sector
weaknesses, but NBC’s international reserves would be at risk.

12
16.
Public debt is sustainable although with moderate risk of distress.3 Public debt,
which is almost entirely external, declined to 33 percent of GDP in 2006. The continued
strong economic growth anticipated in the medium and long term places debt on a
sustainable path and the highly concessional structure of Cambodia’s lending dampens the
risk of distress. Nevertheless, moderate risks do remain, particularly given the current low
level of government revenues, the continued existence of external arrears and the potential
for contingent liabilities. Only the Minister of Finance can issue loan guarantees, which are
currently very small.
17.
The authorities see the recently acquired sovereign credit ratings as
confirmation of their sound polices but do not intend to borrow on commercial terms
from capital markets in the near future. The DSA shows that while some borrowing on
commercial terms is not necessarily inconsistent with debt sustainability it would
significantly increase fiscal debt service costs. Cognizant of this, the authorities stressed that,
at least for the foreseeable future, they have no intention of pursuing the offers of commercial
bond financing they have received. They are, however, prepared to consider limited
borrowing on close to commercial terms (for example, through the AsDB’s non-concessional
window) for high-return infrastructure projects. Similarly, the government will avoid
providing any substantial guarantees. The staff strongly supported this overall approach.
18.
Continued improvements in governance are vital for growth, competitiveness,
and poverty reduction. Although external confidence in increased political stability is
gaining momentum, disorderly or indecisive national elections in 2008 could damage the
investment climate and inhibit domestic policy making. The authorities responded to staff’s
concerns, stressing that recent elections, including the indecisive 2003 general election, have
not led to any loss in macroeconomic stability and the Prime Minister committed not to allow
any loosening of fiscal policy in the coming twelve months. In addition, the NSDP puts
governance improvements at the heart of its strategy, with efforts to improve incentives.
•
Increase incentives for good performance. The authorities are concerned about the
disparity between the rapid pace of economic change and the weak capacity of the
government. However, their plans for civil service reform, which focus on across-the-board
increases in salaries, are at odds with the views of its development partners, who stress the
need for more fundamental change in staffing structures and pay scales (see Chapter III of
the Selected Issues paper).4

3

Supplement 1 details the latest joint Fund/Bank staff Debt Sustainability Analysis. Stress tests show
that less prudent fiscal policies than assumed in the baseline do not significantly threaten debt
sustainability.
4
Basic civil service salaries are so low ($30/month) that a whole system of absentees, ghost workers,
multiple jobs, and bribery has unfortunately evolved.

13
•
Increase disincentives for bad performance. The anti-corruption unit established in
2006, is focusing its efforts on sectors with the most economic impact and has made some
progress in publicly bringing to account, mostly mid-level, civil servants found to be
engaging in corrupt activities. Nevertheless, the authorities acknowledged that passing the
proposed Law on Anti-Corruption would provide a more robust institutional framework.
Moreover, they recognize that actions to tackle illegal logging, land grabbing and fraud have
to be taken.

expenditure. The continued build-up
of domestic surpluses would also
provide room to adjust to economic shocks and enable accumulation of foreign reserves. The
authorities agreed with this framework but preferred to be cautious about revenue projections
for the 2008 budget.
20.
The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) is intending to accelerate
expenditure markedly in the second half of 2007, as teething problems with new budget
execution procedures recede. Staff supported the authorities’ intention to use additional
revenue available after fully meeting budgets—including the within year wage increase
announced in May—to clear up remaining domestic arrears.
21.
The authorities are currently developing a medium-term resource mobilization
policy. They agree in principle with staff that further policy measures are required to
improve the efficiency and equity of the tax system.5 However, with the general elections
imminent, for the 2008 budget they intend to rely on continued revenue gains from improved

14
administration rather than introducing measures such as broadening the VAT base and
implementing property taxation. They believe that recent improvements in collection from an
unchanged tax base reflect returns from previous administration reforms that will continue to
accrue in future years. Further gains in customs performance are expected to come from the
AYSCUDA-based automation beginning in early 2008 and enhanced risk management. Both
of these though are dependent on the passage of the new customs law, now before
parliament, and significant capacity building and investment in equipment.
22.
Expenditure policy aims to improve public services and increase investment.
Increases in revenue will be used in part to finance annual increases in public servants’ base
salaries of 20 percent. 6 The authorities indicated that non-wage allocations to priority
expenditure programs will be increased at a similar rate while increases in other current
expenditure will be limited to the rate of inflation, allowing them to devote increasing
resources to financing public investment. These resources will include the proceeds of MDRI
debt relief from the IMF, which are initially being spent on improving rural irrigation.7 Staff
urged the authorities to use realistic revenue estimates for the 2008 budget in order that
expenditure increases, particularly in the capital budget, could be effectively programmed
and inadvertent savings avoided.
23.
The authorities’ PFM reform program is their flagship reform effort. Significant
progress has been made in the last twelve months, including through the introduction of the
new chart of accounts and program budgets in priority sectors. However, staff and the
authorities agreed that initial implementation problems with these procedures need to be
addressed urgently with line ministries. Poverty-reducing spending will be identified in the
2008 budget and monitored through the year. The authorities have also begun to advance
cash management reforms that should significantly improve expenditure efficiency but much
remains to be done, particularly in rationalizing government bank accounts and increasing
use of the banking system. The National Treasury computerization program also needs to be
completed.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
24.
The authorities’ monetary policy is accommodating rising money demand.
Active monetary policy is currently precluded by the high level of dollarization, lack of
indirect instruments, and considerable excess reserves in the banking system. Participation in
the foreign currency market is therefore NBC’s main monetary policy tool. Riels are supplied
by foreign exchange purchases, largely in response to demand. Avoiding central bank fiscal
6

Base salaries are only around half of total remuneration with functional and other allowances
playing a major role for many public servants. The pay increase will cost less than 0.1 percent of
GDP in 2007 and 2008.
7

The full value of debt relief showed in 2006 revenue. Budgeted spending for 2007 on irrigation is
US$11million but may fall short of this target.

15
financing—a broad working rule the government has adopted for nearly a decade—has
prevented excess riel liquidity, and thus exchange-rate depreciation and local-currency
inflation. More recently, domestic fiscal surpluses have given rise to additional bank deposits
in both riel and dollars, matched by increased international reserves.
25.
Exchange rate policy targets a stable nominal dollar rate. Formally, NBC
conducts a managed float of the exchange rate, intervening only to smooth market
fluctuations. Staff noted, however, that the de facto policy is to maintain a stable nominal rate
against the dollar. The authorities concurred and stressed its benefits in reinforcing
confidence in the nascent financial sector and the national currency. Low inflation and
relatively stable nominal exchange rates in neighboring countries enable the real effective
exchange rate to support external competitiveness stemming from low dollar wages and
continued agricultural productivity improvements.8 Moderate, but increasing, unsterilized
intervention supports this policy. Increasing demand for riel has led to marked increases in
the level of foreign currency purchases over the last 12 months and there have been sales of
only US$½ million in the last 2 years.9
D. Financial Sector
26.
The expansion in lending increases the vulnerability of an immature banking
sector (see Chapter IV of the selected issues paper). While neither the authorities nor staff
believe rapid growth of monetary aggregates is a macroeconomic concern, it could endanger
the small and segmented banking sector. The rapid growth in foreign currency deposits is
concentrated in a few banks that cater for particular segments of the market. Credit, which is
similarly concentrated, is almost entirely collateralized against the booming real estate
market and appears to be also financing real estate and construction investment. Reported

The dramatic changes to Cambodia’s economy in recent years preclude estimation of an equilibrium

These small sales took place recently through auctions conducted with the aim of testing market
conditions.

16
27.
The expansion reinforces the critical importance of strong banking supervision.
The NBC acknowledged that, although enforcement of prudential regulations is improving,
compliance with prudential regulations remains patchy. The central bank aims to bring banks
into full compliance by the end of 2007, in particular those with systemic importance.
Compliance should be improved as transitional exemptions to the new large-exposure
regulation expire.
28.
The authorities are pursuing a number of initiatives to reduce impediments to
financial intermediation. The recently updated blueprint, formatted with the assistance of
the AsDB, contains a broad range of reforms. Staff emphasized actions to establish a secure
and reliable payments system and develop the recently introduced credit information system.
New anti-money laundering legislation will provide a good framework for improving the
integrity of the system. The authorities continue to implement the recommendations of the
2004 IMF safeguards assessment and intend, with staff’s support, to request an update to
contribute to the ongoing modernization of NBC operations.
E. Trade
29.
Trade policy reforms and improvements in facilitation are aimed at reinforcing
Cambodia’s strong external competitiveness. With staff’s support, the authorities’ focus is
now more on trade facilitation reforms than tax incentives to attract foreign investment. The
new customs law will provide the legal framework for streamlining transactions and
implementing commitments made under WTO accession. However, many other pieces of
legislation required under these commitments remain behind schedule. Under ASEAN
agreements, tariff rates under the Common Effective Preferential Tariff Scheme will be
reduced to a maximum of 5 percent by 2010, and all items in the temporary exclusion list
will be transferred to the inclusion list by 2007. The authorities agreed that tariff reductions
should be made on a nonpreferential basis to avoid trade diversion and said that they planned
to similarly reduce non-ASEAN tariffs.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
The Cambodian authorities’ commitment to macroeconomic policies that
promote domestic and external stability is commendable and should enable further
inroads to be made into poverty. Continued robust growth and growing domestic and
international confidence combined with public administration reforms and sustained
agricultural improvements should have a marked impact on rural poverty. The staff supports
the approach of the authorities’ NSDP to channel more resources to increasing agricultural
productivity through rural irrigation, improved land allocation, and rural credit.

17
31.
The lead up to the 2008 elections should be a period of reform not delay. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ commitment to maintaining stability through the election period.
This is crucial for safeguarding increasing investor confidence in Cambodia’s export sector,
which remains concentrated and vulnerable to rapid reversals.
32.
Continued improvements in public services as well as tackling governance are
crucial. Addressing widespread corruption will enhance the business environment as well as
strengthen revenue collection and expenditure quality. Staff continues to support the
introduction of an appropriate anti-corruption law which will provide important rigor and
transparency. In the meantime, existing institutions and laws should be utilized to guard
against misuse of funds and to investigate irregularities as they come to light. Staff
encourages further action to improve the transparency of state assets and concessions, which
appear to be still assigned through uncompetitive processes.
33.
The authorities’ caution with respect to commercial borrowing is welcome.
Reflecting the highly concessional structure of external debt, continuation of the current
prudent borrowing policy—not using the recently acquired sovereign credit ratings in the
short term—should safeguard debt sustainability and minimize risks of distress. Staff
welcomes continued efforts to resolve outstanding arrears with official creditors.
34.
Oil production would improve prospects but also bring additional challenges
and requires a clear legal framework. A key building block is to strengthen the taxation
regime for oil, making use of previous IMF technical assistance. Staff strongly supports the
Prime Minister’s decision to embed this within the existing law on taxation and encourages
the authorities to endorse EITI. Careful consideration of the appropriate balance between
saving, investing and consuming future oil revenues will be needed to ensure the benefits of
oil wealth add to the hard-won macroeconomic stability.
35.
Continued revenue improvements are needed to finance public service
improvement and, ultimately, reduce dependence on aid. Recent revenue increases
arising from administration improvements are commendable but challenges remain,
particularly as the growth of customs department’s tax base is restricted by administered
prices and tariff reductions. Although, with sustained reform effort, further enforcementbased increases will be available, policy measures will also be needed to raise revenue and
improve the structure of the tax system. Staff encourages the authorities to implement initial
measures in the 2008 budget, despite its proximity to the elections.
36.
The authorities’ plan to increase and reorient expenditure is welcome but not yet
fully developed. Staff supports the government’s policy of steadily raising public sector
wages as revenue increases allow. This is needed to improve performance and discourage
corruption. However, the impact would be enhanced if it were embedded in a broader civil
service reform strategy. Revenue increases need also to finance good quality poverty-

18
reducing spending, including productive capital investment, rather than only to increase
domestic savings.
37.
Improved fiscal outcomes require continued progress in implementation of the
PFM reform program. The recent progress in PFM reforms have made the budget more
credible and laid the foundations for more effective spending. Immediate priorities should be
to continue to strengthen cash management and to clearly identify spending priorities in the
2008 budget.
38.
In the staff’s view, dollarization has been, and will continue to be in the medium
term, a valuable foundation for Cambodia’s macroeconomic stability and financial
sector growth. These advantages currently outweigh the loss of seignorage and ability to use
active monetary policy to adjust to domestic and external developments. The NBC should
continue to accommodate increasing money demand without engaging in coercive measures
to reduce the use of dollars. Nevertheless, wage and price developments should be carefully
monitored for indications of inflation pressures.
39.
The exchange rate is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals, with the
underlying current account in equilibrium. Staff supports the current exchange rate
policy, which closely resembles a loose peg to the US dollar. The policy has been
instrumental in external competitiveness, gradual reserve accumulation and low inflation and
is appropriate as long as the expansion in local currency in circulation remains under control.
The policy would need to be reviewed if there were significant movement in the exchange
rates of neighboring countries. Given the need to supplement international reserves, sustained
depreciation pressures, were they to arise, should not be resisted.
40.
Further improvements in NBC’s banking supervision are crucial in preventing
macroeconomic risks arising from the financial sector. The impact of rapid private sector
credit growth on banks’ balance sheets needs to be closely monitored, to ensure that banks
are weighing lending risks properly. Staff looks forward to further progress in enforcing
prudential regulations and encourages NBC to rigorously enforce corrective actions for those
banks that are out of compliance. Priority should be given to assessing asset quality and
strengthening banks’ credit risk management through the recently established credit
information system. Also important will be implementing the recently passed Law on AntiMoney Laundering and working with the commercial banks to enhance the payments system.
41.
The Fund will continue to support the authorities’ reform program. If
outstanding debt arrears issues are resolved, staff would support a request for a new PRGF
arrangement. Until that point, staff will continue an intensive policy dialogue. Substantial
IMF technical assistance will continue to support reforms in the fiscal, financial and
statistical areas.
42.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place within the standard
12-month cycle.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
CAMBODIA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 200710
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Daniel Citrin and Adnan Mazarei (IMF) and
Vikram Nehru and Deepak Bhattasali (IDA)
July 10, 2007
A. Introduction
External debt—of which almost 35 percent is owed to the United States and the Russian
Federation—constitutes almost 95 percent of Cambodia’s public debt. At end-2006,
Cambodia’s total external public debt was about US$2¼ billion (31 percent of GDP),12 while
domestic debt amounted to 2 percent of GDP, one third of which was denominated in foreign
currency. The status of resolution of outstanding debt obligations with the Russian
Federation and the United States has not changed since the last joint DSA, conducted in 2006
(Country Report No. 06/264).
This joint WB/IMF debt sustainability assessment concludes that Cambodia’s debt is on
a sustainable path and that it faces a moderate risk of debt distress. All baseline debt
burden indicators remain well below their indicative thresholds, with only two thresholds—
the NPV of external debt-to-GDP and the NPV of external debt-to-revenue ratios—being
breached briefly in the standard stress tests. Provided debt rescheduling agreements are
reached, the risk of debt distress will decline further, though low revenue collections will
continue to pose risks to debt sustainability.

10

This DSA has been prepared jointly by the IMF and the World Bank staffs based on the framework
considered by the Boards of the Fund and the Bank in April 2005 and revised in December 2006. The analysis
has benefited from inputs provided by the Asian Development Bank and was discussed with the Cambodian
authorities during the 2007 Article IV Consultation.
12

Cambodia received debt relief from the Fund under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) of
SDR57 million (US$82 million) in early 2006, as outlined in Press Release No. 05/291 (12/23/2005).

2
The assessment updates the previous DSA, presented to the IMF’s Executive Board at
the 2006 Article IV consultation, which concluded that Cambodia’s debt at the time was
still at high risk of distress. The change occurs for two main reasons: further higher-thanexpected GDP growth enhancing long term projections and continued large-scale
concessional financing from both traditional donors and new development partners. For this
DSA, staff also applied the standard 70 percent discount to the nominal value of the debt to
the Russian Federation for the past path of the debt.
The baseline assumes robust growth underpinned by agriculture, garment exports and
tourism. Specifically, the analysis is based on the assumption that real GDP growth will be
sustained at 6½ percent and exports will grow at around 10 percent a year. Business
environment reforms are expected to help improve competitiveness. Foreign aid is assumed
to remain broadly stable in nominal U.S. dollar terms through the medium term. Fiscal
consolidation is expected to be underpinned by improvements in tax and customs
administration. The primary deficit is expected to decline over the medium term, as spending
increases only partly offset the improved revenue position. In the longer term, marginal
primary surpluses are expected. New borrowing is projected to be somewhat less
concessional than the existing debt.
It is expected that Cambodia will start producing oil from around 2011, but because of
the uncertainty still surrounding the size of usable deposits and the timing of
production, oil receipts are included only in an alternative scenario. Assumptions on oil
production are moderate but would favorably impact growth and government revenues from
2011.13 Under this scenario, real GDP growth would be somewhat higher and government
revenues increased substantially. The fiscal deficit would widen somewhat in the early years
of oil production to accommodate larger spending for development and poverty reduction.
Nevertheless, the overall impact would be to reinforce the favorable trend in debt
sustainability.
B. Context
Cambodia remains in arrears on debts to the two largest creditors—the Russian
Federation and the United States. Cambodia is not servicing its debt to either creditor, but
has made efforts to conclude agreements with both under the framework of the Paris Club.
Since prospects for early resolution look remote, the current DSA assumes no restructuring in
its baseline, where arrears continue to be built up to the United States and the Russian
Federation throughout the projection period.
The current DSA includes the negotiated debt stocks for the debts to the Russian
Federation. In discussing debt rescheduling, Cambodia and the Russian Federation have
agreed that (i) after applying the stipulated exchange rate and the 70 percent upfront
discount, the total debt would be US$457 million (from US$1.5 billion in the previous
13

An FDI-financed, offshore operation without large domestic investments in shipping facilities or refineries.
Production would begin in 2011. Fiscal revenues from oil would reach around US$1.5 billion or around 5
percent of GDP in 2017.

3
DSA),14 and (ii) the interest rate for the pre-cut-off-date debt would be about 0.8 percent,
with a concessional repayment schedule. However, the countries have disagreed on the
classification of loans valued at US$40 million as either pre-cut-off-date or post-cut-off-date
debt, and the interest rate on the post-cut-off-date debt. On the latter issue, while Cambodia
has stated its desire to have a flat interest rate profile (at 3 percent), the Russian government
has expressed its need to have rates approaching market rates at some point in the payment
profile. The latest proposals from the two sides are very similar in NPV terms. Despite this,
no agreement is in sight.
The United States and Cambodia have reached agreement on the total amount of
principal due. After determining the total obligation to be US$162 million, the Cambodian
government has received from its U.S. counterpart a draft bilateral agreement based on the
1995 Paris Club agreement (i.e., flow rescheduling on Naples terms assuming a 40-year
maturity, 16-year grace period, and an interest rate of 3 percent). The draft agreement is still
under review by the Cambodian government. The arrears that would arise as part of that
agreement would need to be rescheduled in the context of the Paris Club.
Cambodia has normalized debt relations with other Paris Club creditors. Bilateral
agreements were signed with France, Germany, and Japan, and payments resumed. In recent
months, Cambodia has repaid outstanding debt owed to Japan under the Paris Club
rescheduling, around US$4 million.
Cambodia recently received speculative-grade sovereign credit ratings of B+ from
Standard and Poor’s and B2 from Moody’s, which could provide an opportunity for
commercial borrowing. Although no plans have been announced, it is possible that bonds
could be issued to finance infrastructure development, possibly for the oil sector. The
authorities are also considering BOT operations with Chinese companies, several contracts
for which have already been signed. Staffs of the Bank and Fund have not examined the
contracts for the guarantees offered; thus, contingent liabilities from such contracts are not
incorporated in this DSA. In this context, staffs have maintained that careful assessment is
needed to plan for large infrastructure investments, and transactions should be monitored
closely and transparently.
Cambodia ranks as a ‘weak performer’ in terms of its policies and institutions according
to the latest World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). Indicative
debt-burden thresholds for countries in this category are a NPV of external debt-to-exports of
100 percent, to GDP of 30 percent and to revenues of 200 percent, and debt service ratios to
exports and to revenues of 15 and 25 percent, respectively.

14

The previous DSA (in Country Report No. 06/264) incorporated in its analysis the exchange rate to convert
USSR Gosbank Ruble debt to U.S. Dollars, but the discount was applied only after the agreement to
rescheduling the future path of the debt. The current DSA applies the 70 percent discount for both the past and
the future path of the debt, consistent with the 1997 MoU between Russia and the Paris Club and with
agreements reached in the context of bilateral negotiations between Cambodia and the Russian Federation.

4
C. External Debt Sustainability
Cambodia’s external debt burden indicators remain below their indicative thresholds,
and are likely to decline further, with two thresholds being breached in the standard
bound tests. The ratio to GDP of the NPV of external debt will remain below the 30 percent
indicative threshold in the medium term, barely breaching the threshold under only one stress
test. With a 30 percent nominal depreciation relative to the baseline in 2008, NPV of debt-toGDP ratio rises by almost 10 percentage points, but declining below the indicative threshold
in the medium term. It should be noted, however, that the devaluation test overestimates the
negative impact of depreciation since Cambodia is 90-95 percent dollarized.15 The NPV of
debt-to-export ratio, at 32 percent in 2007, is well below its indicative debt burden threshold
of 100 percent under all scenarios. Debt service remains below 1 percent of exports
throughout the entire projection period even under the most extreme stress test, and is well
below the indicative threshold of 15 percent. The external debt-to-revenue ratio is also below
the threshold for all years of the baseline, declining from 175 in 2007 to 137 by 2012, and
further declining over the long term. It breaches its threshold only in the bound tests that
project a sizable increase in debt or a large depreciation. The analysis of external debt in light
of the joint guidelines thus shows that Cambodia is now at a moderate risk of debt distress.
Reaching debt rescheduling agreements with the United States and the Russia would
further marginally reduce the risk of debt distress. An additional scenario is added to
illustrate the case where Cambodia reaches debt rescheduling agreements with the two
creditors and begins servicing debts in 2007.16 It shows that NPV of external debt-to-GDP
ratio would drop by 3 percentage points to 19 percent in 2007, and steadily decline to
7 percent of GDP in 2027. The debt service-to-exports ratio remains below 1 percent over the
projection period.
D. Public Debt Sustainability
Given that most of public debt is external debt, the public debt dynamics closely follow
the external debt dynamics. Under the baseline scenario, the nominal stock of public debt,
which amounted to 33 percent of GDP at end-2006, is projected to decline to 30 percent
in 2007. The NPV of public sector debt-to-GDP ratio would fall steadily from 23 percent in
2007 to 8 percent by 2027. The NPV of public debt-to-revenue ratio, which was 176 percent
at end-2006, is also projected to decline over the projection period. The debt-service-torevenue ratio also remains low in most scenarios because of the concessionality of the
existing debts.

15

Contrary to the DSA, which assumes that nominal GDP in US$ would fall by almost as much as the
depreciation, a depreciation in the case of Cambodia would affect nominal GDP in US$ only marginally.
16

For the U.S. debt, the payment schedule based on the latest bilateral agreement sent by the United States
(48 consecutive semi-annual back-loaded installments commencing in 2012 and an interest rate of 3 percent) is
assumed. For the Russian debt, the disputed US$40 million loans are classified as post-cut-off-date debt, and
the interest rates on the post-cut-off-date debt is assumed to rise gradually from 2.5 to 5.75 percent throughout
payment period.

5
An additional bound test is performed to characterize one-time large-scale commercial
borrowing to finance either onshore infrastructure development for the oil sector that does
not significantly boost growth or a major bailout of the banking sector (Bound test B6 of
Table A2).17 This shows that the debt NPV ratios increase sharply and remain high until
2012. With the interest rate still below nominal GDP growth, the ratios fall over the long
term.
Maintenance of prudent fiscal policies is key to continued debt sustainability. The
historical scenario—in which real GDP growth and primary deficits are at historical averages
(9.8 and 2.0 percent, respectively)—illustrates the case where the government runs
significant primary deficits over the long term. Despite continued high GDP growth, deficit
financing at less concessional terms leads to rising debt burden indicators. Debt sustainability
would be at greater risk if the government borrowed at commercial terms.
E. Conclusion
Staffs conclude that Cambodia’s debt is sustainable, and it faces a moderate risk of debt
distress. No distress thresholds are breached in the baseline, with only two thresholds being
breached briefly in the standard stress tests. The moderate risk rating is also reinforced by
two qualitative considerations: (i) the uncertainty over the contingent liabilities presented by
contracts already signed with foreign operators in infrastructure sectors; and (ii) the existence
of external arrears to the Russian Federation and the United States. Debt rescheduling
agreements, when concluded, will reduce the risk even further if baseline assumptions—
improved revenue performance and sustained growth—hold.
The risks to the debt path would seem to be fairly evenly balanced. On the one hand, the
positive impact of oil production on growth, exports and fiscal revenues in the longer term
would reduce the risks Cambodia faces. This would assume continued prudent economic
policies—including strengthening its non-oil revenue base—and export diversification. On
the other hand, borrowing against the uncertain future oil revenues could present problems.
Staffs also note that while the situation may be sustainable, policy built on arrears
accumulation may not be appropriate. Failure to reach the debt agreements over the medium
term could also give rise to reputational damage and continue to preclude a financial
arrangement with the Fund. Further, close attention needs to be paid to Cambodia’s debt
management strategy, especially regarding less concessional loans, as it could impair
sustainability, especially in the presence of a low revenue base and weak institutions.

17

This assumes that Cambodia issues a sovereign US$ bond with a face value of 10 percent of GDP in 2008, at
9 percent interest rate and 15-year maturity.

7/ Debt services are cash basis until 2006.
8/ Includes effect of MDRI debt relief.

6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 8 years, since the consistent balance of payments data are only available since 1999.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative

As part of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative the IMF Executive Board on January 5, 2006
approved relief on 100 percent of debt incurred by Cambodia to the IMF before January 1, 2005.
This resulted in all Cambodia’s outstanding debt to the IMF, a total of SDR 56.8 million (about
US$82 million) being forgiven. The authorities intend to spend the resources over a number of
years, initially on rural irrigation projects. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) transferred the
full MDRI proceeds to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, effective March 2006.
VIII.

Safeguards Assessment:

Under the Fund’s safeguard assessment policy, the NBC is subject to a full safeguard assessment
with respect to the successor PRGF Arrangement. The assessment was completed in March 2004

3
and specific measures were proposed to address weaknesses in financial reporting, internal audit
and internal control systems. An update is expected to be undertaken in the second half of 2007.
IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Cambodia officially follows a managed float with no pre-announced exchange rate path, although
in recent months the arrangement has resembled a de facto peg to the dollar. The official
exchange rate, which is expressed in Riels per U.S. dollar, applies to all official external
transactions conducted by the government and state enterprises and is used for accounting
purposes by the National Bank of Cambodia. It is determined by the foreign exchange market,
with the rate adjusted to be within 1 percent of the market rate on a daily basis. On May 31, 2007,
the official exchange rate was CR 4,059 per U.S. dollar and the market rate CR 4,061 per
U.S. dollar.
Cambodia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on January 1, 2002.
Cambodia maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions.
X.

Article IV Consultation:

Cambodia is subject to the provisions on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002. The
Executive Board concluded the last Article IV consultation on July 7, 2006 (Country Report
No. 04/328).
XI.

Technical Assistance:

There are currently two resident advisors in Cambodia: a Banking advisor and a multi-sector
Statistics advisor. The Regional Technical Assistance Strategy sees continued substantial
technical assistance being delivered to Cambodia, focused on public financial management,
customs administration, the financial sector and economic statistics. The overall level of input
will however decrease slightly as the emphasis moves further away from full-time resident
advisors towards subject-specific short-term inputs. A summary of recent technical assistance
inputs is at Table 1.
XI.

Resident Representative:

The resident representative office was closed in October 1997, and re-opened at endOctober 1999. Mr. Nelmes is currently the Resident Representative.

ANNEX II. CAMBODIA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP18
(As of May 2007)
The Royal Government of Cambodia’s (RGC) Rectangular Strategy for Growth,
Employment, Equity and Efficiency in Cambodia (2004) identifies improved governance as
“the most important precondition to economic development with sustainability, equity and
social justice.” This analysis accords with that set out in the World Bank Group’s 2005–2008
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (May 2005), which stresses the need to improve
governance in order to maximize the impact of development efforts. The CAS activities are
intended to contribute to six objectives, which are clustered under two over-arching pillars.
Activities under Pillar 1 are intended to help implement improvements in governance that are
needed if Cambodia is to meet the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals (CMDGs). To
this end, the CAS establishes four objectives.
1. Addressing aspects of economic governance that raise the cost of doing business, deter
investment and trade, and hold back broad-based private sector development.
2. Supporting policy and institutional reforms that help the rural poor receive more benefits
from sustainable natural resources management, by improving transparency and
accountability in the governance of natural resources and land in particular.
3. Addressing core issues of public financial management (PFM) as fundamental for
improved service delivery, by supporting the Government's PFM Reform Program and
the formulation of strategies for reform of civil service pay and employment.
4. Promoting accountability by supporting decentralization and promoting citizens’
partnerships for better governance.
Pillar 2 of the CAS allocates World Bank resources to supporting the strategy development
and investments needed to attain the CMDGs. To these ends, the Bank Group first will
encourage the emergence of poverty-focused approaches to the formulation and
implementation of public policy by supporting the new National Strategic Development Plan
(NSDP 2006-2010). Second, where there are clear gaps in critical infrastructure and human
development sub-sectors, the Bank Group will support the emergence of a nationally-owned
vision and strategy through the provision of analytical and investment services.
V. PILLAR 1: IMPROVING GOVERNANCE TO ATTAIN THE CMDGS
A. Private Sector Development
The Government has made some significant progress in improving the private sector
investment climate but more work needs to be done, particularly on the structural reforms
needed to support sustainable, private sector-led growth In addition to providing private
sector-related technical support to the Government through assistance to the Government
Private Sector Forum, the Bank Group, including the IFC, the Foreign Investment Advisory
Service, and the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility, has continued to provide
18

Prepared by World Bank staff.

7
inputs to the Government's Private Sector Development Strategy through an investment
climate assessment and value chain analysis. The objective of this effort has provided focus
on a three-fold strategy aimed at removing impediments to productivity growth, to help
diversify the economy, and to increase the role of the private sector in service delivery. The
2004 Investment Climate Assessment findings identified overlapping trade facilitation,
inspection, and licensing processes of various agencies as contributing to an excessive
regulatory burden and a high incidence of corruption. In light of these findings, the Bank is
focusing its efforts on operationalizing the reform recommendations through the 2005 Trade
Facilitation and Competitiveness Project (TFCP) with participation from other donors,
including the European Commission, AusAID, and IMF. Its key component will streamline
import and export processes, and the Bank and Fund are working together on customs
automation. Solid progress has been made in the customs automation work, resulting in part
from joint Bank–Fund efforts. The Customs and Excise Department is expected to adopt a
Single Administrative Document (SAD) in the third quarter of 2007 and to pilot the
ASYCUDA Customs Automated System by end-2007. A sector-wide approach (SWAp) on
private sector development is being reviewed in line with other donors to provide a unified
input into supporting required reforms in private sector development.
Work is also being done on labor standards and relations with the objective of supporting
stronger and more equitable private sector growth. Working conditions monitoring (Better
Factories Cambodia) is being supported under the TFCP and a component on developing
more effective labor dispute resolution processes is slated for inclusion in the forthcoming
Demand for Good Governance Project (FY08).
At the level of micro-enterprise the Bank is developing a project called Empowerment of the
Poor in Siem Reap (EPSR). The EPSR project seeks to improve incomes and capacities of
the poor in Siem Reap by more effectively linking their livelihoods to the province’s growth
engine - the tourism industry.
B. Natural Resources Management
With 85 percent of the population living in rural areas, and 79 percent of the poor mainly
depending on agriculture and natural resource for their livelihoods, economic growth and
poverty reduction will to a large extent depend on reviving the rural economy. The objectives
of the Land Management and Administration Project (2002) are to reduce poverty, promote
social stability, and stimulate economic development. The specific objectives of the project
are to improve land tenure security and promote the development of efficient land markets.
These objectives are achieved through: (i) development of national policies, the regulatory
framework, and institutions for land administration; (ii) issuance and registration of titles in
urban and rural areas; and (iii) establishment of an efficient and transparent land
administration system. A proposed Land Allocation for Social and Economic Development
Project (FY08) is under preparation. In June 2005, the Bank completed a Rural Sector
Strategy Note (RSSN), which aimed to identify critical rural development issues and options
to address them.

8
C. Public Financial Management
The joint WB-ADB Integrated Fiduciary Assessment and Public Expenditure Review, 2003
(IFAPER) found that though Cambodia had made some progress in reforming public
expenditure policy and management, it would have to make much more progress on fiscal,
fiduciary, and institutional challenges in order to implement its development agenda. In
comparative perspective, Cambodia’s PFM system ranks below average, indicating the need
for substantial upgrading.
The Government launched its Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP) in
December 2004. The PFMRP comprises a detailed, sequenced, and time-bound action plan, a
performance management framework, and measures to address organizational reform,
including staff incentives. Over the past two years the Ministry of Economy and Finance
(MEF) has made good progress. Major reforms measures commenced implementation in
January 2007, including: a significant streamlining of budget execution procedures, the
introduction of program budgeting, and adoption of a new chart of accounts. These follow on
significant reforms in 2005: the amount of customs revenue collected through the banking
system increased (from zero in 2004 to nearly 1/3 in 2006); more than ¾ of all Tax
Department revenue is now collected through the banking system; about ¾ of Treasury
payments to suppliers in Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville are now made by check instead of
cash; the stock of old expenditure arrears has been reduced by over 40 percent; the
procurement process has been streamlined, tightened, and made more competitive with the
passing of a new sub-decree in late 2006; the Government has set up internal audit
departments in a dozen line ministries, and, for the first time in Cambodia, a pilot program
has been launched to pay civil servants through commercial banks instead of by cash.
A joint effort of eleven of Cambodia’s development partners committed to assist in
strengthening the Government’s ability to lead and implement this agenda and to provide
fully coordinated support via a sector wide approach (SWAp). The Bank is supporting the
PFMRP, including oil revenue management, through the Public Financial Management and
Accountability Project (June 2006). In addition, the Bank leads the donor group and manages
a Multi-Donor Trust Fund to support the program on behalf of AusAID, DFID, and the EC.
The collaborative approach is supported by the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) secretariat, as envisioned in the recent Bank-Fund board paper.19 The
Fund has provided extensive TA to the RGC in tax and customs administration and selected
areas in budget management and Treasury operations. The Bank and Fund have established a
productive working relationship on PFM.
The IFAPER also found serious problems afflicting the civil service: low and compressed
pay, low skills, and thus low capacity. Low public sector wages provide a breeding ground
for corrupt practices and are a leading cause of Cambodia’s relatively poor standing on
public sector performance. The Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)
ranks Cambodia in the fourth lowest quintile among low income countries on issues
pertaining to public sector management and institutions.
19

“Bank/Fund Collaboration on Public Expenditure Issues,” February 14, 2003.

9
However, despite the Bank’s provision of a significant amount of grant funding in 2004 for
the Council for Administrative Reform to carry out an agreed set of studies that would
provide the analytical foundation for reform, progress has been minimal. The pace of civil
service reform—and the resources that the Government has devoted to it—do not appear to
match the seriousness of the problems caused by Cambodia’s weak civil service. Donors
believe that reform of public administration is essential if there is to be progress in
implementing the Rectangular Strategy and NSDP, and are appealing to the Government to
consider how this work can be reinvigorated.
The Bank is working with government ministries and other donors to pilot accelerated pay
and employment reform in high priority sectors. The Merit Based Pay Initiative (MBPI),
which is an official Government program, has recently been agreed and is now being
implemented first in MEF. The MBPI provides for substantial increases in remuneration for a
small group of officials in MEF (about 10 percent in 2007) selected based on merit and
performance management. The MBPI aims to introduce the principles and practices of
meritocracy into the Cambodian civil service.
D. Decentralization and Accountability
Cambodia’s framework of accountability, derived from the Constitution, is based on three
key relationships of accountability: (i) between elected officials and those responsible for
delivering essential services to citizens; (ii) between citizens and the state; and (iii) between
those who deliver services and the citizens who receive these services. The work under this
objective is concerned with all three of these relationships. The primary investment vehicle
will be projects at the commune level—the lowest level at which citizens interact with the
state, elected representatives, and service providers. Analytical work and partnerships will
support the evolving vision for deconcentration and decentralization and will contribute to
establishing an enabling environment for civic engagement.
The Bank’s primary investment support to decentralization is through the ongoing Rural
Investment and Local Governance Project (RILGP, FY03-FY06), for which additional
financing of about $36 million will be provided in FY08, and a future planned RILGP II.
RILGP supports improved local governance as a foundation for sustainable development and
poverty reduction by strengthening the newly decentralized development process at the
commune level and providing grants for priority rural infrastructure and related public goods
identified through this local planning process. RILGP II (2009) will be the Bank’s main
lending support to the new decentralized mechanisms once they are clarified. In addition, the
Bank is developing a Demand for Good Governance (DFGG) project for FY08. The DFGG
project’s objective is to promote good governance by building the capacities of institutions,
and supporting programs and coalitions that promote, mediate, respond to or monitor demand
for good governance. In doing this the DFGG project will focus on: (i) governance at the
sub-national level; (ii) labor dispute resolution; (iii) media; and (iv) legal awareness. The
project will involve separate funding windows for state and non-state institutions and
encourage partnerships across them to enhance effectiveness.
VI. PILLAR 2: SUPPORTING STRATEGY AND INVESTMENTS TO ATTAIN THE CMDGS
This work also falls under the following sub-components:

10
A. Poverty-focused Public Policy
Cambodia Equity Report and Related Initiatives. The Bank, with inputs from local
research partners, CDRI (Cambodia Development Resource Institute), and IRL (Indochina
Research Limited) has led the production of the Cambodia Equity Report, to be released at
the forthcoming CDCF Meeting in June 2007. The topic for the Equity Report was suggested
by the RGC following the March 2006 CG meeting at which the problem of rising inequality
was discussed. The report will analyze dimensions of inequality in Cambodia, such as
income and consumption, access to health and education services, control over assets and
land, the impact of formal and informal institutions on inequality, the changing aspect of
gender-based inequality, as well as examine inequality trends in urban and rural contexts.
The analysis is based primarily on the 2004 Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey (CSES) and
the 2006 Cambodian Health and Demographic Survey (CDHS), complemented by mixed
methods research into local variations and household poverty dynamics (the Moving out of
Poverty Study).
National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP). An NSDP Secretariat, chaired by the
Ministry of Planning (MOP) with inputs from the Supreme National Economic Council
(SNEC), is charged with coordinating the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the
RGC’s five year plan, the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP, 2006-2010),
approved by the National Assembly in May 2006. The NSDP, which constitutes the RGC’s
second poverty reduction strategy, guides the implementation of the vision laid out in the
Government’s Rectangular Strategy (RS) and the Cambodian MDGs. The WB and the UN
Resident Coordinator serve as co-lead donor facilitators for the Technical Working Group on
Planning and Poverty Reduction (TWG-PPR), and coordinate all donor inputs and advice to
the MOP regarding NSDP implementation, such as producing the Annual Progress Report,
developing the Ministry of Planning Strategic Plan (MPSP), and supporting capacity building
initiatives for stakeholders involved in the NSDP process. The TWG-PPR is also
contributing to aid effectiveness and donor coordination around the NSDP by initiating
discussions on moving toward a Program Based Approach (PBA) for the Ministry of
Planning.
B. Investment and Analytical Services for Infrastructure and Social Service Delivery
Social Sector Policy Dialogue. In the health sector the key policy issues under discussion
are: (i) improved effectiveness of health financing through improved sector wide planning
and budgeting processes, equity funds (access to health services for the poor), and
contracting with NGOs for improved service delivery and outcomes; and (ii) pay and
employment reform in the Ministry of Health. The recent joint health sector performance
review established maternal and child health as health priorities. The Bank, along with other
partners, is preparing a Health Sector Support Program (II) that will focus on these priorities.
In the education sector the Bank has been an active contributor to the Education Strategic
Plan and the Education Sector Support Program. The key policy issues the Bank is focusing
on are: (i) disparities in education participation rates by different regions, income groups, and
gender; (ii) inefficiency and poor quality in education service delivery at primary, secondary,
and tertiary levels; (iii) weak local management capacity; (iv) lack of reliability in education
finance disbursements; and (v) pay and employment reform. The Bank, along with other
partners, is helping Cambodia access significant volumes of additional funding for basic

11
education under the Education for All Fast Track Initiative for which Cambodia has recently
become eligible. Both the education and health sectors have undertaken public expenditure
tracking surveys, which provide insights into ensuring that these additional funds for health
and education are spent in a transparent manner and reach the intended beneficiaries.
Energy Sector Strategy. Donors are currently supporting the Government to develop a
coherent energy sector strategy and implementation plan. The work consists of three phases.
The first phase focuses on the issues identification and was completed in 2006. The key
findings are documented in the World Bank report "Cambodia--Energy Sector Strategy
Review: Issues Paper," which reviews the issues in several subsectors including electric
power, rural electrification, renewable energy, petroleum industry, and coal mining.
Currently, a Hydropower Development Master Plan is being developed and the Power
Development Plan was recently updated. The Bank has just completed preparation of a GMS
Power Trade Project (FY07) that will enable Cambodia to buy electricity from Vietnam and
Laos. Due to the urgency of the emerging oil and gas sector issues, the donor community has
recently been organized to provide coordinated policy advice and technical support to the
government. The proposed donor work program covers several aspects of the oil and gas
sector, including sector policy, sector structure, legal framework, fiscal framework,
transparency and revenue management. Oil and Gas ‘Sector Policy Notes’ have been
prepared and distributed, and the Bank is supporting Cambodia’s endorsement of the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) through the PRGO program.
The Poverty Reduction and Growth Operation (PRGO) Program
PRGO-1, the first in a series of three annual operations, selectively focuses on the key reform
areas of private sector development (PSD), public financial management (PFM), and land
and natural resources management (LNRM) (subsequent PRGOs would broaden the
coverage to other priority sectors).20 The PRGO process is designed to strengthen the linkage
between results and donor assistance. The operation is supporting the implementation of the
policy agenda laid out in the RS and the NSDP. The PRGO is linked closely to the joint
monitoring indicators (JMIs) agreed at the 2004 and 2006 CG Meetings so that the reform
program remains government-owned and led and supported by the entire donor community
collectively (viz., the prior actions for PRGO-1 are a subset of the CG Meeting JMIs).
The prior actions for PRGO-1 focus on key issues in each of the three areas: in LNRM the
prior actions address the issues of state land management and economic land concessions; in
PSD the prior actions focus on trade facilitation and investment law; in public financial
management the prior actions focus on budget process and treasury operations, procurement,
and meritocratic pay and employment reform.
Staffs have coordinated closely on the Fund’s policy dialogue and the PRGO program.
Though there are several areas where the PRGO program and the Fund’s dialogue overlap—
20

Negotiations on PRGO-1 were successfully completed on April 24, 2007, and the Bank
hopes to send the operation to the Executive Directors for approval in early FY08, after
agreement has been reached with the Government on repayment on misprocured contracts.

12
LNRM, PSD, and PFM—the Bank and Fund have ensured that their interventions are
complementary and mutually reinforcing, while not overlapping on any specific areas.
Comprehensive consultations are on-going, most recently taking place during the Fund
mission in May 2007, but continuing at the country office level on a regular basis.
Lending Operations and Non-lending Instruments
Proactive portfolio management continues to be a very high priority for the Bank Group.
Following the 2004-2005 Fiduciary Review carried out in partnership with the Royal
Government of Cambodia, the World Bank's Institutional Integrity Department (INT) carried
out separate investigations in 2005-2006. The INT investigations substantiated allegations of
corruption, collusion, and fraudulent practices on several contracts under seven projects (four
active21 and three closed22). As a result the Bank declared several contracts “misprocured” in
June 2006. In addition the Bank temporarily suspended23 disbursements under three projects
(LMAP, PRIP and PPUWSSP) and established action plans for the concerned Government
agencies to execute in order to lift the suspensions. These action plans were completed in
January 2007 and the Bank lifted the suspensions on all three projects in the first half of
February 2007. In addition, the Royal Government of Cambodia decided to establish and
implement anti-corruption actions plans for all active and future Bank-financed operations.
The Bank is actively assisting all concerned agencies to complete these actions plans by the
end of June 2007. One of the strongest portfolio measures being implemented consists of the
hiring of a specialized consultancy firm to act as a procurement agent for the Government.
Overall disbursement under the portfolio has been much lower than previous years due to the
suspension of disbursement on three projects.
Non-lending instruments and operations (credits and grants) are described in the following
tables.

Biodiversity and Protected Areas Management Project (BPAMP); the Land Management and Administration
Project (LMAP); Provincial and Rural Infrastructure Project (PRIP); and Provincial and Peri-Urban Water
Supply and Sanitation Project (PPWSP).
22

Flood Emergency and Rehabilitation (FERP), Forestry Concession Management and
Control Pilot Project (FCMCPP), and Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project (APIP).

Suspension is a remedial measure available under all World Bank legal agreements. It can
be exercised by the Bank in a number of situations, including when the borrower is not
fulfilling its obligations under the legal agreement. Suspension entails a temporary freeze on
the Bank's financing of implementation; it does not mean that the Bank withdraws from the
project. Rather, the Bank steps up its supervision, dialogue, and other activities to help the
Government in its efforts to meet the conditions for lifting the suspension.

The sector composition and loan/grant amounts of the remaining active portfolio is as
follows: agriculture and natural resources ($73.6 million); education ($63.0 million); energy
($64.3 million); finance ($10.0 million); health, nutrition and social protection ($29.0
million); industry and trade ($35.6 million); law, economic management and public policy
($17.8 million); multi-sector ($43.2 million); transport and communication ($92.0 million);
and water supply, sanitation and waste management ($44.3 million).
During the same period, the AsDB also designed and administered 141 technical assistance
projects amounting to $ 91.4 million. They were financed through grants from AsDB’s
Technical Assistance Special Fund ($32.6 million), the Japanese Special Fund ($38.7
million), and other sources ($20.1 million). In 2006, the AsDB approved two loans: Second
Power Transmission and Distribution ($20.0 million) and GMS: Rehabilitation of the
Railway in Cambodia ($42.0), and one grant: Commune Council Development, Phase II
($7.8 million).
AsDB’s overarching goal in Cambodia is sustainable poverty reduction. AsDB’s Country
Strategy and Program (CSP 2005-2009) will focus on: (i) broad-based economic growth
through investments in physical infrastructure, development of the financial sector,
sustainable development of small and medium-scale enterprises, and investments in
agriculture and irrigation; (ii) inclusive social development through basic education,
empowering vulnerable groups such as women and ethnic minorities, control of
communicable diseases, the provision of rural water supply and sanitation facilities, and
community-based sustainable management and conservation of natural resources in the Tonle
Sap Basin; and (iii) good governance through improving accountability and service delivery,

16
supporting legal, regulatory and policy reforms, strengthening institutional capacity building,
and improving efficiency and effectiveness of project implementation. A focus on the Tonle
Sap basin to address geographical disparities in development, and a subregional focus to
benefit from the broader opportunities provided by AsDB’s Greater Mekong Sub-region
program are also included. Four cross-cutting themes, namely governance, private sector
development, gender, and the environment are also proposed to support the poverty reduction
objectives of the country strategy.
The CSP was developed based on wide ranging consultations with the Government, donors,
civil society, and the private sector. In particular, AsDB, the World Bank, the United
Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID), and the UN agencies
undertook a joint strategic planning process for their country strategies which resulted in
shared analysis and assessments.

ANNEX IV. CAMBODIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
43. Despite significant shortcomings in some areas, core economic and financial data
provided to the Fund are generally adequate for surveillance. In March 2002, metadata were
posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board, and Cambodia began participation in
the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).
44. Extensive technical assistance from the IMF, UNDP, AsDB, and World Bank has
contributed to substantial improvements in the macroeconomic statistics. A long-term IMF
advisor has worked in the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) since October 2001 (with a
one-year interruption) to assist the authorities in upgrading economic and financial statistics.
A new Statistics Law was passed by the National Assembly in March 2005. Technical
assistance from the UNDP will facilitate the implementation of the Statistics Law provisions
in relation to establishing governance, coordination, and dissemination mechanisms, as well
as general statistical training.
National accounts and price statistics
45. Annual and quarterly official GDP estimates are produced with support from the AsDB’s
peripatetic expert and a long-term IMF advisor. The national accounts series was updated in
2006 incorporating new household survey data and leading to an upward revision in growth
rates. Final estimates for the national accounts for 2006 were published in May, 2007 and
first quarter estimates for 2007 were published in June 2007. Nevertheless, the quality of
GDP estimates remains hampered by the lack of comprehensive and reliable sectoral
information.
46. The NIS provides a monthly CPI with a five-week lag; this series was recently updated
with new expenditure weights and rebased to July–December 2000 = 100. Since July 2000,
the NIS has compiled a quarterly urban CPI for five major provincial cities and Phnom Penh.
A quarterly producer price index has been developed, with support from STA and financing
from the AsDB. The experimental producer price index was released in April 2005, and a
manual entitled “Cambodian Prices Statistics: Concepts, Sources and Methods” was recently
published. However, compilation of the PPI has been discontinued owing to resource
constraints.
Government finance statistics
47. The Ministry of Economy and Finance provides monthly fiscal data (broadly based on
GFS standards) with a four-week lag. There remain, however, certain weaknesses with
regard to the reliability of source data, coverage, and the economic and functional
classifications of expenditure. Data on donor-financed projects are available with a
considerable lag. Some of these issues are currently being addressed. With the support of a
Treasury advisor (FAD) and a Statistical Advisor (STA), in 2007 the authorities implemented
a reform of the government accounting system and budgetary nomenclature based on the
classification of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. Initial teething problems
with the implementation of these new procedures have slowed fiscal reporting in the first half
of 2007. In addition, several STA missions to improve GFS compilation procedures and

18
assist with the implementation of the new methodology have taken place in recent years, the
latest in February 2006.
48. In 2005, the authorities resumed providing monthly fiscal data for publication in IFS after
a pause of several months, and for the first time reported data for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.
Monetary and financial statistics
49. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) provides monthly data on the monetary
authorities and deposit money banks with a four-week lag. In addition to the accounts of the
monetary authorities and deposit money banks, the NBC also compiles the sectoral balance
sheet and the survey for central bank and other depository corporations in accordance with
the methodology recommended in the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
Since August 2005, the NBC has reported monetary and financial statistics to STA using the
Standardized Report Forms (SRFs).
External sector statistics
50. The NBC is responsible for compiling balance of payments statistics. Customs data have
substantial coverage and valuation problems arising from the nonrecording of no dutiable
imports, underreporting of re-exports, and weaknesses in customs controls. While there have
been improvements in the quality of foreign direct investment data, private capital flows are
believed to be large and not fully captured in the official data. A range of international
transactions by enterprises, such as payments for imported services, income payments, and
portfolio investment abroad are not included in the data. In January 2003, the authorities
implemented an International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) to collect data on
international transactions made through the banking system to improve balance of payments
estimates. An STA balance of payments statistics mission in March–May 2004 reviewed
source data used for compiling the balance of payments and recommended improvements;
the multisector statistics advisor currently residing in Cambodia is assist in improving the
external sector statistics. Gross external debt data are provided by the Ministry of Economy
and Finance, but public and publicly guaranteed debt by maturity, the external debt service
schedule, and timely information on disbursements by bilateral donors are not available.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 31, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Cambodia
On July 25, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Cambodia.24
Background
Strong macroeconomic policies have enabled Cambodia to achieve impressive growth
and make inroads into poverty. Supported by prudent fiscal and monetary policies that
have strengthened the economy’s resilience to shocks, growth has averaged over
9 percent since 2000, accelerating in recent years. Anchored in part by the
extraordinarily high degree of dollarization, inflation has remained low and confidence
increased. Growth, however, has been narrowly based on the garment and tourism
sectors, with the agricultural sector only making a sustained contribution in recent years.
The overall poverty rate has declined markedly, but with a rise in inequality, and remains
uncomfortably high in rural areas. Progress will have to be accelerated if Cambodia is to
meet the Millennium Development Goals.
Macroeconomic performance in 2006 was impressive. Growth in 2006 was 10¾ percent,
based on continued growth in agriculture, following the record-breaking year of 2005
and buoyant exports. Construction and services, particularly the financial sector,
24

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments
and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN
summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the July 25, 2007
Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

2
underpin a vibrant urban economy. Inflation has recently picked up slightly as a result of
rising fish and petroleum prices, but is expected to remain around 4 percent, assuming
broadly stable international oil prices for the rest of the year.
Garments and tourism exports grew by more than 20 percent in 2006 while imports
increased on the back of strong GDP growth and high oil prices, leading to an external
current account deficit (excluding official transfers) of around 7 percent of GDP. External
financing came mainly from aid and foreign direct investment focused on garments,
tourism, agriculture, and construction.
Fiscal policy continues to be prudent. The overall fiscal deficit in 2006 remained stable
at around 3¼ percent of GDP (excluding the proceeds of debt relief from the Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative). Revenue collections exceeded expectations, particularly from
domestic taxes, while expenditure restraint led to further increases in government bank
deposits and significant reductions in domestic arrears. These trends continued in early
2007.
Money demand is accelerating, boosting the mainly dollarized financial sector. Broad
money is growing at an annual rate of around 40 percent, mainly reflecting increases in
bank deposits, almost entirely in dollars. Credit to the private sector, also in dollars, is
growing even more rapidly but the level remains very low at only 12 percent of GDP.
The exchange rate is stable and reserve growth is healthy. The riel has remained
broadly stable in bilateral and effective terms with some small nominal appreciation in
early-2007. Increased demand for riel, in part as a result of improved tax compliance,
has allowed the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) to make larger-than-expected dollar
purchases from the market. NBC’s reserves now exceed US$1.2 billion, albeit with a
continued small build up of external arrears with respect to the old debt outstanding to
the United States and Russia.
Progress has been made on structural reforms but much remains to be done. Efforts in
the fiscal and financial sectors are bearing fruit, with notable achievements being the
implementation of new government expenditure and accounting procedures and
strengthened prudential regulations for the banking sector. However, legal and judicial
reform progress has been much slower. Efforts to strengthen the draft anti-corruption
law halted pending review of the penal code and an anti-corruption unit in the Council of
Ministers was created in the interim. The Law on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter
Financing of Terrorism and Customs Law passed, but drafts of the Insolvency Law and
the Law on the Status of Judges and Prosecutors are still being debated at the Ministry
level.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Cambodian authorities for their sound
macroeconomic policies, which have promoted rapid growth with domestic and external
stability, and allowed inroads to be made in reducing poverty. Cambodia’s fiscal position
is strong, public and external debt are sustainable, and inflation has remained low. To
promote the diversification of the sources of growth and sustain poverty reduction,

3
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to make improvements in public
services, the financial sector and the business environment, including by strengthening
governance.
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to a continued prudent fiscal policy
by avoiding domestic bank financing, while improving the level and quality of revenue
and expenditure. They welcomed the intentions to reorient public expenditure toward the
objectives of the National Strategic Development Plan, including with a view to tackling
rural poverty. They encouraged the authorities to increase good quality poverty-reducing
spending, including productive capital investment. Directors supported the government’s
policy of raising public sector wages to improve public services and discourage
corruption, while emphasizing the need to embed wage policy in a broad civil service
reform strategy.
Directors welcomed the recent progress made in public financial management reforms
that have strengthened the budget process and laid the foundations for more effective
spending. They noted the importance of enhancing cash management and identifying
spending priorities in the 2008 budget.
Directors considered that achieving the expenditure policy objectives would require
sustained increases in revenue. The recent impressive tax collection increases arising
from administration improvements were acknowledged. Nevertheless, there continues to
be a need for policy measures to broaden the tax base and improve the structure of the
tax system. Directors encouraged the authorities to implement initial steps as soon as
possible.
Directors considered Cambodia’s current exchange rate policy to be appropriate. They
noted the assessment that the riel is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals and
that the underlying external current account is in equilibrium. Given the need to
supplement international reserves, were sustained depreciation pressures to arise, they
should not be resisted.
Directors supported the National Bank of Cambodia’s accommodative monetary
approach, but cautioned that future wage and price developments should be monitored
for indications of inflation pressure. They noted that the advantages of dollarization as a
foundation for Cambodia’s macroeconomic stability and financial sector expansion
continue to outweigh the disadvantages from loss of seignorage and constraints on
monetary policy. In the long run—and provided the appropriate capacity and policy
conditions are in place—greater use of the riel would help strengthen the effectiveness
of monetary policy.
Directors called on the authorities to strengthen banking supervision and enforce
prudential regulations rigorously, to ensure that the financial sector continues to
contribute to macroeconomic stability. They encouraged the authorities to work with the
commercial banks to enhance the payments system and facilitate financial
intermediation, and welcomed the recent passage of the Anti-Money Laundering Law.

Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to good governance, as demonstrated
by the establishment of an anti-corruption unit in the Council of Ministers. They stressed
that continued improvements in governance will be crucial to enhance the business
environment, strengthen revenue collection, and promote expenditure effectiveness.
Directors encouraged the authorities to introduce appropriate anti-corruption legislation,
and to improve the management of state assets and concessions.
Directors observed that oil production would improve Cambodia’s economic prospects,
but also present challenges to ensure an appropriate balance between saving, investing
and consuming future oil revenues. They welcomed the authorities’ recognition that a
clear legal framework and strengthened taxation regime for the oil sector will be
essential. Directors encouraged the authorities to endorse the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to refrain from contracting
nonconcessional loans following Cambodia’s recently acquired sovereign credit ratings.
They called on the authorities to continue their current prudent borrowing policy, which
has ensured a highly concessional external debt structure that should safeguard debt
sustainability.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue efforts to resolve outstanding arrears
with official creditors, noting that a successful resolution would pave the way for
consideration of a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility arrangement. They welcomed
the Fund’s intensive policy engagement with Cambodia, including through the provision
of technical assistance.
