Discussions were held in Lilongwe and Blantyre during October 26–November 10,
2009 and continued via videoconference. Staff met with the Minister of Finance,
Mr. Kandodo, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM), Dr. Ligoya, the
Secretaries of the Treasury, Mr. Mwadiwa and Mr. Mwanamvekha, the General Manager
of the RBM, Dr. Banda, other senior government officials, and representatives of the
private sector, civil society, and development partners. The staff team comprised
Ms. Stotsky (head), Ms. Randall, Ms. Matlanyane, and Mr. Yartey (all AFR), and
Mr. Thornton (SPR). Mr. Itam and Ms. Teferra (OED) participated in the discussions.
The Fund’s resident representative, Mr. MacFarlan, and country economist,
Mr. Mulwafu, assisted the mission.
Staff recommends the approval of a three-year arrangement under the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF) in the amount of SDR 52.05 million (75 percent of quota),
based on understandings reached on the macroeconomic program and structural
reforms for the period 2010–12. A one-year Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF)
arrangement of SDR 52.05 million (75 percent of quota) was approved on December 3,
2008 (Country Report No. 09/16) and expired on December 2, 2009. The last Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement was completed on August 4, 2008.
The completion point for the enhanced HIPC Initiative was reached on August 31, 2006.
Outstanding Fund credit through January 2010 was SDR 80.95 million
(116.64 percent of quota).
The safeguards assessment was updated in December 2008 and is currently being
updated.
The joint IMF and World Bank staff advisory note on the first annual progress
report on the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy was presented to the
Executive Board on September 16, 2008.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


Malawi’s agricultural-based economy has weathered well the global economic storm,
with record harvests in recent years leading to 9.8 percent growth in 2008 and an
estimated 7.6 percent in 2009. Inflation has remained moderate. The financial sector
was only modestly affected by the global turmoil and remains well-capitalized and
profitable.



A loosening of fiscal and monetary policies during the run-up to last May’s elections
led to high government domestic borrowing in fiscal year 2008/09 (ending in June
2009), and rapid money and credit growth. This easing contributed to low
international reserves. The end-June 2009 ESF program targets for net domestic
repayment of the central government, and net domestic assets and net international
reserves of the RBM were missed by wide margins. The fiscal year 2009/10 budget
reflects a prudent fiscal stance, targeting a repayment of net domestic borrowing in
line with the medium-term objectives to maintain a low deficit and create room for
private sector credit.



A weak balance of payments threatens exchange rate and price stability and mediumterm growth. The de facto pegging of the Malawi kwacha to the U.S. dollar from
2006 to late 2009 helped to moderate inflation. But persistent inflation differentials
with trade partners and the peg led to some appreciation of Malawi’s real effective
exchange rate. Rapid growth of domestic incomes and exchange rate appreciation
have led to an imbalance between the growth of imports and exports and widened
external current account and balance of payments deficits.



The authorities have recently adopted a number of measures to address the external
imbalance, including initial steps at market liberalization, gradual depreciation of the
exchange rate, and strengthened budgetary spending controls. However, continued
policy adjustment and external support are critical.



Staff support the request by the Malawian authorities for a three-year arrangement
under the ECF with access of 75 percent of quota. This arrangement would support
Malawi’s efforts to sustain high growth and poverty reduction, underpinned by sound
macroeconomic and exchange rate policies, in line with the Malawi Growth and
Development Strategy, which incorporates its poverty reduction strategy.

debt and net domestic assets of the RBM were missed by wide margins and the central
government deficit was above target. The overrun on fertilizer reflected both high world
prices and unbudgeted purchases of fertilizer. The fiscal year 2009/10 budget returns to a
prudent fiscal stance. Preliminary results on execution through December 2009 are in line
with the budget, adjusted for donor support delays.1

3.
The monetary aggregates expanded rapidly in 2008 and early 2009 but tended
to stabilize towards mid 2009. Broad money growth fell to 19.4 percent on a 12-month
basis at end-October 2009, down from 33.1 percent at end-December 2008 (Tables 3a and
3b and Figure 2). The RBM’s policy rate remained at 15 percent in 2008 and 2009, while
the six-month t-bill rate fell slightly during the year.

4.
Financial sector indicators show a well-capitalized and profitable banking
system with low nonperforming loans (Table 3c). However, spreads remain high. The
RBM’s financial position has been strengthened by recapitalization, and staff and other
operating cost reductions.
5.
Malawi’s external position remains weak. In 2008, high tobacco prices led to
robust export growth, while high fertilizer and fuel prices and rising incomes and public
spending led to rapid import growth (Table 4 and Figure 3). Despite a further improvement
in the terms of trade in 2009, unexpectedly rapid import growth, reflecting the strong
economy and increased fiscal expenditures, led to a higher-than-programmed external
current account deficit. Consequently, the ESF program target for end-June 2009 on net
international reserves of the RBM was missed by a wide margin.
6.
Official reserves, chronically low, fell to less than one month of prospective
imports at end December 2009, well below a prudential three months or more of
import cover. Malawi needs a sizeable reserve cushion. Its high dependence on agriculture
and foreign aid make it vulnerable to exogenous shocks, such as poor weather or diminished
donor flows. In addition, the concentration on tobacco exports produces pronounced
seasonal volatility in foreign exchange flows, complicating monetary and exchange policy
management.
7.
In recent years, there have been periods of foreign exchange shortages and
rationing, and private import payment arrears (Box 1). The arrears that arose in early
2009 were reversed during the harvest season. As of late 2009, the authorities indicated that
all private import payment arrears had been cleared, though the banking sector continues to
face difficulties meeting foreign exchange demands for current account purposes.
Box 1. External Payment Arrears and Restrictions
Malawi has suffered recently from shortages of foreign exchange, reflected in private import payment
arrears; sizeable spreads between the official exchange rate and foreign exchange bureau and parallel
rates; and queues in commercial banks to obtain foreign exchange to purchase imports.2
Article VIII, Sections 2 and 3 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, obligations which Malawi accepted
in 1995, requires countries to refrain from imposing restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current transactions or engaging in multiple currency practices without the approval of the Fund.
External payment arrears arising from an official action are evidence of an exchange restriction subject
to Fund approval. The maintenance of unapproved exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices
constitute a breach of the Article VIII obligations.
Fund-supported programs also have a continuous performance criterion regarding exchange measures
inconsistent with Article VIII and non-accumulation of public sector external payment arrears.
2

The RBM defines import payment arrears as payments for imports already received that are overdue by more
than 30 days, which may arise when importers cannot purchase needed foreign exchange. Queues are defined
for program-monitoring purposes as the amounts of foreign exchange that businesses have applied for—but not
yet received—at commercial banks, for legitimate current account transactions.

In late 2009 and early 2010, RBM directives reverted the surrender of export earnings back

Foreign exchange queues and parallel market premiums, if sustained, can be
damaging to growth. Difficulties in accessing needed foreign exchange constrain growth
by increasing business uncertainty regarding import financing, hinder diversification by
encouraging businesses to stay small and informal, can lead to under-invoicing of exports or
over-invoicing of imports, and may result in the private sector shifting from official markets
to informal markets to circumvent the surrender requirements.5 Shortages of foreign
exchange for petroleum imports emerged in late 2009, requiring the petroleum importers’
consortium to source foreign exchange from a regional bank.

3

The decline in the premium in August 2009 reflects in part the impact of the closure of non-bank affiliated
foreign exchange bureaus, which has reduced competition in this market.
4

Tobacco exporters are required to surrender earnings to commercial banks at the commercial bank rate, while
exporters with foreign currency denominated accounts (FCDAs) can retain 60 percent of earnings in these
accounts. In practice, the smaller tobacco farmers tend to surrender all their foreign exchange earnings. Other
exporters of traditional products are required to surrender 40 percent of earnings to commercial banks at the
commercial bank rate. The earlier directives, now reversed, had required that tobacco farmers without FCDAs
surrender export earnings directly to the RBM at the official exchange rate, and tobacco exporters with FCDAs
and exporters of other traditional products surrender 40 percent of their receipts—20 percent to the RBM at the
official rate, and 20 percent to the commercial banks at the commercial bank rate.
5

Market participants spoke of the existence of an “offshore” market in the kwacha, where participants agreed
on their own exchange rate.

8
10.
Staff estimate that the real effective exchange rate (REER) is overvalued, within
a broad range of about 5 to 28 percent, impairing Malawi’s competitiveness. 6 The
official nominal exchange rate had been de facto pegged against the U.S. dollar at the rate of
about 141 Malawi kwacha per
U.S. dollar from 2006 to early

a modest inflation differential,
and some modest nominal
depreciation of the kwacha.7 Staff estimate that there is still a sizeable gap between the
REER and the equilibrium real exchange rate (Box 2).
11.
The one-year ESF arrangement, designed to assist Malawi to overcome external
shocks, expired on December 2, 2009, without completion of any reviews (Box 3). A
first tranche of SDR34.7 million (US$51.4 million) was drawn after Executive Board
approval of the program on December 3, 2008. The key performance criteria for the first and
second reviews, based on end-December 2008 and end-June 2009 targets, respectively, were
missed by wide margins. Given the medium-term nature of the difficulties confronting
Malawi, staff and the authorities agreed that the best approach would be to allow the ESF
arrangement to expire and to discuss instead a three-year ECF arrangement.

6

The REER assessment is complicated by a lack of data, frequent structural breaks, a current account that is
(analytically) constrained by foreign exchange rationing, and insufficient variation of the nominal and real
exchange rates, which prevent estimating with confidence the elasticity of the current account with respect to
changes in the exchange rate. The results are also sensitive to output growth and foreign aid flow assumptions.

7

Staff had characterized the exchange arrangement as “stabilized.” With the authorities’ recent commitment to
adjust the exchange rate to ensure the maintenance of a market-clearing rate, the exchange arrangement could
now be classified as “other managed,” in Fund staff’s classification.

9
Box 2. Assessment of Malawi’s Exchange Rate
Malawi’s exchange rate was assessed using three CGER methodologies, which consistently indicate that the REER
is overvalued. These results support evidence drawn from balance of payments indicators, foreign exchange
queues, and parallel market premiums. The program’s policies would contribute to aligning the exchange rate with
its underlying fundamentals.

5/ Appreciation (depreciation) needed in the real exchange rate to close the gap between norm and projection.



The Macroeconomic Balance approach calculates an equilibrium current account balance as a function of
macroeconomic fundamentals, and then assesses the degree of depreciation of the real exchange rate
necessary to close the gap between the projected current account balance and the equilibrium current account.
Malawi’s relative demographic profile, fiscal balance, income, openness and terms of trade volatility would
suggest a current account deficit of around 1 percent of GDP, compared with the 5.6 percent projection.



The External Sustainability approach targets the level of net foreign assets necessary to achieve reserves of
three months of imports. This would suggest a current account norm of 0.7 percent of GDP in order to
achieve the desired net foreign assets target, a result driven largely by Malawi’s weak reserve position. This
would require a REER depreciation ranging from 13.2 to 27.5 percent, depending on the assumed current
account elasticity.



The Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate approach suggests a somewhat smaller degree of overvaluation, of
about 5.3 percent. The degree of overvaluation has fallen in recent months as the dollar has declined against
the rand. This approach does, however, indicate that Malawi’s exchange rate has been somewhat overvalued
in recent years, a conclusion borne out by Malawi’s weak reserve position over the same timeframe.

Box 3. Economic Performance under Recent Fund Arrangements8
Malawi has had two arrangements with the Fund since the last ex-post assessment in September
2004: a PRGF arrangement (August 2005 to August 2008), and an ESF arrangement
(December 2008 to December 2009).
Performance under the PRGF arrangement was largely successful. While domestic borrowing
exceeded initial fiscal targets, domestic debt as a share of GDP sharply declined. HIPC debt
relief in 2006 also lowered the overall debt burden. Monetary restraint led to much lower
inflation and interest rates. These improvements were supported by a range of structural
reforms. A key weakness, however, was the lower-than-expected build-up in international
reserves—a consequence of much higher imports than projected, large cumulative terms of
trade declines, lower-than-expected budget support, over-borrowing relative to the initial
targets, and lack of exchange rate flexibility.
Performance under the ESF arrangement was less successful. The initial disbursement under
this arrangement helped Malawi weather the impact of shocks arising in 2008 from high
international fuel and food prices, and also catalyzed additional donor support. However,
important program slippages in the first half of 2009—especially in public spending—led to
much higher domestic borrowing than expected, and lower reserve accumulation. As a result of
these slippages, no program reviews were completed.

12.
Although there has been some progress toward the MDGs, poverty is still
widespread (Table 5). With gross national income per capita at around US$250 in 2007,
Malawi remains one of the poorest countries in the world. HIV/AIDS is prevalent and
electricity and running water availability are limited. The Malawi Growth and Development
Strategy (MGDS) emphasizes sustainable growth, social protection and development,
infrastructure development, and improved governance.9
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
The 2009 Article IV consultation discussions and ECF program negotiations
focused on the design of a medium-term program to restore Malawi’s external
equilibrium while sustaining a high rate of growth and poverty reduction, in line with
MGDS. In this regard, the program’s key objectives include:

This box substitutes for an ex-post assessment update, in accordance with the one-year suspension on such
updates approved by the Executive Board on August 28, 2009 (SM/09/213, Supplement 3).
9

The third annual review of the MGDS (which is Malawi’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper) will be finalized
in February 2010.

11
Restoring external equilibrium by:


Liberalizing the foreign exchange regime for current account transactions to allow a
market-clearing exchange rate to emerge and to eliminate measures inconsistent with
Article VIII by end-2011.



Attaining international reserve coverage of a minimum of three months of imports to
buffer against external shocks by end-2012.

Maintaining internal equilibrium by:


Pursuing prudent fiscal and monetary policies, as reflected in the fiscal year 2009/10
budget and through restrained monetary aggregate growth, to contain aggregate
demand and inflation pressures and shift demand toward domestic output.

Sustaining poverty reduction efforts by:


Creating room in the budget for more social and pro-poor spending.



Improving the structure of the social safety net to protect poor households from
shocks and policy adjustments, including exchange rate depreciation.

Building competitiveness by:


Improving public financial management, tax administration, and the efficiency and
solvency of public utilities;



Enhancing the business climate by expanding the capacity and quality of
infrastructure, promoting investor access to finance, and reforming legal and
regulatory frameworks governing financial supervision and the operation of other key
economic activities.
A. A Return to Fiscal and Monetary Discipline

14.
The programmed overall central government deficit is the same as in the
legislated budget. The ECF-supported program therefore accords with key budget goals,
such as to reduce government indebtedness, leave room for private sector credit growth, and
focus on poverty-reducing spending. It targets repayment of net domestic borrowing of
1.2 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2009/10, compared to 0.8 percent of GDP in the legislated
budget, reflecting slightly higher than estimated foreign inflows.10 The fiscal year 2009/10
budget addresses last year’s overspending through improved control of discretionary
spending, including on goods and services and fertilizer.
10

Domestic debt repayment is intended to raise government saving to support a stronger external current
account and reserve accumulation, without jeopardizing aid-financed spending.

12
15.
The authorities are committed to cutting lower priority expenditures or shoring
up revenues, while protecting social spending, if budget execution falls short of the
domestic repayment target. To protect poverty-reduction goals, the program includes an
indicative target for a floor on social spending. In addition, the authorities have committed
to ensuring that any costs associated with the newly purchased presidential jet (a first-year
payment of US$4.4 million or 0.08 percent of GDP out of a total cost of US$22 million) and
support to cotton producers (0.07 percent of GDP) are incorporated into the existing budget
ceilings through offsets of lower priority expenditures.
16.
The authorities have also taken steps to guard against the deficits in key
parastatals, such as the electricity company, the water boards, and Air Malawi, from
impinging on budget priorities. They have already announced adjustments to electricity
and water tariffs to cover a higher percentage of operating costs, and have committed to not
absorb any costs for restructuring or paying off Air Malawi’s debts in this fiscal year’s
central government budget, and to devise a cost-effective plan to deal with Air Malawi over
the medium term.
17.
The authorities have laid out a prudent medium-term fiscal policy framework.
They indicated that the fiscal year 2010/11 and medium-term budgets would be formulated
with a similar domestic repayment target as in this year’s budget and adherence to a modest
overall deficit under 3 percent of GDP to avoid any significant accumulation of debt. In
addition, staff and the authorities agreed that it will be important to continue strengthening
tax and customs administration. Key tax bases need to be broadened to allow the valueadded tax rate to be reduced to regional norms, and to offset the impact of further tariff
reforms that Malawi is committed to as part of regional integration.11 Finally, to ensure
sustained poverty reduction, the authorities intend to reform the social safety net to improve
targeting of households and are considering the expansion of a donor-financed pilot income
transfer program that addresses the needs of the poor, including landless households, and
which so far covers 7 of 26 districts and would cost US$68 million when scaled up to all
districts.
18.
Continued public financial management reforms are needed to reinforce fiscal
discipline. The government has made some progress over the past year in improving fiscal
accounting and reporting. Staff emphasized the importance of making fully operational the
Public Financial and Economic Management (PFEM) unit in the Ministry of Finance and
producing timely, consolidated, and reconciled accounts.
19.
Monetary policy is oriented toward achieving price stability, while providing
room for adequate credit to the private sector and supporting reserve accumulation
and a properly valued exchange rate. Monetary policy is anchored in a target for reserve
11

intention to reverse these measures soon in line with their regional commitments.

13
money, which is programmed to grow by about 16 percent in 2010 (about the same as
projected nominal GDP growth). The authorities indicated that there are sufficient tools to
conduct effective monetary policy, including through the active use of open market
operations, with RBM and treasury bills, to control growth of monetary aggregates. The
authorities agreed on the need to rely more heavily over time on adjustments of interest rates
to control inflation, while noting that the potential for using interest rates is now limited in
part because broader considerations are at times taken into account in setting rates.
B. Anchoring External Sustainability and Foreign Exchange Market Liberalization
20.
The authorities have begun taking steps, as prior actions for the ECF-supported
program, to liberalize the foreign exchange market and reduce excess demand for
foreign exchange. RBM directives in late 2009 and early 2010 have reversed the earlier
directives on foreign exchange surrender requirements to the RBM, increasing the role of
commercial banks in the foreign exchange market. In November 2009, the RBM announced
that the exchange rate would be managed with some flexibility, and by early-February 2010,
the exchange rate had depreciated to about 151 kwacha to the U.S. dollar.
21.
While valuing the past contribution of exchange rate stability to output growth
and price stability, the authorities acknowledged that current pressures on the
exchange rate warranted enhanced exchange rate flexibility. Staff noted that the
kwacha 141 peg was not sustainable given Malawi’s precariously low level of reserves and
that the fundamental exchange rate imbalance had intensified in recent years. Staff advised
that without exchange rate depreciation and supporting measures to liberalize the foreign
exchange regime, fiscal and monetary policies would have to be tighter than currently
envisaged to bring about the necessary reduction in excess demand for foreign exchange at
the prevailing exchange rate. The authorities agreed that prudent demand management,
including the tightening of last year’s loose fiscal and monetary measures, is important, and
that an appropriate balance needs to be struck between demand management and exchange
rate adjustment in restoring external equilibrium to avoid undesirable effects on growth and
poverty reduction.
22.
The ECF-supported program will entail concrete measures to liberalize the
foreign exchange regime and bring about a better balance of supply and demand of
foreign exchange. The authorities have committed to re-establishing an active interbank
market for foreign exchange, which has virtually ceased to function because the supply of
foreign exchange to commercial banks has largely dried up (Box 4). They have also
committed to reducing the role of the RBM in the market, and to improving monetary and
exchange policy transparency. By the end of 2010, the combination of a more flexible
exchange rate, liberalization, and supporting monetary and fiscal policies should lead to a
significant reduction in the foreign exchange queues and exchange rate premiums, and by
2011, a foreign exchange regime that operates without restriction on current account

14
transactions, with a unified, market-clearing exchange rate, in adherence to Malawi’s
obligations under Article VIII. 12
Box 4: Foreign Exchange Market Liberalization Measures, 2010–12
Restructuring the foreign exchange market is intended to ensure the maintenance of a market-clearing
exchange rate consistent with economic fundamentals, as laid out in the authorities’ Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). Key measures during the ECF-program period include:


Introducing flexibility in the exchange rate. The authorities have committed to adjusting the
exchange rate, as needed, to reach and maintain a market-clearing rate (MEFP ¶20). Prudent
management by the central bank will be required to smooth the transition.



Re-activating the interbank market for foreign exchange and reducing the RBM’s marketmaking role in 2010, supported by changes in institutions (MEFP ¶21).



Taking steps to allow all foreign exchange bureaus that meet fit and proper tests to operate
(MEFP ¶21)



Enhancing transparency by increasing and disseminating market information (MEFP ¶22).



Revising and updating laws and regulations pertaining to the foreign exchange market in
accordance with liberalization reforms and removing foreign exchange restrictions that impede
access to foreign exchange for current account transactions against appropriate documentation
(MEFP ¶22).



Encouraging market participants to build capacity to manage exchange rate risks, with RBM
monitoring (MEFP ¶22).



Introducing reliable and efficient settlement systems to increase the effectiveness of market
intermediaries (MEFP ¶22).



Eliminating current account restrictions under Article VIII by end-2011, while making a
significant reduction in queues and exchange rate premiums in 2010 (MEFP ¶26–27).

23.
The authorities have committed to undertaking further policy adjustments,
including of the exchange rate, to support foreign exchange market liberalization,
eliminate excess demand for foreign exchange, and achieve a market-based and
competitive exchange rate. The ECF-supported program will use three measures for
monitoring pressures in the foreign exchange market, and developments in all these
measures will be a focus of the first review. The monitoring of these measures will help to
provide a basis for assessing whether further policy adjustments, including potentially
further exchange rate adjustments, are needed to achieve the goal of eliminating foreign
exchange shortages. The first measure is international reserve accumulation, which is a
quantitative performance criterion. Two additional measures are: (i) the size of commercial
banks’ reported queues for

12

Even with the move to flexibility, the RBM intends to rely on foreign exchange market intervention to limit
exchange rate movements, though the scope for intervention would be limited by low reserves and the need to
build them to meet program targets.

15
foreign exchange; and (ii) the gaps in exchange rates between the bank bureau midrate and the
official midrate, for which indicative targets are set.
24.
Downside risks from market liberalization and nominal depreciation, including
from balance sheet effects, appear moderate. On balance, the central government budget
should benefit from currency depreciation, given the relatively large size of trade and traderelated taxes and foreign aid compared to the import content of public expenditures and
external debt service. The 2008 joint IMF and World Bank Financial System Stability
Assessment found that the banking system’s net foreign exchange exposure was limited
through prudential regulations. The nonbank private sector is believed to have relatively little
foreign-denominated debt. Moreover, depreciation of the currency will increase the income of
smallholder tobacco and other farmers, who constitute a significant share of households,
while the fertilizer subsidy and the pilot income transfer program, if continued, would protect
the poorest households from higher costs of imported inputs.
Building reserves to restore external stability
25.
To build international reserves, the ECF-supported program is expected to entail
a sizeable narrowing of the current account deficit (inclusive of grants) by reducing nonaid financed domestic demand relative to output over time. The improvement in the
current account balance would be achieved through a mix of fiscal and monetary
consolidation and exchange rate adjustment and liberalization measures. A real exchange rate
depreciation is essential to avoid an excessively contractionary fiscal and monetary stance and
would help shift demand towards domestic output. Although low export elasticities are likely
to put the bulk of external adjustment initially on reduced import growth, an appropriately
valued exchange rate should stimulate export growth over the medium term. The program
envisages an ambitious improvement in the savings-investment balance of 6.8 percent of
GDP between 2009 and 2010 (text table). The tightening of the fiscal stance to what has been
more the norm in recent years (apart from last) will make a large contribution to this
improvement, complemented by higher private saving.

C. Structural Reforms
26.
The ECF-supported program will also encompass structural measures to
underpin macroeconomic objectives and sustain high growth. The authorities have
provided, as a prior action of the ECF-supported program, a transparent accounting of the
execution of the fertilizer subsidy program in the fiscal year 2008/09 budget and of the
budgeted figures in fiscal year 2009/10. The authorities committed to undertake further
structural measures in three areas during the first year of the program: (i) improving public
financial management by making fully operational the PFEM unit; (ii) developing a timebound plan to restart and liberalize the interbank foreign exchange market; and
(iii) continuing with implementation of financial sector reforms, and improving monetary
and exchange rate policy transparency. Over the final two years of the program, they intend
to continue improving transparency and solvency of the public utilities.
III. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
27.
Malawi’s medium-term outlook is favorable, within the context of successful
implementation of the ECF-supported program. Growth is expected to remain buoyant,
though more moderate

productive capacity at
the Kayelekera uranium mine and, possibly, by the exploitation of niobium (a niche mineral
for steelmaking), as well as the development of other sectors, such as sugar, where
significant new investments are underway. The Southern African Free Trade Agreement
also promises to open regional markets to basic manufactures.
28.
Inflation should remain moderate, below 10 percent. Although the depreciation
of the exchange rate would exert pressure on tradable’ prices in 2010, last season’s solid
maize harvest, relatively stable international fuel prices, and restrained fiscal and monetary
policies should contain inflationary pressures.
29.
The weak reserve position is expected to improve. International reserves should
rise as a result of a substantial expected inflow of donor assistance; seasonal inflows, once

17
the new harvest season begins; and a reduction of import growth followed by some greater
export growth, as exchange rate adjustments and liberalization of the foreign exchange
market bring about a market-based price. Under the program, international reserves are
projected to rise to 1.4 months of prospective imports by end-December 2010 and to three
months by end-December 2012.
30.
The updated debt sustainability analysis does not show any immediate
concerns. Foreign debt is modest as a consequence of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) initiative and domestic debt is low. Indebtedness is projected to rise with the
increase in infrastructure investment financed with concessional debt. Thus, the debt-toexports ratio is expected to rise towards its threshold during the projection period, but
without exceeding it. Malawi’s debt service indicators are therefore projected to remain
below their indicative thresholds in the medium term in both the baseline and under a
variety of shocks (see Debt Sustainability Analysis). Overall, Malawi’s risk of debt distress
is moderate.
31.

There are several key downside risks:



Lack of a market-based exchange rate. A lack of flexibility on the exchange rate
could contribute to shortages of foreign currency, which would threaten
macrostability, and dampen investment and growth.



Changes in the international environment for tobacco consumption. The mediumterm prospects for burley tobacco, the largest export commodity, are currently
uncertain in light of recent Canadian legislation to ban additives that are typically
combined with burley tobacco in cigarettes.



Reliance on rain-fed agriculture. Malawi’s reliance on unirrigated agriculture leaves
it vulnerable to drought. So far, it has largely escaped the devastating drought that has
afflicted large parts of eastern and southern Africa, but this risk remains central.



Business policies that discourage investment and production. Another key risk is
that business policies could be adopted that discourage investors, especially foreign
investors, and reduce incentives for domestic producers to shift resources into the
most productive activities. Minimum pricing policies should be designed with both
sellers and buyers of farm produce in mind.



Poor infrastructure. The quality and availability of electricity and water supply
already impede growth. Malawi will need to adopt a comprehensive strategy for
reforming the parastatals that deliver utilities’ services, and to develop an innovative
program for expanding access to underserved areas.



Uncertainties in the external environment. A slower global recovery could dampen
export demand, investor interest, remittances, and access to foreign capital.

18
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING
A. Program Monitoring and Conditionality
32.
Program implementation will be monitored according to the following
performance criteria and benchmarks as laid out in the authorities’ MEFP, with terms
defined in the accompanying Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). Over
the three years of the ECF-supported program, performance criteria will be set on net
domestic assets and net international reserves of the RBM and on net domestic borrowing of
the central government, and an indicative target will be set on reserve money (Table 6 and
MEFP ¶26). In addition, there will be an indicative target for a floor on social spending, so
that this spending does not fall below budgeted levels. The performance criteria will be set
for end-June and end-December, and the indicative targets for end-quarters. There will also
be continuous performance criteria on non-accumulation of government external payment
arrears and on no new contracting and guaranteeing of short-term and medium-term
nonconcessional external debt.
33.
To help guide adjustment, the program will also incorporate supplemental
monitoring with regard to excess demand for foreign exchange (MEFP ¶27). To gauge
progress in eliminating, over time, the measures that gave rise to multiple currency practices
and foreign exchange queues, the RBM will measure, jointly with Fund staff, on a monthly
basis, three indicators: (i) the reduction in the size of commercial banks’ reported queues for
foreign exchange; and (ii) the reduction in the gaps in exchange rates between the bank
bureau midrate and the official midrate, both indicative targets, and (iii) reserve levels, a
performance criterion. These indicators will also be covered by the semi-annual reviews.
34.
The program will also set structural benchmarks in the three key reform areas
for the first year of the program and then establish longer-term benchmarks (MEFP
¶28). To enhance public sector efficiency, the authorities will make fully operational a
PFEM unit (Table 7). To support efforts to liberalize the foreign exchange market, the
authorities will formulate a plan to re-activate the interbank foreign exchange market.
Finally, to deepen financial development, the authorities will seek Cabinet approval of the
Financial Sector Development Strategy and increase monetary policy transparency. Over the
medium-term, the authorities will work toward improving the transparency and solvency of
public utilities.
B. Capacity to Repay
35.
Malawi would have reasonable assurances of capacity to repay the Fund
(Table 8). The envisaged Fund disbursements would total 75 percent of quota, which is
justified by Malawi’s balance of payments need, and is the norm under the ECF instrument
for a country with more than 100 percent of quota outstanding (Malawi’s purchases from the
PRGF Trust Fund total 116.64 percent of quota). If purchases are made as scheduled, there
will be a peak in debt service to the Fund in 2018 at US$32.1 million (or 1.7 percent of
exports). Fund support will be a relatively small part of the overall financing package, as

19
Malawi is projected to receive an average of US$200 million per year in budget support,
seven-eighths of which is in the form of grants, and the rest in the form of highly
concessional loans. In addition, Malawi receives around US$800 million per annum in
official aid, three-quarters of which goes through the budget. The strong level of donor
support, combined with the prospects for future development of Malawi’s agricultural
potential and natural resources (and the accompanying foreign currency earnings and
government revenue), are expected to support Malawi’s capacity to repay the Fund.
C. Safeguards Assessment
36.
The ECF-supported program will require an update of the December 2008
safeguards assessment. This assessment has commenced and will be completed no later
than the first review of the proposed arrangement.
D. Data Issues, Technical Assistance, and Capacity Building
37.
The data provided are adequate for surveillance and program monitoring. The
quality and timeliness of Malawi’s fiscal, monetary, and external data have improved,
although their shortcomings are still significant. The authorities are committed to building
technical capacity within the government and the RBM. The Fund is providing technical
assistance in several areas, including public financial management, tax reform and tax and
customs administration, monetary and exchange rate management, statistics, and legal
drafting.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Malawi has weathered the global downturn well, with continued high growth
and moderate inflation. The post-election period provides an opportunity to take the bold
actions necessary to restore external equilibrium, while sustaining high growth and poverty
reduction.
39.
Expenditure overruns in the fiscal year 2008/09 budget are being addressed
with a return to a more prudent fiscal stance in the fiscal year 2009/10 budget and
execution. In the last fiscal year, ending in June 2009, net domestic borrowing was higher
than in the budget, with significant cost overruns in fertilizers and other goods and services.
However, the fiscal year 2009/10 budget scaled-back spending of lower priority items and
achieved savings by using excess fertilizer stocks from last year, while setting ambitious
targets for revenue collection. Execution through the first half of the fiscal year to endDecember 2009 was in line with the budget. Donor funding continues to be a critical
component of the macroeconomic framework. The authorities’ commitments to continue
reforms in public financial management and improve tax and customs administration are
important to ensure that the budget remains on track. The steps taken to consolidate the
fiscal position should help reduce pressure on the balance of payments and over the longer
term, avoid the accumulation of debt.

20
40.
Monetary policy has tightened, after a significant easing in 2008 and early 2009.
The authorities are actively absorbing the liquidity overhang. Good control of credit growth
is essential to support strengthening of the balance of payments and contain inflationary
pressures from exchange rate adjustments. Over time, as financial markets develop and with
the move to a flexible exchange regime, monetary policy should rely more heavily on
interest rate adjustments to achieve inflation targets. The financial system is resilient and
well-capitalized and profitable.
41.
Recent decisive steps will help address a weak balance of payments, which
threatens exchange rate and price stability and medium-term growth. Chronically low
reserves were further weakened last year by the loose fiscal and monetary policies. Some
recent measures to liberalize the foreign exchange market, such as the reversion of surrender
requirements to the commercial banks, and a move to greater flexibility in the exchange rate
and some modest depreciation of the nominal rate, will supplement measures to reduce
aggregate demand and help address the external imbalance. However, continued policy
adjustment, including further potential exchange rate adjustments, and external support are
critical to restore external equilibrium.
42.
Staff support the request by the Malawian authorities for a three-year
arrangement under the ECF with access of 75 percent of quota. This arrangement would
support efforts to liberalize the foreign exchange regime, build reserves, and strengthen
fiscal sustainability and anti-poverty activities, in line with Malawi’s poverty reduction and
growth strategy.
43.
Malawi’s breach of commitments under Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement, should be eliminated.
44.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place within 24 months,
subject to the decision on consultation cycles in program countries.

The ECF scenario assumes an initial depreciation and that the real exchange rate is kept constant during the program period.
Correcting the underlying exchange rate misalignment is a key element of the macroeconomic framework.
The increase in national savings in 2010 relative to 2009 results from the combined effect of expenditure-reducing policy, as the
government pursues a tighter fiscal stance, and expenditure-switching policy as the devaluation effects a change in relative prices
and also impacts the private sector.

Programmed usable reserves in 2009 excludes the SDR allocation, while the projection includes the SDR allocation.

APPENDIX I.
LETTER OF INTENT

Ref. No. M/F/4/1

th

26 January, 2010

Mr. D. Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
The Government of Malawi requests continued support from the International Monetary
Fund for its economic objectives and policy framework for 2010–12 through a new threeyear arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). We request access of
75 percent of quota (SDR 52.05 million). This arrangement will support our medium-term
reforms to address balance of payments weaknesses and to sustain growth and poverty
reduction. Maintaining a close engagement with the Fund will send a positive signal to
domestic stakeholders and our development partners, notably concerning our determination
to maintain macroeconomic stability and build on the positive economic gains achieved to
date.
In the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), we set out our
macroeconornic framework and policy objectives for 2010–12 and the medium term. Our
main goal is to provide a consistent and coherent macroeconomic policy framework to
underpin our development objectives. In that regard, our programme focuses on preserving
macroeconomic stability, while enhancing growth and poverty reduction. Specific emphasis
is placed on moving towards a market determined exchange rate and rebuilding

38
international reserves; improving public financial management and monetary and fiscal
transparency; and supporting private-sector-led growth.
The MEFP and Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) present quantitative
performance criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks through the programme
period. We believe that the policies set forth in the MEFP are adequate to achieve the
objectives of the programme, but we will take additional measures as needed to reach these
goals. We will consult with IMF staff on the adoption of these measures, and in advance of
revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the agreed IMF policies
on such consultation.
The Government of Malawi authorizes the IMF to make this letter, the attached MEFP,
TMU, and the IMF staff report available to the public, including through the IMF internet
website.
Yours sincerely

ATTACHMENT I.
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES, 2010–12
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum summarizes the government of Malawi’s economic objectives
and policy framework for January 2010–December 2012, for which the government is
seeking support from the International Monetary Fund through a three-year
arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The policies described are
consistent with Malawi’s Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS), which sets out the
country’s medium-term development priorities.
2.
Our medium-term program builds on the strong economic results achieved since
2005, including under the successfully completed Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement. Our economic strategy has emphasized the need for fiscal
consolidation, involving both judicious increases in public spending and improvements in
revenue performance—hence creating the space for pro-poor and pro-growth spending. This
strategy has been designed to correct the severe macroeconomic imbalances that existed prior
to 2005, when weak program implementation led to large fiscal slippages, an unsustainable
domestic debt spiral, and low investment.
3.
Our strengthened policy implementation has supported macroeconomic stability,
reduced domestic debt and interest rates, and built overall credibility. Reflecting these
improvements, Malawi has benefited from external debt relief and increased inflows of aid.
Growth has been impressive, averaging 6.8 percent for 2004–08, and inflation has come down
to below 10 percent. Higher revenues and aid, and lower interest payments on the public debt
have translated into higher poverty-reducing and social expenditures. We have made progress
toward many of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
4.
Recent gains notwithstanding, Malawi continues to face important development
challenges. Despite recent progress, poverty reduction and food security remain pressing
concerns, as the economy is still heavily dependent on drought-prone agriculture. In addition,
at about one month of prospective imports, international reserves remain low, especially
considering Malawi’s vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, implementing the MGDS will require
increases in public investment and spending in areas such as health and education. To address
these and other challenges over the long term, Malawi will continue to rely heavily on
external support through grants and highly concessional financial assistance.

40
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Malawi’s growth has accelerated while inflation has moderated in recent years.
Output in 2008 is estimated to have reached 9.8 percent, driven by a record-high tobacco
harvest and rapid expansion in maize and services. Growth in 2009 is estimated to have
remained robust, reflecting strong tobacco and maize crops, the start of uranium production,
and expanding wholesale and retail trade. Production of maize has benefited from favorable
rainfall and the government’s subsidized distribution of fertilizer to smallholder farmers.
Inflation has trended downward during 2009, reflecting moderation in food and fuel prices
and reduced monetary expansion.
6.
The fiscal year 2008/09 budget targets were missed by a wide margin, owing to
difficulties in containing spending on the fertilizer subsidy program coupled with
expenditure overruns on goods and services. Overspending on fertilizer, sold to farmers at
subsidized prices, reflected a combination of high fertilizer prices in mid-2008, at the time of
the government’s planned purchases, and an additional unbudgeted purchase later in the year.
Efforts are now being made to strengthen budget control and improve the targeting of the
fertilizer program.
7.
The combination of high spending with a shortfall in foreign financing led to
rapid credit expansion to the government and contributed to higher than targeted
growth in reserve money. Large injections by the government in the first quarter of the fiscal
year led to high market liquidity. However, reserve money growth has since moderated, with
the 12-month change in reserve money declining significantly from the beginning to end of
2009. Moreover, with expected donor inflows, we expect a repayment of domestic borrowing
in fiscal year 2009/10.
8.
We have moved forward with our structural reform agenda. Public administration
is being strengthened, supported by a Public Financial and Economic Management (PFEM)
unit in the Ministry of Finance, which is charged with coordinating reforms in this area and
updating the public financial management action plan. In line with this plan, we have
strengthened control over the wage bill and utility payments, and implemented the Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) to improve control over expenditures
more generally. The Ministry of Finance has also made significant improvements in statistical
classification and presentation of the budget, including on a functional basis, which will allow
for more accurate tracking of trends in key social welfare spending and coherence of spending
with the MGDS goals. In addition, a cash management unit at the Accountant General’s
Office has been formed to enhance the government’s capacity for cash flow planning. The
most recent Public Finance Management Assessment for Malawi, based on the Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) framework, concluded that our public
financial management has substantially improved over the past three years and compares
favorably to our neighbors. We have also issued a debt management strategy, and cleared the
2004 stock of arrears. Finally, the capacity in the offices of the Accountant General and
Auditor General have been enhanced, with the support of our development partners, and

41
substantial progress has been made in reducing the backlog in the submission of annual
accounts by the Accountant General to the National Audit Office and to Parliament.
9.
We have also made progress in establishing credit reference bureaus, which will
over time help to lower high lending spreads. Information disclosure clauses have been
introduced in commercial bank lending contracts and a Credit Reference Bureau Bill,
providing the legal and regulatory framework for the sharing of credit information, has been
finalized and is awaiting Parliamentary approval. This should help establish functioning credit
bureaus and bring down the cost of lending by lowering the risks and promoting competition
among banks through easier identification of sound borrowers.
10.
We have also made improvements in bank supervision and regulations. The
Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) adopted a risk-based supervision approach to examining
bank performance in January 2009, and is in the process of establishing Basel II governance
structures and committees. For the time being the assessment of banks will still be based on
CAMEL, with the risk-based assessment run in parallel with CAMEL. Following this change,
the RBM will be able to assess more effectively all risks banks undertake in addition to credit
risk, as was emphasized in the CAMEL method. Moreover, the RBM continues to assess the
quality of bank loans during on-site and off-site examinations. Whenever a bank is found to
be under-provisioning, the RBM directs it to make additional provisions. Related to this, the
RBM is revising its Asset Classification Directive to take into account new developments
such as International Accounting Standards.
11.
The amendments to the Banking Act and the Insurance Act were recently
approved while the Financial Services Bill will be tabled during the next sitting of
Parliament in February 2010. These are designed to empower the RBM to actively
regulate and supervise Malawi’s financial sector. The Banking Act and the Financial
Services Bill: (i) extend fit and proper requirements beyond the board and executive
management to include shareholders; (ii) enhance enforcement powers of the RBM and
outlines corrective actions and remedial measures to be undertaken by the RBM to resolve
problems in the banks; (iii) empower the RBM to prescribe higher ongoing capital than the
required minimum depending on an individual bank’s risk profile; (iv) empower the RBM to
require external auditors to present their findings prior to publishing the annual accounts; and
(v) empower the RBM to carry out consolidated supervision of the financial sector. The RBM
has also taken a number of steps to improve its capacity to examine transactions related to
anti-money-laundering and combating of financing of terrorism. The Money Laundering and
Proceeds of Serious Crimes Terrorist Financing Law was enacted in 2006 and took effect in
2007, and the RBM has introduced anti-money laundering examinations, with a key focus on
compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) principles. A Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)
was established in 2007 and is working closely with the RBM and law enforcement agencies
on matters pertaining to AML-CFT.
12.
The RBM has also strengthened its liquidity forecasting capabilities. The liquidity
forecasting framework, designed with the assistance of the Norges Bank and the Fund, is now

42
fully operational and is used daily by the Treasury Department to assess liquidity conditions
and prospects and smooth liquidity management on an ongoing basis. RBM has also replaced
bilateral repos with repos sold through auctions, in the interest of greater transparency and
with a view to enhancing financial market development.
III. SUSTAINING GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION WHILE ENHANCING
COMPETITIVENESS

13.
Our medium-term strategy—set out in the MGDS—is directed at boosting
growth and reducing poverty. Key objectives include private sector-led development,
diversification of economic activities, and empowerment of the poor through a sound
economic environment, high-quality public service, effective institutions and the rule of law,
and zero tolerance for corruption.
14.
Our medium-term program, for which we seek ECF support, aims to provide a
consistent and coherent economic policy framework to underpin our development
objectives. The program focuses on enhancing the sustainability of growth and development
through policies that consolidate economic stability, reinforce resilience to shocks, further
improve public financial management, and support private-sector-led growth.
15.

The program’s key medium-term objectives include:



Increasing and maintaining sustainable growth over the medium term and reducing
poverty within a stable macroeconomic environment and consistent with Malawi’s
MGDS and MDGs.



Increasing foreign reserves coverage to three months of imports. We view this as the
minimum desirable level, given Malawi’s vulnerability to weather, terms of trade, and
aid shocks and the large seasonal volatility in trade flows.



Reducing government net domestic debt. This will support the planned increase in
reserves and lower further the share of public expenditures devoted to debt service.



Establishing, by end-2011, a liberalized foreign exchange regime for current account
transactions consistent with our obligations under Article VIII of the International
Monetary Fund’s Articles of Agreement, which we accepted in 1995, and making
substantial progress in this regard during 2010.



Re-activating the interbank foreign exchange market.



Making progress toward and achieving a market-clearing exchange rate that supports
the accumulation of reserves and a stable macroeconomic environment.



Promoting internal equilibrium by pursuing prudent fiscal and monetary policies,
designed to contain aggregate demand pressures and limit the pass-through of
exchange rate changes to prices of nontradeables.

43


Continuing reforms in public financial management and tax administration, designed to
enhance capacity and strengthen both expenditure control and revenue performance;



Pursuing wide ranging reforms to deepen the financial sector and promote greater
financial inclusion; and



Improving the business climate through improvements in infrastructure and regulatory
reform.

Outlook for growth and inflation
16.
Our goal is to increase growth over the medium term in order to reduce poverty
levels and facilitate attainment of the MDGs. Our macroeconomic and structural reform
program will help lay the groundwork, with growth expected to average 8 percent during the
ECF-supported program. An expansion in private activity beyond the agricultural sector,
complemented by public investment in infrastructure, the opening of the Kayelekera uranium
mine in 2009, and development of further mining opportunities will help to underpin growth.
Inflation is expected to stabilize at 6-7 percent over the medium term, reflecting prudent fiscal
and monetary policies and a strengthened capacity to respond to exogenous shocks.
Medium term fiscal policies
17.
The government intends to preserve the gains from HIPC debt relief by
sustaining sound fiscal management over the medium term. We will adhere to a prudent
fiscal policy of modest overall budget deficits, financed by foreign borrowing, leaving room
to expand credit to the private sector (see MEFP ¶26). We aim to strengthen the tax revenue to
GDP ratio by around ½ percent of GDP per year until fiscal year 2014/15, mainly by
broadening of the base of the value added and income taxes (including through improved
compliance), while still leaving room to lower the value added tax rate and international trade
taxes to regional norms. In this regard, the government intends to target a domestic borrowing
repayment of around 1 to 1.5 percent of GDP and a modest overall deficit in the fiscal year
2010/11 budget, while incorporating measures to strengthen public services in education and
health care through hiring of qualified personnel in these areas, and improving targeting of
the social safety net. The government also stands ready to undertake budgetary adjustments
this year, either through a reduction in lower priority expenditures or a shoring up of
revenues, while preserving budgeted social and poverty-reducing spending, to ensure that the
domestic repayment target is met.
18.
The government will aim to reduce the risks to the budget posed by growing
implicit and explicit contingent liabilities resulting from the activities of parastatals and
by rationalizing expenditures. It will seek to establish a clear regulatory regime for public
utilities infrastructure—namely, the Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi, Ltd.
(ESCOM) and the Malawi regional Water Boards—that covers operating costs and avoids the
need for budgetary transfers and that minimizes recourse to commercial bank borrowing. In
this regard, the government has already increased electricity tariffs by 36 percent as of

44
December 1, 2009, and will increase them by a further 20 percent in December 2010, with
additional adjustments expected over the subsequent two years. It has also been announced
that water tariffs will increase by 12.5 percent. These actions are designed to set the stage for
these utilities to invest in needed capital infrastructure to improve the quality, availability, and
reliability of their service delivery, with a view to supporting the expansion of manufacturing
and other economic activities. In addition, the government will seek to restructure Air
Malawi’s debts and absorb the costs of the presidential jet and any transfers to parastatals or
productive sectors, without allowing this spending to crowd out social and other priorities in
the government budget.
Monetary policy
19.
Monetary policy in the medium term will be geared toward achieving price
stability, while providing room for sufficient credit to the private sector and supporting
reserve accumulation and a properly valued exchange rate. Reserve money will be the
nominal anchor. To help manage domestic demand, reserve money is programmed to grow at
about the pace of GDP to help contain inflation and limit the pass-through effects of exchange
rate adjustment to nontradeables’ prices (see MEFP ¶26). Reserve money is targeted to grow by
about 16 percent in 2010 (about the same as projected nominal GDP growth). The RBM will
continue to develop its instruments of indirect monetary control and strengthen its ability to
implement monetary policy through changes in interest rates.
Exchange rate policies
20.
Exchange rate policies are geared toward liberalizing the foreign exchange
regime and achieving a market-based exchange rate. In addition to an initial depreciation
of the currency prior to the commencement of the ECF-supported program, we are committed
to undertaking further policy adjustments, including of the exchange rate, to support foreign
exchange market liberalization, eliminate excess demand for foreign exchange, and achieve a
market-based and competitive exchange rate (see MEFP ¶26–27).
21.
To support the reduction of foreign exchange shortages and multiple currency
practices, we have already put in place a number of reforms to the foreign exchange
regime. The RBM has implemented the Foreign Exchange Statistical Database System
(FESDS) with a view to improving efficiency in mobilization and tracking of foreign
exchange proceeds from the country’s exports. In addition, the RBM has recently reversed
measures that had required tobacco farmers without FCDAs to surrender export earnings
directly to the RBM at the official exchange rate, and tobacco exporters with FCDAs and
exporters of other traditional products to surrender 20 percent of their receipts to the RBM at
the official rate, and 20 percent to the commercial banks at the commercial bank rate. The
requirements on tobacco and traditional exporters are now to surrender the required foreign
exchange receipts from exports to the commercial banks for conversion at the bank rate. The
government will also allow foreign exchange bureaus to operate when they meet specified fit
and proper tests.

45
22.
Over the medium term, the RBM will modernize its exchange rate and monetary
policy frameworks. This will entail a further strengthening of the domestic credit, foreign
exchange, and interbank markets, as well as RBM policies and instruments to regulate,
supervise, and influence these markets. Enhanced transparency will be an essential element of
this strategy. Our goal is to establish the framework for market-oriented monetary and foreign
exchange instruments and operations that support economic growth and diversification,
including building capacity of market participants to manage exchange rate risk. Technical
assistance for these reforms will be provided by the Fund, the Norges Bank and other key
development partners.
Other structural policies
23.
The government intends to accelerate the pace of its structural reforms in public
expenditure management, with a view to producing timely, consolidated and reconciled
accounts, with continued technical assistance from the Fund. We will also seek to strengthen
external audit and procurement capabilities in order to further bolster accountability and
governance.
24.
The government will continue its efforts to create an enabling environment for
private investment and growth. It will focus public investments on improving the
educational and health care systems, utilities, transportation, and communications
infrastructure; strengthen the regulatory environment, cut cumbersome business regulations
and those that impair the efficient functioning of the labor market; and roll back the role of
the public sector in areas that the private sector should dominate.
25.
The government has recently formulated a draft Financial Sector Development
Strategy, which is currently being presented to stakeholders. At the end of the
consultative process, the strategy and action plan will be presented to and discussed by
Cabinet for approval. The strategy is currently comprised of two stages, namely:


The attainment of inclusive finance for growth, which will encompass the following
three pillars: (a) the alignment of the domestic financial system with key growth
sectors, (b) financial inclusion, including by expanding the provision of financial
services to the rural economy and minimizing existing market distortions and
(c) creating a conducive business environment—including by upgrading the legal and
regulatory framework for the financial sector in line with recommendations of the
recent FSAP and strengthening financial sector oversight through modernization and
the RBM (the latter will be supported by the recent Parliamentary approval of the
Banking Act and the impending approval of the Financial Services Bill).



Financial deepening and competitiveness, comprised of efforts to strengthen capital
market development—in part, through the creation of domestic infrastructure/project
finance funds, the development of housing finance products, the creation of a
regulatory framework for the bond market, and organizational strengthening of the
Malawi Stock Exchange.

46
III. PROGRAM MONITORING
26.
Program implementation will be monitored according to the following
performance criteria and benchmarks, with definitions as set out in the accompanying
Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). Over the three years of the ECFsupported program, semi-annual performance criteria will be set on net domestic assets and
net international reserves of the Reserve Bank, and on net domestic borrowing of the central
government and an indicative target on reserve money (Table 1). In addition, there will be an
indicative target for a floor on social spending, so that this spending does not fall below
budgeted levels. There will also be continuous performance criteria on nonaccumulation of
government external payment arrears and of no new contracting and guaranteeing of shortterm and medium-term nonconcessional external debt. The program will have semi-annual
reviews. The first review will be completed by November 20, 2010 and the second review by
May 20, 2011.
27.
The ECF-supported program will include monitoring with regard to excess
demand for foreign exchange. There will be a continuous performance criterion on no
intensification of restrictions under Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. To
gauge progress in eliminating practices that have created multiple exchange rates in the
market and foreign exchange queues, the RBM will measure, jointly with Fund staff, on a
monthly basis, three indicators: (i) the reduction in the size of commercial banks’ reported
queues for foreign exchange; and (ii) the reduction in the gaps in exchange rates between the
official and foreign exchange bureau rates, both indicative targets, and (iii) reserve levels, a
performance criterion, to be covered by the semi-annual program reviews.
28.
To strengthen the underpinnings of growth, the program will also contain
structural benchmarks in three key areas for the first year and longer-term
benchmarks. To ensure greater efficiency in the public sector, the authorities will make fully
operational a PFEM unit. To improve the foreign exchange regime, the authorities will
develop a time-bound action plan to restart the interbank foreign exchange market. Finally, to
strengthen the financial sector, the authorities will secure Cabinet approval of the Financial
Sector Development Strategy and increase monetary policy transparency. Targets will be set
for end-June and end-December 2010. Over the longer-term, the authorities will improve
transparency and solvency of public utilities.

47
ATTACHMENT II.
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (TMU)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Malawian authorities and
the International Monetary Fund regarding the definitions of quantitative performance
criteria, benchmarks, and indicative targets for the program supported by the ECF
arrangement, as well as the related reporting requirements.
2.
Coverage: The central government includes all units of government that exercise
authority over the entire economic territory. However, in contrast to the System of National
Accounts 1993 (SNA 1993) and Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001)
standards, nonprofit institutions that are controlled and financed by the central government
are excluded for purposes of this memorandum. The accounts of the monetary authorities
include those of the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) and the central government’s holdings
of international reserves. Monetary aggregates under the program are based on the eight-bank
monetary survey.
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA: DEFINITIONS
AND DATA SOURCES
A. Reform of the Foreign Exchange Regime
3.
Easing of foreign exchange surrender requirements to the RBM: The current
regulations require that all exporters should surrender 40 percent of proceeds to the banking
system. Tobacco exporters may retain 60 percent of export proceeds in Foreign Currency
Deposit Accounts (FCDAs) and surrender 40 percent of proceeds to commercial banks at the
commercial bank rate. Tobacco exporters without FCDAs must surrender 100 percent of
proceeds to the commercial banks at the commercial bank rate. The RBM will refrain from
rationing foreign exchange, and have certified that all private external payment arrears are
cleared as of January 25, 2010 and will avoid interfering in foreign exchange markets that
result in private sector external arrears on a continuous basis during the program period.
B. Floor on Net International Reserves of the RBM
4.
Definition of net international reserves (NIR) of the RBM: The NIR of the RBM
is defined as gross reserves minus IMF and other short-term liabilities. The values of all
foreign assets and liabilities will be converted into U.S. dollars at each test date using the
program cross exchange rates for the various currencies and then converted into kwacha
using the program exchange rate for the U.S. dollar–kwacha exchange rate.
5.
Gross reserve assets of the RBM are defined in the International Reserve and
Foreign Currency Liquidity Guidelines for a Data Template as external assets immediately
available and controlled by RBM “for direct financing of payments imbalances, for indirectly

48
regulating the magnitudes of such imbalances through intervention in exchange markets to
affect the currency exchange rate, and/or for other purposes” (BPM5, para. 424).
6.
This concept includes the following: (1) monetary gold holdings of the RBM;
(2) holdings of SDRs; (3) the reserve position in the IMF; (4) central government (treasury)
holdings with crown agents; and, (5) foreign convertible currency holdings; (6) deposits held
in foreign central banks, the Bank for International Settlements, and other banks; (7) loans to
foreign banks redeemable upon demand; (8) foreign securities; and (9) other unpledged
convertible liquid claims on nonresidents. It excludes the following: (1) any foreign currency
claims on residents; (2) capital subscriptions in international institutions; (3) foreign assets in
nonconvertible currencies; (4) transfers of foreign currency claims to RBM by other
institutional units in Malawi just prior to reporting dates with accompanying reversals of
such transfers soon after those dates; (5) gross reserves that are in any way encumbered or
pledged, including, but not limited to, (i) assets blocked when used as collateral for third
party loans and third-party payments, pledged to investors as a condition for investing in
domestic securities, and (ii) assets lent by RBM to third parties which are not available prior
to maturity, and are not marketable (including the outstanding balance of the loan to
Zimbabwe).
7.
Gross reserve liabilities of the RBM are defined as the sum of the following:
(1) SDR allocations; (2) outstanding medium and short-term liabilities of the RBM to the
IMF; and (2) all short-term foreign currency liabilities of the RBM to nonresidents with an
original maturity of up to, and including, one year.
8.
As under the latest accounting guidelines (BPM6), NIR has increased with the
2009 allocation of SDRs, which is treated as a long-term foreign exchange liability of
Malawi to the SDR Department of the IMF, instead of a debt liability or shares and equity, as
in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The SDR allocation does not affect
net foreign assets (NFA), because it increases both gross foreign assets and long-term
liabilities.
9.
Adjustment clause on NIR—budget support: The floor on the NIR of the RBM
will be adjusted upward by the full amount by which the cumulative receipts from the budget
support are greater than US$30 million above the program baseline (see Table 1). The floor
on NIR of the RBM will be adjusted downward by the full amount up to a maximum of
US$10 million by which the cumulative receipts from budget support are less than the
program baseline. Budget support is measured as the cumulative flow from the beginning of
the fiscal year.
10.
Definition of budget support: Budget support includes all grants and foreign
financing that is not directly linked to additional budgetary expenditure. Excluded from this
definition is external project financing to fund particular activities, including food security
funding from the European Union and loan financing from the IMF, and donor inflows

49
(in kwacha) from the U.S. dollar–denominated donor pool account for the health sector-wide
approach (SWAp) and National AIDS Commission held in the Malawi banking system.
11.
Adjustment clause on NIR—donor pool account for the health SWAp account:
The floor on the NIR of the RBM will be adjusted downward by the full amount by which
the donor inflows (in kwacha) from the U.S. dollar–denominated donor pool account for the
health SWAp held in the Malawi banking system is smaller than the donor inflow (in
kwacha) to those accounts in the program baseline. The downward adjustment will be capped
at US$10 million. Donor inflows for the SWAp account are measured as the receipts
received (in kwacha) by the budget from the SWAp account, a U.S. dollar-denominated
account set up at the RBM. Donor inflow is measured from the beginning of the fiscal year.
12.
Adjustment clause on NIR—debt service payments: The floor on NIR of the RBM
will be adjusted upward (downward) by the full cumulative amount by which debt service
payments to the World Bank and the ADB fall short of (exceed) the program baseline
(Table 1). The cumulative amount will be measured from the beginning of the fiscal year.
13.
The total downward adjustment to NIR from a shortfall of (1) budget support and
(2) donor inflows to the donor pool account for the health SWAp account relative to program
assumptions and (3) an excess of debt service payments relative to the program assumption
will be capped at $10 million.
14.
For purposes of this target, as well as those for external debt and arrears, valuation
will be in U.S. dollars using the above defined program exchange rates.
15.
Data on NIR, including its components, will be reported by the RBM on a weekly and
end-month basis.
C. Ceiling on the Net Domestic Assets of the Reserve Bank of Malawi
16.
Definition of net domestic assets (NDA) of the RBM: NDA of the RBM are defined
in kwacha terms as end quarter reserve money less NFA of the RBM at the program
exchange rate. Reserve money consists of currency issued by the RBM and balances of
commercial banks’ accounts with the RBM. It includes required reserves held for Malawi
kwacha deposits and any other domestic currency reservable liabilities and other demand and
time deposits held with the RBM. The NDA program ceilings are the indicative money
targets defined below less the NFA of the RBM.
17.
Definition of NFA of the RBM: The NFA of the RBM are defined as the above
defined NIR plus other foreign assets of the RBM—including but not limited to (1) capital
subscriptions in international institutions; (2) foreign assets in nonconvertible currencies; and
(3) gross reserves that are in any way encumbered or pledged, less any medium- and longterm foreign liabilities of the RBM.

50
18.
Adjustment clause on NDA—budget support: The ceiling on NDA of the RBM
will be adjusted downward by the full amount by which the cumulative flow of receipts from
budget support are greater than US$30 million above the program baseline. The ceiling on
NDA of the RBM will be adjusted upward by the full amount up to a maximum of
US$10 million by which the cumulative receipts from the budget support are less than the
program baseline. The kwacha value of the cumulative shortfall/excess will be calculated at
the program exchange rate. Budget support is measured as the cumulative flow from the
beginning of the fiscal year.
19.
Adjustment clause on NDA—donor pool account for the health SWAp account:
The ceiling on NDA of the RBM will be adjusted upward by the full amount by which the
donor inflows (in kwacha) from the U.S. dollar–denominated donor pool account for the
health SWAp held in the Malawi banking system is smaller than the donor inflow
(in kwacha) to those accounts in the program baseline. The upward adjustment will be
capped at US$10 million. Donor inflows for the SWAp account are measured as the receipts
received (in kwacha) by the budget from the SWAp account, a U.S. dollar-denominated
account set up at the RBM. Donor inflow is measured from the beginning of the fiscal year.
20.
Adjustment clause on NDA—debt service payments: The ceiling on NDA of the
RBM will be adjusted downward (upward) by the full cumulative amount by which debt
service payments to the World Bank and the African Development Bank falls short of
(exceed) the program baseline (Table 1). The cumulative amount will be measured from the
beginning of the fiscal year.
21.
The total upward adjustment to NDA from a shortfall of (1) donor inflows to the
donor pool account for the health SWAp account relative to the program assumptions and
(2) an excess of debt service payments relative to the program assumption will be capped at
US$10 million.
22.
Adjustment clause on NDA—liquidity reserve requirement: The ceiling on NDA
of the RBM will be adjusted downward for a decrease in the reserve requirement ratio, and
will be adjusted upward for an increase in the ratio. The adjustment will be spread equally
over two quarters, starting in the quarter in which the reserve requirement ratio is reduced.
The adjuster will be calculated as follows: (one minus the existing required percentage of
reserve assets held at the discount houses) multiplied by (the program baseline required
reserve ratio minus the new required reserve ratio) multiplied by (the amount of average
reservable deposit liabilities in commercial banks during the last month prior to the change in
regulation).
D. Ceiling on Central Government Net Domestic Borrowing (CGDB)
23.
Definition of CGDB: CGDB is computed as the sum of (i) net borrowing from the
RBM (including ways and means advances, loans, holdings of local registered stocks,
government bonds, and holdings of treasury bills minus deposits); (ii) net borrowing from

51
commercial banks1 (including advances, holdings of local registered stocks, and holdings of
treasury bills minus deposits); (iii) net borrowing from nonbanks (including, but not limited
to, holdings of local registered stocks and holdings of treasury bills); and (iv) holdings of
promissory notes. The treasury bills and local registered stocks are valued at cost rather than
face value. The ceiling is measured as the change in the stock of CGDB since June 30, 2009,
including promissory notes and securities transferred to the RBM from the Treasury since
the beginning of the fiscal year.
24.
Definition of domestic arrears: Domestic arrears are overdue payment obligations
of the central government other than external payment arrears, including on wages and
salaries, pensions, transfers, domestic interest, goods and services, obligations arising from
court cases, legally established compensation claims, and tax refunds. Payments on wages
and salaries, pensions, transfers, court-established obligations, and compensations are in
arrears when they remain unpaid for more than 30 days beyond their due date. Domestic
interest payments are in arrears when the payment is not made on the due date. Payments for
goods and services are deemed to be in arrears if they have not been made within 90 days of
the date of invoice, or—if a grace period has been agreed—within the contractually agreed
grace period.
25.
Adjustment clause on CGDB—budget support: The ceiling of CGDB will be
adjusted downward (upward) by the full amount by which cumulative kwacha receipts from
budget support are greater (less) than the program baseline. The upward adjustment will be
capped at US$20 million. In the event of excess budget support, the ceiling on CGDB will
be adjusted by the full amount less US$30 million. The kwacha value of the cumulative
shortfall/excess will be converted at the corresponding monthly average of the RBM mid
rate. Cumulative receipts will be measured from the beginning of the fiscal year.
26.
Adjustment clause on CGDB—donor pool account for the health SWAp
account: The ceiling on CGDB will be adjusted upward by the full amount by which the
donor inflows (in kwacha) from the U.S. dollar–denominated donor pool account for the
health SWAp held in the Malawi banking system are smaller than the donor inflows
(in kwacha) to those accounts in the program baseline. The upward adjustment will be
capped at US$20 million. Donor inflows for the SWAp account are measured as receipts
received (in kwacha) by the budget from the SWAp account, a U.S. dollar-denominated
account set up at the RBM. Donor inflow is measured from the beginning of the fiscal year.
27.
Adjustment clause on CGDB—debt service payments: The ceiling on CGDB will
be adjusted downward (upward) by the full cumulative amount by which debt service
payments to the World Bank and the ADB fall short of (exceed) the program baseline
(Table 1). The cumulative amount will be measured from the beginning of the fiscal year.
1

Includes all commercial banks in Malawi—and in particular the Malawi Savings Bank—not just the banks
covered by the eight-bank monetary survey.

52
28.
The total upward adjustment to CGDB from a shortfall of (1) budget support and
(2) donor inflows to the donor pool account for the health SWAp account relative to the
program assumptions and (3) an excess of debt service payments relative to the program
assumption will be capped at US$30 million for permanent shortfalls.
29.
Adjustment clause on CGDB—securitization of arrears: The ceiling on CGDB
will be adjusted upward by the full cumulative amount by which pre-2005 domestic arrears
are securitized from the beginning of the fiscal year.
E. Ceiling on External Payment Arrears
30.
Definition of external payment arrears: External payment arrears consist of debtservice obligations (principal and interest) of the government or the RBM to nonresidents
that have not been paid at the time they are due, as specified in contractual agreements,
except on external debt subject to rescheduling or restructuring. This performance criterion
will be monitored on a continuous basis.
F. Ceiling on Nonconcessional External Debt
31.
Definition of nonconcessional external debt: The definition of debt, for the
purpose of the limit, is set out in Executive Board Decisions No. 6230-(79/140) August 3,
1979, and as amended by Decisions No. 11096-(95/100), October 25, 1995; 12274–(00/85)
August 24, 2000; and 14416-(09/91), August 31, 2009. For program purposes, short- and
medium- and long-term debt is nonconcessional if it includes a grant element of less than
35 percent, as indicated in Decision No. 11248-(96/38), April 15, 1996. The ceiling on
nonconcessional debt applies to the contracting and guaranteeing by the central government,
the RBM, or other agencies on behalf of the central government or the RBM on debt with
nonresidents. This performance criterion is monitored on a continuous basis. The ceiling
applies to debt and commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been
received. The ceiling is measured cumulatively from the beginning of the fiscal year.
32.
less.

Short-term debt: Outstanding stock of debt with an original maturity of one year or

33.
Medium- and long-term debt: Outstanding stock of debt with a maturity of more
than one year.
34.
Excluded from the limit is the use of IMF resources, and any kwacha-denominated
treasury bill and local registered stock holdings by nonresidents. Excluded from the limit are
also (i) debts classified as international reserve liabilities of the RBM; (ii) new debt issued
to restructure, refinance, or repay existing debt up to the amount actually used for the abovementioned purposes; (iii) normal import financing; and (iv) arrangements to pay over time
obligations arising from judicial awards to external creditors. A financing arrangement for
imports is considered to be “normal” when the credit is self-liquidating.

53
III. QUANTITATIVE INDICATIVE TARGETS AND STRUCTURAL BENCHMARKS
A. Ceiling on Reserve Money
35.
Definition of reserve money: Reserve money is defined as the sum of currency
issued by the RBM, including the vault cash of commercial banks, and balances of
commercial bank accounts with the RBM. It includes required reserves held for kwacha
deposits, other domestic currency liabilities, and other demand and time deposits held with
the RBM. The reserve money targets are the projected end-quarter values starting with endMarch 2010 to end-December 2012.
36.
Definition of foreign exchange queue for program monitoring: The foreign
exchange queue is defined as the value of foreign exchange applications filed with
commercial banks that have not yet been satisfied, for bona fide current account
transactions, and it will be assessed as a percentage reduction from its end-November 2009
level of US$127.6 million. Measurement of foreign exchange queues will draw on
commercial banks’ reporting to the RBM on the effective foreign exchange demands they
face (e.g., excluding demands that have been met, have lapsed, or are not matched by
kwacha that clients could make available at the time the exchange will be transacted).
Reduction in queues will be assessed for each test date against the end-November 2009
measure, which comprises unmet foreign exchange demands placed with banks from August
1, 2009 to end-November 2009. Foreign exchange demands will reflect still outstanding
requests for immediate and forward delivery by the test date that cannot be met because of
insufficient foreign exchange supplies. The stock will include applications with commercial
banks, both by corporate and noncorporate entities, and for current but not capital
transactions, following standard Fund definitions for these terms. The RBM will, to the
extent possible, eliminate duplicate unmet requests for foreign exchange (i.e., the same
request placed with more than one bank); however, recognizing that full elimination of
duplication may be infeasible, monitoring will focus on the change from the initial stock
rather than the absolute level of the queue at the test dates. The queues will be measured on
the last day of the month and will be based on demands up to the third to last day of each
month, to take into account a normal trading period for filling requests of two to three days.
37.
Spread between the bank bureau midrate and the official midrate: This spread
is defined as the difference between the bank bureau mid-rate for U.S. dollar cash-based
buying and selling transactions and the official midrate at the day’s fixing, expressed as a
percentage of the official midrate. The reduction in the spread will be assessed against the
end-November 2009 measure of the spread of 22.2 percent.
G. Floor on Social Spending
38.
Definition of social spending: Social spending is computed as the sum of central
government spending on health, education and the fertilizer subsidy as articulated in the
central government budget for a particular fiscal year. In order to maintain Malawi’s

54
commitment and progress towards poverty reduction and the MDGs, the social spending
allocations in the government budget will not be adjusted downward to meet fiscal targets of
the program.
IV. REPORTING OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS IN THE FISCAL ACCOUNTS
39.
Donor pool–funded expenditures in support of the health SWAp: The
Government of Malawi has embarked on an integrated program of service delivery in the
health sector, the health sector-wide approach (health SWAp). In support of the health
SWAp some donors are pooling resources (the donor pool), and release these resources
through normal government procedures (i.e., recurrent budget or development Part II
budget) to the health sector. In order to manage the inflows of donor resources a U.S. dollardenominated account has been set up at the RBM that holds donor pool resources until
expenditures need to be financed. Financial flows into and out of this account will be
reported on a monthly basis from the beginning of the fiscal year.
40.
Fertilizer subsidy program: The government has embarked on a program of
subsidizing agricultural inputs, in particular, fertilizer, to smallholder farmers to improve
agricultural production, financed by the budget. The spending on the fertilizer subsidy
program will be reported quarterly from the beginning of the fiscal year, and a prior action
for the ECF-supported program, will be a transparent accounting on execution of the budget
for fiscal year 2008/09 and of the budgeted figures for fiscal year 2009/10, which was met.

V. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
41.
Monitoring of the program requires that the information listed in Tables 1-4 below
be reported to the IMF within the timeframe indicated.

JOINT IMF/WORLD BANK DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS14
The staff’s debt sustainability analysis for low-income countries (LIC DSA) shows that
Malawi is at medium risk of external debt distress. Although the debt ratios are currently low
as a result of Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt relief and Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI), the country’s debt carrying capacity has not increased substantially
in recent years. Malawi’s concentrated export base, reliance on rain-fed agriculture, and
weak international reserves leave it vulnerable in the face of adverse shocks such as the
sharp rise in fuel prices in 2008. A cautious approach to the contracting of external debt
continues to be warranted, together with a sufficiently tight fiscal policy to avoid excessive
domestic borrowing by the public sector. Measures to support a diversification of the export
base will also be important.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
HIPC and MDRI debt relief, supported by strong growth and fiscal
consolidation, allowed Malawi to attain a sustainable debt situation, such that by 2006
Malawi’s external debt was under 15 percent of GDP. Malawi’s stock of public external
debt as of end-2008 is estimated at US$683 million, 90 percent of which is multilateral, with
the balance being official bilateral debt. The previous DSA found Malawi to be at medium
risk of debt distress. Reliable figures on private external debt are not available, although the
amounts are not believed to be large.

II. DEVELOPMENTS IN FISCAL YEAR 2008/9
2.
Real GDP growth has also been strong. However, much of the growth has been in
maize production, the staple food of Malawian households (accounting for over 60 percent of
calories consumed), which has dramatically improved household consumption. However, for
the most part maize is not exported and has, therefore, not led to improved debt servicing
capacity.
3.
The increase in the price of fuel and fertilizer in 2008 had a dramatic impact on
Malawi’s balance of payments. Despite strong prices for Malawi’s major exports
(particularly tobacco), the rapid increase in prices of key imports and loose fiscal and
monetary policies contributed to a loss of official reserves. While declining fuel and fertilizer
prices in 2009, together with another strong tobacco season, brought some relief, the reserve
situation became increasingly precarious as donors delayed disbursements while awaiting
clarification on the government’s steps to address macroeconomic weaknesses.
4.
The worsening foreign exchange shortage forced the government to resort to
extraordinary external financing to address the balance of payments pressure. Malawi
sold the 2009 special allocation of SDRs in November 2009. Petroleum Importers Limited,
the private consortium that imports the majority of Malawi’s petrol, contracted a $50 million
nonconcessional external loan to purchase petrol. A $22 million nonconcessional loan was
contracted by the government in late 2009 to purchase a new presidential jet. However, after
mid year, the government began to take measures to improve the foreign exchange situation,
including tightening fiscal and monetary policies and gradually depreciating the exchange
rate.
III. MEDIUM-TERM MACRO AND DSA ASSUMPTIONS
5.
Despite recent external shocks and some policy slippages, Malawi’s growth
prospects remain solid. Malawi’s growth and development strategy to 2011 aims to
transform the nation from a “predominantly importing and consuming economy to a
predominantly manufacturing and exporting economy.” In the last 5 years growth has
averaged about 7 percent. Exports will remain the key driver of growth, supported by the
gradual dismantling of barriers within the region through the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) and Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) free
trade areas. Uranium production, which began in 2009, is expected to increase significantly
next year, and the prospects for further mining operations are good. While agricultural
production has grown strongly in recent years, yields are still low by international standards,
and improved fertilizer use and irrigation could increase both yields and cultivated acreage.
Malawi is a relatively low-cost producer of a number of cash crops, including sugar, and
further investment in this sector is likely to yield steady growth. It will be vital that policy
makers provide appropriate opportunities and prices, and avoid damaging the incentives
necessary to support the dynamic smallholder farming sector. Tourism also offers growth

61
opportunities thanks to a relatively safe environment and attractions such as Lake Malawi,
albeit starting from a low base. Prospects for the country’s main export, tobacco, are less
favorable, and the baseline assumes negative real growth over the projection period.
6.
The baseline macroeconomic framework is consistent with the government’s
economic program supported by an ECF arrangement with the IMF. It assumes that
robust real growth rates continue, buttressed by sound macroeconomic policies and increased
investment, a gradual reduction in the external current account deficit through export
diversification, prudent fiscal and monetary policies, and reliance on grants and concessional
financing in the medium term. It is assumed that not only that the current mining projects
continue as planned but that additional projects in uranium and other minerals such as
niobium prove viable. It also assumes that no contingent risks stemming from parastatal
organizations fall due. The key macroeconomic assumptions are summarized in Box 1.
7.
The projected evolution of the key debt indicators in this DSA is broadly
consistent with the projections in the previous DSA (December 2007). However, the
situation as of end-2009 is now estimated to be slightly worse than had been projected in
December 2007: the PV debt-to-export ratio was 64 percent rather than 59 percent, the debtto-GDP ratio was 14 percent rather than 12 percent, and the debt-to-revenue ratio was
85 percent as opposed to the projection of 74 percent. The debt service ratios, on the other
hand, are considerably lower than had been projected: less than 2 percent of exports and
revenues compared with a projection of 3 and 4 percent respectively. This discrepancy
between the solvency and liquidity measures partly reflects the current low interest rate
environment, which has resulted in the retention of a lower discount rate.
The projections in the 2007 DSA for growth in exports and GDP in 2008 and 2009 were
slightly lower than the actual outturn, reflecting strong tobacco prices in 2008 and strong
volumes in 2009. Uranium exports were somewhat lower in 2009 than projected, reflecting
longer project implementation times than anticipated: contracts tend to be set over the
medium-to-long term, and the price assumptions for uranium exports have only been revised
down slightly since the previous DSA.
8.
Growth in imports was substantially higher than projected in the previous DSA
for 2008 and 2009, reflecting loose fiscal policy and high prices for fuel and fertilizer.
Moving forward, the current DSA assumes that tighter fiscal and monetary policies,
combined with a real exchange rate depreciation, bring the rate of import growth down to five
percent a year in line with the previous DSA’s projection, and that the loose policies of
2008/09 prove to be an aberration. The current DSA assumes slightly higher longer-term
growth rates than the previous DSA, at 5.4 percent vs. 3.9 percent, reflecting increased
investor interest and a more favorable long-term outlook for commodities. The 5.4 percent is
considerably lower than average growth over the last five years, and reflects Malawi’s growth
potential and current low base.

62

Box 1: Key Macroeconomic Assumptions in the Baseline Scenario
The Kayelekera uranium mine is expected to operate for ten years starting in 2009 and act as a major
driver for GDP and export growth. The mine is adding to overall economic growth while
production is being ramped up during the first four years, but will then detract from overall growth
as production is wound down at the end of the mine’s life. At its peak, the mine could add
10 percent to Malawi’s overall GDP and 25 percent to exports. This DSA assumes that additional
mining projects are expected to come on stream as Kayelekera winds down, reflecting considerable
interest in Malawi’s natural resources, including uranium and niobium, with projects expected to be
viable at current prices.
Real GDP growth is projected to average 6.7 percent over 2009–14, thereafter averaging 5.4 percent.
Growth is slightly higher than the 4.5 percent average over the past decade, which reflected poor
macroeconomic management in the earlier period and a sequence of negative shocks, including a
food crisis in 2005, but lower than the average over the last five years.
Inflation is expected to remain in single digits, declining moderately from current rates of around
7.7 percent to around 7 percent over the long run. The real exchange rate is assumed to remain
stable.
The external current account, including aid transfers but excluding interest payments, is assumed to
improve over the medium term as the reserve position improves, before returning to its historical
average as a reflection of strong donor flows and increasing FDI (assumed to be on average
1 percent higher over the forecast period than the historical period, reflecting an improved business
environment and potential for additional mining projects). The current account is projected to
improve towards the outer years as increased investment begins to be reflected in exports.
Imports are expected to rise at a more moderate pace than in the past—rising 5 percent each year
compared to 13 percent over the past decade (reflecting loose fiscal and monetary policy and high
fuel and fertilizer prices in 2008). The moderation in import growth is underpinned by increased
domestic production.
Export growth is expected to remain strong, averaging 6.9 percent over the medium term to 2014 and
6.2 percent thereafter, lower than the 9.5 percent over the past decade. Strong growth in nontraditional exports contrasts with the more negative picture for tobacco exports, projected to grow
at 1 percent per annum in nominal terms.
Revenues (excluding grants) are projected to increase relative to GDP due to the expansion of the tax
base and reforms aimed at improving tax administration. Domestic revenues are projected to
average 22 percent over the projection period, improving gradually from 16.8 percent in 2010 (the
historical average for the last 10 years) to stabilize at just over 23 percent in the outer years.
Aid is projected to average 14.5 percent of GDP over 2009–14, and decline gradually thereafter,
averaging 8 percent over the projection period. Aid flow projections are based on the data provided
by the government and donors for the ECF. Grant equivalent financing (loans and grants) is
expected to decline from about 85 percent of total external financing over the medium term to
67 percent by 2029, as the government becomes less reliant on grants and highly concessional
financing.
Highly concessional financing from multilaterals is assumed to be the major source of debt (twothirds), with somewhat less concessional financing from non-Paris Club creditors providing the
balance. A small but increasing amount of borrowing on commercial terms is assumed for the outer
years.

63
IV. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
9.
In the baseline scenario, all external debt indicators remain below the
indicative, policy-dependent debt burden thresholds, although some do come close to
those thresholds (Table 1).15,16 The debt burden increases gradually after the dramatic fall
resulting from HIPC and MDRI: the ratio of the present value of debt to exports comes
closest to breaching a threshold, increasing gradually from 64 percent in 2009 to 79 in 2014,
and peaking at 128 percent in 2024, before declining to 124 percent at the end of the
projection period. The present value (PV) of external debt to GDP also increases from
around 14 percent of GDP after HIPC relief to stabilize at around 22 percent of GDP. The
PV debt-to-revenues ratio remains comfortable throughout the projection period at under
100 percent, reflecting the expected improvements in revenue collection in Malawi.
10.
Debt service obligations are expected to remain manageable, reflecting the
impact of debt relief and the expected continued high concessionality of Malawi’s
external financing. The debt-service to-exports ratio is expected to remain under 10 percent
throughout the projection period, while the debt-service-to-revenue ratio remains under
7 percent.
11.
However, stress testing reveals potential vulnerabilities in Malawi’s external
debt situation. Under the historical scenario, for example, the debt ratios would increase
rapidly, reflecting the high current account deficits of recent years, and would breach the
PV debt-to-GDP and PV debt-to-exports thresholds, while the trajectory remains below the
relevant debt-to-revenue ratio threshold (A1 in Table 3).
12.
Tobacco still accounts for more than half of Malawi’s export earnings, and
though this proportion is expected to decline to less than one-fifth by the end of the
projection period, Malawi will remain vulnerable to a shock on tobacco prices for
some time. Burley accounts for the majority of production, leaving Malawi vulnerable to
changes in tastes and regulatory actions that could dramatically shrink what is already a
stagnant global market. A country-specific shock simulating a permanent one-third fall in
tobacco prices would lead to an increase in Malawi’s debt-to-export ratio of almost
30 percentage points over the medium term, leading Malawi to exceed the 150 percent
threshold, albeit marginally and for a short period of time, after 2022 (A3 in Table 3).
Malawi would, however, fall back under the threshold by the end of the projection period.
While Malawi is also vulnerable to further falls in the price of exports, these risks are
somewhat mitigated by the longer-term contracts that characterize this market.
15

With a three-year average CPIA rating of 3.40, Malawi is classified as a medium performer under the Debt
Sustainability Framework. Accordingly, the relevant debt-burden thresholds used to indicate the risk of debt
distress are a present value of debt equivalent to 40 percent of GDP, 150 percent of exports, and 250 percent of
revenues; and debt service equivalent to 20 percent of exports and 30 percent of revenues.

16

This analysis excludes external debts of state-owned enterprises.

64
13.
Malawi also remains vulnerable to less favorable financing terms. Assuming that
the interest rate on new borrowing were 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline,
Malawi would breach the debt-to-exports ratio by 2018, although the other two PV ratios
would stay below their thresholds. The additional bounds tests (B1–5 in Table 3) further
underline these vulnerabilities: in particular, the combination shock, which shows the
impact of lower GDP, exports, inflation, and non-debt creating flows using one-half
standard deviation shocks, would result in a breach of the debt-to-exports and debt-torevenue ratios.
V. COUNTRY SPECIFIC DEPRECIATION SCENARIO
14.
In recent years Malawi has suffered from persistent balance-of-payment problems as
import growth has not been matched by growth in exports. Periodic shortages of foreign
exchange have made for a more difficult business environment, and the over-valued
exchange rate has disincentivized investments in the import-substituting and export sectors.
The depreciation scenario (Figure 1 and A4 in Table 3) is designed to show the impact of
a sharper up-front nominal depreciation on Malawi’s key debt indicators than in the baseline
scenario. This scenario assumes a depreciation of 21 percent at the start of 2010, aimed at
bringing the exchange rate rapidly into line with staff’s estimate of its equilibrium value.
This should in turn stimulate FDI and export growth: under this scenario the devaluation
leads to export growth higher by 3 percentage points per annum in 2010–13 over the
baseline scenario, reflecting our assessment of considerable underutilized potential to
increase exports to neighboring countries.
15.
Under our projections, ratios would deteriorate slightly in the short term as a result
of the decline in dollar terms of GDP and government revenues: PV external debt-to-GDP
would be 2 percentage points higher in 2010 than under the baseline scenario, and PV debtto-revenue ratios would also rise. However, over time, we project that faster export growth
would lead to debt-to-export ratios peaking at a level around 20 percentage points lower in
this scenario than under the baseline, and, if accompanied by appropriate monetary and
fiscal policy to limit the pass through into inflation, would enhance Malawi’s external
sustainability.
VI. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
16.
The public debt ratios in Malawi are expected to remain at manageable levels,
reflecting the baseline assumption of continued revenue efforts and appropriate
expenditure controls.17 The public sector PV debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline from
its 2009 level of just under 35 percent to reach under 25 percent by the end of the projection
period. The public sector debt-to-revenue ratio is expected to decline gradually from
17

Based on net debt (total stock of government liabilities less liquid assets).

65
115 percent to just under 90 percent, while the debt service-to-revenue ratio is expected to
remain under 10 percent throughout the projection period.
17.
However, public debt also remains vulnerable to shocks. Stress testing (Table 4)
indicates that the key ratios could increase significantly from their current levels in the face
of less favorable macroeconomic conditions. An unchanged primary balance from 2009
could lead to a PV debt-to-GDP ratio of 59 percent at the end of the projection period, while
GDP growth permanently lower than that in the baseline18 could see the debt-to-GDP ratio
reach 49 percent by 2029. Furthermore, Malawi is subject to a number of contingent fiscal
risks stemming from the activities of loss-making parastatal institutions, and which it is not
yet possible to quantify, but which could potentially have an impact on public debt
sustainability. To address this risk, the government has set out its intention to establish a
clear regulatory regime for public utilities infrastructure that covers operating costs and
avoids the need for budgetary transfers, and has recently taken measures to increase tariffs
on electricity and water. However, Air Malawi continues to operate at a loss and could have
implications for the public debt stock. Some question marks also remain with regard to
parastatal agricultural operations, whose finances are somewhat nontransparent.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
Despite its current relatively low debt ratios, Malawi is assessed to be at moderate risk
of external debt stress. The baseline scenario reflects a positive outlook for macroeconomic
developments in Malawi, with strong GDP growth and improvements in the external current
account. However, Malawi remains vulnerable to price fluctuations for key imports and
exports, heavily reliant on rain-fed agriculture and the narrow export base.
Reducing the risk of debt distress will depend on maintaining sound macroeconomic policies,
diversifying the export base, sustaining a sound fiscal position as well as on strengthening the
foundations for growth.

1/ This analysis covers public sector external debt only, since insufficient information is available on private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
5/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
6/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Assumes tobacco exports 25 percent lower than in baseline scenario and offsetting adjustment in import levels.
4/ Assumes an upfront nominal depreciation of 21 percent at start of 2010.
5/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
6/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Because assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at
the completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point, these two amounts cannot be added.
3

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed in the interim.
4

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to member countries that qualify for the assistance. Grant
assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover all debt owed to the Fund as of
2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for debt relief.

IX. Safeguards Assessments:
A safeguards update of the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) was completed in December
2008 with respect to the ESF arrangement approved on December 3, 2008. Previous
assessments of the RBM were completed in 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2006. The last update
found that the RBM had taken steps to strengthen its operations, but new vulnerabilities had
emerged, particularly in the areas of governance and financial reporting. Recommendations
to mitigate the identified weaknesses included: (i) reconstitution of the RBM board of
directors, which was dissolved in August 2005, and subsequent reestablishment of an audit
committee; (ii) expansion of explanatory notes in the financial statements to include
advances to government and letter of credit financial commitments; and (iii) strengthening of
the central bank law provisions on the appointment and dismissal of board members.
X. Exchange Arrangements:
From mid 2006 to late 2009, the authorities kept the exchange rate stable at about
141 Malawi kwacha to the U.S. dollar. From November 2009 to mid January 2010, the
authorities gradually depreciated the currency about 8 percent relative to the U.S. dollar to
151 kwacha to the U.S. dollar. The authorities have committed to adjusting the exchange rate
to ensure the maintenance of a market-clearing rate. Therefore, the exchange rate is now
classified as “other managed.” During the second review of the PRGF arrangement in August
2006, a multiple currency practice (MCP) under Article VIII emerged (manifested by the
significant spread between the commercial bank exchange rate and the rates at foreign
exchange bureaus). Malawi also maintains restrictions on the capital account.
XI. Article IV Consultation:
Malawi is on a 24-month Article IV consultation cycle. The last consultation
(CR No. 07/147) was concluded by the Executive Board on March 14, 2007.

ANNEX III
MALAWI: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance and
program monitoring purposes. The data module of the Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes (data ROSC), published February 17, 2005, found that, while the institutional
framework for the production of macroeconomic statistics was broadly adequate, there were
shortcomings in the scope, accuracy, and reliability of data. The weakest areas are: national
accounts, government finances statistics, and monetary and financial statistics. A key STA
recommendation was to formally assign the responsibility for the compilation of government
finance statistics to the Ministry of Finance and responsibility for the compilation of monetary
statistics to the RBM.
2.
The authorities are making efforts to improve the quality and timeliness of economic
and financial data through participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) and the GDDS Project for Anglophone African Countries. Malawi is participating in
the GDDS/PRSP and the monetary and financial statistics modules of the project. GDDS
metadata have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB)
since February 2007.
A. Real Sector Statistics
3.
The accuracy and reliability of the real sector data (including national accounts,
prices, and trade) are affected by inadequate source data and timeliness. STA has
recommended remedial actions, including the need for additional resources for the National
Statistics Office (NSO). A long-term technical assistance program in the area of national
accounts is being provided under a project by Statistics Norway. Specifically:
National accounts
4.
The NSO have revised the national accounts methodology to implement the SNA93
and to better account for the activities in the informal sector. The estimate of 2006 nominal
GDP was revised upward by some 40 percent. The revisions include a lower estimated output
share of the agricultural sector, resulting in lower estimates of output growth for 2006 and
2007.
Prices
5.
A consumer price index (CPI) is available on a timely basis. The CPI base is 2000,
drawing on the 1997/98 household survey, and data are collected on a monthly basis by
regional price collectors. There are plans to revise the CPI weights based on the 2010 planned
Integrated Household Survey (IHS).
Trade
6.
Preliminary estimates of trade are now available with a lag of two to three months.
Trade data are received electronically from six major ports. The adjustment of imports from

82
c.i.f. to f.o.b. prices is not appropriate and there is no reconciliation with data from
neighboring countries. Quality control is inadequate, and the figures are not cross-checked
with any other sources (e.g. customs receipts) to ensure accuracy.
B. Government Finance Statistics
7.
The accuracy and reliability of the data are affected by inadequate source data. A key
shortcoming in this area is inadequate system of recording source data. In addition, there are
serious quality problems, including data inconsistencies, that complicate program monitoring:


While tax revenue data are received in a timely fashion, it is not always possible to
reconcile them with deposits in the Malawi Government (MG) Account.



Nontax revenue, including capital revenues collected by line ministries are not properly
accounted for in the fiscal reports prepared by the Ministry of Finance.



Data on recurrent expenditure suffer from serious shortcomings partly related to
insufficient bank reconciliation between expenses records prepared by line ministries
and financing information prepared by the Ministry of Finance. Line ministries submit
spending reports to the Ministry of Finance based on recorded expenses, while the
Ministry of Finances estimates expenses based on funding data (from the Credit
Ceiling Authority). At times, there are sizable discrepancies between these two sources
of data for both wages and other recurrent transactions—to some extent reflecting the
widespread practice of reallocation across budget lines.



Domestically financed development expenditure estimates are based on funding
released to line ministries, and estimates on externally funded expenditure are based on
reported project grants and loans. Owing to differences in timing and financing
modalities (e.g., some donors require prefinancing of expenditure before
reimbursement), there are substantial differences between the flow of expenses and
corresponding financing data. In addition, many donor projects are still not
incorporated in the budget, and hence the corresponding expenditure is not captured in
government finance statistics. Some externally funded development expenditures are
likely recurrent and reported capital expenditure therefore overstated.



Data on expenditure arrears are likely incomplete, as reporting from the Commitment
Control System appears to be only partial, and ministry level data are not consistent
from report to report.



Malawi’s current budget classification includes economic and program classification
and program, but does not include an effective administrative/organizational
classification.20 Expenditure data is loosely mapped to functional classification based
on the CoFoG classification.



The budget classification and chart of accounts may be adequate for some
administrative, economic, functional and program classifications. An output-oriented

20

Economic classifications were upgraded to GFS 2001 compatible framework in FY 2006/07.

83
activities-based budget classification (ABB) is used for the presentation of the budget.
However, pro-poor expenditures that have been protected in line with the PRSP are
only identified in the ABB classification. As no bridge table exists to map the ABB
classification into the program classification used for expenditure reporting and
accounting, pro-poor expenditures cannot be monitored. Under the ECF program, the
government is expected to develop a mechanism for properly monitoring social
expenditures.


The government nomenclature program/subprogram currently used for the functional
classification seems appropriate considering the nature of the items classified under
this group. The items currently classified under this group include functions, programs
and administrative levels. Although substantial elements of the current output based
budget structure appear to be predominately functional in nature, it is not clear whether
they are cleanly linked to classification of functions of government (CoFoG). As such,
the government should review the current budget structure and the functional
classification based on CoFoG (GFSM2001) to verify that they are aligned.



The absence of a financial administrative structure, complete with vertical hierarchy of
responsibilities inhibits the use of Government Finance Statistics (GFS). Budget funds
are directed to organizations generally defined as cost centers (e.g., headquarters of
ministries down to the level of secondary school principals). As such, there does not
appear to be an effective hierarchal financial system. However, to be clear, over the
past two years, sub-votes have been introduced to a number of Ministries, but not as
yet, a system of warrants and sub-warrants have not been introduced.



Financing estimates are based on monetary and debt data, rather than on government
records of financing. Reporting on treasury bills directly issued to the RBM at times
has been slow.

8.
The authorities have received significant technical assistance from the Fund and other
donors to strengthen expenditure monitoring and reporting, accounting, and statistical
reporting, but results have lagged. The government has pledged to strengthen public financial
management and fiscal reporting, and renewed efforts are being made to establish a work plan,
including utilizing donor technical assistance more effectively. The authorities are currently
working with AFRITAC to modify its chart of accounts and output-based structures so that
they could more easily be realigned to the national strategy and can be readily understood.
9.
Government finance data are not reported for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) or the International Financial Statistics (IFS). An August 2005
and August 2007 STA mission that visited Lilongwe reiterated the importance of continued
efforts to implement the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), and
encouraged the authorities to improve the coverage and sectorization of government financial
operations and to correctly classify transactions according to international guidelines. The
mission proposed, and discussed with the authorities, a migration plan and timetable to adopt
the GFSM 2001 methodology.

84
C. Monetary and Financial Statistics
10.
Despite recent improvements, monetary and financial statistics (MFS) continue to
have shortcomings. These includes irregular reporting to STA21, lack of proper legislation to
grant the authority to the RBM to require reporting from other institutions22; the sectorization
of the domestic economy, and classification of financial instruments to ensure that the RBM
adheres fully to the methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The 2004
and 2008 missions noted and made a number of recommendations for addressing the above
shortcomings. The May 2008 STA mission also assisted RBM staff in developing the
standardized report forms (SRFs) for the central bank accounts and monetary aggregates and
initiated work on the SRF for reporting the data of other depository corporations (ODCs). The
mission also updated the SRF on monetary aggregates with the national definitions of money,
and used the central bank data to initiate the development of an integrated monetary database
(IMD) that will become effective only when the RBM reports data on the SRFs for the ODCs
and other financial corporations. The mission revised the coverage of interest rates in
International Financial Statistics to ensure that the most representative rates are published.
D. External Sector Statistics
11.
The external sector statistics in Malawi exhibit serious deficiencies. Concepts and
definitions used to compile the balance of payments statistics are in broad conformity with the
guidelines presented in the fourth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM4),
although there has been some progress in the transition to the methodology of BPM5. The
NSO should now adopt the BPM6 methodology, on the base of which the Malawi balance of
payments metadata should also be updated. Balance of payments data remain weak in a
number of key areas. The NSO balance of payments section remains crucially understaffed, as
it has been since March 2008. Moreover, important data sources for balance of payments
compilation ceased to be available during 2006–07, for example exchange control forms,
which could supply information on imports of goods, services, and current transfers.
Procedures for assessing the accuracy of trade data need to be improved.
12.
Data on remittances are non-existent, despite anecdotal evidence that there are high
remittances. As a first step the money transfer services should be required to report monthly
data to the RBM. Data on foreign direct investment and portfolio flows are similarly weak.
Project aid is currently classified as current transfers rather than in the capital account, and
several large in-kind projects are not captured in the balance of payments data properly.
13.
No international investment position statement is prepared. No foreign private capital
survey (FPC) was conducted between 2006–07, and the results of the 2009 survey are not yet
available. The RBM and Ministry of Finance’s Debt and Aid Department need to improve
reporting of monetary and external debt data.
21
22

The latest monetary data which were reported in November 2009 include observations for October 2009.

Some legislation that is designed to address this issue has recently been approved. However, some of the
pending legislation would give and strengthen the authority of the RBM in this regard.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Malawi
February 19, 2010

The following information has become available since the issuance of Malawi’s Staff Report
for the 2009 Article IV consultation and Request for Support under the Extended Credit
Facility (EBS/10/24). The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
The first half of the fiscal year (from July-December 2009) was characterized by
stronger than projected revenue performance, donor disbursement delays, and higher domestic
borrowing.1

•

Total revenues overperformed by around 0.5 percent of GDP, mainly due to
improvements in tax administration and strong performance from nontax revenues,
which were higher by around 0.3 percent of GDP.

•

Grants were lower than budgeted, with the shortfall amounting to around 2.7 percent
of GDP (MK 20.4 billion). Delays in donor disbursements led to higher than projected
domestic borrowing.

•

Total expenditures were roughly in line with the budget, with some notable differences
in the expected composition. In particular, expenditures on wages and salaries were
higher than budgeted by 0.06 percent of GDP (reflecting additional wages paid
teachers, nurses, and doctors), along with spending on domestic interest payments
(reflecting higher domestic debt). These additional budgetary outlays were largely
offset by reduced spending on the fertilizer subsidy program, due mainly to lower than
projected fertilizer import prices.

2.
In the second half of the fiscal year, domestic revenues are expected to continue to
overperform, and overdue donor funds are expected to be disbursed. The government intends
to tighten its control of wages and salaries and goods and services expenditures, and reduce
the domestic debt. It also intends to use some of the added budgetary inflows to increase
social and development spending by about 0.7 percent of GDP compared to the budget, while
meeting the domestic debt repayment target of 1.5 percent of GDP.
3.
The growth in reserve money and broad money was higher than projected in the fourth
quarter, reflecting the increased government borrowing intended to compensate for delayed
donor disbursements. Broad money grew by 24.4 percent at end-December 2009 on a twelvemonth basis against the projected growth of 17 percent, and reserve money grew by
1

2010.

87
39 percent against the projected increase of 28.4 percent. The central bank intensified its
efforts to mop up the ensuing rise in liquidity, resulting in an increase in the interbank rate
and other key interest rates. The program’s monetary targets are expected to be achieved,
given the expected reduction in domestic debt in the second half of the fiscal year.
4.
This year's tobacco crop is estimated at 177,500 metric tons (MT), including
153,000 MT of burley, which is slightly lower than last year’s total production. The reduced
production stems from less favorable weather conditions and a smaller number of producers.
However, prices are expected to be fairly resilient because of concerns about supply shortages
in Mozambique and Zambia. The industry is still in negotiation with the government over this
year's minimum price schedule, which tobacco producers hope will reflect prevailing market
conditions.
5.
The rains have been erratic in the southern region of the country, which has hurt maize
production. However, the maize crop is unaffected in other regions of the country. Food
security requires about 2.2 million MT of maize production per annum, which could still be
met, despite reduced production in the south.
6.
Official unencumbered reserve assets were slightly higher than projected at
US$130 million at end-December 2009, equivalent to around 0.7 months of prospective
imports.
7.
Market reaction to the recent depreciation of the kwacha has been favorable, resulting
in a gradual narrowing of the exchange rate spread from 22.2 percent at end-November 2009
to 20.6 percent.
8.
The Department for International Development (DFID) and European Union (EU)
have now confirmed their provision of budget support for fiscal year 2009/10.
9.
The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) board has recently re-certified Malawi as
eligible for compact funding. A compact could be signed later this year, and the five-year
window within which these funds must be drawn could start six to twelve months from that
point after the plans and institutional arrangements to support the program are put in place.
The MCA-funded program would focus on improving the reliability and quality of the
country’s electricity supply, expanding electricity access to peri-urban and rural areas, and
supporting institutional reforms to the Electricity Supply Corporation (ESCOM) and the state
regulator.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 19, 2010

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with Malawi
On February 19, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Malawi.23 The Executive Board also approved a
three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in the amount of
SDR 52.05 million (75 percent of quota).
Background
Malawi stands at a critical juncture following its recent progress on macroeconomic stability.
The 2009 Article IV consultation discussions and ECF program negotiations focused on the
design of a medium-term program to restore Malawi’s external equilibrium while sustaining a
high rate of growth and poverty reduction, in line with Malawi’s poverty reduction and growth
strategy.
Malawi’s macroeconomic performance has improved significantly over the past two years
and the country’s agricultural-based economy has weathered the global economic storm
relatively well. Good weather and the distribution of subsidized fertilizer have contributed to
robust growth and moderate inflation in recent years. After reaching 9.8 percent in 2008, real
GDP growth is estimated at 7.6 percent in 2009 buoyed by an increase in agricultural
production and the expansion of the service sector. Inflation has remained moderate. After
rising in late 2008, in response to food and fuel price shocks, consumer price inflation
decreased steadily to 7.5 percent in the 12 months to October 2009.

23

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

89
Fiscal policy loosened significantly in the run-up to the 2009 presidential and parliamentary
elections. Sizeable budget overruns on fertilizer and goods and services spending during
fiscal year 2008/09, combined with a modest shortfall in foreign financing, led to a high level
of domestic borrowing and meant that the central government deficit was well above the
budget. The fiscal year 2009/10 budget is a return to a prudent fiscal stance and the
preliminary results on the execution through the first half of the fiscal year to December 2009
are in line with the budget, adjusted for delays in donor support.
A weak balance of payments threatens exchange rate and price stability and medium-term
growth. The de facto pegging of the Malawi kwacha to the U.S. dollar from 2006 to late 2009
contributed to the moderation of inflation. However, persistent inflation differentials with trade
partners and the de facto peg led to some appreciation of Malawi’s real effective exchange
rate in recent years. The combination of rapid growth of domestic incomes in the nontradable
sectors and the exchange rate appreciation have led to an imbalance between the growth of
imports and exports and widened the deficits in the external current account and balance of
payments.
Malawi’s medium-term outlook is favorable, within the context of successful implementation
of the ECF-supported program. Growth is expected to remain buoyant, but moderate
somewhat relative to the high growth of the recent past. Over the medium term, growth is
expected to be supported by the expansion of productive capacity at the Kayelekera uranium
mine and the exploitation of niobium (a niche mineral for steelmaking), as well as the
development of the sugar sector. Inflation is expected to remain moderate. Although the
depreciation of the exchange rate could exert pressure on prices, the solid maize harvest,
stable fuel prices, and restrained fiscal and monetary policies should contain inflationary
pressures. International reserves should rise as a result of a substantial expected inflow of
donor assistance; seasonal inflows, once the new harvest season begins; and a reduction of
import growth followed by some greater export growth, as exchange rate adjustments and
liberalization of the foreign exchange market bring about a market-based price that can be
supported without foreign exchange rationing.
There are several key downside risks to the economic outlook including foreign exchange
shortages, uncertainties in the external environment, and changes in the international
environment for tobacco consumption. Delays in relieving the foreign exchange shortage
could threaten growth, fiscal revenues and investor confidence. A slower global recovery
could dampen export demand, investor interest, remittances, and access to foreign capital,
and thereby impair growth and the balance of payments. The medium-term prospects for
burley tobacco, the largest export commodity, are uncertain.
Executive Board Assessment
They observed that the Malawian economy has proven resilient during the global economic
crisis by sustaining high growth and moderate inflation. The financial sector remains wellcapitalized and sound; Malawi’s food security was enhanced through increased agricultural
output; and progress was made towards the achievement of the Millennium Development
Goals. At the same time, Directors noted that Malawi’s external position remains weak and
that official reserves have fallen to well below prudential levels, and they regretted last year’s
policy slippages. Directors therefore called on the authorities to seize the opportunity of their
renewed program engagement with the Fund to restore internal and external equilibrium and
address key structural constraints, while supporting strong growth and poverty reduction.

90
Directors welcomed the adoption of a more prudent fiscal stance in the 2009/10 budget
following last year’s slippages, which partly reflected the impact of high fertilizer prices. They
stressed the importance of adhering to the deficit target by containing nonpriority spending.
Directors supported the steps to minimize the budgetary impact of deficits in key parastatals
by announcing tariff adjustments to enhance cost recovery, and beginning to devise a plan
for dealing with Air Malawi’s debt. They also welcomed the more transparent accounting of
the fertilizer subsidy program, recent improvements in fiscal accounting and reporting, and
measures to ensure that budgetary targets on priority social spending are met. Directors
encouraged the authorities to make the Public Financial and Economic Management unit in
the Ministry of Finance fully operational, and looked forward to further steps to strengthen
public spending management and develop a strong debt management policy. They
supported the ongoing efforts to improve tax administration and broaden the tax base.
Directors welcomed the tightening of monetary policy and encouraged the Malawian
authorities to control the growth of monetary aggregates by ensuring fiscal discipline and
prudent credit expansion. They encouraged the development of financial markets over the
medium term, which would allow greater reliance on interest rate adjustments to help control
inflation.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ objectives to build international reserves, achieve a
properly valued exchange rate, and liberalize the foreign exchange market. They saw the
reversion of the foreign exchange surrender requirement and the gradual depreciation of the
nominal exchange rate as encouraging steps, and looked forward to Malawi’s full adherence
to Article VIII obligations by end-2011. Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
undertake further policy adjustments, including of the exchange rate, should continued
evidence emerge of excess demand for foreign exchange. They noted the importance of
exchange rate flexibility to avoid an overly contractionary fiscal and monetary stance.
Directors commended the authorities for recent progress in strengthening financial regulation
and supervision. They welcomed the recent passage of the amendments to the Banking and
Insurance Acts. Directors looked forward to cabinet approval and implementation of the
Financial Sector Development Strategy, designed to enhance financial inclusiveness,
deepening, and competitiveness.
Directors encouraged the authorities to create an enabling environment for private
investment and growth by developing a comprehensive strategy for reforming the utility
companies and expanding access to utility services. They also advised the adoption of
market-friendly agricultural sector policies. Close cooperation with Malawi’s development
partners will be important to help build capacity in these areas.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Press Release No. 10/52
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 19, 2010

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves Three-Year US$79.4 Million Extended Credit
Facility Arrangement for Malawi

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year,
SDR 52.05 million (about US$79.4 million) arrangement for Malawi under the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF) 1 to support the authorities’ economic program for the period
2010–12.
A one-year Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) arrangement also for SDR 52.05 million
(see Press Release) expired on December 2, 2009. The ESF arrangement was preceded by
an arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) that was
completed on August 4, 2008. Malawi reached the completion point for the enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative on August 31, 2006.
The ECF arrangement approved today represents 75 percent of Malawi’s SDR 69.4 million
quota in the Fund, of which the country became a member in July 1965.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion of the request by Malawi, Mr Takatoshi Kato,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“Malawi’s economic program, supported by the Extended Credit Facility, aims to support
Malawi’s Growth and Development Strategy by restoring internal and external equilibrium
and addressing key structural constraints. The authorities have adopted a prudent fiscal
stance in the 2009/10 budget by reigning in discretionary spending on goods and services
while safeguarding priority social spending, and shoring up revenues. The budgetary impact
of deficits in key parastatals will be limited by allowing for greater cost recovery and initiating
a medium-term plan for restructuring Air Malawi’s debts. Progress is also made toward a
more transparent accounting of the fertilizer subsidy program and enhanced fiscal
accounting and reporting.
“The Malawian authorities have tightened monetary policy and intend to control the growth of
monetary aggregates by ensuring fiscal discipline and prudent credit growth. The
development of financial markets over the medium term would allow greater reliance on
interest rate adjustments to help control inflation.

93
“The program is designed to build reserves and achieve a properly valued exchange rate to
support growth and stability. The adoption of a flexible exchange rate and the steps taken to
liberalize the foreign exchange market are welcome. The authorities have committed to
undertake further policy adjustments, including of the exchange rate, if evidence emerges of
continued excess demand for foreign exchange. Continued exchange rate flexibility will help
to avoid an overly contractionary fiscal and monetary stance.
“Malawi’s structural reform agenda aims at strengthening the Public Financial and Economic
Management unit in the Ministry of Finance, and enhancing the social safety net program
through improved targeting of households and a possible expansion of the donor-financed
pilot transfer program. Tax administration will be further strengthened and the tax base
broadened to allow the value-added tax rate to be reduced to regional norms.
“The authorities intend to continue their efforts to create an enabling environment for private
investment and growth by: developing a comprehensive strategy for reforming the utility
companies and expanding access to utility services; strengthening the regulatory
environment; and adopting market-friendly agricultural sector policies.”
Recent Economic Developments
Malawi’s agricultural-based economy has weathered the global economic storm well. Record
agricultural harvests in recent years led to economic growth of 9.8 percent in 2008 and an
estimated 7.6 percent in 2009. Inflation has remained moderate. The financial sector was
only modestly affected by the global turmoil and remains well-capitalized and profitable.
A loosening of fiscal and monetary policies during the run-up to elections in May 2009 led to
high government domestic borrowing in fiscal year 2008/09 (ending in June 2009), and rapid
money and credit growth. This easing contributed to low international reserves. The endJune 2009 ESF program targets for net domestic repayment of the central government, and
net domestic assets and net international reserves of the RBM were missed by wide
margins. The fiscal year 2009/10 budget reflects a prudent fiscal stance, targeting a
repayment of net domestic borrowing in line with the medium-term objectives to maintain a
low deficit and create room for private sector credit.
A weak balance of payments threatens exchange rate and price stability and medium-term
growth. The de facto pegging of the Malawi kwacha to the U.S. dollar from 2006 to late 2009
helped to moderate inflation. But persistent inflation differentials with trade partners and the
peg led to some appreciation of Malawi’s real effective exchange rate. Rapid growth of
domestic incomes and exchange rate appreciation have led to an imbalance between the
growth of imports and exports and widened external current account and balance of
payments deficits.
The authorities have recently adopted a number of measures to address the external
imbalance, including initial steps at market liberalization, gradual depreciation of the
exchange rate, and strengthened budgetary spending controls. However, continued policy
adjustment and external support are critical.

94
Program Summary
The authorities’ ECF-supported economic program aims to:
• Restore external equilibrium by liberalizing the foreign exchange regime for current
account transactions to allow a market-clearing exchange rate to emerge and to eliminate
measures inconsistent with the IMF’s Articles of Agreement by end-2011; and by attaining
international reserve coverage of a minimum of three months of imports to buffer against
external shocks by end-2012.
• Maintain internal equilibrium by pursuing prudent fiscal and monetary policies, as
reflected in the fiscal year 2009/10 budget and through restrained monetary aggregate
growth, to contain aggregate demand and inflation pressures and shift demand toward
domestic output.
• Sustain poverty reduction efforts by creating room in the budget for more social and
pro-poor spending and improving the structure of the social safety net to protect poor
households from shocks and policy adjustments, including exchange rate depreciation.
• Build competitiveness by improving public financial management, tax administration, and
the efficiency and solvency of public utilities, and by enhancing the business climate by
expanding the capacity and quality of infrastructure, promoting investor access to finance,
and reforming legal and regulatory frameworks governing financial supervision and the
operation of other key economic activities.
The program also encompasses structural measures to underpin macroeconomic objectives
and sustain high growth. The authorities have provided, as a prior action of the ECFsupported program, a transparent accounting of the execution of the fertilizer subsidy
program in the fiscal year 2008/09 budget and of the budgeted figures in fiscal year 2009/10.
The authorities committed to undertake further structural measures in three areas during the
first year of the program:
(i)

improving public financial management by making fully operational the PFEM unit;

(ii)

developing a time-bound plan to restart and liberalize the interbank foreign exchange
market; and

(iii)

continuing with implementation of financial sector reforms, and improving monetary
and exchange rate policy transparency. Over the final two years of the program, they
intend to continue improving transparency and solvency of the public utilities

Statement by Samuel Itam, Executive Director for Malawi
February 19, 2010

My Malawi authorities would like to thank staff and Management for their candid assessment
of recent economic developments and constructive dialogue and their support for Malawi’s
request for an arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). They are especially
thankful to the Executive Board and Fund Management for their continued support and
valuable policy guidance against the backdrop of a very difficult global economic
environment. The authorities are requesting Executive Board’s approval for the 3-year
arrangement under the ECF.
Recent economic developments
Malawi’s remarkable economic performance over the last few years resulted in the attainment
of macroeconomic stability, generated robust growth, reduced domestic debt and lowered
interest rates. The authorities’ resolution to generate rapid socio-economic development under
Malawi’s Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) has enabled the country to achieve
impressive growth, averaging 7 percent a year in the recent past, with inflation ebbing to
single digits. However, the high growth and development efforts boosted imports creating
pressure on external reserves, and, in some instances, the policy response was not as rapid or
robust as the authorities would have preferred. Furthermore, the adverse effects of the global
financial and economic crisis have been more severe than initially envisaged.
However, economic performance has remained encouraging. Real GDP growth for 2009 is
estimated at about 7.7 percent, supported by buoyant maize and tobacco production and the
start of uranium production. Consumer price inflation has trended down to 7.6 percent at endDecember, reflecting the tight monetary policy stance and the moderation in food and fuel
prices. In contrast, fiscal performance in 2008/09 was weaker-than-projected. The strong
domestic revenue growth was more than offset by higher-than-expected spending on the
fertilizer subsidy program, overruns on goods and services, and shortfalls in foreign financing.
These developments in turn led to expansion of credit to government and decline in foreign
exchange reserves.
The authorities have responded with stronger measures to address the fiscal and external
imbalances. The budget for 2009/10 presents a prudent fiscal stance and targets a net domestic
debt repayment of 1.2 percent of GDP. Expenditures so far in the fiscal year have been
closely aligned to the budget provisions. The authorities have also implemented a number of
measures to address the external imbalance and to liberalize the foreign exchange market. The
exchange rate has been allowed to depreciate steadily, all private import payment arrears have
been cleared, and the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) has issued a directive to revert the
surrender of export earnings to commercial banks instead of RBM. The authorities have also

97
made further progress with structural reforms to lower high lending spreads. The Credit
Reference Bureau Bill, providing the legal and regulatory framework for sharing credit
information, was approved by Parliament on February 11, 2010.
Outlook and policies going forward
The authorities are committed to adjusting their economic policies and programs for the near
term to meet the emerging challenges and maintain macroeconomic stability. They plan to
continue directing their fiscal, monetary, exchange and debt policies toward achieving their
near-term objectives of high growth, single digit inflation and building up of foreign reserves.
At the same time, the authorities will focus on their long-term development and poverty
reduction objectives.
Fiscal policy and public financial management
The authorities stand ready to reduce lower-priority spending and/or shore up revenue with
further measures to ensure that they meet the domestic debt repayment target. The authorities
intend to continue with domestic debt reduction in the medium-term. To accommodate
necessary investment, efforts will continue at mobilizing additional revenue and relying on
concessional financing. However, the authorities intend to cut expenditures further if domestic
revenue falls short and reduce domestic borrowing if aid inflows exceed budgetary
projections.
To strengthen fiscal discipline, Malawi authorities are committed to continue public financial
management reforms. In this regard, they plan to make the Public Finance and Economic
Management (PEFM) unit in the Ministry of Finance operational, which will facilitate the
timely production, consolidation and reconciliation of accounts. To reduce the risks to the
budget from contingent liabilities from activities of parastatals, electricity and water tariffs
will be adjusted as needed, commercial borrowing avoided, and Air Malawi’s debt
restructured. The debt sustainability analysis undertaken by the Fund and the World Bank
reaffirms that the level of debt distress will remain modest.
Monetary policy and exchange rate
The authorities will continue to focus monetary policy on containing inflation, maintaining
exchange rate stability, promoting a viable external sector for sustained economic growth, and
supporting the rebuilding of international reserves. The monetary program is anchored on
controlling broad money growth, with reserve money serving as the operational target. To this
end, the authorities will continue to improve liquidity forecasting by enhancing the
coordination between RBM and the Ministry of Finance, providing greater stability and
predictability to the domestic money market, and facilitating the achievement of reserve
money targets. The restraints on government borrowing and build up of international reserves
will also open greater space for provision of credit to the private sector.

98
The authorities see the need for enhanced exchange rate flexibility and have taken steps to
move the exchange rate judiciously and gradually in order to maintain expectations and avoid
reigniting inflation. They are committed to modernizing the exchange rate and monetary
policy framework. In this regard, they will re-establish an active interbank market for foreign
exchange. Foreign exchange bureaus that meet the fit and proper test will also be licensed to
operate.
The need for Fund support
The authorities have formulated a focused set of macroeconomic policies and program to
maintain a stable macroeconomic environment that would support strong and sustainable
growth. They believe that their economic and financial policies complemented by the Fund
support under the ECF, will help build international reserves to more than 3 months of import
cover without jeopardizing the development and poverty reduction objectives. Finally, while
my authorities are aware of potential risks to the program, they do not view them as
insurmountable. They expect the Fund support to be an essential and timely input that will
help them to sustain their effort to maintain macroeconomic stability and lay the foundation
for enhanced growth over the medium term.
