IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Kingdom of
the Netherlands
On February 8, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Netherlands.
A strengthening but moderate recovery led by exports and investment is underway, after a
double-dip recession that ended in early 2014, although lower production and exports of natural
reduced gas reduced growth in the second quarter of 2015, without however interrupting its
momentum. Unemployment is falling slowly and inflation is low, but positive. Credit has
continued to decline, but demand for credit is gradually rebounding. The Dutch banking system
is emerging from its restructuring. A turnaround in house prices has helped reduce the share of
homeowners with negative equity.
The economy now appears set on a gradual path of recovery and growth is expected to reach
1.9 percent this year and in 2015, supported by an improving domestic demand. The current
account surplus is projected to reduce gradually, as domestic investment and consumption take
over from net exports as the main drivers of growth. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the
downside, stemming mainly from weaker-than-expected growth in the euro area and emerging
markets. The Netherlands is receiving many refugees, and there will be unpredictable but
significant near term costs to accommodating them. However, in the longer term, there will be
demographic and growth dividends if incoming refugees are effectively integrated.
With the economy having turned the corner, and public sector balance sheets now being repaired,
it is now time to refocus the policy agenda on structural reforms. Key priorities for the Dutch
authorities include: furthering tax reform to reorient the tax burden away from the labor tax
wedge towards goods, services, and property; reforming the second-pillar pension system to
ensure greater transparency and stability; better balancing the fiscal and social benefit treatment
of regular employees vis-a-vis the self employed; and continuing the agenda of policies relating
to the housing, mortgages, and household debt.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that a recovery is underway, with moderate growth despite the decline
in natural gas output. Unemployment is on a gradual downward trajectory, house prices are
recovering, and the financial sector is strengthening. The current account surplus remains high,
although it is expected to decline gradually over time. Directors observed that risks to the
outlook are tilted to the downside, while population aging and the refugee influx pose some
challenges. Against this background, policy priorities are to support demand and boost potential
growth, including through reforms of taxation, and the labor and housing markets.
Directors considered that fiscal policy should support the recovery to the extent that there is
fiscal space, which could be used in such areas as human capital, and research and development.
A number of Directors, however, saw no available fiscal space under the Stability and Growth
Pact (SGP), pointing to the need to rebuild fiscal buffers and reduce public debt further.
Directors encouraged the authorities to use the available flexibility under the SGP to
accommodate refugee related costs without cutting other priority spending.
Directors welcomed the recent reduction of labor taxes. They encouraged broader tax reforms,
with a view to simplifying the tax system, enhancing its fairness and efficiency, as well as
promoting labor force participation. It is also important that measures be taken to address the
bias toward debt financing that has contributed to overly leveraged household and corporate
balance sheets.
Noting some strains in the second pillar pension system, Directors welcomed the principles
underpinning the government’s reform proposals to ensure greater transparency, individual
choice, and actuarial fairness. In this regard, they recommended that the authorities consider an
approach that would lessen the burden on younger families.
Directors underscored the importance of broad based reforms in the housing sector. They noted
that a reform of the social housing sector, deregulation of the private rental market, and further
reducing the maximum loan to value ratio and mortgage interest deductibility would help
improve the housing market.
Directors noted that the rapid growth in self employment points to the need to address rigidities
in the formal employment sector. In this context, they encouraged the authorities to consider
liberalizing the regulatory regime for regular employees, and to review tax and other incentives
for self employment to ensure equitable treatment between regular employees and the self
employed.

KINGDOM OF THE
NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 5, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: A strengthening but moderate recovery is taking hold after a double-dip recession
that stretched into the first quarter of 2014. Growth has been led by exports and investment,
although net exports faltered in mid-2015 as the government cut natural gas output in
response to earthquakes in the gas producing areas.
Fiscal stance: The Netherlands should use any available fiscal space with respect to the
Medium-Term Objective (MTO) to increase spending on the government’s priority areas or
reduce taxes to bolster the recovery so long as the economy remains below potential.
Tax reform: The Netherlands tax system subsidizes mortgage debt and has a high rate of
taxation on labor. Household and corporate balance sheets are highly leveraged in part
because of tax incentives. A tax reform that reorients the tax burden away from labor and
toward property and consumption taxes would reduce the debt bias in household and
corporate balance sheets, promote higher labor force participation, and enhance growth.
Pension reform: The second pillar of the Dutch pension system is fully funded and delivers a
high replacement rate. It is in principle a defined benefit system for the majority of employees.
However, frequent adjustments to contribution rates, accrual of benefit rates, and indexation
to maintain solvency make it increasingly like a collective defined contribution system. A shift
to a new model with greater transparency and individual choice is needed.
The rise of the self-employed in the labor force: The share of the labor force recorded as
being in self-employment has risen sharply in the past 15 years to 17 percent. Because of the
exemption from the second pillar of the pension system and social insurance schemes and
substantial tax preferences, employee positions are being converted into self-employed
status. This is enhancing the flexibility of the labor force. However, it may be undercutting the
social safety net to the extent that de facto employees are being reclassified as self employed
and remain outside some of the social benefits schemes as a result. The authorities should
consider creating alternative pension options for the self-employed, perhaps with partial optouts, mandatory sickness and disability insurance with pooling of risks to control costs, and
more equal tax treatment between employees and the self employed.
Housing-related policies: The turnaround in house prices presents an opportunity to
implement policies to better insulate Dutch households and the overall economy from the
effect of future house price declines and remove some of the incentives for excessive
leverage—thereby reducing the likelihood and intensity of boom-bust cycles.

CONTEXT
1.
A moderate recovery is underway after a double-dip recession that ended in early 2014.
Growth is expected to rise from 1.0 percent in 2014 to about 2 percent in 2015 and 2016. GDP growth
slowed sharply in 2015:Q2 as natural gas production and exports have been cut because of seismic
events in the gas production region. This reduced growth by half a percentage point in 2015.
Domestic demand continues to strengthen at a moderate pace.
2.
Unemployment is falling slowly. The unemployment rate fell to 8.3 percent in September
2015 from its February 2014 peak of 9.5 percent based on the national definition.1 However,
unemployment still remains well above the 5–7 percent range of 2003–07, and it is much higher for
15–25 year olds and slightly higher than average among women and the 45–65 year old group.

Credit has continued to decline, but
surveys point to a turnaround in demand for
credit. ECB quantitative easing has increased
liquidity, but it has not yet spurred lending.
Credit has continued to decline, although credit
to households appears to have bottomed out in
early 2015. Weak demand for credit appears to
be a more important factor than either liquidity
or capital constraints. However, this may be
turning around; lending surveys have been
reporting increased demand from households
and large enterprises since early 2014, while the
most recent lending survey reported stable
rather than declining credit demand from SMEs
for the first time since early 2009.

in Amsterdam, where house prices are less than 4 percent below the 2008 peak, and to a lesser
extent in other major cities. However, house price increases are more subdued in outlying areas.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
The economy appears set on a gradual path of recovery. The central scenario has
moderate growth and a slow decline in unemployment over the remainder of the decade. A gradual
reduction in the current account surplus is also projected as domestic investment and consumption
take over from net exports as the main drivers of growth. Corporate savings are high, reflected in
the high current account surplus. There is scope for firms to use these savings for new investment or
increased wages and hiring, which would further boost domestic demand and reduce the current
account surplus.
8.
The risks to the macroeconomic outlook are mixed, but skewed to the downside.
Weaker-than-expected growth in the euro area or emerging markets could slow the Dutch economy
given its high dependence on exports. While the housing market seems to have turned the corner, a
reversal of the recent recovery in house prices could weaken household balance sheets and dampen
domestic demand. With house prices still well below their peak levels even in nominal terms, there
seems little risk of overheating thus far. Fiscal risks are mixed; while a slowdown in overall growth
would negatively affect revenues, a continued rebalancing of growth from external to domestic
components would, other things being equal, improve the tax composition of growth, leading to
stronger structural consolidation and debt reduction.

The Netherlands is also receiving many refugees and economic migrants. The number
of asylum applications, more than half from Syria, has been rising rapidly. Over 20,000 new asylum
applications were placed in September and October alone, nearly equal to the total in the preceding
8 months of 2015. The most recent forecast is for 58,000 arrivals in each of 2015 and 2016. Even if
the numbers of applicants remain at September–October levels for the final two months of the year
instead of increasing further, the numbers in 2015 would be more than twice those of 2014 and
nearly five times the 2013 level. Costs associated

Sector Report (ESR) assessment indicates that the
external position is stronger than the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable
policy settings by 1–5 percent of GDP. But the assessment is particularly uncertain in the
Netherlands—the current account surplus may also reflect the high corporate savings and liquidity
of Netherlands-based multinationals and favorable tax treatment for corporate income in the
Netherlands. The high corporate savings are likely to be used for new investment as the Dutch and
global economies recover which will also tend to reduce the current account surplus (see ESR Table).
Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities broadly agree with the central scenario of a gradually closing output
gap over the remainder of the decade and a slight turnaround in the current account surplus. They
also agreed that the risks are mostly to the downside and are largely due to external factors.
However, they see some upside potential from a strengthened recovery in the housing market.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
An interrelated set of policies has given rise over the years to an overly leveraged Dutch
economy. The tax system has a bias toward debt rather than equity for both households and firms.
The high pension savings of most workers promotes security in old age, but the associated high
contributions together with the high labor tax wedge can leave younger households cash-constrained.
These constraints, together with the tax incentives for home ownership and mortgage debt and the
absence of a well-functioning private rental market, promote premature home ownership and high
household leverage. This in turn leaves the real economy vulnerable to shocks. There are also issues
with the need for frequent changes in contribution, benefit accrual, and indexation in the pension
system and tax and other incentives to reclassify employment relationships as self-employment. The
government has taken important steps to address the inefficiencies in the housing market, support
indebted households, address financial sector problems, and implement pension and labor reforms.
However, there is more to be done, and because of the interrelated nature of the policies and their
economic impact, there is merit in pursuing the reforms in tandem.

A. Fiscal Policy—Making Effective Use of Fiscal Space
12.
Fiscal policy was broadly neutral in
2015 and is expected to slightly tighten in
2016. The recovery helped keep the headline
deficit relatively stable in the 2.2–2.4 percent of
GDP range in 2013–15, with a slight deterioration
in the structural balance. The draft 2016 budget
reduces labor and income taxes by €5 billion
(about 0.7 percent of GDP) while pursuing the
expenditure-based path of fiscal consolidation.
General government debt will decline from
67 percent to 66 percent of GDP between
2015 and 2016. Both the headline deficit and the
pace of debt reduction are comfortably within the
Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) limits.

13.
There is fiscal space in economic terms, but perhaps less in SGP terms. Staff calculations
show a structural deficit only slightly larger than the MTO of a 0.5 percent of GDP deficit, based on
output gap estimates in line with the authorities’ ones. However, the authorities note that the
European Commission’s (EC) approach to the calculation, based on a smaller and more rapidly
closing output gap, shows structural deficits close to 1 percentage point above the MTO in 2015 and
2016.2 However, because the SGP rules are defined in terms of the EC approach, Fund staff and
other alternative estimates are of limited relevance in assessing fiscal space under the SGP.
14.
Dutch fiscal policy should support the recovery to the extent possible. Should
calculations of the deficit for 2016 change or if there is still a significant output or employment gap
in 2017, staff recommends that the authorities make use of this space to support the recovery. The
authorities could use any available fiscal space to catch up on deferred spending priorities. For
example, public research and development spending is low in comparison to EU Member States at
similar levels of development (e.g., Austria, Denmark, Germany, and Sweden), and it is assumed to
decrease further. Also, the authorities should consider using any available fiscal space under the SGP
to accommodate refugee-related costs without cutting other priority spending. However, in the
medium- and long-term as the output gap closes, consolidation should resume to rebuild fiscal
buffers, including by reducing public debt below 60 percent of GDP.
Authorities’ Views
15.
Given that the fiscal stance is at the limit of that permitted under the SGP, the
authorities do not see fiscal space. While the deficit is well below 3 percent of GDP and the
reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio is more than sufficient to meet SGP requirements, the structural
balance calculated using the European Commission approach, exceeds the MTO by nearly a
percentage point in 2016. They also noted the substantial increases in public debt in the course of
the financial crisis and recession. In this context, they noted that it would be important to reduce
public debt to levels well below 60 percent of GDP to restore fiscal buffers.

B. Tax Reform—Promoting Growth and Reducing Complexity3
16.
Tax reforms could increase potential growth, enhance fairness, and improve efficiency.
Despite progress in recent years, the Dutch tax and benefit system remains unbalanced; significant
efficiency gains could be achieved by shifting the tax burden away from labor, and towards
consumption and capital income, in particular on residential property ownership. This makes some
sense on distributional grounds as well; Dutch households have high net wealth on average, but—
excluding pension entitlements—it is unevenly distributed and most of the assets are in illiquid real
estate and pension accounts.
2

The European Commission methods show a smaller output gap than estimates by staff or the authorities with the
result that there is a structural deficit instead of approximate balance.

Practices.

17.
The authorities have recently taken a number of steps in the right direction. For
example, they have decided to gradually phase out some of the large subsidies on housing
investment and pension savings and to roll back some of the regressive features of the taxation of
capital income. Also, the 2016 €5 billion labor tax cut package is mainly targeted at female workers
and low-wage earners—the most responsive groups to labor taxation in the Netherlands—
which should help create new jobs and increase hours worked.
18.
But more could be done and faster. In particular, the tax preferences on pension income
could be reduced and the current large subsidies on home ownership could be phased-out more
quickly than currently envisaged, allowing a budget-neutral and growth-enhancing rapid reduction
of the labor tax wedge. Moreover, important tax revenue and efficiency gains would result from
harmonizing the currently fragmented capital income and value-added tax schemes. Taxes should
be levied on actual returns on assets as opposed to presumptive returns, allowing greater fairness
and better anti-cyclical properties of the taxation system.
19.
The current tax system favors debt and has contributed to overly-leveraged
households and firms. Interest deductibility has favored debt over equity financing, resulting
in excessive leverage, exacerbating business cycles and potentially threatening financial and fiscal
sustainability. Future tax reforms should minimize this debt bias. The Dutch authorities have already
taken some measures to foster a gradual deleveraging in the housing sector (e.g., decreasing loanto-value (LTV) ratios and mortgage interest deductibility (MID)). Similar measures should be taken in
the corporate sector. For example, an allowance for corporate equity (ACE) could be introduced and
calibrated so that equity and debt finance become fiscally neutral to encourage equity building.4
A similar type of allowance could, in principle, also be introduced in the housing sector; revenue
shortfalls could be offset through broadening the VAT base and unifying VAT rates.
20.
The OECD and G20 recommendations on international corporate taxation to limit
Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) will deploy their first effects in 2016. The Dutch
Corporate Income Tax Act 1969 (CITA 1969) will be modified to include supplementary transfer
pricing documentation requirements in line with the three-tiered approach of Action 13 of the OECD
BEPS project. Under the draft law (September 2015), the Country-by-Country (CbC) report, the
master file and local file requirements will be applicable for fiscal years starting on or after
January 1, 2016. The Tax Administration also plans to start exchanging information on rulings in
2016 (Action 5), and to adopt the new minimum standards to prevent treaty abuse (Action 6) and
the criteria to define permanent establishment (Action 7) once incorporated into the update of the
OECD Model Tax Convention.

4

Numerous studies have tried to measure the impact of taxation on leverage and yielded widely different results.
Methodologies vary and the results are sensitive to the debt maturity, the design of the tax system and other country
specific factors. A meta-analysis of the empirical literature (R. De Mooij, “The Tax Elasticity of Corporate Debt: A
Synthesis of Size and Variations”, IMF working paper WP 11/95, 2011) concluded that 1pp increase in the corporate
income tax rate could increase the debt-equity ratio up to 0.28 percent. In other words, a country with a CIT rate of
25 percent—like the Netherlands—would see the average corporate debt–asset ratio fall by 7 percentage points
(0.25x0.28) if it fully eliminated the corporate tax advantage of debt.

taxation—a potentially efficient revenue collection
instrument—does not carry its share of the load (see table and figures). There is substantial scope for a
reallocation of the tax burden from labor to capital, in particular housing. Back-of-the-envelope calculations
indicate that taxing pensions as ordinary savings (€14 billion), removing the tax subsidy for housing (€6 billion),
and unifying VAT at the standard rate (€8 billion) could increase (ex-ante) revenues by roughly 4 percent of GDP.

Authorities’ Views
21.
The authorities and staff are in broad agreement on tax reform. They agreed about the
desirability of a shift in tax burden from labor to other taxes less harmful to economic growth. They
noted that the 2016 tax reductions on labor taxes were a move in the right direction, especially due
to targeting the lower tax wedge on groups with the highest labor supply elasticity. However, they
expressed some reservations about taxing the actual returns on assets, which is in the political
spotlight. Although they recognized that it is the most fair and least distorting way to tax capital
income, it would entail a much greater burden of record-keeping than their own proposed reform of
the wealth tax. The authorities will investigate whether it will be feasible to tax actual returns in the
near future. They agreed in principle on raising VAT taxes on items not currently charged at the
standard rate, but noted the lack of political support and that they are constrained to some extent
by EU rules in this regard. They agreed that a reduction in the debt bias in personal and corporate
tax is in principle also desirable, and noted the gradual reduction in MID that is already underway,
but had concerns that faster reduction in MID could undercut the housing recovery. They have not
included measures such as an allowance for corporate equity to reduce the debt in corporate
taxation, and they have noted that corporate taxation needs to be reformed in a coordinated
manner with other EU and advanced economies.

C. Pensions—Second Pillar Business Model is Under Stress5
22.
The Dutch pension system has many virtues. The first pillar ensures a basic retirement
income for all citizens and a very low rate of old-age poverty. The fully-funded, mostly definedbenefit, second pillar plans ensure a high replacement rate while pooling longevity risk. Finally, the
Financial Assessment Framework ensures the soundness of these plans by requiring adjustments in
contributions and benefits whenever the solvency ratio threatens to fall below full funding.
23.
However, the second pillar plans are coming under stress. They are increasingly
combining the disadvantages of both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes while
failing to capture many of the virtues of either. While in principle defined benefit plans, they are
increasingly behaving as de facto collective defined contribution plans. Preserving their solvency has
necessitated frequent ad hoc adjustments in contribution rates, benefit accrual rates, indexation
mechanisms, and even nominal benefit reductions. The system also entails opaque redistribution
mechanisms from younger to older cohorts. As a result, the predictability that should be associated
with defined benefit plans for both contributors and beneficiaries has been undermined.
Furthermore, the adjustments to contributions and benefits tend to be procyclical in that they
reduce disposable income at times when the economy is already weak. Finally, the absence of
individual accounts, and opaque redistribution mechanisms between age cohorts make them nontransparent.

24.
The government’s reform proposals to provide for more transparency, individual
choice, and improve actuarial fairness across age cohorts are welcome in this context.
In particular, individual accounts could improve transparency and provide greater choice.


One possibility is to shift to a full defined-contribution system. This option would not preclude
collective asset management by the social partners. It would also allow greater individual choice
in contributions and investment options, and ensure sustainability by definition. The investment
options could be constrained to protect future retirees from poor investment choices and insure
them against longevity risk; the social partners could continue to negotiate terms for annuities,
pension-related insurance, and investment management services collectively. The problems of
procyclicality, portability, actuarial fairness in intergenerational transfers, and non-transparency
would go away.

levy catch up contributions, thus negatively
affecting disposable income in pro-cyclical way. At the same time, opaque and actuarially unfair
redistribution mechanisms within the schemes, notably from the young to the old, or from the poor to the
rich, have remained unscathed, hence delaying debt deleveraging and the economic recovery. In this
context, the government has recently submitted to Parliament a proposal for “personal pensions with risk
sharing”, consisting of mandatory, individual defined contributions schemes complemented by insurance
provisions aimed at pooling part of the longevity and/or financial risks, in a proportion still to be
determined. There are no obvious answers to the challenges facing the Dutch pension system. However, the
authorities may consider the experiences of the Australian system (mandatory individual DC schemes,
instrumental in the built up of large pension savings but currently suffering from underdeveloped payout
options), Swiss system (decentralized DC schemes complemented with DB features such as nationwide
guarantees on investment returns and retirement incomes) discussed in the SIP, or perhaps even closer to
the Dutch model, Danish pension system (mandatory DC schemes with collective management of asset
portfolios) for both positive and negative lessons learned.



If reforms are more limited and retain defined-benefit system elements such as predefined
accrual rates, the question of actuarial fairness between age cohorts would still arise. The
government proposal has a constant, proportional, but a decreasing accrual rate as retirement
age approaches. We have argued for addressing intergenerational fairness issues by keeping a
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS

constant accrual rate with escalating contribution rates with age. Each has its problems. The
former approach would place a high premium on the youngest workers to have regular and
stable employment at a stage in life when they are least likely to be in that situation. The latter
has the advantage of giving younger households more disposable income to save up for down
payments or build up home equity, but it might discourage the hiring of older workers.
Modifications would also need to take into account the need for greater transparency, although
individual accounts would facilitate this.


Under any approach, transition issues will be complicated. They are technically easier to solve
the closer to a defined contribution system the authorities go, but real and perceived issues of
fairness will arise with any transition scheme.



Administration and trading costs for pension funds seem high at roughly 50 basis points per
year, particularly taking into account the very large size of the funds. The authorities and
pension funds should consider the merits of the current active management strategies relative
to more of a buy-and-hold approach and other strategies to reduce costs.



The current pillar II system is fragmented among sectoral and corporate pension schemes,
penalizing occupation mobility. Any redesign should increase rather than reduce labor market
flexibility through pension portability.

There are no obvious answers to the challenges facing the Dutch pension system. However, the
authorities should consider the experience of the Australian system (with mandatory definedcontributions but challenges in the payout options) and Swiss system (with decentralized definedcontribution plans) for lessons learned in both positive and negative experiences. The Danish
pension system may also merit consideration; it has many similarities to the Dutch model, but it also
differs from it in some of the dimensions currently under consideration in the Netherlands.
Authorities’ Views
25.
The authorities welcomed the staff endorsement of their principles for pension
reform. In particular, they agreed that more transparency would be welcome and possibilities for
tailor-made solutions or individual choice need to be explored. However, they express some
reservations about allowing too much individual choice in terms of both contribution levels and
investment decisions. In their view, the government and social partners needed to protect
contributors from the consequences of poor investment decisions and the “myopia” revealed in the
behavioral economics literature. In reforming the system to make it actuarially fair across age
cohorts, they see having a flat contribution rate but a rate at which pension entitlements accrue that
declines with increasing age as preferable to the staff recommendation of contributions that
increase with age.

D. Strengthening the Financial Sector and Housing Finance6
26.
The Dutch banking system is gradually emerging from its restructuring. Dutch banks
are well prepared for Basel III, and continue to adjust to tightening capital and liquidity
requirements (Panel 3), Retail deposits increased, as depositors moved assets from insurance savings
accounts to banks’ and helped reduce banks’ reliance on wholesale funding.
27.
Banks have made steady progress towards meeting the new capital and liquidity
requirements under Basel III and securing loss-absorbing capital. In early 2015 the banking
sector needed to raise about €2.6 billion in core capital to comply with the Basel III rules, and
€12 billion in hybrid debt instruments to comply with national supervisory requirements—mainly for
higher risk-weighted requirements and the Dutch-specific leverage ratio at 4 percent. Banks were
successful in issuing qualifying instruments in 2015. The three systemic banks are also gradually
preparing for specific risk buffers and the minimum capital necessary to absorb losses through bailin rules.
28.

Housing policies and housing finance are being addressed in tandem with tax reform.



The authorities are reducing the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for mortgage loans by one
percentage point per year until it reaches 100 percent in 2018, with no further plans beyond that
date. The 2014 Article IV consultation urged a further and faster reduction beyond 2018. In May
2015, the Financial Stability Committee’s (FSC) recommended reducing the LTV by one
percentage point a year through 2028 when it would reach 90 percent.7



The current policies of gradually reducing the LTVs ratios on new mortgages to 100 percent by
2018 and allowing MID only for new fully amortizing loans are steps in the right direction to
mitigate housing risks.



The prospective reinstatement of the higher gift tax exemption is also welcome for reducing
mortgage debt.

29.


However, more could be done in housing-related policies.
The Netherlands’ LTV limit is high even at 100 percent, and the recent recommendation of the
FSC to continue the annual reduction in LTV limits between 2019 and 2028 to reach 90 percent
should be adopted.8

6

The Netherlands is among the countries for which Financial Stability Assessments (FSA) are mandatory. The next FSA
will be conducted in conjunction with the next Article IV consultation, and planning for it is well underway.
Accordingly, the next Article IV consultation will have a deeper focus on financial sector issues.
7

The FSC is composed of the DNB, and the Authority for Financial Markets (AFM). The Ministry of Finance participates in
its deliberations, but it does not vote. It also receives research support by the Central Planning Bureau (CPB).
8

Figures are not available on the likely impact of such a change on average LTV ratios; however, a substantial
minority of mortgage loans are made at the maximum allowable LTV (103 percent in 2015).
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS



A faster pace would be welcome for both LTV and MID reduction. This would ensure that
households have greater financial buffers and would limit macroeconomic volatility in the event
of a housing shock.



This process should be complemented by an accelerated reform of social housing to make it
more market oriented and other polices to promote a larger and more robust private rental
market (e.g., deregulation of rents on small apartments).

These policies would give younger households an alternative to premature home ownership and
promote geographic labor mobility, both directly and by helping to avoid underwater mortgages.
Clarifying the LTV path after 2018 sooner rather than later would also provide buyers more time to
build savings and for all participants in the housing market to plan appropriately.
Authorities’ Views
30.
The authorities pointed to the low level of defaults on mortgages throughout the
crisis. Furthermore, they pointed to the broad set of reforms undertaken by the current
government. In this context, they emphasized that the FSC advice on further reducing the LTV limit
was addressed to future governments and the decision on this and any further measures should
indeed be left to future governments.

E. The Rapid Rise of the Self-Employed—Costs, Benefits, and Reforms9
31.
The rapid rise in self-employment reveals tensions in the labor market. While the rising
share of self employed has helped increase the flexibility of the Dutch labor market and contain
unemployment, it is also suggestive of an overly rigid regulatory regime for regular employment;
the self employed receive large tax exemptions and tend to pay lower social and pension
contributions. But not all of the self employed are in that status voluntarily. Many work under
conditions that resemble regular employment relationships, and their increasing number threatens
to undercut the social safety net and to jeopardize the viability of the pension schemes. Therefore,
tight enforcement of recent regulations aimed at screening involuntary self employment is a
welcome development. Perhaps new criteria could also help (e.g., when hours and work location are
set by the entity paying for the services, there would be a presumption that this is a regular
employment relationship).
32.
The lack of retirement benefits and sickness and disability insurance for the self
employed needs to be addressed. The low levels of participation in Pillar II and Pillar III pension
schemes and sickness and disability insurance exposes many of the self employed to low income in
retirement. This could be addressed through a collectively-managed pillar III system with
contributions roughly equivalent to average Pillar II plans for employees. The self employed could

be enrolled by default but opt out of part of the pension contributions down to some minimum
level. Sickness and disability insurance could also be made obligatory, and a collectively managed
insurance pool could be used to control costs to beneficiaries. At the same time, the authorities
should consider liberalizing the regulatory regime for employees and move toward more equal tax
treatment between employees and the self employed.
Authorities’ Views
33.
The authorities emphasized the benefits from allowing self employment as a means of
allowing labor market flexibility. They agreed that the rapid growth in the self-employed can
possibly be attributed to differences in fiscal and labor market regimes, but also noted that new
legislation has been proposed to limit abuse. They agreed that tax, social and pension contribution
and benefit regimes, and other labor market regulations should be examined to help ensure
equitable treatment of citizen in both regular employment and self employment.

STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The Netherlands appears to be firmly on the path to recovery from the long recession.
The economy has grown for five quarters, and growth is moderate but strengthening when the
impact of reduced natural gas production is taken into account. Unemployment is on a gradual
downward trajectory, and housing prices are recovering.
35.
The assessment of external stability and the exchange rate is generally benign. The
current account surplus is high, but structural factors relating to population aging and the
associated drawdown of pension assets placed abroad, and the decline in natural gas production
will contribute to a gradual decline in the surplus in the coming decades.
36.
Nevertheless, there may be a role for fiscal support for the recovery. The economy
remains well below potential, and there appears to be fiscal space, at least in economic terms, for
more support for the recovery. However, in the medium- and long-term, it would be desirable to
rebuild fiscal buffers, in particular by reducing public debt to levels substantially below 60 percent of
GDP.
37.
The authorities’ proposed ideas for tax reform through shifting taxes away from labor
income are welcome. However, a more far-reaching plan to reduce the bias toward debt that has
contributed to overly-leveraged household balance sheets should also be implemented.
38.
The strains in the second-pillar pension system need to be addressed. The principles laid
out by the government for more individual choice and more transparency are appropriate. A move
toward a more explicit defined contribution approach would solve many of the transparency and
individual choice issues that have arisen. However, to the extent that a more modest reform retains
some of the defined benefit features relating to accrual and contribution rates, a more actuarially
fair approach that frees up disposable income for younger families deserves consideration.

39.
Reforms are needed in the Dutch housing sector beyond removing tax preferences.
The Dutch housing market has many features that push toward excessive leverage, in particular the
absence of a well-functioning private rental market. Relatively affordable rental housing tends to be
confined to the social housing sector, which is characterized by inefficiencies, a lack of market-based
pricing, very long waiting lists, and heavy regulation of rents in housing that might compete with
social housing. As a result, young families are pushed prematurely into home ownership. A reform of
the social housing sector to more effectively implement means testing and market-based pricing
and deregulation of the private rental market are necessary complements to the removal of tax
preferences and shift toward LTV limits that require at least some home equity.
40.
Labor market inflexibility and its consequences need to be addressed. The rapid rise in
the share of the Dutch labor force characterized as self-employed, particularly those whose work
arrangements strongly resemble regular employment relationships, suggests that rigidities in the
employment protection regime for regular employees are excessive. While self employment is a
useful means of introducing flexibility into the Dutch labor market, it appears that the current
system is open to abuse in some cases. The authorities should consider liberalizing the regulatory
regime for regular employees but also reconsider the tax incentives and the extent to which the selfemployed are exempt from safety net contributions and the benefits that go with participation in
the social safety net programs.
41.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month schedule.

Tensions on liquidity could
prompt the banks to tighten
credit conditions and entrench
segmentation in the financial
market, keeping growth low.

Policy response
- Use the fiscal space to support
growth, investment, and private
debt deleveraging.
- use fiscal space or reprogram
expenditure for refugee-related
costs.
- Maintain adherence to mediumterm structural fiscal targets
- Reduce debt bias, eliminate
VAT distortions, and reduce
labor market tax wedge.

- Continue the deregulation of
the housing market
- Promote sustainability and
transparency of pension funds.
- Reduce tax incentives for self employed and reverse the
associated transfers from
private to public balance
sheets.

- Ensure adequate capital and
liquidity buffers.
- Announce a clear path for
further reducing the LTV
towards 80 percent beyond
2018.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF Staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall
level of concern of the time of discussion with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex II. External Sector Assessment
The Netherlands
Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Background. Since 2000, the NIIP has continuously strengthened and reached 69.7 percent of GDP at end-2014 up from
41.6 percent in 2013. Through end-June 2015, the NIIP reached 66.2 of GDP. The increase chiefly reflects large net FDI outflows
and a strong other investment position as well as valuation effects on overseas holdings due to higher equity prices and the
euro’s depreciation. As of June 2015, the total assets reached 536.5 percent of GDP and liabilities 470.3 percent of GDP. Over the
medium term, the NIIP is expected to continue growing, given the projected sizeable current account surpluses
Assessment. The Netherland’s safe haven status and its sizeable foreign assets limit risks from its large foreign liabilities.

Current account

Background. The current account has been in surplus since 1981, and is expected to reach 10.2 percent of GDP in 2015, after
10.6 percent of GDP in 2014. The high current account surpluses reflect mainly the savings of the corporate sector and
institutional pensions held by households, offset in part by health expenditure above OECD average, and Netherland’s status as
a trade and financial center and natural gas exporter. The large corporate savings have been used to finance substantial FDI
outflows by global firms in the Netherlands. Household savings have also increased as a result of deleveraging following the
sharp declines in housing prices starting in mid-2008. The CA surplus is projected below its level in 2014 (10.2 percent of GDP),
given a lower primary income and a higher service deficit. Declining oil and commodity prices had substantial effects in 2015,
reducing the CA surplus by 1.6 percent of GDP, explained by lower gas production due to earthquakes in extraction areas and
reflected in lower exports (-0.6 percent of GDP). Strong growth in export volume amid declining export prices and contained
exporter margins are projected to deliver a lower CA surplus in 2015 than in 2014.

Real exchange
rate

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Background. Both the ULC and CPI based REERs depreciated by 2.1 and 1.7 percent respectively in 2014, mainly due to the
1.6 percent nominal effective depreciation, primarily reflecting the euro depreciation. As of October 2015, the REER depreciated
by 4.0 percent from its 2014 average.
Assessment. The EBA REER gaps estimates for 2014 are -1.3 percent and -10 percent respectively for the EBA index and level
models. Taking into account the EBA REER results, staff assesses that the REER remained undervalued by around 5 percent
within a range of 0-10 percent. The further depreciation of the euro in 2015 is likely to have increased the undervaluation of the
exchange rate.

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and policy
measures
FX intervention
and reserves
level

Background. Net FDI and portfolio outflows dominate the financial account. FDI outflows are driven by the investment of
corporate profits abroad. On average, gross FDI outflows largely match corporate profits.
Assessment. The strong external position limits vulnerabilities from capital flows. The financial account is likely to remain in
deficit as long as the corporate sector continues to invest substantially abroad.
Background. The euro is a global reserve currency.
Assessment. Reserves held by the Euro area are typically low relative to standard metrics, but the currency is free floating.

Overall Assessment: The
external position in 2015 was
stronger than the level
consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable
policy settings. The REER
depreciation since 2014 is
likely to further strengthen
the external position. The
Netherlands’ status as a trade
and financial center and
natural gas exporter make an
external assessment more
uncertain than usual.
Potential policy responses
Structural reforms to raise the
productivity of smaller,
domestic firms and progress
in repairing household
balance sheets and
strengthening the banking
system will support domestic
demand and contribute to
reducing external imbalances.
A shift towards more
productive investment as the
Dutch and global economies
recover will also help in the
rebalancing.

29

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS

Assessment. Staff assesses that the current account gap is smaller than that estimated in the EBA model due to the following
country-specific factors: (i) unlike many other advanced economies, the Netherlands has a fully funded pension system which
has probably increased household saving rates above the level that households would save voluntarily, and (ii) following the real
estate collapse, household deleveraging has also kept saving rates high. Taking account these factors, staff assessment of the
current account gap is in the range of 1-5 percent of GDP. 1/ In the medium term the CA surplus is likely to decline, supported
by a recovery in domestic demand, progress in household deleveraging, declining gas exports, and demographic trends.

Overall Assessment

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

1/ In comparison with last year, the EBA-estimated CA gap in 2015 (unexplained residual plus by the contribution of identified
policy gaps) narrowed by 1.5 percentage point to 3.6 percent of GDP. The smaller gap reflects a lower cyclically adjusted CA
surplus (down from 9.7 to 9.2 percent of GDP) and a higher estimated CA norm of 5.7 percent of GDP (after 5.0 percent in 2013).
2/The larger external balance sheet, presence of large international corporations, and issues related to the measurement of the
current account add uncertainty to this assessment. According to the DNB, half of the positions in assets and liabilities are
attributable to subsidiaries of foreign multinationals, which are identified as Special Financial Institutions (SFIs).

Annex III. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt is expected to remain sustainable, peaking at 67 percent of GDP in 2015 before
decreasing at a faster pace than previously anticipated to about 63 percent of GDP by 2020,
owing to favorable growth developments and continued fiscal tightening. The largest risks to the
baseline scenario are represented by a negative growth shock and a contingent liability shock,
which could push up the debt-to-GDP ratio to 74 percent and 95 percent by 2017, respectively.
Macroeconomic assumptions: Real growth is forecast to accelerate from about 1.9 percent in
2015 to 2 percent in 2020, driven by exports, a gradual rebound in private consumption supported
by positive wealth effects, and catch up investment. Reflecting stronger domestic demand, inflation
would increase to just below 2 percent in 2016 before stabilizing around 1.5 percent over the
medium run. While rapidly declining over the projection period, public debt would remain above
60 percent of GDP, calling for the use of the higher scrutiny framework in the context of the Fund
framework for debt sustainability analysis.
Realism of baseline assumptions: Over 2006–2014, staff projections of the main macroeconomic
and fiscal variables in the Netherlands have constantly remained close to the median within the
25–75 interquartile range vis-à-vis other surveillance countries, except for the 2014 primary balance,
which turned out higher than expected. On average, real growth and primary balance forecasts
appear to have been relatively conservative, while inflation forecasts have been slightly optimistic.
Baseline scenario and stress tests: Under the baseline scenario, public debt would rapidly decrease
from 67 percent of GDP in 2015 to about 63 percent by the end of the projection period, under the
joint effects of steady nominal growth and the pursuit of expenditure-based fiscal consolidation.
Public debt would increase up to, and stabilize around, 69 percent of GDP in the historical scenario,
due to conservative growth assumptions. It would first peak, and then steadily decrease over the
medium term, in all other scenarios.
Main shocks to the baseline scenario


Growth shock. Assuming a negative one standard deviation shock on the real growth rates in
2016-2017, lowering them by about 2.5 percentage points compared to the baseline scenario,
associated with inflation rates lower by 0.6 percentage points, public debt would increase to
74 percent of GDP in 2017 before gradually returning to 71 percent by 2020. Gross financing
needs would peak at 15 percent of GDP in 2017.



Primary balance shock. A deterioration of the primary balance by 1.2 percentage points in
2016-2017 would stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratios at 69 percent for these years, with gross
financing needs reaching 14 percent of GDP, thus postponing fiscal consolidation until 2018.



Contingent liability shock. A non-interest expenditure shock arising from the need to bail out
10 percent of the banking sector, accompanied with lower growth rates by one standard
deviation, lower inflation, and higher interest rates, would push up gross financing needs to

33 percent of GDP in 2016 and public debt to 95 percent of GDP in 2017. Public debt would
subsequently decrease, but remain above 93 percent of GDP by the end of the projection
period.

Annex IV. Progress Against IMF Recommendations

Financial Sector Policy

Fiscal Policy

Promote orderly
deleveraging

IMF 2014 Article IV Recommendations

38

Authorities’ Response

Addressing the household debt problem
among the young would lift overall spending
by increasing transfers between generations,
helping reprofile underwater mortgages, and
reducing the stigma associated with personal
bankruptcy.

The recovery in the housing sector since mid-2014
reduced the share of underwater households. The tax
break on monetary gifts up to €100,000 will be
restored from January 2017. In the meantime,
households can use a standard €50,000 exemption on
tax-free transfers.

Reducing pension contributions for the young
could also free resources to reduce debt.

Rebalancing pension contributions from young to
older cohorts is one of the aspects currently discussed
with all stakeholders within the Pension Dialog.

To support growth during deleveraging, fiscal
policy should focus on structural targets. Also,
a medium term budget framework would also
enhance the predictability and responsiveness
of fiscal policy.

With the exit from the EDP, the authorities are
refocusing the fiscal balance on medium-term targets,
provided SGP targets are observed. They also target
to reduce public debt to levels below 60 percent of
GDP to restore fiscal buffers.

Tax reform should aim to reduce the debt bias,
VAT distortions, and the labor tax wedge.

Shifting the tax burden from labor to goods and
services and property would help reduce labor costs
and improve tax equity. Accordingly, the 2016 tax
reduction on second-income earners elicits the shift.

Stronger capital and liquidity buffers would
ensure that banks have the capacity to support
the recovery and the adjustment of
household’s balance sheet.

In 2015 banks continued to strengthen their capital
and liquidity buffers, and €2.6 billion in core capital,
and €12 billion in hybrid capital are still needed. The
authorities remain confident that the targets are
within reach, and that Dutch banks will be able to find
adequate resources to meet their buffers through
2019.

Further improvement to the framework for risk
management and resolution are needed.

The DNB can deploy a number of macroprudential
instruments to control risks to financial stability—in
particular the capital buffers for systemic banks, and a
quarterly adjustment to the countercyclical capital
buffer from 2016. The DNB adopted organizational
changes reflecting its new role as The Netherlands’
resolution authority.

Accelerate the pace of LTV reduction to reach
80 percent and clarify [shortly] the path of LTV
after 2018.

The decision on further lowering the LTV cap below
100 percent will be addressed by the next
government.

Dutch pension funds should look to further
reduce the procyclical link between interest
rates and payouts.

The pension funds are expected to fully use the
flexibility offered by the revised Financial Assessment
Framework, e.g., freezing pension payouts,
moderating indexation, increasing contributions, and
spreading out the adjustment over a longer 10-year
horizon. However, hedging the interest rate would cut
returns, thereby undermining coverage ratios.

Structural Reform

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS

Labor market: Easing protection for regular
workers combined with reduction in the tax
wedge would support employment.

New legislation was introduced to limit abuse and
tighten eligibility to the self-employed category. The
labor and income tax reductions in the draft 2016
budget would help reducing the tax wedge on labor.

SMEs: Improving the quality and sharing of
credit information would enhance the
availability of credit for SMEs. Also, shifting
public support from credit guarantees to equity
or quasi-equity initiatives could foster SME
startups and innovation.

The authorities have not committed to a course of
action.

Housing market: The size of the social housing
corporation (SHC) sector should be scaled back
to focus on its social mandate and allow the
development of the private sector rental
market. Zoning regulations should be eased to
expand housing supply, while scaling back
public support would reduce housing risks to
the government.

From this year SHC concentrate on their core social
mandate, income test tenants and offer temporary
rent contracts. The private sector market is expanding
with the interest of foreign investors.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
National accounts
The Netherlands adopted the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) in March 2014. The
transition from the ESA 1995 (ESA 95) entailed a revision of national accounts data. New data
sources have been incorporated in the new estimates. As a result of these changes, the GDP level
in 2010 has been revised 7.6 percent upward (only 3 percent because of the ESA 2010). Historical
data series are available from 2001.
Government Finance Statistics
Government finance statistics reported to Eurostat and the Fund are compiled using the
ESA 95 methodology and are converted to the Government Finance Statistics Manual
2001 format. Starting from September 2014, government finance statistics data will be based on
ESA 2010 methodology which is likely to include revisions of the general government deficit and
debt levels from 1995 onwards. Revised ESA based data series will be published in October 2014.
External Sector Statistics
The DNB compiles the balance of payments in close cooperation with the CBS. An agreement
between the CBS and the DNB was formally ratified in 2006 to further strengthen the decadeslong cooperation between the two institutions. Balance of payments and international
investment position (IIP) statistics are compiled according to the Balance of Payments Manual,
fifth edition (BPM5) and the legal requirements of the ECB and Eurostat. The Data Template on
International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity is disseminated monthly and quarterly external
debt data are reported to the World Bank for redissemination in the Quarterly External Debt Statistics
(QEDS) database.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary data reported for International Financial Statistics
are based on the European Central Bank’s (ECB) framework for collecting, compiling, and
reporting monetary data.
Financial Soundness Indicators
The Netherlands participates in the financial soundness indicators (FSIs) project. Quarterly data
for most of the 40 FSIs are posted on the FSI website for the period 2008:Q1 to 2012:Q4.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data
Data ROSC is available.

Statement by Mr. Snel, Executive Director for Kingdom of the Netherlands—
Netherlands and Ms. De Lint, Advisor to the Executive Director
February 8, 2016
We thank staff for the interesting consultations and the well-written report and SIPs. The
documents provide a good overview of the state of the Dutch economy and discuss the
structural issues that are now at the focus of the policy debate in the Netherlands: tax and
pension reform and the rise of the self-employed in the labor force. Especially because staff
is well placed to give an outsider perspective and has experience with similar situations in
other countries, their analysis is a useful contribution to the ongoing discussion in the
Netherlands.
Economic growth is projected to increase to 2.1 percent in 2016, supported by growing
household consumption and investments, and rising export levels. The restrictions on
natural gas production in the north of the country are projected to slow down growth by
0.2 percentage points. Consumption is expected to increase next year by over 2 percent, and
savings by households will stabilize. Disposable incomes will increase due to higher wages
under low inflation, increased employment and an income tax cut package of €5 billion
which is part of the 2016 budget envelope. As a result of the favorable economic
developments and increases in profitability, investments will increase. Export levels are
growing because of a further lowering of the exchange rate and the growth in world trade,
while natural gas exports are declining. Although the employment figures will increase, the
effect on unemployment figures will be limited in 2016, as growth is still relatively low and
labor supply increases as a result of demographic factors, policy incentives (including the
€5 billion package of tax measures) and a return to the labor market of the previously
discouraged.
The current account surplus is mainly explained by structural factors and, as staff
describes in the report, is expected to come down over the medium to longer term as
baby boomers will retire and natural gas exports will decline. In the short term, the end of
the fiscal consolidation and the stabilization of savings by households will also contribute to
a narrowing of the surplus. The two most important factors that explain the large surplus are
the relatively high savings and foreign investments by multinational enterprises and pension
funds, and the internationalization of the Dutch economy. The savings and investment
behavior of multinational enterprises and pension funds does not point directly to market or
policy failures which should be addressed by economic policy. We disagree in particular with
the reference in the report to a favorable tax treatment for corporate income as a reason for
the current account surplus. The recently published report by the World Bank and PwC
“Paying Taxes 2016” does not characterize the tax regime in the Netherlands as particularly
favorable. On the contrary, it suggests that the Netherlands is getting less attractive for
corporates in terms of tax treatment.
The authorities agree that fiscal policy should support the recovery to the extent
possible, but do not see fiscal space and stress the importance to restore fiscal buffers.
The authorities’ expectations for the overall fiscal deficit are more or less in line with staff’s
projections, but the structural deficit figures substantially differ, as the authorities forecast

2
1.3 percent of GDP in 2015 and 1.9 percent in 2016. The government debt is projected to
decrease to around 65 percent of GDP in 2016. This means that both the debt level and the
structural deficit are still above the levels set under the SGP rules (60 percent and 0.5 percent
respectively). For the credibility of the SGP, which contains strong fiscal rules in line with
IMF recommendations, it is important that member states comply with the rules. Steering
towards or across the boundaries of the European rules could require further consolidation
measures in upcoming years to comply with the rules again and will limit the possibility to
restore adequate buffers against negative shocks. The absence of buffers could result in procyclical spending cuts in case of an unexpected downturn. Regarding the suggestions by staff
how to use possible fiscal space if it would come available, we are pleased that staff dropped
the recommendation for infrastructure investment as was included in the October 2015 WEO,
but regret the inconsistency in staff’s policy advice.
The authorities are continuously looking for ways to simplify and improve the tax
system and have started debating an overhaul of the system in 2014. In this context,
several measures were taken, including mainly targeting the €5 billion of tax cuts on income
for this year at female workers and low-wage earners, the group with the highest labor supply
elasticity. The gradual reduction in MID will reduce the debt bias in personal tax. For the
preparation of the 2017 tax plan, citizens and companies are invited to provide the Ministry
of Finance with suggestions for simplifying the tax system. Discussions on more
fundamental reforms will continue and will most likely be an important topic for the 2017
elections. Staff’s analysis and suggestions are very helpful in this regard and provide a good
overview of the issues at stake and interesting examples from other countries. Possible
reforms need to be judged on their effectiveness, simplicity and coherence and should aim to
minimize distortion and shortfall in revenues.
To ensure the sustainability of the pension system in the face of an ageing population,
the authorities increased the pension age to 67 by 2021, while linking it to life
expectancy afterwards. In addition, to strengthen the (occupational) pension system, the
Financial Assessment Framework has been reformed, including rules regarding the
distribution of financial shocks and the indexation of pension claims. Although these
measures significantly strengthened the sustainability of the pension sector in the short term,
the low interest rate environment continues to pose challenges for pension funds.
The Dutch pension system is solid and is ranking high in international comparison, but
the authorities saw a need for an inclusive and comprehensive debate about the future
of the pension system. The labor market has changed, with increased mobility and more and
more self-employed. Moreover, there are feelings of uncertainty and lack of transparency in
the society about second pillar pensions. Given the complexity of the issue and the large
transaction costs, the government is approaching the debate in a careful manner without
rushing into a major overhaul. All stakeholders had the opportunity to contribute to the
National Pension Dialogue (i.e. a national consultation on the future of the pension system).
Using this as an input, the government formulated four principles for a future-proof pension
system. First, the aim is a differentiated approach to accommodate the diversity in the labor
market (i.e. fixed contract, flexible contract, self-employed, etc.). Second, the system should
become more actuarially fair, to eliminate structural transfers from young to old contributors

3
within the second pillar. In this regard, there is a preference for a decline in accrual of
pension entitlements with age instead of an increase in contributions with age. Third, the
risk-sharing system should become more transparent and simple, while the base of a new
pension contract could be one of personal pension accounts. Fourth, more room for
customization and choice for participants to reflect their different preferences and situations
is required. Based on these principles, the government will present in the summer of 2016 a
couple of concrete options for reform. The economic impact as well as the costs and benefits
of these options will be calculated by the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis
(CPB) so that they can be used in the 2017 election programs.
The current government has implemented a broad set of reforms in the housing market
and housing prices have started to recover, albeit unevenly. The reforms that have been
initiated, significantly reduce the fiscal subsidy on home-ownership, reduce vulnerability to
housing price shocks, redirect the attention of housing corporations to their core
responsibility of housing for lower incomes and incentivize higher income households to
move out of social housing. One specific measure has been the gradual reduction of the
maximum LTV ratio for mortgage loans to 100 percent in 2018. Last spring, the FSC
recommended future governments to continue the annual reduction in LTV limits to reach
90 percent in 2028. The government has indicated that it will indeed leave this decision to the
next government. An important prerequisite will be a well-functioning private rental market.
In this regard, the government has initiated further reforms, including obliging housing
corporations to separate their public and commercial operations – paving the way for a level
playing field.
Although the presence of self-employed in the economy has important benefits, the
rapid rise in self-employment requires careful consideration of the different aspects of
this phenomenon. It is important to note that the group of self-employed is very diverse.
There is the group of entrepreneurs who may bring diffusion of knowledge, competition, and
flexibility into the economy and labor market. However, there is also self-employment that is
just replacing a regular employment relationship, but then without the protection, social
benefits and mandatory second pillar pension. This could lead to low incomes, in particular
in retirement of cases of disability. In an Interdepartmental Policy Review, the government
analyzed the developments concerning self-employed and identified three areas where
measures could be taken: 1) fighting feigned self-employment; 2) improving attractiveness of
regular employment; and 3) facilitating accessible social protection for self-employed.
