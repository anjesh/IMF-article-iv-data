IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Belize
On September 16, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV Consultation1 with Belize.
Real GDP growth reached 3.6 percent in 2014, up from 1.5 percent in 2013 and well above the
five-year average of 2.9 percent. A rebound in agriculture, strong performances in tourism,
electricity, construction and services offset the significant decline in oil-related activities. The
fall in international oil and food prices pushed headline inflation (y/y) to -0.2 percent as of
December 2014. Despite strong tourism receipts, falling exports and relatively strong imports
widened the external current account deficit to 7.6 percent of GDP in 2014, up from 4.4 percent
of GDP in 2013. PetroCaribe and other official disbursements continued to finance the current
account deficit and help build international reserves (equivalent to 5 months of imports at endDecember 2014).
The fiscal stance deteriorated significantly in FY 2014/15 (April–March). The primary fiscal
balance recorded a deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP, down from a revised deficit of 0.2 percent of
GDP in FY 2013/14 and well below the surplus of 1 percent of GDP envisaged in the FY
2014/15 budget. Revenue collection remained in line with budget targets. Spending continued to
grow well above budget targets. Financing of the fiscal deficit essentially came from a
drawdown of PetroCaribe deposits and official external loans. Relatively strong GDP growth
helped maintain public debt around 76 percent of GDP.
Private credit growth recovered and reached 4.7 percent in 2014, up from 3.5 percent in 2013,
supported by strong real estate credit and loans to the sugar sector, while broad money grew by
7.9 percent. The banking system remained highly liquid. Non-performing loans (NPLs) declined
to 15.7 percent at end-December 2014, down from 17.6 percent at end-2013. The banking
system’s reported capital adequacy ratio (CAR) stayed above 21 percent. The termination of

Under the Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,

major correspondent banking relationships with Belizean banks has so far had a limited impact
on the financial system and economic activity.
Growth over the short-to-medium term would hover around 2.5 percent, in line with the
assessment made during the 2014 Article IV Consultation. Inflation would remain subdued
owing to the exchange rate peg and moderate inflation in trading partners. However, the fiscal
outlook could be worse due to excess spending. The primary fiscal balance would remain in
deficit for a while as the political climate further exacerbates spending pressures and hinders
revenue-enhancing reforms. Expansionary fiscal policies would increase imports in the context
of modest growth of exports, widening the external current account deficit. International reserves
could decline to uncomfortable levels, especially if compensation for the nationalized utilities is
paid and repatriated.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted the recent improvement in economic activity, despite the significant
deterioration in the fiscal stance and the widening external current account deficit. Belize’s
economic outlook is characterized by sluggish growth, weak fiscal stance, and external and
financial sector vulnerabilities. They welcomed the settlement reached on one of the two
nationalized companies but noted that significant contingent liabilities from these
nationalizations remain, which could further raise the already elevated debt levels. Against this
backdrop, Directors called for a concerted effort to reduce vulnerabilities, rebuild policy buffers,
and accelerate medium-to-long term growth.
Directors underscored the importance of prompt and credible fiscal efforts that would boost
investor confidence and private investment. In this context, they urged the authorities to begin to
progressively raise the primary balance to levels consistent with debt sustainability. This could
be achieved by removing exemptions and zero-ratings from GST, building a stronger revenue
administration that contains leakages, and limiting current spending, including through reform of
the public officers’ pension scheme. Directors agreed that public sector reforms and stronger
public financial management, especially internal controls, audits and procurement practices,
would reduce low-quality spending and should not be delayed.
Directors welcomed the authorities new Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS).
In order to ensure credible implementation of the GSDS, Directors recommended that the
authorities seek to tap into all available resources, domestic and external. Domestic resources can
be mobilized through enhanced domestic revenue collection and spending rationalization, which
would create the fiscal space needed for greater investment in human capital. External resources
can be mobilized through international partners and well-designed public private partnerships.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors stressed that the success of any growth strategy would require well functioning
financial markets, supporting infrastructure and regulation for key economic sectors such as
agriculture and tourism, an attractive business environment, greater liberalization of domestic
markets, including labor markets, and greater diversification of export markets.
Directors welcomed continued progress in financial sector reforms, including preparation of a
financial crisis management plan and bank resolution templates with technical assistance from
the Fund. Directors also welcomed the recent strengthening of banks’ balance sheets, but noted
that significant vulnerabilities remain and were heightened by the recent termination of some
corresponding banking relationships. Directors are encouraged by the authorities’ determination
to keep the banking system under tight supervision, and reiterated the call for an asset quality
review of all banks to fully assess their true strength. Directors noted the challenges in collateral
valuation and their weak loss absorption capacity in the context of illiquid markets. Therefore,
Directors recommended a gradual increase in provisioning to fully cover all loan losses, secured
and unsecured. It is also important to continue preparing financial stability reports, including
bank stress tests that fully take shortfalls in provisioning into account.
Directors noted that the deficiencies identified by the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force
(CFATF) have been mostly addressed, allowing Belize to recently exit the CFATF follow-up and
monitoring process. Important reforms are still needed to ensure effective implementation of
Belize’s AML/CFT regime in line with recent Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards.
Directors concurred that the recent termination of corresponding banking relationships with
Belizean banks and banks in many other countries could have a significant impact on financial
stability and economic activity in the affected countries. They urged the authorities regulating
international banks that are terminating correspondent banking relationships to better clarify their
expectations of how these international banks should deal with local banks they perceive as
“high risk.”

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
September 1, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and risks. The economic outlook is mainly characterized by sluggish growth and
a weak fiscal stance, which have put public debt on an unsustainable path. The widening
current account deficit would put strong pressures on international reserves, which could
decline to very low levels. Low capital buffers would remain a drag on the financial
system. Main risks continue to be a court decision that leads to larger than expected
liabilities to the former owners of the nationalized companies and weaknesses in the
systemic bank.
Focus of the Consultation. Discussions focused on measures that would signal credible
commitment to fiscal consolidation; strengthen the financial system; and boost economic,
growth taking into account constraints on human and financial resources.
Key policy advice.


Improve the primary fiscal balance to about 4.5 percent of GDP in the medium term.
Fiscal measures identified during the 2014 Article IV Consultation (widening the tax
base, strengthening revenue administration, and containing spending on goods and
services, the wage bill, and pensions) would no longer be sufficient and will have to be
supplemented for instance with cuts in transfers.



Address public financial management (PFM) weaknesses, including internal and
external controls as well as procurement practices to contain low-quality spending.



Continue to address banking sector vulnerabilities, including by raising capital buffers
and tightening restrictions on the distribution of dividends and lending for banks with
the lowest capital buffers.



Implement a comprehensive medium-term growth strategy, including clear foreign
exchange regulations and policies to boost the financial system’s role in financing the
economy.

Implementation of staff advice. Implementation of staff advice and even the
authorities’ own commitments remains mixed. The primary fiscal balance has turned
negative and is well below the authorities’ own commitment during the 2013 debt
restructuring (2 percent of GDP). The review of tax exemptions promised in the 2014
budget speech has not yet started. Nonetheless, some bright spots do exist on the
financial sector, including preparation of a financial crisis management plan and progress
in the modernization of the payment system.

BACKGROUND
1.
The ruling United Democratic Party (UDP) of Prime Minister Dean Barrow won a
landslide victory during the municipal elections of March 4, 2015 and now has time to
implement the much needed fiscal adjustment. The UDP captured 62 out 67 seats, up from the
44 seats it held after the 2012 elections. The main opposition party, the People’s United Party (PUP)
only won 5 seats, losing 18 seats to the ruling party. There is no election in sight before the general
elections due in March 2017.

3.
The authorities still have to implement their own fiscal commitments and recent Fund
advice (Box 1). The primary fiscal balance remains well below the authorities’ commitment during
the 2013 debt restructuring (2 percent of GDP) and has even turned negative in FY 2015
(April−March), moving them further away of their medium-term public debt target of 60 percent of
GDP. The review of tax exemptions promised in the 2014 budget speech has not yet started. None
of the fiscal measures identified by staff in recent Article IV Consultations to raise the primary fiscal
balance has been implemented. Instead, implementation of promises to key segments of the
population has been given priority, including spending for the new public bank and sizeable wage
increases to public sector employees.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Despite the significant deterioration of the fiscal stance, macroeconomic performance
in 2014 was broadly favorable (Figures 1–5):


4

Real GDP growth reached 3.6 percent in 2014, up from 1.5 percent in 2013 and well above
the five-year average of 2.9 percent. A rebound in agriculture, strong performances in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

tourism, electricity, construction and services offset the significant decline in oil-related activities.
The fall in international oil and food prices pushed headline inflation (y/y) to -0.2 percent as of
December 2014. However, core inflation, which excludes transportation, food and utilities, rose
modestly from 0.2 percent in December 2013 (y/y) to 1.2 percent in December 2014 (y/y).


Despite strong tourism receipts, falling exports and relatively strong imports widened the
external current account deficit to 7.6 percent of GDP in 2014, up from 4.4 percent of GDP
in 2013. The contraction in oil exports, reflecting both declining production volumes and world
market price, was accompanied by subdued growth in agricultural exports. Nevertheless,
PetroCaribe and other official disbursements continued to finance the current account deficit
and help build international reserves (equivalent to 5 months of imports at end-December
2014).



The fiscal stance deteriorated significantly in FY 2014/15 (April–March). The primary fiscal
balance recorded a deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP, down from a revised deficit of 0.2 percent of
GDP achieved in FY 2013/14 and well below the surplus of 1 percent of GDP envisaged in the
FY 2014/15 budget. Revenue collection remained in line with budget targets. Spending
continued to grow well above budget targets, driven primarily by increases in wages, pensions,
teachers’ salaries, and capital expenditures. A significant portion of this additional spending,
equivalent to 2.6 percent of GDP, was executed outside the normal budget process, and
approved by parliament in a revised budget only after its execution. Financing of the fiscal
deficit essentially came from a drawdown of PetroCaribe deposits and official external loans.
Relatively strong GDP growth helped maintain public debt around 76 percent of GDP.



Private credit growth recovered and reached 4.7 percent in 2014, up from 3.5 percent in
2013, supported by strong real estate credit and loans to a new large firm in the sugar
sector. Broad money grew by 7.9 percent, in line with nominal GDP. Abundant liquidity
continued to support low T-bill rates and declining lending rates.



Banks’ balance sheets continued to slowly improve, though vulnerabilities remained
(Text Table and SIP on the financial sector). At end-December 2014, the banking system’s ratio
of gross non–performing loans (NPLs) to total loans stood at 15.7 percent (6.3 percent net of
provisions) compared with 17.6 percent at end-2013 (9.4 percent net of provisions). The banking
system’s reported capital adequacy ratio (CAR) stayed above 21 percent, though it must be
qualified (para. 6). Banks’ profitability was mixed. While the return on assets (ROA) of
international banks appeared comfortable at 3.2 percent at end-2014, the ROA of domestic
banks stood at -1.0 percent at end–2014, mainly because of increased provisioning expenses
and domestic banks’ inability to make more profitable use of their abundant liquidity.

5.
Despite the continuing decline in exports, macroeconomic performance pointed to
some encouraging signs in early 2015. Real GDP growth stood at 7 percent (y/y) in the first
quarter, lifted by strong performance in the primary sector and continued growth in tourism.
Inflation remained low at -0.8 percent (y/y) at end-June 2015 pushed down by the fall in
international oil and food prices. However, exports of goods during January−May 2015 declined by

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

BELIZE

9 percent compared with the same period last year, mainly because of falling petroleum exports.
Imports of goods rose by 1.5 percent during the same period, driven largely by higher imports of
machinery and equipment. Nonetheless, reserves at end-April stood at the equivalent of about
5 months of imports of goods and services owing to inflows from tourism, Petrocaribe loans and
foreign direct investment. Private sector credit grew by 6.0 percent (y/y) in April 2015, driven by real
estate credit.
6.
The banking system’s financial soundness indicators (FSIs) in early 2015 highlighted
remaining vulnerabilities (Text Table and SIP on the financial sector). At end-March 2015, the
banking system’s ratio of gross NPLs to total loans rose to 16.1 percent (6.1 percent net of
provisions), primarily because of a small increase in NPLs of international banks. Its CAR was
23.7 percent but is very likely inflated because of under-provisioning of NPLs in a few banks. NPLs
that are classified as losses, fully collateralized and free of specific provision before December 2011,
are only provisioned at 50 percent for domestic banks. Based on this provisioning rule, all domestic
banks are now compliant with provisioning requirements, with the exception of the systemic bank
(21 percent of the banking system’s assets at end-March 2015), which was granted an extension.
Banks have until November this year to write off these NPLs, which would seriously erode the capital
buffers of two banks (26 percent of the banking system’s assets at end March 2015), including the
systemic one. The system’s ROA stood at 0.5 percent at end-March 2015.

valuable piece of real estate (US$23 million) did offset the impact of two large expense items on its
balance sheet, namely a large tax payment of US$ 4.75 million and a large provision expense of
US$7.9 million on a disputed claim against the government. Excluding this disputed claim (US$21.5
million), the bank’s CAR would have been lower.

(CBR) with the systemic bank in early 2015 has so far had a limited impact on the financial
system and economic activity (SIP on the financial sector). The new arrangements that have
been put in place with the support of the Central Bank and major credit card companies (Visa and
MasterCard) seem to be working as international financial transactions have not been disrupted.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Growth over the short-to-medium term would hover around 2.5 percent, in line with
the assessment made during the 2014 Article IV Consultation, but the fiscal outlook could be
worse due to excess spending. Real GDP growth in 2015 is expected to fall to 2.2 percent after a
strong performance in 2014 as economic activity returns to normal levels. It would accelerate to
about 3 percent during 2016–17 as a new large sugar firm starts production. Inflation would remain
subdued owing to the exchange rate peg and moderate inflation in trading partners. The primary
fiscal balance would remain in deficit for a while as the political climate further exacerbates
spending pressures and hinder revenue-enhancing reforms. Hence public debt would continue to
rise to unsustainable levels, exceeding 100 percent of GDP in 2016, as staff continues to assume that
liabilities related to the nationalized companies (about 20 percent of GDP) are recognized in 2016

(Annex I).1 Given limited external financing, Belize is expected to rely massively on domestic
financing, especially from banks, to meet its gross financing requirements in the medium term, with
the potential to significantly reduce banking system liquidity and crowd out some private
investment.2 Expansionary fiscal policies—including large wage increases and new initiatives and
projects financed with PetroCaribe resources—would increase imports in the context of modest
growth of exports of goods, widening the external current account deficit above levels consistent
with external stability (about 3 percent of GDP or less), and contributing to a moderate
overvaluation of the exchange rate (Annex II). Without strong external inflows, international reserves
could decline to uncomfortable levels, especially if compensation for the nationalized utilities is paid
and repatriated.
10.
The baseline outlook is subject to substantial downside risks (Annex III). Other banks
could also lose their CBRs with global banks with severe impact on international financial
transactions. Other risks include a worsening of banking sector vulnerabilities, especially the
systemic bank’s low capital buffers and banks’ exposure to an already over-indebted sovereign,
lower-than-projected primary balances, and larger-than-expected compensation payments for the
nationalized utilities. Fiscal risks from public enterprises appear limited, while risks from social
security liabilities are considerable in the long run (Annex IV). External downside risks, which could
lead to faster erosion on the international reserve cushion, include persistent U.S. dollar strength,
Cuba’s entrance in the Caribbean tourism market, structurally weak growth in key advanced and
emerging economies, the end of PetroCaribe financing, and a larger-than-expected drop in sugar
prices after the EU reform of its sugar regime takes full effect in 2017 (Annex V and SIP on the sugar
sector). On the upside, low international oil prices and growth-enhancing projects that are currently
being implemented or envisaged could mitigate the above-mentioned risks.

By law, the liabilities will be in domestic currency. For a discussion of staff’s assumptions on the fiscal cost of the
nationalized companies, see the staff reports for the 2013 and 2014 Article IV Consultations (IMF country reports nos.
13/227 and 14/280). The Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ), which is the highest court on the matter, will issue its
ruling any time on the constitutionality of the nationalization of one of the companies. It would take another 12−24
months for a ruling on compensation. The legal process for the other nationalized company has not yet started but
staff assumes that the government will recognize its liabilities for the two nationalized companies around the same
time. An out-of-court settlement is still possible for the two companies.
2

Banks are expected to maintain their exposure to the government mainly because of lack of alternative investment
opportunities in the context of high liquidity and the inclusion of treasury bills in the computation of reserve
requirements.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Staff encouraged the authorities to: (i) raise the primary fiscal balance to levels that
would put public debt on a sustainable path and create credible policy buffers while
addressing public financial management (PFM) weaknesses; (ii) continue to address
banking sector vulnerabilities; and (iii) implement a comprehensive medium-term growth
strategy, taking into account constraints on human and financial resources.

A. A Fiscal Stance that Sends Credible Signals to Investors and Starts to
Build Some Policy Buffers
11.
Staff advised the authorities to promptly begin to progressively raise the primary
fiscal balance to 4−5 percent of GDP so as to signal some commitment to fiscal consolidation
and boost investor confidence as well as private investment (Text Table on macro scenarios)
Even under this fiscal adjustment scenario, public debt would reach about 85 percent of GDP by
2020, well above the target of 70 percent of GDP recommended during the 2014 Article IV
Consultation. The less ambitious debt target for 2020 reflects the sharp deterioration of the fiscal
balance in 2014, which is expected to continue in 2015. As argued during the 2014 Article IV
Consultation, staff is of the view that primary fiscal surpluses of 4–5 percent of GDP would leave
room for growth-enhancing public expenditures and would have a limited impact on growth
compared to baseline growth because government spending multipliers are small in the highly open
Belizean economy and investors’ confidence is likely to recover (para. 30). Moreover, maintaining
primary fiscal surpluses of 4–5 percent of GDP beyond 2020 would return public debt to a
sustainable path, reaching the authorities’ target of 60 percent of GDP by 2030.3

International experience highlights that successful large fiscal adjustments depend on political consensus as well as
fiscal structural reforms. The recent Fund-supported program for Jamaica is an example of large fiscal adjustment
that was sustained for two years. For an assessment of international experience, see G. Tsibouris, M. Horton,
M. Flanagan, and W. Maliszewski (2006) “Experience with Large Fiscal Adjustments,” Occasional Paper, No. 246,

realistically collect more than 1–2 percent of GDP by removing exemptions and zero-ratings from
the general sales tax (GST). Recent FAD TA on revenue administration also shows that strengthening
and modernizing tax administration, including enforcing collection of undisputed tax arrears
(3 percent of GDP in 2014) and creating an integrated domestic tax department would boost
revenue. Spending measures discussed during the 2014 Article IV Consultation would only produce
a spending adjustment of 1–2 percentage points of GDP, especially if outlays on goods and services
are frozen at their FY 2015 level in real terms instead of their level in FY 2014. Better monitoring of
transfers would help reach the desired spending adjustment of 2–3.5 percentage points of GDP.
Staff encouraged the authorities to promptly pass a supplementary budget with fiscal consolidation
measures in the areas just mentioned.

1/ Adjustment of pensions according to past inflation, and contributions to the pension plan.
2/ Freezing purchase of goods and services in real terms, and cuts in transfers (excluding teacher's salaries).
3/ Measures include streamlining exemptions and strengthening revenue administration. The projected impact
of revenue measures is conservative as they could annually yield as much as the equivalent of 2 percentage
points of GDP if implemented vigorously.

13.
Staff strongly pressed the above set of measures as necessary to achieve sustainable
growth in the long term, but also noted the dangers to the economy of taking no action and
urged the authorities, if they found it impossible to carry out the recommended strategy, at
least to implement a “plan B” that could rely on a weaker fiscal adjustment but more vigorous
growth-enhancing structural reforms (Text Table on macro scenarios). Under this “plan B”, the
authorities could at least target a primary fiscal surplus of about 2 percent of GDP, which was
promised to investors during the 2013 debt restructuring, and implement structural reforms more
vigorously (Section C). Such structural reforms will have to lift annual real GDP growth to about

GDP at the time of the 2014 Article IV Consultation. Since then, spending on goods and services and pensions and
hiring in the public sector increased. Freezing spending on goods and services, reducing the wage bill by attrition
only, and adjusting pensions with inflation would now yield much lower savings because of a higher starting point.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

BELIZE

6 percent in the medium term, allowing Belize to reach the debt target of about 84 percent of GDP
in 2020 and 60 percent of GDP by 2026. Staff emphasized the significant risks associated with such a
“plan B,” including the fact that the growth impact of structural reforms takes time to materialize.
14.
In any event, staff encouraged the authorities not to delay PFM and public sector
reforms, which will help improve the quality of public spending. In particular, staff urged the
authorities to implement the recommendations of the recent Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessment, including enhancing internal and external controls and audits as
well as procurement practices. A more active debt management, including refinancing expensive
debt with low-earning deposits (essentially from PetroCaribe), would greatly support fiscal
consolidation efforts. The authorities should also consider the reform of the civil service and the
public employees’ pension system, making the latter contributory.
15.
Staff urged the authorities to fully weigh the risks and costs of delaying fiscal
adjustment. Staff reminded the authorities that some investors could be very reluctant to continue
financing the government in the coming years unless the authorities signal commitment to fiscal
consolidation. Unfavorable external developments, which could deplete central bank reserves, could
force the government to borrow in international markets at very high interest rates just to rebuild
reserves (Annex V). Interest payments alone are now much larger than domestically-financed capital
spending and the projected high level of debt would continue to limit the government’s ability to
spend on growth-enhancing projects or implement counter-cyclical policies. Such a high debt path
would also increase the probability of a crisis and translate into even higher debt service going
forward, increasing the needed fiscal adjustment over time.
Authorities’ views
16.
The authorities remain firmly convinced that the true value of the nationalized
companies at the time of the nationalization was closer to their valuation, and should courts
adopt their valuation, the public debt path would be better than staff’s baseline projections.
With the authorities’ valuation of nationalized companies at about 8 percent of GDP
(BZ$281 million), debt would stabilize at about 85 percent of GDP in the medium term under current
policies. The authorities also noted that unless achieved through a settlement, compensation for the
nationalized utilities will not be decided soon as ongoing litigation could last many more years.
17.
The authorities acknowledged the need for a greater fiscal effort to ensure that the
path of public debt is sustainable, even if courts were to accept their valuation of the
nationalized companies. They do recognize that the public debt outlook has lost some ground
subsequent to the 2014 Article IV Consultation and that a sustainable debt path should bring public
debt toward 60–65 percent of GDP in the medium-to-long term. As a consequence, they
acknowledge that a combination of fiscal adjustment and vigorous growth-enhancing structural
reforms is needed.
18.
The authorities are committed to returning to primary fiscal surpluses but did not
commit to any specific target or measure to kick start fiscal consolidation, and insisted that a

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

few options for policy adjustment are being considered, including PFM and growthenhancing structural reforms.


Revenue. As indicated in the Prime Minister’s 2014 budget speech, the authorities still plan to
set up a committee to review the list of exempted and zero-rated items under the GST. They are
committed to fully exploiting insights from the revenue administration monitoring reports that
staff helped them prepare and to holding the revenue administration more accountable,
especially on the very low effective taxation. They will give due consideration to
recommendations of recent IMF TA missions and the revenue-enhancing committee established
under the 2013 wage agreement with labor unions, including the need to better collect
undisputed tax arrears and modernize revenue administration. They noted that creating an
integrated domestic tax department would be difficult and would require amending the existing
legislation but they are determined to improving information sharing among different revenue
departments. The revenue-enhancing committee will be made permanent so as to continuously
monitor revenue performances. The authorities are fully cognizant of the risks of largely relying
on revenue measures to achieve significant fiscal consolidation.



Expenditures. The authorities noted that some degree of spending is needed in infrastructure.
However, they acknowledged that the 2013 wage agreement has been much costlier than
initially envisaged. Nonetheless, they remain of the view that backtracking on their
commitments under this agreement would be politically difficult. They agree with staff that
future wage agreements will have to be conducted within a framework that takes into account
fiscal sustainability and stress that they are still committed to signing a memorandum of
understanding with labor unions in this regard. The framework proposed by staff during the
2014 Article IV Consultation remains a good reference point in their view. Recommendations of
the cost-saving committee, also established under the 2013 wage agreement, will be considered
in due course, and its tasks will be extended to reforms of the pension system. Following the
passage of the Petrocaribe Act, which should strengthen the management of Petrocaribe
resources, the authorities noted that Petrocaribe resources accumulated until March 2015 will
continue to be used for capital spending. However, Petrocaribe resources accumulated between
April 2015 and March 2016 will be saved to help pay compensation for the nationalized
companies, and those accumulated beyond March 2017 will be allocated to the refinancing of
more expensive external debt.



PFM. The authorities acknowledged that delays in submitting financial statements to the Auditor
General and then to parliament represent a weakness in controls that needs to be effectively
addressed. They are committed to addressing this major PFM weakness and others identified by
the recent PEFA mission, though they did not specify any timetable. They acknowledge that
adopting a procurement law would enhance transparency in procurement and help improve
value for money. They reiterated their commitment to strengthen debt management and will
finalize the draft public debt management bill prepared with IMF TA and submit it to parliament
as soon as possible.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

BELIZE



Other growth-enhancing structural reforms. The authorities intend to vigorously implement
the Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS) and its successful implementation
could lift real GDP growth by several percentage points in the medium term and help improve
the path of public debt (Section C).

B. A Financial Sector that Continues to Strengthen and Reduce Fiscal Risks
19.
Staff supported the authorities’ determination to keep the banking system under tight
supervision and reiterated its call for an asset quality review (AQR) of all banks to fully assess
their true strength. In addition to offsite examinations, the authorities have conducted in 2014 fullscope onsite examinations of two banks, including the systemic bank, and AML-focused onsite
examinations of one bank and three credit unions. Staff reminded the authorities that an AQR of all
banks will complement such examinations. Quarterly financial stability reports (FSRs) should
continue to be prepared, including quarterly stress tests of banks that fully take shortfalls in
provisioning into account. Adequate resources should be given to units in charge of preparing such
reports. Staff welcomed the authorities’ continued monitoring of weaknesses highlighted in the
latest FSRs, including the need for some institutional strengthening of capital to build resiliency, the
still high liquidity, as well as the high concentration of loans and deposits. With the latest technical
assistance from CARTAC on the consolidated supervision framework, staff urged the authorities to
start monitoring group risk, group capital adequacy, group governance and regulatory arbitrage.
20.
Given challenges faced with collateral valuation in the context of illiquid local markets,
staff urged the authorities to raise provisioning requirements to 100 percent on all loan losses
(secured and unsecured). Banks with loan losses that are not fully provisioned should be ordered
to gradually increase provisioning to 100 percent on these loan losses over a reasonable transition
period and during which dividend distribution is strictly forbidden and management fees contained.
21.
Staff strongly encouraged the authorities to step up progress in effectively
implementing the AML/CFT framework. Although the deficiencies identified by the Caribbean
Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) in 2011 have been mostly addressed, allowing Belize to recently
exit the CFATF follow-up and monitoring process, this progress relates to technical compliance with
the 2003 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standard. Important reforms are still needed to ensure
compliance and effective implementation of Belize’s AML/CFT regime in line with the 2012 FATF
standard. In particular, the authorities should step up progress in implementing risk-based
approaches to AML/CFT supervision, enhance the transparency of legal entities and arrangements
and further ensure the operational and effective international cooperation of the financial
intelligence unit (see SIP on the financial sector).
22.
Staff welcomed the financial crisis management plan the authorities have prepared
with IMF TA, including bank resolution templates as well as an updated list of technical
partners the authorities may call on at short notice to support their crisis management
efforts. Staff also advised the authorities to continue their support for greater coordination and
cooperation among regional financial authorities.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

23.
Staff supported other ongoing financial sector reforms. The draft credit bureau law has
been approved by cabinet and will be sent to parliament by the first half of next year. Notable
progress was made in modernizing Belize's national payments system as very critical parts of this
project, including the draft legal framework, and the Automated Transfer System are near
completion. The authorities have allocated resources to hire an in-house legal expert to further
strengthen the Central Bank’s legal department and are in search of a suitable person with the
requisite experience.5
Authorities’ views
24.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to addressing remaining weaknesses in
the financial system, including their supervisory framework. In particular, they are considering
measures in the following areas:

Provisioning shortfalls. The authorities are of the view that the current provisioning rules
are prudent enough to safeguard the reliability of banks’ balance sheets, but noted that provisioning
requirements of 100 percent on all loan losses (secured or unsecured) were considered in the past.
They decided that 50 percent provisioning for fully secured loan losses was prudent after
discussions with banks, which were then given a certain number of years to provide for the legacy
loans. The authorities are strongly of the view that the value of collaterals for secured loans are
inflated and is thus a disincentive to a timely disposal. They greatly appreciated recent IMF TA on
loan classification and provisioning and will give due consideration to the TA mission’s
recommendations.

Financial stability reports. The authorities will continue to prepare financial stability reports
including adequate stress tests and stronger analysis of group risks, taking advantage of recent
CARTAC TA on consolidated supervision. They noted that recent delays in the completion of
financial stability reports were mainly due to capacity constraints which are being addressed. A
database that will facilitate production of future reports is being finalized.
25.
The authorities strongly emphasized that termination of some correspondent banking
relationships with banks in Belize has the potential to destabilize the Belizean financial system
and also illustrates the need for greater transparency in advanced countries’ regulations and
decision-making processes, which should be rules-based. They insisted that neither the
international banks that terminated correspondent banking relationships with Belizean banks nor
the regulators of these international banks ever provided any explanation for these decisions. They
noted that this complete lack of transparency about decisions that have important negative
spillovers on other countries is outrageous and should quickly be addressed by the international
community. This lack of transparency does not only unjustly affect small open economies like Belize,

5

See SIP on the financial sector for additional progress.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

BELIZE

but also denies the local authorities the opportunity to address the weakness since no information is
shared with them.
26.
The authorities are determined to effectively implement their AML/CFT framework.
They insisted that their recent exit from the CFATF follow-up and monitoring process confirms the
significant progress Belize has made on AML/CFT. They are strongly of the view that the recent
favorable CFATF review of Belize’s AML/CFT framework and the termination of correspondent
banking relations with Belize do send contradictory messages and called for greater consistency in
the assessment of AML/CFT frameworks. They are confident that future rounds of CFTAF mutual
evaluations will only confirm the continuous progress Belize is making on AML/CFT.
27.
The authorities will continue to update the list of technical partners that could support
them if there is a financial crisis. However, as mentioned during the 2014 Article IV Consultation,
they reiterated that progress on regional supervision and financial crisis management is being held
back due to the refusal of another regional supervisor to address a parallel banking issue with Belize
(SIP on the financial sector).

have contributed to the recent drop in
productivity, including remaining deficiencies in
infrastructure, human capital and the business environment. This suggests that reforms to raise
productivity should be an essential part of any comprehensive medium-term growth strategy.
29.
In this context, staff welcomed the authorities’ new Growth and Sustainable
Development Strategy (GSDS) covering 2015–18 (Annex VI). This implementation plan of
Belize’s long-term development strategy (Horizon 2030) is the nation’s primary planning document
during 2015–18, providing detailed guidance on priorities and specific actions to be taken to raise
growth and productivity. The GSDS does not quantify the growth impact of the structural reforms it
envisages but seeks to help achieve real output growth of 5 percent annually over a prolonged
period. Staff is of the view that Belize can reach such targets for real GDP growth if appropriate
investments are made to fully exploit the country’s potential, especially in agribusiness, and

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

strengthen access to neighboring markets, especially Guatemala and Mexico.6 However, staff noted
that financial and human resources needed for a credible implementation of the GSDS remain
uncertain. Therefore, staff strongly encouraged the authorities to quickly enhance domestic revenue
collection and investment in human capital, while implementing other key reforms (para. 30). Staff
also urged the authorities to develop a strategy to tap into all resources available to them through
international partners and well-designed public private partnerships (PPPs).
30.
Staff urged the authorities to pay particular attention to growth-enhancing reforms
identified during the 2014 Article IV Consultation, keeping the following three main themes
in mind:


Macroeconomic policies that inspire confidence, enhance competitiveness, and support
private sector-led and inclusive growth. Fiscal policies will have to be sustainable and
promote inclusive growth as discussed during the 2014 Article IV Consultation. The fiscal
tightening recommended by staff is expected to mostly reduce imports, not GDP growth, and
boost investor confidence as well as private investment. Staff analysis suggests that the real
exchange rate is moderately overvalued (Annex II). Despite the risks to external stability, the
costs of a nominal devaluation to facilitate the external adjustment appear high in the context of
high government external debt and large pass-through to inflation, as well as the authorities’
strong commitment to the exchange rate peg. Therefore, policies could focus on external price
competitiveness measures that lower production costs, liberalize the economy and increase the
flexibility of labor and product markets. The new Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy
considers a range of measures, including cost savings from streamlining of public services and
reforms to strengthen the tradable sector by attracting foreign investment, improving export
market penetration, and conducting productivity-enhancing reforms in key sectors. Amending
labor regulations to provide greater flexibility in working hours could help lower labor costs in
the business outsourcing and tourism industries where flexibility is needed. Nevertheless, the
short-term benefits of external price competitiveness measures should not be overestimated as
they have been difficult to achieve in the past.



Financial markets that work for the Belizean economy. With the recent low credit growth and
high liquidity, the financial sector could play a larger role in boosting growth in Belize. Policies
should give a greater role to competition in determining interest rates and asset prices and help
lenders improve their knowledge of borrowers through a well-functioning credit bureau.
Competition can be further enhanced with modern financial market infrastructure and
regulations that reduce transaction costs. In this context, the recent regulation that
administratively allocates foreign exchange to one importer falls short of best practice. Staff
advised against such measures and urged the authorities to request IMF technical assistance to

transport infrastructure, would require less than US$100 million in investments.

strengthen the foreign exchange market. The administrative allocation of foreign exchange does
not breach Belize’s Article VIII obligations, to the extent that the sale is done at the prevailing
market rate. However, staff (LEG) is currently conducting a routine review of Belize’s overall
foreign exchange regime, and will conclude its assessment after discussions with the authorities.


Structural reforms that support key engines of growth. Staff reviewed progress made in
implementing structural reforms identified during the 2014 Article IV Consultation and discussed
key sectors that would support economic growth in the coming years, including agriculture,
agro-processing, energy and tourism. The required infrastructure will have to be quickly built
and appropriate regulations adopted to fully exploit Belize’s potential in the above-mentioned
sectors. With the expected drop in sugar prices following the full liberalization of the EU sugar
market after 2017, enhancing the efficiency and productivity of sugar cane production would
help lower overall production costs and strengthen competitiveness (SIP on the sugar sector).
Lowering the cost of energy could greatly boost external competitiveness and real GDP growth,
promoting the expansion of agro-processing and tourism (SIP on the energy sector). Finally,
improving the business environment, including through quicker resolution of contract disputes,
simplifying the procedures for starting a new business and registering property, greater
liberalization of domestic markets, including labor markets, and greater diversification of export
markets, are of utmost importance.

Authorities’ views
31.
The authorities will actively seek the financial and human resources required for the
successful implementation of their GSDS, including through enhanced domestic revenue
collection and better design of expenditure policies to boost human capital. They indeed see
agro-business, tourism, and energy as key sectors with the highest growth potential and plan to
devote even greater attention to them. They noted that the recent amendment of the Sugar Act to
allow for more flexibility in the way sugar farmers organize themselves is a major step toward
strengthening the sugar sector. In collaboration with sugar farmers and Belize Sugar Industries (BSI),
they are also developing a long-term strategic plan for the sugar industry, including liberalization of
domestic sugar market. On tourism, they noted that they have prepared and are implementing their
tourism master plan, which recently helped increase tourism inflows to Belize. On energy, the
authorities are implementing their National Strategic Plan for 2012–17, which aims among other
things at improving efficiency and conservation across all sectors by reducing per capita energy
intensity by at least 30 percent by 2033.
32.
The authorities agreed with the thrust of staff’s views on growth and competitiveness.
They acknowledged that Belize can only grow faster through increased investment and greater
access to foreign markets, and therefore must become more competitive. They concurred with the
thrust of staff’s external assessment and the need to further strengthen external inflows, though
they still did not commit to any specific measure in this regard. They remain of the view that the
current account of the balance of payments (BOP) should indeed improve notably to ensure the
medium-term external stability of the Belizean economy. They continue to view the nominal
exchange rate peg as a key anchor of macroeconomic policies. In line with the thrust of staff’s
18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

advice, including recommendations made during the 2014 Article IV Consultation, they are
determined to implement through their strategic developments plans (Horizon 2030 and the GSDS)
policies that inspire private sector confidence and support inclusive growth. They agreed that a
strong financial sector and vigorous structural reforms should play a greater role in boosting the
economy but did not commit to any specific measure in this regard beyond those described above
(paras. 18, 23, and31) and envisaged in the GSDS.
33.
The authorities also shared some dissenting views on how to make Belize grow faster.
As regards the foreign exchange market, they noted that the administrative allocation of foreign
exchange to the fuel importer was necessary as some banks had been withholding foreign exchange
in violation of their responsibilities as authorized dealers in foreign exchange. They do not see the
need for IMF TA to strengthen the functioning of the foreign exchange market. With respect to
interest rates, the authorities continue to note that past reductions of the interest rate floor did not
produce a comensurate drop in lending rates as banks used most of the additional profit margins
they gained to strengthen their balance sheets, including through increased provisioning. Since
provision shortfalls remain significant in the banking system, the authorities are convinced that
removing the interest rate floor at this juncture will not lower lending rates much further. They
stressed that the role of financial markets in supporting growth will be enhanced with adequate
financial market infrastructure, including well-functioning capital markets, and greater transparency
requirements for businesses. Financial and technical assistance will be needed in these two areas,
which are also considered in their strategic development plans.

OTHER
34.
The authorities continue to closely monitor spillover risks from other countries. Most
banks in Belize still maintain some CBRs with banks in the U.S. and Europe, and the authorities and
staff see termination of these remaining CBRs as the greatest spillover risk of the moment. The
authorities will continue to strengthen their financial system and AML/CFT framework but do urge
international partners to raise awareness of the negative consequences of some prudential
regulations that are being implemented in advanced countries. Risks arising from Belize’s financial
linkages with banks in Antigua and Barbuda that are currently under receivership with total
exposures of around US$14million are being contained with greater provisioning. Spillover risks
from trade channels are being contained through export diversification.
35.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. In general, the quality, coverage, and
timeliness of statistics permit an adequate monitoring of economic developments.7 The authorities
confirmed that they remain committed to strengthening statistics, but acknowledged that progress
remains slows. They are still committed to subscribing to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination

Standard as promised to investors during the 2013 debt restructuring. They are also preparing
consolidated data on the public sector. There is no timetable for completing these two key projects.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Belize’s macroeconomic performance in 2014 and early 2015 was broadly favorable
despite a significant deterioration in the fiscal stance. Real GDP growth reached 3.6 percent in
2014 and 7 percent (y/y) in the first quarter of 2015, owing mainly to strong performances in
agriculture and tourism. Inflation remained subdued, but the external current account deficit has
widened. The primary fiscal balance deteriorated sharply to a deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP. Credit
growth is recovering, driven by loans to the sugar sector and real estate credit.
37.
The macroeconomic outlook broadly remains in line with the assessment made during
the 2014 Article IV Consultation, but the fiscal outlook is expected to be worse due to excess
spending. A weak GDP growth and an expansionary fiscal stance combined with the assumed
recognition of liabilities from nationalization in 2016 (about 20 percent of GDP) would push public
debt to about 96 percent of GDP in the medium term, more than 6 percentage points of GDP above
projections during the 2014 Article IV Consultation. Expansionary fiscal policies would increase
imports in the context of modest growth of exports, widening the current account deficit and
contributing to a moderate overvaluation of the exchange rate. Without strong external inflows,
international reserves would decline to uncomfortable levels, especially if compensation for the
nationalized companies is paid and repatriated.
38.
Substantial downside risks to the macroeconomic outlook deserve close monitoring.
Compensation payments for the nationalized companies could be higher than in staff’s projections.
Other banks could lose correspondent banking relationships with severe impact on international
financial transactions. Cuba’s entrance in the Caribbean tourism market, the end of Petrocaribe
financing, a significant drop in sugar prices, and a protracted period of weak growth in advanced
and emerging economies could accentuate pressures on international reserves.
39.
Public debt should credibly be brought back to a sustainable path and fiscal buffers
created to safeguard against looming risks. A primary fiscal balance of 4–5 percent of GDP would
contain the rise of public debt to 85 percent of GDP by 2020, which would still be unsustainable, and
then reduce it about 60 percent of GDP by 2030. This could be achieved by removing exemptions
and zero-ratings from the GST, building a stronger revenue administration that contains leakages,
and limiting current spending, including through reform of the public officers’ pension scheme.
More vigorous growth-enhancing reforms could help achieve the public debt targets above with a
slightly weaker primary fiscal balance. In any event, PFM and public sector reforms that reduce lowquality spending should not be delayed.
40.
Efforts to strengthen the financial sector should continue, with emphasis on
strengthening banks’ balance sheets. An asset quality review of all banks will complement reviews
currently done by the Central Bank and enhance confidence in the quality of banks’ books. Given the

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

challenges in collateral valuation in the context of illiquid markets, provisioning on loan losses
(secured or unsecured) should be raised to 100 percent. Preparation of financial stability reports
must continue, including bank stress tests that fully take shortfalls in provisioning into account.
Efforts to effectively implement the AML/CFT framework must be stepped up.
41.
The national Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS) must be
vigorously implemented, taking into account constraints on financial and human resources. A
strategy to mobilize financial and human resources for the credible implementation of the GSDS
should be published. Enhancing revenue collection, tapping into resources available through
international partners and well-designed public private partnerships, and boosting human capital,
including through better public spending, will be essential. Financial markets that work for the
Belizean economy, engines of growth such as agriculture and tourism that are supported with the
required infrastructure and regulation, an attractive business environment that reduces the cost of
doing business, greater liberalization of domestic markets, including labor markets, and greater
diversification of export markets will be key to the success of any growth strategy.
42.

It is recommended that the next Article IV be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. The Authorities’ Response to Key IMF Policy Recommendations

22

Fiscal consolidation
Strengthen fiscal policy to rebuild macroeconomic
buffers in the context of rollover risks and
emerging contingencies

Marginally consistent
The outturn for the fiscal primary balance in the
fiscal year 2014/15 was well below staff
recommendation during the 2014 Article IV
Consultation. The projected primary balance for
fiscal year 2015/16 falls short of the target
recommended by staff.
The authorities acknowledged the need for a
greater fiscal effort to ensure that the path of
public debt is sustainable, but did not commit to
any specific fiscal target or measure.

Financial sector reform
Closely monitor elevated risks in the financial
system and continue to implement the 2011 FSAP
recommendations.

Broadly consistent
The authorities continue to implement key FSAP
recommendations. They have prepared a crisis
management plan and bank resolution templates
with IMF TA. The national payment system is being
modernized. The framework for consolidated
supervision is being established. They have stepped
up efforts to strengthen compliance of their
AML/CFT framework with FATF standards. They are
determined to addressing remaining weaknesses in
the financial sector.

Structural reforms
Remove key infrastructure bottlenecks and improve
the environment for doing business to boost
economic growth.

Moderately consistent
Bottlenecks persist in port facilities, energy,
transportation, and education. Doing business
indicators and investor confidence remain low. The
authorities have developed a new Growth and
Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS) covering
2015–18 (Annex VI), and are actively seeking the
financial and human resources required for its
successful implementation. There has been
progress recently, most notably in the sugar and
energy sectors.

Annex I. Belize: Debt Sustainability Analysis
Belize’s public debt will remain high and unsustainable because of recognition of liabilities and weak
fiscal stance, and despite the cash flow relief provided by the March 2013 debt restructuring. The main
risk is the amount of compensation that justice courts will order the government to pay for the two
nationalized companies. As courts’ ruling remains uncertain, staff continues to assume the mid-point
valuation of these companies. Other important risks include additional contingent liabilities from the
financial sector, the fiscal cost of rebuilding central bank reserves, and shocks to the primary balance,
the exchange rate and GDP growth. Belize is expected to rely massively on domestic financing as well
as asset reductions to meet its gross financing requirements in the medium term as official external
disbursements are projected to gradually decline and external commercial borrowing is expected to be
very limited within the projection horizon. Refinancing risks are expected also to increase with rising
gross financing requirements. External debt would gradually decline over the medium term mainly
because of non-debt creating inflows and asset reductions (mostly reserves). The public debt burden
underlines the need for ambitious fiscal consolidation, a more robust debt management, and the
development of the domestic debt market.
Macroeconomic Framework
Economic growth is projected to remain relatively low at about 2.5 percent in the medium term.
Non-oil commodity exports, tourism, and construction, coupled with low inflation will support
moderate real output growth, and at same time offset the projected decline in oil production.
However, growth will remain vulnerable to external and weather-related shocks that could further
deteriorate the debt outlook. Improving the business environment and attracting FDI will be critical
to improving growth prospects.
The recognition of contingent liabilities could raise the level of debt stock by 22 percent of GDP in
2016. Although the Court of Appeals has ruled that the nationalization of two utilities companies
was constitutional, the amount of compensation to the former owners of the nationalized
companies is still unsettled. The DSA assumes that the government recognizes the additional
liabilities at end 2016 and compensation payments at BZ$726 million (20 percent of GDP)—the midpoint valuation between the authorities’ assessment and the former owners’ claims, including
capitalized accrued interests since 2011 and assuming interest rates in the range 6–8 percent. It also
assumes that the government utilizes the proceeds from the sale of BTL shares (BZ$75 million) to
pay part of the compensation, and pays the remaining balance in five equal payments starting in
2017. The DSA finally assumes that the government also repays US$94 million (2 percent of GDP) in
compensation to owners of land appropriated by the government.
Belize is expected to rely massively on domestic financing as well as asset reductions to meet its
gross financing requirements in the medium term. Although the authorities may opt to issue new
US$2,038 bonds up to a maximum US$75 million to pay part of the compensation, the DSA has
assumed no new issuance of new U.S. dollar bonds given the uncertainties regarding the demand
for these bonds. As a result, the bulk of projected financing would need to be covered by domestic

borrowing, as official external disbursements are projected to gradually decline and external
commercial borrowing is expected to be very limited within the projection horizon. Nominal interest
of domestic borrowing is expected to increase (assumed between 5 and 8 percent) as public debt
rises, increasing the nominal debt service burden. The DSA assumes that the government uses its
assets, mainly international reserves, to pay debt.
Public Debt
The heat map suggests that the risks to debt sustainability remain high (Figure A1.1). Subjecting the
baseline to stress testing indicate that Belize’s debt burden exceeds the benchmark for emerging
markets. The heat map highlights significant risks to the debt profile, including contingent liabilities,
market perception (high spreads), external financing requirements, the residency of debt holders,
and the currency composition of Belize’s debt. The increasing share of short-term debt in total debt
is not yet a major source of concern as its level is relatively low. The fan charts show the possible
evolution of debt over the medium term under both symmetric and asymmetric distributions of risk.
The asymmetric fan chart shows that public debt could reach 140 percent of GDP in the medium
term.
There appears to be no systematic projection bias in the macro assumptions in recent years
(Figure A1.2). In the past, staff projections of GDP growth and inflation have been on average close
to outcomes, with the median forecast errors of 0 and -0.58 respectively percent during 2005–13.
However, projections of the primary balance have been relatively pessimistic, with a median forecast
errors of 0.91 percent of GDP during the same period. Nevertheless, staff’s projections of the
primary balance have been more accurate in recent years.
Under the baseline scenario, Belize’s public debt will remain high and unsustainable because of
recognition of liabilities and a weak fiscal stance (Figures A1.3 and A1.4). Public debt would
experience a hike to 101 percent of GDP in 2016 as a result of an assumption that the courts would
require that the government recognize liabilities in the amount of 20 percent of GDP to the former
owners of the two nationalized utility companies. Debt is projected to decline slowly, owing to weak
fiscal efforts under the baseline (primary surplus of only about 1 percent of GDP after 2018) and
relatively low growth. At the primary surplus of 1 percent of GDP, it would take about 30 years to
bring public debt to 60 percent of GDP, levels seen by the authorities and staff as sustainable.
Financing conditions would gradually deteriorate, as public sector gross financing needs would
increase to 28 percent of GDP by 2020 mainly due to the maturing principal of the additional
liabilities from the nationalizations and high interest rates charged on domestic financing. Moreover,
short-term debt is assumed to represent an increasing share of debt as the perceived riskiness of
government paper increases. Finally, financing needs would rise even more starting in 2019, when
the amortization of the new external bond starts.
Stress tests highlight the fact that that the public debt trajectory is highly vulnerable to various
shocks (Figure A1.5). As 87 percent of total public debt was denominated in foreign currency at end
of 2014, the debt profile is particularly sensitive to an exchange rate shock: a 10 percent real
depreciation in 2014 combined with the baseline assumption of the recognition of additional
36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

liabilities related to nationalization (20 percent of GDP) would boost total public debt to 105 percent
of GDP in 2016. A financial sector contingent liability shock that increases public spending by the
equivalent of 10 percent of banking sector’s assets associated with recapitalization needs of a few
banks would raise total public debt to 107 percent of GDP in 2015. The debt-to-GDP ratio is also
highly sensitive to shocks in growth, interest rate, and the primary balance. The fiscal consolidation
scenario aiming at a debt-to-GDP ratio of 84 percent by 2020 illustrates the magnitude of the fiscal
adjustment needed: 4.5 percent of GDP compared to 0.5 percent on average over the medium term
in the baseline scenario. This fiscal adjustment path proposed by staff would imply cyclically
adjusted primary balances that are above 3 percent of GDP, putting Belize in the top quartile. The
proposed fiscal adjustment is realistic as staff has identified feasible measures that would help
achieve it, though the political situation could delay the adjustment.
External Debt
The external debt ratio1 is projected to gradually decline over the medium term to around
50 percent of GDP by 2020 mainly because of non-debt creating inflows and asset reductions,
mostly international reserves (Figure A1.6 and Table A1.1). External current account deficits would
continue to put upward pressures on external debt. Bound tests suggest that external debt is mostly
sensitive to nominal exchange rate devaluation and current account shocks. In particular, under a
30 percent depreciation of national currency, external debt would surge to 100 percent of GDP in
2016 and remain elevated at 80 percent of GDP in 2020. Further vulnerability stems from a noninterest current account shock that would boost the external debt to above 65 percent of GDP over
the medium-term horizon. In light of limited options for external financing, high gross external
financing needs—8 percent of GDP on average annually over the next 6 years—pose additional risk
to the debt outlook.
Summary Assessment
Under the baseline scenario, Belize’s public debt will remain high and unsustainable because of the
recognition of liabilities and a weak fiscal stance. Debt reduction is projected to be slow, owing to
weak fiscal efforts under the baseline (0.6 percent of GDP primary surplus on average in the medium
term), relatively low growth, and high interest rates. Liquidity conditions would gradually deteriorate,
as public sector gross financing needs would increase to 31 percent of GDP by 2020 mainly due to
maturing principal of the additional liabilities and high interest rate charged on domestic financing.
Belize is expected to rely massively on domestic financing as well as asset reductions to meet its
gross financing requirements in the medium term as official external disbursement is projected to
gradually decline and external commercial borrowing is expected to be very limited within the
projection horizon. Refinancing risks are expected also to increase with rising gross financing
requirements. External debt would gradually decline over the medium term mainly because of nondebt creating inflows and asset reductions (mostly reserves). Bound tests highlight that the public

debt trajectory is highly vulnerable to various shocks, especially on the exchange rate and
contingent liabilities, including compensation for nationalized utilities and potential recapitalization
needs of a few banks.
Strong fiscal consolidation efforts are essential to bringing public debt back to a sustainable longrun level. Recurrent debt restructuring episodes suggests that the country’s current debt level is not
sustainable debt and it would be prudent for the authorities to adopt a more ambitious target
around 50–60 percent of GDP for the medium to long term. In addition to fiscal adjustment,
supporting policies to improve growth, deepen domestic financial market, and improve public debt
management will also be essential to improve the debt outlook.

Annex II. External Stability Assessment
The external stability assessment suggests that the real exchange rate is moderately overvalued. The
overvaluation seems to reflect largely fiscal policy gaps that are projected to generate widening current
account deficits and net external indebtedness. International reserves appear at a comfortable level at
present but are projected to decline below standard adequacy thresholds by 2018–19.
External stability is assessed using two different approaches: external stability (ES) and external
balance (EBA-lite).These external stability tools are highly indicative for small countries like Belize and
the results should be interpreted with caution. The ES approach assumes a gradual strengthening of
the NFA position from -114 percent of GDP at end-2014 to -100 percent of GDP by 2024 in the
baseline scenario and to -90 percent by 2024 in the alternative scenario. These NFA levels appear
consistent with debt paths that are sustainable. Stabilizing NFAs at these levels would imply
maintaining current account deficits of -3.2 percent of GDP per year in the baseline scenario and of
-2.2 percent of GDP in the alternative scenario (Text Table). This implies an average overvaluation of
about 10 percent in the baseline scenario and 12 percent in the alternative scenario (calculated as
the average of the minimum and maximum REER adjustment needed during the period to align the
current account with the norm).

2/ The values in brackets show the minimum and maximum projected current acount deficits in the 2015-20 period.
3/ This elasticity is computed using the standard long-run real exchange rate elasticities for imports (0.92) and exports (-0.71), as well as the
medium-term values of Belize’s exports and imports of goods and services (in percent of GDP).
4/ The brackets indicate the mininum and maximum adjustment needed to bring the current account in line with the norm in the 2015-20
period.

The external balance approach broadly confirms these results. The EBA-lite results point to a real
exchange overvaluation of 11.5 percent, which is broadly consistent with the ES baseline result. EBAlite is based on a multilateral approach that aims to identify the policy gaps contributing to the
misalignment, which for Belize appear largely related to fiscal policy.

Both traditional and risk-weighted metrics indicate that reserves would decline below the adequacy
thresholds in a few years. Standard non-risk based adequacy metrics suggest that without a policy
adjustment, reserves would fall below 3 months of imports and below 20 percent cover of broad
money by 2019 (see Text Table below). The two risk-weighted adequacy metrics suggest that
reserves would fall below the comfortable adequacy region at end-2018. The first risk-weighted
measure indicates that despite their current comfortable levels, reserves would represent only 87
percent of the adequate level at end-2018. The second risk-weighted measure, adjusted for small
island developing states (SIDS), reveals a similar trend – although comfortably above the 75 percent
benchmark at end-2014, reserve coverage would decline to 57 percent in 2018. These reserve
pressures are to some extent

adoption of a lower fiscal
primary balance will
leave the country in a
highly vulnerable
position.

2. Distress in the banking
system.

Relative Likelihood

Impact if Realized

Policy measures

High
 Declining petroleum revenue, the
increases in compensations for civil
servants, and the rolling out of the
national health insurance scheme and
other spending pressures stemming
from the political environment have
reduced the likelihood of a significant
improvement in the primary balance.
Moreover, the authorities are of the
view that deteriorating social,
infrastructure, and security conditions
constrain Belize from tightening the
fiscal stance beyond the primary surplus
target of 1 percent of GDP.

High
 Debt will continue to increase in an
unsustainable manner. Gross financing
needs would rise sharply over the
medium term. Securing such financing
would be a challenge due to
undeveloped domestic market and
limited external market access.

 Carry out fiscal consolidation gradually
raising the fiscal primary balance to 45 percent of GDP by cutting nonessential spending, improving PFM,
and raising more revenue by reducing
exemptions and strengthening
revenue administration.

High
 Major Belizean banks have already
received termination of correspondent
banking relationships with U.S. banks
and finding replacement
correspondents is very difficult.
 While declining, non-performing loans
remain high, and while improving,
provisioning remains relatively low.
Some domestic banks, including the
largest bank, which is of systemic
proportions, still have low capital
buffers, and raising new capital to avoid
a deterioration of their capital adequacy
ratios could be a challenge, increasing
the risk of public sector intervention.

High
 Financial intermediation could be
damaged and seriously disrupt
economic activity.
 Absorption of the financial cost of
recapitalizing distressed banks by the
government could entail significant
fiscal costs, putting additional
pressure on public finances.

 Temporarily allow banks to use the
central bank platforms to process
international transactions, while
ensuring that appropriate AML/CFT
due diligence measures are effectively
implemented for these transactions by
the banking sector as a whole..
 Order undercapitalized banks to raise
more capital, perform asset quality
review of all banks, and maintain tight
supervision.

Risk Assessment Matrix (continued)
3. Surge in contingent
liabilities.

High
 Courts still have to rule on the size,
modality, and timing of the
compensation the government has to
pay to the former owners of the two
nationalized utility companies.
Payments could turn out to be closer to
the claimants’(upper) valuation of about
30 percent of GDP. Moreover,
nonresidents, who account for a
significant portion of the compensation
claims, would likely not roll over their
debt holdings.
 In addition to a possible intervention for
the financial sector, the government
may have to incur more external
liabilities, just to build up reserves and
support the current exchange rate peg
should BOP pressures become more
severe than envisaged.

4. Structurally week
growth in key advanced
economies

 Even though additional external
borrowing was envisaged at the time
of the 2013 debt restructuring, new
external lending to Belize will likely be
very costly. It will also further weaken
debt sustainability and undermine
investors’ confidence in the Belizean
economy and the currency peg.

High
 Decline in tourism and exports. A
weak recovery in advanced
economies, especially in Europe could
significantly undermine growth in
Belize, restrain public finances, and
put pressures on the BOP and
reserves. Belize’s share of exports to
Europe is very high.

 Support external stability by
strengthening the competitiveness of
key export sectors (sugar, banana,
citrus, marine products).
 Strengthen the business environment
and improve physical infrastructure to
attract greater domestic and foreign
investment and support the
development of small-and-mediumsized enterprises.
 Create fiscal buffers through fiscal
consolidation (see point 1).

 Strengthen resilience to external
demand shocks by diversifying the
export mix to include a larger share of
CARICOM countries.
 Build fiscal and external buffers to
offset a potential shock.
 Broaden the sources of growth by
diversifying into economic sectors that
are less vulnerable to cyclical external
shocks.

High
 Weak demand and persistently low
inflation from a failure to fully address
crisis legacies and undertake structural
reforms, leading to low medium-term

High
 Debt could suddenly increase by tens

of the compensation for the
nationalized companies, further
threatening fiscal sustainability and
aggravating refinancing risks as
nonresident debt holders pull out.

6. Persistently low energy

High
 As the currency is pegged to the U.S.

High
 Export of goods and services would
decline, and the external current

Medium
 The external current account deficit
would narrow, but PetroCaribe soft

Medium
 A sustained decline in oil prices would
lower the oil import bill, but the
positive impact on BOP would be
partially offset by lower PetroCaribe
financing.

 Carry out fiscal consolidation and
reforms to boost external
competitiveness and curb real

measures..
 Use savings from lower oil prices to
build reserves and enhance external
stability. Ensure a reliable pass through
of lower international oil prices to
domestic prices to stimulate demand
and enhance competitiveness.

Annex IV. Social Security and Pension Plan for Public Officers
Left unreformed, the two public pension systems will continue to significantly drain the budget and
pose additional rapidly rising fiscal risks.
There are two public pension schemes in Belize: the Social Security Scheme, and the pension plan for
public officers (PPPO).
The general Social Security System (SSS) is a contributory, partially-funded, defined benefit scheme
that is based on a scaled premium system. Contributions are adjusted over time to cover the
expected cost of benefits and administration. It provides retirement pensions from age 60, drawing
on contributions of at least 10 years, up to a maximum of 60 percent of the highest three years of
earnings in the 15-year period preceding retirement. The 2012 actuarial report recommended that
contributions and other parameters of the system, such as income ceilings and the retirement age,
be adjusted to ensure the system’s sustainability.
Left unreformed, Social Security reserves would vanish by 2029, and the government would have to
pay all pensions by a combination of budget allocations, sharp rise in contribution rates, and drastic
cuts in pensions and benefits. This would obviously have deep social and political repercussions,
affecting mostly the poorest part of the population. A reform of social security parameters raising the
retirement pension age to 65 and contribution rated from 8 percent to 9.5 percent, combined with a
reduction in administrative cost from 30 percent of total cost to 20 percent would rebuild Social
Security reserves and reduce substantially pension and benefits,1 turning Social Security financially
sustainable (Figure A4. 1).
The PPPO is an unfunded, noncontributory defined benefit scheme. It provides retirement pensions
from age 55 to public officers with at least 10 years of service, up to a maximum of 67 percent of the
average earnings of the last three years of service. Pension benefits are adjusted in line with public
employee salaries by the government. All expenses are covered by the central government budget.
PPPO expenses amount to about 1.5 percent of GDP. By combining benefits from the SSS and PPPO,
some categories of public officers may obtain combined replacement rates of more than 100 percent
of their average salary.
The PPPO must be reformed to become fiscally sustainable. The government should carry out an
awareness campaign explaining the risks of an unfunded pension for fiscal sustainability, and
negotiate with the public sector unions a package of reform, including contributions that are in line
with those in other countries and a higher retirement age.

risks to external stability in the medium term. This annex assesses the resilience of the external position
to large but plausible shocks to tourism, exports, oil prices, and a discontinuation of PetroCaribe
financing. The results indicate that the external position is vulnerable to these shocks, which could
worsen the external current account deficit on average by 4–9 percentage points compared to the
baseline and largely deplete reserves by 2017–18.
Although the current level of reserves appears comfortable at 5 months of imports as of end-2014,
the import cover is projected to decline below the standard adequacy threshold of 3 months of
imports by 2019 under the baseline barring significant changes in current policies.
External risks under the baseline stem from sluggish growth of Belize’s agricultural exports (sugar,
banana, citrus) against the backdrop of a steady decline in oil exports and strong demand for
imports. The strengthening U.S. dollar could fuel real appreciation, while lower oil prices would
reduce PetroCaribe financing. Expected shocks to the balance of payments in 2017 would also
increase Belize’s external financing needs. First, the current account could be negatively affected by
changes to regulations of the EU sugar market, which would make Belize’s sugar exports less
competitive. Second, higher external debt service payments and a potential repatriation of
compensation payments for the two nationalized utility companies would increase capital outflows
from 2017 onward and would exert downward pressure on the capital and financial accounts.
Low export diversification is a source of risk to external stability. Foreign exchange earnings depend
heavily on tourism, which represented about 35 percent of total exports in 2014. Tourism revenues
are sensitive to developments in major source markets such as the U.S., which accounted for about
two thirds of total tourist arrivals. In 2014, Belize’s largest export markets were the U.S. (35 percent)
and the U.K. (29 percent). Export concentrations in the U.S. and U.K. markets render exports revenues
exposed to cyclical fluctuations in these countries. Belize’s merchandise exports are concentrated in
commodities, notably sugar (9 percent), banana (8 percent), marine products (9 percent), citrus
(7 percent) and oil (8 percent) and are thus sensitive to commodity price fluctuations.
In light of the vulnerabilities above, the analysis examines four negative shock scenarios (deviations
from the baseline) to Belize’s balance of payments. The first scenario applies a shock to the growth
rate of tourism, triggered by a slowdown in the U.S. The second scenario assumes a broad-based
slowdown across Belize’s export markets leading to a sharp decline in merchandise exports. The
shocks reduce the baseline growth rate by 1.5 standard deviations in 2015 and 2016 (standard
deviations are based on 5 years of historical data) and then revert to the baseline growth rate. The
third scenario tests the BOP resilience to oil price shocks, which would increase the growth rate of
international oil prices by 1.5 standard deviations in 2015 relative to 2014 and maintain oil prices
unchanged afterward. The fourth scenario assumes that PetroCaribe financing is discontinued in
2015.

The results suggest that the external position is highly vulnerable to these negative shocks. The
current account deficit widens notably under the tourism and export shock scenarios and reserves
are largely depleted by 2017–18 (Text Table). Out of the four scenarios, the export shock leads to the
largest deterioration in the external current account and reserves. The current account deficit widens
to 16 percent of GDP under this scenario, and the import cover falls below 3 months of imports in
2016. The oil price shock also widens the current account deficit but the impact on reserves is
mitigated somewhat by the resulting increase in Petrocaribe financing. The estimates also point to a
significant negative impact of a withdrawal of Petrocaribe financing on international reserves.

Annex VI. Belize’s Growth and Sustainable Development
Strategy 2015–18
The Belizean authorities’ new Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS) is a detailed
implementation plan that translates the vision articulated in the long-term national development
framework for 2010−30 (Horizon 2030) into specific goals and policy actions for the period 2015–18.
The GSDS rests on three key pillars: a proactive role for the state, tapping into global markets, and
innovative social policy.
Belize has undertaken the role of a “pilot country” within the United Nations (UN) system in
sustainable development planning. Hence, the GSDS incorporates for the first time poverty reduction
and long-term sustainable development issues, which are at the forefront of the UN newly
developed “Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)”.
The GSDS represents an integrated system of factors, conditions, and policy actions, centered on a
single overarching objective—to improve the quality of life for all Belizeans both in the short-term
and in the long-term. This objective is anchored in four “Critical Success Factors (CSF)” each linked to
a set of “Necessary Conditions (NC)”. In order to ensure effective implementation, the GSDS
proposes concrete policy actions linked to measurable targets:
CSF1: Optimal national income and investment. The first CSF aims to lift long-term GDP growth to
5 percent by improving productivity and competitiveness. Six related NCs seek to build workers’
capacity, use more efficient technology and operations, and achieve economies of scale and scope:


NC1: Penetrating export markets. The GSDS aims to maintain a positive growth trend in exports
over the medium term by exploiting more fully market access agreements, enhancing market
intelligence, improving compliance with export standards, increasing access to export financing,
and improving export promotion.



NC2: Attracting foreign investments. The GSDS sets the objective of bringing FDI back to levels
achieved in the three-year period prior to the global crisis and sustaining a positive real FDI
growth thereafter. Belize’s attractiveness to foreign investors could be improved by reducing the
cost and ease of doing business, including costs of inputs (energy, transportation and
telecommunications); and combating crime. The GSDS places a special emphasis on raising field
productivity in the sugar sector and aligning tax incentives with World Trade Organization
agreements.



NC3: Effective industrial policy based on Belize’s strengths. The GSDS plans to raise productive
efficiency by among other things overcoming the small scale and scope of production,
introducing new economic activities, developing priority sectors (agriculture, agro-processing,
tourism and energy), improving access to financing, promoting inclusive growth, encouraging
innovation and investment in green technologies.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

BELIZE



NC4: Enhancing market efficiency. The policies in this category focus on strengthening the
regulatory framework of the utilities sector, reducing the informal sector, improving labor market
flexibility, strengthening the financial system, and reducing the cost of financing.



NC5: Adequate infrastructure. The policies in this category aim to improve the road network, the
sea ports, and airport infrastructure, as well as to promote investment in electricity generation
capacity and renewable energy, and to strengthen the investment climate and regulation of the
telecommunications sector.



NC6: Adequate human capital. The GSDS aims at attaining universal primary and secondary
education and higher rates of successful school completion through increased school enrollment,
enhancements in teaching effectiveness and quality, and better alignment of the school
curriculum with labor market needs.

CSF2: Enhanced social cohesion and resilience. The second CSF seeks to eradicate poverty by 2030
and reduce homicides to fewer than 10 per 100,000 inhabitants, among other goals, including
through improvements in access to healthcare and education, optimizing the provision of social
security and social protection, improvements in working conditions and social inclusion.
CSF3: Sustained or improved health of natural, environmental, historical and cultural assets. The
objective of the third CSF is to ensure adequate management of natural resources, disaster risk,
climate change and protection of the environment.
CSF4: Enhanced governance and improved citizen security. The fourth CSF focuses on improving
technical and political governance, addressing the social causes of crime and strengthening law
enforcement and border control.
Implementation of the GSDS is coordinated by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development.
Monitoring is managed by inter-ministerial Working Groups chaired by the Statistical Institute of
Belize and based on a set of performance indicators. The GSDS also introduces a prioritization
framework that will evaluate the urgency, impact, availability of resources, and systemic contribution
of policies to guide the budget allocations.
The GSDS considers both internal and external resource mobilization. Internal financing options
include improving spending efficiency and revenue generation.
In order to strengthen GSDS implementation, a detailed follow-up plan could spell out specific
measures to mobilize human and financial resources, both internal and external. The external
financing strategy could usefully identify projects with high growth potential and propose concrete
steps to mobilize resources available from international partners and through public-private
partnerships.

BANK-FUND COLLABORATION UNDER THE JMAP AND
RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK2
(As of July 2015)

A. Bank-Fund Collaboration Under the JMAP
1.
The World Bank’s program in Belize is guided by a four-year Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for FY 2012–2015. Under the CPS, the focus is on assisting Belize to achieve
inclusive and sustainable natural resource-based growth and enhanced climate resilience. The CPS
builds on lessons learned from the implementation of the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for
FY 2009–11.
2.
The overall size of the envelope during the CPS period is around
US$45 million. Activities include a US$15 million municipal development loan and a US$30 million
climate resilient infrastructure loan, approved by the World Bank Board on September 16, 2010 and
August 27, 2014 respectively.
3.
The IMF and World Bank teams agree that Belize’s main macroeconomic challenges are
to enhance the economy’s resilience to shocks and strengthen inclusive growth and social
prospects. In particular, the teams agree on the need to enhance banking system stability, to bring
debt back to a sustainable path, and to strengthen the policy framework, while reinforcing the
implementation capacity of the Belizean authorities.
4.
The teams of the Fund and the World Bank meet on a regular basis to coordinate the
work on Belize. Going forward, the work of the teams will be organized along the following
lines:


Public Financial Management (PFM). The Fund is assisting in the reform of PFM processes and
institutions by optimizing the use of available information technology to ensure that future ICT is
geared to sound and best practice business processes.



Medium-Term Debt Management. The Fund will continue assisting the authorities in building
analytical capacity for developing a debt management strategy and enhancing the domestic
public debt market.



Banking Sector. The Fund, through CARTAC, plans to continue assisting the authorities in the
preparation of guidance on corporate governance, internal controls, operational risks, and
valuation of collateral. CARTAC also plans to assist the central bank to develop its financial
stability framework and preparation of its first financial stability report. The Fund is ready to assist

the authorities in updating the crisis management plan, as well as bank restructuring and
resolution framework. The Fund is also assisting in the enhancement of the regulatory and
supervisory framework of the central bank to support the proper adoption, development, and
implementation of a risk-based approach to AML/CFT.


Infrastructure. Through the ongoing Municipal Development Project, the Bank supports
improved access to basic municipal infrastructure and enhanced municipal management in
selected town and city councils of Belize.



Natural Resource Management. The Bank will continue to support Belize in adopting a
sustainable natural resources based economic model while enhancing its resilience to climate
change and natural hazards. A range of activities include: i) policies and strategies for
mainstreaming of natural resources and climate resilience; ii) institutional capacity strengthening
for natural resource management and climate change; and iii) investments to strengthen climate
resilience.

B. Economic and Sector Work
7.
The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) has continued to support the government of
Belize (GOB) in pursuing its development goals within the context of the Bank’s country
strategy for Belize for the period 2011 to 2015. New loan and grant approvals have closely
mirrored the indicative project pipeline identified in the country strategy. In addition, despite a
relatively slow disbursement rate that has seen net (loan) flows to Belize turn negative since 2011,
satisfactory progress has been made in implementing these and other projects in the portfolio under
implementation.
8.
The bulk of this portfolio reflects CDB’s efforts to expand, rehabilitate or reconstruct
critical transportation and water infrastructure. In terms of transportation, work has progressed
on the reconstruction of the Kendall (Sittee River) and Mullins River bridges, which were destroyed
by floods generated from the passage of tropical storm Arthur. Work has already been completed on
the Kendall Bridge, with the Mullins River Bridge set for completion in July 2016. Meanwhile,
completion of the Fourth Road project, which commenced construction in 2012, has been delayed
until early 2017. The Fifth Road loan for upgrading of the Philip S. W. Goldson (formerly Northern)
Highway was approved in May 2014 and work should commence in the last quarter of 2015. The
intervention seeks to reduce congestion and climate change vulnerability and improve road safety
on this economically important road, while also enhancing the capacity of GOB and Belizean
contractors to address gender equality and social inclusion in current and future projects.
Complementing its investments in transportation infrastructure, CDB approved a loan in 2012 to
assist GOB in enhancing road safety along a demonstration corridor on the Western Highway from
Belize City to Belmopan. With positive initial results from implementation to date, an additional loan
was approved in October 2014 to expand the scope of the project.
9.
With respect to water sector infrastructure, construction activity is complete on a
potable water supply system to serve nine villages in the Belize River Valley and final
disbursement on the project should be made in 2016. In addition, a loan was approved in 2012 to
finance detailed designs for the expansion of water and sewerage on Ambergris Caye, building on an
earlier feasibility study. The designs should be completed in the last quarter of 2015, when appraisal
of the capital project is scheduled to begin. This project is viewed as important to sustain and boost
tourism activity in the area and to protect the sensitive environment.
10.
CDB’s support for private sector development in Belize is mainly through lines of credit
managed by the Development Finance Corporation (DFC), which on-lends the funds to the
agriculture, industry, housing, and education sectors. The sixth such line of credit was fully
committed as at end-2013. Consequently, a seventh was approved in July 2014, which included a
small grant for a pilot project to support renewable energy/energy efficiency initiatives by private
sector entities. A small TA grant was also provided for institutional strengthening of DFC in 2014, and
implementation of the consultant’s report is ongoing. CDB also supports the private sector in Belize
through its Caribbean Technological Consultancy Services (CTCS) network, under which micro, small
and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) benefit from grant-funded technical assistance.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

11.
CDB has also provided significant levels of concessional lending and grant funding for
social programmes aimed at poverty reduction. The Belize Social Investment Fund (BSIF) was
established by legislation in 1996, to appraise, finance, and supervise small and medium-sized subprojects in underserved poor communities. CDB has made US$15 million available to BSIF through a
second loan approved in 2010, following on from a loan of US$7 million approved in 2003. Grant
funding has been provided through the Basic Needs Trust Fund (BNTF) currently in its 8th cycle.
Belize’s allocation under the 7th cycle of US$6.1 million is still under implementation and the 8th cycle
allocation of US$1.6 million is currently being programmed. Interventions under the BSIF and the
BNTF are community-based, and are usually concentrated in the areas of water and sanitation,
education, health, and infrastructure to facilitate community access. The CDB funds also allow for the
development of a comprehensive results-based monitoring and evaluation system.

With grant assistance provided by CDB in 2010, GOB formulated a comprehensive
Education Sector Strategy. Based on this work, in 2012, CDB approved a Technical Assistance loan
for Education Sector Reform, which sought to underpin the success of the strategy in enhancing
learning outcomes across all levels of the education sector through institutional strengthening.
Under this project, a comprehensive school location plan was developed, which then informed the
Belize Education Sector Reform Programme II approved in May 2015. This capital loan aims to
significantly expand the school plant in Belize and provide other supporting services in order to
increase access to quality education, in line with the objectives of the Education Sector Strategy.
13.
The Youth and Community Transformation Project was approved in 2012 based on a
previous CDB-financed feasibility study. In accordance with the priority that GOB has given to
strategies to reduce crime and improve citizen security, the aim of the project is to contribute toward
building human capital, particularly among youth and children from poor communities in Belize City,
as part of an attempt to reduce socially deviant behavior. Project implementation is scheduled for
completion by the end of 2017.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of July 31, 2014)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most affected areas are:
national accounts, labor, and fiscal sector statistics.
Real sector: The accuracy and reliability of the data are affected by inadequate source data. The Statistical Institute of
Belize (SIB) continues to face human and financial limitations for undertaking surveys and processing the data. Lack of
reliable data on expenditure components hampers estimation of national savings and domestic investment. To
address these shortcomings the SIB is planning to conduct a comprehensive business census in 2014, which will
provide the basis for the completion of the Statistical Business Register and the compilation of supply and use tables.
Price and labor statistics: Labor market statistics are scarce and available at irregular intervals, the SIB plans to
conduct the labor force survey twice a year going forward. The SIB is in the process of developing its new website,
with plans to make metadata on the CPI as well as other statistics available online.
Fiscal accounts: Data on the consolidated operations of the public sector are unavailable. Priorities for the period
ahead include preparing a comprehensive list of institutions that comprise the central government, general
government, and the public sector including extra budgetary units. Also, difficulties persist in the compilation of
capital expenditure as a number of Capital II (government-funded capital and project expenditures) items that started
life as fixed-term project contributions have become permanent funding allocations. Authorities are aware of this
shortcoming and are advising ministries to examine the continuing need and authority for such expenditures. In
addition, the current accounting practices follow neither a cash basis nor an accrual basis of accounting, which
contributes to an inconsistent accounting and reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Finally, domestic
debt data recording needs to be improved.
Monetary and financial statistics: Data on financial soundness indicators of individual banks are available on
quarterly basis. However, there is very limited data on non-bank financial institutions, especially the offshore sector,
while the information on the activities of domestic insurance companies are not publicly available. There is need to
classify offshore banks as part of Other Financial Corporation’s (OFC) subsector. Also, the Social Security Board (SSB)
is not treated as part of the general government. Instead, the Central Bank classifies the entity as other non-financial
public corporation, and includes its claims (deposits) on the banking system as part of broad money. Plans are
ongoing to improve the availability of statistics.
Balance of payments: Official grant and loan disbursements and repayments are generally well recorded, but
strengthening inter-agency coordination in information sharing between the MOF and CBB would be warranted. The
authorities have compiled International Investment Position (IIP) statistics for 2009 and 2010, which excludes offshore financial sector, and are in the process of reconciling the discrepancies between the balance of payments flows
and the stock position on “currency and deposits” on the IIP for those years before publication and dissemination.
Upon completion, authorities plan to produce annual and quarterly IIP for 2011-2013 during the second half of this
year. While the current sourcing of FDI data appears adequate, survey responses are very low. Frequency could be
improved.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Approved By

Charles Enoch and Jacques Bouhga-Hagbe

This note reports on information that has become available since the Staff Report
(SM/15/234) was circulated to the Executive Board and does not alter the thrust of
the staff appraisal.

Recent Developments and Prospects
1.
The baseline fiscal outlook is slightly more favorable following an outof-court settlement between the authorities and the owners of one of the two
nationalized companies (Tables on valuations and macro scenarios). On September
4, 2015, parliament approved the deed of settlement between the government and the
former owners (“Fortis”) of one of the two companies (Belize Electricity Limited or “BEL”)
that were nationalized in 2011.1 The government compensated “Fortis” with cash (US$35
million or about 2 percent of GDP) and by returning some BEL shares (with end-2014
book value of US$59 million or 3.4 percent of GDP). Staff’s projected compensation
payments for the other nationalized company (Belize Telemedia Limited or BTL) remain
unchanged. Compared with projections in the staff report, the projected path of public
debt has shifted downward by about 6 percentage points of GDP and staff now projects
public debt to reach about 89 percent of GDP in 2020, closer to the baseline mediumterm debt level envisaged during the 2014 Article IV Consultation (SM/14/149).2 The
path of gross financing needs has also shifted down by 2–5 percentage points of GDP
over 2017-2020, and gross financing needs are now projected to reach about 26 percent
of GDP by 2020.

1
2

The deed of settlement was signed on August 28, 2015.

The debt ratio is measured on a gross basis and the BEL settlement was financed by running down assets rather
than by accumulating new debt. The cash payment reduced reserves while the share return reduced the
government’s financial assets. The revision to the gross debt-to-GDP ratio overstates the impact on net public
finances, which benefited by just 1.4 percent of GDP relative to the staff report.

BELIZE

2.
Nonetheless, significant contingent liabilities from the two nationalized companies
remain, with a potential impact on the medium-term path of international reserves (Table on
Macro Scenarios). The deed of settlement on BEL contains a clause (“Put Option”) that allows
“Fortis” (or its transferees) to sell the newly reacquired BEL shares back to the government after
August 2019 (or earlier if some clauses of the deed are violated). In this case, the government will
have to repurchase these shares at their book value. Payment will have to be made available to
“Fortis” (or its transferee) within 24 months after the date of the “Put Notice”. It will have to be in US
dollars and made by wire transfer to a bank account outside Belize, free of all taxes, duties, fees,
imposts and deductions. The revised baseline assumes that “Fortis” will not exercise the “Put Option”
after August 2019 and will keep the shares as BEL’s recent good performances are assumed to
continue.3 However, staff notes that this “Put Option” is a non-negligible downside risk to the
baseline as public debt could jump at end-2019 by 3.4 percentage points of GDP and reserves drop
by US$75 million (one month of imports) if “Fortis” (or its transferee) exercise this “Put Option.”
Moreover, as noted in the staff report, the legal proceedings for BTL are continuing and justice
courts could impose compensation payments for BTL that are larger than amounts envisaged in the
staff report (13 percent of GDP in 2016 payable in five years).
3.
Raising the primary fiscal balance to 4–5 percent of GDP will significantly improve the
debt trajectory and bring it closer to debt targets recommended during the 2014 Article
IV Consultation (SM/14/149). As emphasized in the staff reports for the 2014 and 2015 Article IV
Consultations, staff maintains its recommendation that the authorities promptly begin to
progressively raise the primary fiscal balance to 4–5 percent of GDP. Under this fiscal adjustment
scenario, public debt would reach about 77 percent of GDP in 2020 and the authorities’ public debt
target of 60 percent of GDP by 2023.

3

The book value of BEL shares has risen from US$ 2.07 per share at end-2011 to US$ 2.565 per share at end 2014
(8 percent growth per year on average). With an annual book value growth of say 5 percent, the book value of BEL
shares would amount to US$ 3.274 per share at end-2019. A “Put Option” at end-2019 could then cost about US$
75.3 million to the government (or 3.4 percent of GDP).

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Approved By

Charles Enoch and Jacques Bouhga-Hagbe

This note updates staff’s assessment of Belize’s medium-term outlook, taking into
account additional information that has become available since the Staff Report
(SM/15/234) and supplementary information (SM/15/234, Sup. 2) were circulated
to the Executive Board. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.

Recent Developments and Prospects
1.
The authorities have reached an out-of-court settlement on one of the two
nationalized companies and have signed an agreement with the former owners of
the other:
 The deed of settlement on Belize Electricity Limited (BEL) was signed on
August 28, 2015 and approved by parliament on September 4, 2015. The government
compensated the former owners of BEL (“Fortis”) with cash (US$35 million or about
2 percent of GDP) and by returning some BEL shares (with end-2014 book value of
US$59 million or 3.4 percent of GDP).
 The settlement agreement on Belize Telemedia Limited (BTL) was signed on
September 11, 2015 and must be approved by parliament into a legislation that must be
published by September 18, 2015 (“BTL settlement legislation”). Under the agreement:
o

The former owners of BTL (“Dunkeld”) will stop their legal challenge to the
constitutionality of the nationalization of BTL.

o

The government recognizes liabilities (about US$ 48.5 million or 2.8 percent of GDP)
associated with a loan that was extended to BTL many years ago (“British Caribbean
Bank Loan”).1 One business day following the enactment of the “BTL settlement

The loan was extended to BTL almost 10 years ago. The original amount was US$ 22 million, but an arbitration
court ruled that the liability is now about US$ 48.5 million, including interest and other costs. British Caribbean Bank

“legislation”, the government will pay off “British Caribbean Bank Loan” in US dollars
by wire transfer, free of all taxes or other government charges or counterclaims.
o

One business day following the enactment of the “BTL settlement legislation”, the
government will make a down payment of about US$ 32.5 million (1.9 percent of
GDP) to “Dunkeld” toward compensation for the nationalized BTL.

o

The government will recognize the ruling of the permanent court of arbitration on
compensation for the nationalization of BTL (“Final award”). A hearing was held in
April 2015.2 Within 10 business days of the issuance of the “Final award”, the
government will pay 50 percent of the “balance” on the award (i.e. amount in the
“Final award” minus the down payment of about US$32.5 million mentioned above).
The remaining 50 percent will be paid on the 12 month anniversary of the issuance
of the “Final award”.

o

Almost all payments related to the “Final award” will be free of all taxes or other
government charges and can be taken out of Belize free of foreign exchange
restrictions and controls.

2.
In the revised baseline, the early repayment of debt related to nationalizations has
improved the public debt trajectory but significantly worsened near-term projections of gross
financing needs and central bank reserves (Tables on valuations and macro scenarios).
Compared with projections in the staff report, the projected path of public debt has shifted
downward by about 9 percentage points of GDP. Staff now projects public debt to reach about
87 percent of GDP in 2020, closer to the baseline medium-term debt level envisaged during the
2014 Article IV Consultation (SM/14/149).3 Near term gross financing needs have worsened by 2–5
percentage points of GDP but improved by similar amounts in the medium term. Central bank
reserves would significantly drop (by 1–3 months of imports) compared with projections in the staff
report and would be wiped out by 2020, especially if BTL compensation amounts in the “Final
award” are close to or higher than staff’s assumptions. Staff assumes that the permanent court of
arbitration will issue its ruling on BTL compensation by the end of 2016 (at staff mid-point
valuation). As envisaged in the settlement agreement on BTL, the government will make the first

Limited, which is incorporated in Turks and Caicos and is owned by “Dunkeld”, is the entity that holds the rights to
that loan and will receive the payment.
2

For the ruling on the “British Caribbean Bank Loan”, arbitration courts took nine months after hearing the case to
issue their ruling.
3

The debt ratio is measured on a gross basis and the BEL settlement was financed by running down assets rather
than by accumulating new debt. Payments for the “Dunkeld loan” (US$ 48.5 million) and the down payment of US$
32.5 million toward compensation for the nationalization of BTL are also made by running down assets rather than by
accumulating new debt. These cash payments reduced reserves while the share return in the BEL settlement reduced
the government’s financial assets. The revision to the gross debt-to-GDP ratio overstates the impact on net public
finances, which benefited by just 1.4 percent of GDP relative to the staff report.

payment in 2016 (one day after the ruling) and the second and last one in 2017. Staff assumes that
both payments will be made by accumulating new debt.
3.
Significant contingent liabilities from the two nationalized companies remain and
have heightened risks to Belize’s external stability (Table on Macro Scenarios). The deed of
settlement on BEL contains a clause (“Put Option”) that allows “Fortis” (or its transferees) to sell the
newly reacquired BEL shares back to the government after August 2019 (or earlier if some clauses of
the deed are violated). In this case, the government will have to repurchase these shares at their
book value. Payment will have to be made available to “Fortis” (or its transferee) within 24 months
after the date of the “Put Notice”. It will have to be in US dollars and made by wire transfer to a bank
account outside Belize, free of all taxes, duties, fees, imposts and deductions. The revised baseline
assumes that “Fortis” will not exercise the “Put Option” after August 2019 and will keep the shares as
BEL’s recent good performances are assumed to continue.4 However, staff notes that this “Put
Option” is a non-negligible downside risk to the baseline as public debt could jump at end-2019 by
3.4 percentage points of GDP and reserves drop by US$75 million (one month of imports) if “Fortis”
(or its transferee) exercise this “Put Option.” Moreover, as noted in the staff report and above, the
legal proceedings for BTL are continuing and the permanent court of arbitration, which is now the
only court to rule on BTL compensation, could impose compensation payments that are larger than
amounts envisaged in the staff report (13 percent of GDP in 2016 payable in five years). Such
compensation payments now have to be made over a much shorter period of time (within 12
months of the ruling) and could seriously deplete central bank reserves.
4.
Raising the primary fiscal balance to 4–5 percent of GDP would signal commitment to
fiscal consolidation, enhance investor confidence, and start to create the buffers needed to
help contain looming risks. As emphasized in the staff reports for the 2014 and 2015 Article IV
Consultations, staff maintains its recommendation that the authorities promptly begin to
progressively raise the primary fiscal balance to 4–5 percent of GDP. Under this fiscal adjustment
scenario, public debt would reach about 74 percent of GDP in 2020 and the authorities’ public debt
target of 60 percent of GDP by 2023. The enhanced investor confidence would boost private
investment and the much needed foreign exchange inflows associated with greater foreign direct
investment. The fiscal buffers that would be created would allow the government to borrow in
external markets to help rebuild central bank reserves if required.

4

The book value of BEL shares has risen from US$ 2.07 per share at end-2011 to US$2.565 per share at end 2014
(8 percent growth per year on average). With an annual book value growth of say 5 percent, the book value of BEL
shares would amount to US$ 3.274 per share at end-2019. A “Put Option” at end-2019 could then cost about US$
75.3 million to the government (or 3.4 percent of GDP).

Statement by Trevor. Lessard, Advisor for Belize
and Michael McGrath, Alternate Executive Director
September 16, 2015
Our Belizean authorities would like to express their appreciation to the staff for their frank
assessment of their economy and the helpful research conducted during the Article IV
consultation. We agree with staff that the main policy issues facing Belize are ensuring
financial stability, preserving external sustainability, and placing debt on a more firm
downward path. However, in some instances our authorities continue to disagree with staff
on what is the optimal policy mix to achieve these goals.
Fiscal Policy and Debt Sustainability
Similar to last year, our authorities are perplexed and disappointed that the report
refers to Belize’s debt as unsustainable and they would strongly encourage staff to be
more factual, and less editorial, in their assessments going forward. At 78.1 percent of
GDP, the debt-to-GDP ratio is higher than the authorities (and staff) would consider prudent
in the long term, but it is significantly lower than many other developing (and advanced)
economies whose debt has been deemed sustainable by the Fund. Unfortunately, again this
year staff seems to conflate having a debt-to-GDP above the desired level as equivalent to it
being unsustainable, which it is not. While our authorities agree with staff that debt
vulnerabilities are high over the medium term, and absent corrective action financing
pressures could be exceptional, these risks are not sufficient to conclude debt is unsustainable
at this point. Seemingly in contrast to staff’s conclusion, Belize’s debt path is downward
sloping in every year of the projection scenarios put forth by staff, except of course for the
year(s) that the costs associated with the nationalized entities are recognized.
With respect to the costs associated with the nationalizations, our authorities remain
firmly of the view that staff’s passive assumption to use the midpoint valuation of the
contingent liabilities for DSA purposes erroneously inflates Belize’s debt. The recent
settlement of BEL at a level significantly below the mid-point valuation is evidence in
support of this view. Given the importance such a determination by the Fund can have, every
effort should be made to ensure accuracy and consistency across the membership. Moreover,
when significant uncertainty is present, as is the case here, staff should more explicitly
highlight these unknowns and exercise caution in reaching a definitive judgment.
Our authorities recognize the need for fiscal consolidation and have already started
taking action. To begin, the relatively large fiscal expansion that accommodated increased
infrastructure spending, financed at favourable rates with the support of funding from the
Petro-Caribe arrangement, has run its course. Going forward, the Government of Belize has
committed to use any additional financing available through Petro-Caribe to lower the debt
burden on Belizeans through either a debt-buyback or to compensate the former owners of

2
the nationalized companies. This is only a first step as our authorities are reviewing various
revenue and expenditure measures, such as the structure of the GST and ways to rationalize
the public wage bill, which will improve the primary balance and place debt on an even
steeper downward trajectory.
Notwithstanding our authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation over the medium
term, they once again strongly disagree with staff’s recommendation to engage in harsh
fiscal austerity to achieve a primary balance of 4-5 percent. They continue to have
legitimate concerns that such an exceptional amount of front-loaded fiscal austerity carries
with it considerable opportunity costs in an economy requiring significant investment in
physical and human capital to achieve its growth potential. Moreover, staff’s ‘gradual’
consolidation path, which still envisages a substantial frontloading of greater than 4 percent
of GDP fiscal adjustment in a single year, is considered by our authorities to be economically
disastrous as well as socially and politically destabilizing, which could in itself undermine
securing much needed medium term multi-annual adjustment. Given recent high profile
discussions within and outside the Fund on what is an achievable fiscal adjustment path and
what are realistic estimates of fiscal multipliers, our authorities would have welcomed a more
considered, country-specific, and achievable fiscal adjustment path to anchor staff’s active
scenario. It is all the more surprising that staff did not explore a more growth-friendly
medium-term path given the relatively negligible difference in debt-to-GDP between the
austerity driven active scenario and the growth focused Plan B as evidenced by the end-point
results shown in the table on page 12 of the report.
Financial Sustainability
We thank the staff for highlighting the continued progress that has been made in
repairing the financial sector and bolstering financial regulatory and supervisory
frameworks. While staff rightly highlight remaining vulnerabilities in the financial sector
related to NPLs, it is important to place these levels into context. NPLs have continued their
multi-year trend decline while simultaneously banks have complied with the Central Bank of
Belize’s mandate to increase loan-loss provisions, the results of which are clearly illustrated
in Figure 4 of the staff report. Similarly steady progress has been made in addressing FSAP
recommendations and the recent exit from CFATF’s follow-up and monitoring progress
confirms the progress Belize has made on AML/CFT and other issues.
The recent and unexplained termination of correspondent banking relationships (CBR)
for some banks operating in Belize has the potential to destabilize the financial system
and have large negative spillovers, largely contained at present, for the real economy.
The lack of justification for terminating these CBRs, and lack of transparency on what is
required for their reactivation, is particularly problematic since it denies local authorities and
domestic banks the opportunity to address the concerns that may have brought the
termination of the CBR. Our authorities wish to highlight that this issue is not unique to

3
Belize, with banks (and central banks) in several developing economies losing these
important business relationships, thus leaving policy makers struggling in the dark with how
to respond. Our authorities hold the view that the termination of the CBR is the unintended
consequence of large financial institutions responding to a rapidly changing regulatory
environment and supervisory enforcement in their home jurisdictions. In rightly addressing
regulatory deficiencies, the relevant policy makers and authorities do not consider the
appropriate treatment of CBR, the current situation could worsen the too-big-to-fail (TBTF)
issue as it is small and medium-size domestic banks that are struggling to maintain relations
and stay active, not large multinational financial conglomerates. This hollowing out of the
financial sector in developing economies could bring with it not only important risks to
financial stability, but also affect the real economy as it is often smaller banks and credit
unions who are more willing to extend credit to SMEs and the productive sectors in their
economy.
The Fund has a clear role to play in resolving the correspondent banking issue, which is
affecting several of its members and has the potential to quickly worsen. We understand
that a working group has been created within the Fund to address this issue and would invite
staff to provide Directors with additional information on this group. Our authorities would
like to stress that the Fund, not only as the leading international institution in this area but
also as a spokesperson for many of its small and developing members who are not able to get
the international attention this issues deserves alone, needs to be proactive in this area. Our
authorities believe that the Fund’s role needs to go beyond researching the topic and
monitoring its effects. Rather, we strongly encourage the Fund to engage collaboratively with
affected members, large financial institutions, and systemically important regulators to
develop a set of concrete rules based benchmarks that can assist policymakers in
safeguarding and restoring normal financial relationships between domestic banks and
international markets.
Growth and Prosperity
While Horizon 2030 sets the long-term objectives that will guide development efforts in
Belize, the new Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS) for the period
2015-2018 transforms these objectives into specific goals and policy actions for the next
couple of years. With support from the UN, the GSDS is intended to be operational, rather
than aspirational, and explicitly takes into account the fiscal and economic realities in Belize.
As mentioned by staff one goal of the GSDS is to lift growth to an ambitious, but achievable
average real output growth of 5 percent - a point acknowledged by staff in their alternative
scenario analysis. Achieving this goal will require a multi-faceted approach that includes
improving the investment and business climate, targeted growth-inducing investments in
physical and human capital, maximizing the support from official sector partners, and
targeting sectors such as agribusiness that have strong growth prospects. Actioning this
achievable growth strategy as well as fostering and nurturing confidence in the economic

4
prospects will be critical to its success. In this regard, our authorities are very much aware of
the role that communications of the current situation and their plans will play in this regard.
External Sector
The fixed exchange rate regime has served Belize well, providing an important
macroeconomic anchor and price stability. Our authorities are closely monitoring
developments in the current account and the medium-term risks that are resulting from
declining oil exports and consistent current account deficits. Authorities recognize the need
to close the current account deficit in the coming years, which is why expanding export
markets and attracting foreign investments are explicitly highlighted as necessary conditions
for the success of the GSDS. The change in the current account will not occur instantly, and
our authorities are aware that an alternative path of austerity and import compression as
advocated by staff yield quicker results on the Balance of Payments, but they remain of the
view that this is not a lasting or sensible solution nor does it help Belize meet its
development and poverty reduction goals.
Concluding Remarks
Our authorities are in agreement with staff on the main vulnerabilities facing the Belizean
economy, although long-standing disagreements on the policy actions required in some areas
between themselves and staff remain. This should not be surprising given it mirrors a larger
unsettled debate within the discipline of economics. That said, our authorities do feel that the
Fund could better serve its role of a Trusted Advisor if more effort was made to take into
account the need for small poor countries such as Belize to focus extra attention on growth
and economic transformation through a well thought out structural reform agenda. Similarly,
fiscal policy discussions could be improved, and traction potentially increased, if staff
explored alternative fiscal scenarios instead of the unnecessarily harsh austerity path that has
been put forth year after year and rejected as unrealistic and not conducive to achieving a
sustainable shift in Belize’s growth trajectory.
