Executive Summary
•

Despite robust economic growth, rural poverty in Cambodia has remained
stubbornly high. Growth has averaged around 10 percent annually in recent years,
supported by prudent macroeconomic policies, large aid inflows, and greater openness
to trade. But much of this growth has been narrowly based on the garment and tourism
sectors while conditions in the rural, mainly agricultural areas had not improved
substantially by 2004. Cambodia has reduced overall income poverty but will need to
accelerate progress if it is to meet its Millennium Development Goals.

•

Growth was very high in 2005 largely due to an excellent agricultural
performance and continued strength in garment exports, tourism and
construction. Higher petroleum prices adversely affected the external position in 2005.
Continued high oil prices would pose risks to the balance of payments and growth
outlook, but have little direct fiscal impact given full pass-through.

•

Progress has been made in increasing fiscal revenue since late 2004, and debt is on
a sustainable path. Revenue collection increased with stepped-up arrears-collection
efforts. The revenue-to-GDP ratio remains very low, however, and collection efforts
need to be fortified to finance higher social spending and infrastructure development.
Cambodia’s debt, reduced by the recent MDRI relief, is on a sustainable path but risk
of debt distress remains due to low revenue collections.

•

Monetary and exchange rate policies are expected to continue focusing on the
government’s aim of keeping inflation low and limiting volatility of the riel, while
allowing the exchange rate to reflect changes in fundamentals.

•

Structural reforms have advanced after lagging earlier. Initial progress has been
made in structural reform implementation, particularly in the fiscal and legal areas,
though much needs to be done to enhance governance.

•

The recently approved National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) seeks to
achieve sustainable broad-based growth and poverty reduction. The aspects of the
strategy that have been discussed in the context of a possible PRGF arrangement focus
on maintaining macroeconomic stability, strengthening the role and effectiveness of the
government, and improving financial intermediation. Governance reforms, in particular
establishing the rule of law and addressing corruption, are essential for maintaining
fiscal integrity, improving competitiveness, and together with other structural reforms,
in creating an environment more conducive to private sector activity.

•

The authorities and staff have reached understandings on the parameters for a
successor PRGF arrangement. Such an arrangement would support implementation
of the NSDP. However, delays in resolving outstanding debt issues with official
creditors prevent the progress of the proposed arrangement.

•

Risks to the government’s strategy include (i) difficulty in implementing reforms,
reflecting entrenched interests within and outside the bureaucracy; and (ii) capacity
constraints, reflecting Cambodia’s level of economic development.

4
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Cambodia has enjoyed a broad degree of macroeconomic stability in recent
years, underpinned by prudent fiscal and monetary policies. Growth has been very
robust, averaging more than 10 percent annually over the last three years. The economy has
successfully created new jobs to absorb the rising working age population, which has been
growing at 3 percent annually, faster than the population. Inflation has remained under
control. The economy has withstood pressures from high world oil prices, albeit with a small
deterioration in the balance of payments. With the exchange rate broadly stable, the external
debt burden has eased to 51 percent of GDP in 2005, from a peak of 60 percent in 2003.
2.
Nevertheless, the country remains poor and governance weaknesses limit both
critical spending and the environment for broad-based development. Growth has been
narrowly based on garment exports and tourism and thus while the overall poverty rate has
declined—from 47 percent in 1994 to 35 percent in 2004—rural poverty remains stubbornly
high, and many Millennium Development Goals appear beyond reach (Box 1 and Table 6).
Low revenue has led to development spending shortfalls while corruption has contributed to
poor government operations and high costs of doing business. Cambodia ranks 130 (out of
158 countries) in Transparency International’s Corruptions Perceptions Index.
Box 1—Poverty in Cambodia1
According to the 2004 Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey of households, 35 percent of the population
lived below the national poverty line in that year.2 This represents a significant decline from an estimated
47 percent in 1994, although data issues hamper a strict comparability with earlier surveys. Thus, midway into
the 1993–2015 period set for reaching its Millennium Development Goals (MDG), Cambodia is well on its way
to achieving its first MDG of halving the proportion of the poor.
Poverty remains a largely rural phenomenon—more than 90 percent of the poor live in rural areas.
While poverty declined in all areas, the gains in urban areas were more significant than those in rural areas.
Moreover, inequality has increased: the consumption Gini coefficient is estimated to have reached about 0.42 in
2004, one of the highest in the region.
The overall changes in incidence and distribution of poverty largely reflect the broad patterns of
economic growth over the period. In the urban areas, poverty reduction was helped by rapid growth in
garment manufacturing and tourism-related services. In rural areas, prospects were held back by weak growth in
agricultural productivity, hampered by a range of structural impediments, including uneven access to land.
Efforts to address this problem will need to confront recent adverse trends, with the proportion of landless rural
households increasing from 13 percent in 1997, to 20 percent in 2004.
The spill-over of high urban growth into the rural economy appears to have been muted, reflecting weak
rural-urban linkages. For example, only a small fraction of rural households receive remittances from family
members working in cities. Sustained poverty reduction thus requires a deepening and broadening of economic
growth to include the rural economy and strengthen urban-rural linkages (including through public spending).
In this respect, the impressive growth in agriculture in 2005—about 17 percent—is a welcome development.
1

See Chapter II of the Selected Issues Paper for a more detailed treatment, drawing on the Poverty Assessment
prepared by the World Bank, and published in February 2006.
2
The poverty line is defined using a regionally-adjusted per capita consumption threshold. The results give
poverty line estimates, in 2004, ranging from about US$160 per capita in rural areas to a high of US$215 in
Phnom Penh.

5
3.
The political environment is stable but still fragile. Tensions over criminal
proceedings against dissidents have eased recently. The opposition leader, Sam Rainsy,
earlier convicted of criminal defamation and sentenced in absentia, was pardoned and
returned to Cambodia to resume his seat in Parliament. Parliament voted to amend the
Constitution to reduce the proportion of lawmakers required to form a government, giving
Prime Minister Hun Sen’s Cambodia People’s Party the ability to form a government without
the need for a coalition partner. However, the coalition continues in place although Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the coalition party FUNCINPEC, resigned as President of the
National Assembly.
4.
International support has remained strong despite concerns over the governance
environment. The Consultative Group meeting in March 2006 commended Cambodia’s
recent progress and donors pledged a combined US$600 million (10 percent of 2005 GDP) in
support for 2006, much of it in grant form. For 2005, the comparable figure was
US$500 million. The Fund also forgave 100 percent of its debt (about US$82 million)
through the Multilateral Debt relief Initiative (MDRI).1 However, the international
community remains concerned over the quality of governance and is taking close interest in
the recent suspension by the World Bank of three projects because of fraud concerns.2 The
World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy, discussed mid-2005, focuses on public financial
management, private sector development, natural resource management and local
governance. A Poverty Reduction Strategy Operation (PRSO) based on these issues is
expected to be approved in the second half of 2006.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Despite earlier pessimism, real GDP growth rose to 13½ percent in 2005 with all
sectors contributing (Table 1 and Box 2). In 2005, largely because of exceptionally
favorable weather conditions, following a drought in 2004, agriculture output grew by around
17 percent. Contrary to previous staff expectations of a large negative impact of the
termination of MFA quotas, with the introduction of safeguard restrictions put in place by the
United States and European Union, garment exports continued to expand in 2005, albeit at a
slower pace. To provide some relief, the government extended tax concessions to the sector
while trade unions suggest that wages have been cut as increased pressure was felt on profit
margins in the new environment. After increasing by 50 percent in 2004, tourist arrivals rose
by 35 percent in 2005 to nearly 1½ million with a related increase in construction activity.

1

The obligation of the National Bank of Cambodia NBC to the IMF was cancelled on January 6, 2006. The
government received a one-off capital revenue transfer, improving the 2006 deficit position by around 1 percent
of GDP, as spending of the proceeds (on rural irrigation projects) will occur mostly in subsequent years.

2

These infrastructure projects have a total value of around US$70 million.

6
Box 2. A Changing Picture of Cambodian Incomes
Compared with estimates and projections at the time of the 2004 Article IV consultation, the Cambodian
National Institute of Statistics’ revised GDP estimates are sharply higher:
•

the new estimates incorporate the results of the 2004 Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey, with much
higher household final consumption expenditures (about 17 percent) than previously estimated,

•

the coverage of the national accounts was broadened to include activities hitherto ignored, such as cash
crops from commercial
agricultural exploitation, gem and
500
gold mining, insurance and microGDP per capita in US$ (2004 Article IV staff report)
finance, and privately-provided
GDP per capita in US$ (current estimate)
450
education and health services.

Real growth in 2005 turned out to have
been sharply higher than projected in a
broad range of sectors, including
agriculture, largely the result of unusually
good weather; garments, as the anticipated
negative shock following the lifting of
MFA quotas did not materialize; and
construction, boosted by tourism-related
and donor-financed construction spending
exceeding initial forecasts.

Inflation remained under control, although rising to 6¾ percent at end-2005,
mainly reflecting higher petroleum prices. At end-April 2006, inflation had eased to below
5 percent as the effect of the 2004 drought on food prices and oil-price shock diminished.
7.
Fiscal policy was cautious, as expenditure restraint and slower donor project
execution led to a decline in the overall deficit to 3½ percent of GDP in 2005, from
4¾ percent in 2004 (Table 2). The

current spending grew only moderately. As the current balance improved, the government
was able to reduce the stock of outstanding payment orders in 2005.

7
8.
Revenue collection continued to grow in early 2006. Collection of domestic taxes
through April was in line with the revised 2006 projections. Nontax and trade taxes increased
but are somewhat behind target. As earlier, weaknesses in management have meant that
expenditure has been restrained in the early part of the year.
9.
Financial intermediation continued to expand, in the context of extremely high
dollarization. Broad money and bank deposits grew by about 16 percent (year-on-year) in
2005 (Table 3) and have picked up pace in early 2006. The banking system, however,
remains relatively undeveloped and concentrated. In this context, the acquisition of the
government-owned Foreign Trade Bank (FTB) by the owners of the largest private bank was
particularly noteworthy; together the two banks account for around 40 percent of total
deposits. The recent entry of ANZ Bank has introduced more modern banking practices and
rapidly mobilized deposits. Although annual growth in bank credit to the private sector
approached 30 percent, financial intermediation remains low—private sector credit averaged
less than 10 percent of GDP in 2005, allocated mainly to the services and retail sectors. Only
4 percent of deposits in banks and 6 percent of bank loans are in riel. In this relatively thin
market, the riel was fairly stable both in terms of dollars and partner country currencies with
little evidence of intervention by the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC).
10.
External developments were mixed. Robust tourism earnings and tourism have only
partly offset higher petroleum prices and strong non-garment imports (Table 4). The current
account deficit (excluding transfers) widened to 9½ percent of GDP in 2005, but this was
financed by an upswing in foreign direct investment, concentrated in garment, tourism, and
construction sectors. So far in 2006, reserve accumulation has been steady, due in part to
increases in the value of NBC’s gold holdings, with reserves reaching over US$1 billion in
May (around 2½ months of imports).
11.
Progress has been made on the wide-ranging structural reform agenda. The
authorities are implementing their flagship public financial management (PFM) reform
program. The program addresses the weaknesses discussed in the recent assessment of
Cambodia’s public expenditure management system made in the context of the MDRI.3 In
the financial sector, NBC certified all banks as compliant in implementing the new bank
Chart of Accounts but much improvement is still required in banking supervision. In the area
of land policy, the issuances of sub decrees on economic land concessions and on state land
management were significant developments.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.
Discussions took place in the context of a newly finalized PRSP—the National
Strategic Development Plan 2006–10 (NSDP). Reflecting the importance attached to it, the
3

EBS/05/181. The broader assessment and the actions the reform program is putting in place to address PFM
issues are summarized in Chapter IV of the Selected Issues paper.

8
NSDP was approved by the National Assembly in May 2006 despite a large backlog of
legislation. It focuses on broadening growth, increasing access to social services, and
promoting rural development through improved irrigation, land allocation and access to
credit. In their discussions with staff, parliamentarians supported the Plan’s emphasis on the
sustainable broad-based growth and poverty reduction through ensuring macroeconomic
stability, strengthening the role and effectiveness of the government, and enhancing financial
intermediation and governance. NGOs also expressed support for the strategy but hoped to be
more broadly involved in its implementation.
13.
The authorities have shown commitment to implementing this strategy, which
they hope will soon be supported by a PRGF arrangement. They have performed strongly
over the last year against the quantitative and structural indicators previously agreed with
staff for a possible arrangement in support of this strategy. As a resolution of longoutstanding arrears to official creditors (see Box 3 and Chapter V of the Selected Issues
Paper) has not been reached, the authorities have not been able to request such an
Box 3. Debt Obligations to the Russian Federation and the United States
Cambodia’s overdue obligations to the Russian Federation and the United States are tied to its
tumultuous history. As Cambodia shifted its Cold War alliances, it received loans from each of the
superpowers. In the unstable years that followed, these loans
were unaccounted for and largely unpaid. At the Paris Club
Public Debt Outstanding, 2005
meeting of 1995, the government acknowledged its
(In millions of U.S. dollars)
inheritance of these obligations.
The U.S. Debt
Obligations to the United States arise from commodity
shipments during the latter stages of the Vietnam War to
the then-incumbent Lon Nol regime. The United States
provided documentation that it had for these loans, including
proof of shipment, in 2005 (as no documentation survived in
Cambodia), reducing its claims in the process. Following this,
agreement was reached on an outstanding principal amount of
US$162 million. A bilateral agreement to formalize this is
currently being drafted. Outstanding interest payments are
estimated at $155 million by the United States. The two sides
have agreed that the overdue obligations will be further
rescheduled in the context of the Paris Club, where terms of
rescheduling will be agreed upon with other creditors.

The Russian Debt
Cambodia’s obligations to the Russian Federation arise from transferable ruble trading balances
incurred in the 1980s. Agreement has been reached on valuing the outstanding nominal debt stock at
US$1.5 billion, which, with an agreed up-front discount, would be reduced to about US$457 million.
However, there has been no agreement on the concessionality of the repayment terms for short-term
debt and debt contracted after December 31, 1985. Discussions are ongoing—the last bilateral
discussions were held in March 2006—though negotiations have not yet been concluded.

arrangement.4 They hope to be in a position to do so soon, in line with the understandings
reached in the context of the Article IV discussions.
A. Medium-Term Outlook
14.
Staff and authorities agreed upon a favorable medium-term macroeconomic
framework. It was accepted that, despite very strong recent growth, a degree of
conservatism was appropriate for planning purposes. With strong nonagricultural growth
tempered by a return to normal agricultural output trends, overall growth is expected to slow
to 5 percent in 2006, but will average about 6 percent in the medium term (Table 5).
•

Garment exports, construction, and tourism are expected to continue to underpin
buoyant economic activity in the near term but decelerate in the medium term as the

and land allocation, could lead to better agricultural performance in 2006. The agreed
framework, however, anticipates this effect, though significant, to be felt more in the
medium term.

•

Inflation should ease slightly, to about 5 percent in the near term, as higher oil prices
impede a more rapid decline. In the medium term, it is expected to decline to the level
of trading partners (about 3 percent).

•

High oil prices will dampen growth and contribute to a widening of the external
current account deficit (excluding official transfers) in the near term before sustained
growth in tourism and improved competitiveness allow it to narrow to 9¼ percent of
GDP by 2009. With the anticipated increase in external assistance, international
reserves are projected to recover to around 2¾ months of imports by 2009.

4

Fund financing to a member is precluded when there are arrears to official bilateral creditors, unless such
arrears are addressed consistent with Fund policy on non-toleration of arrears. The earlier PRGF arrangements
were approved on the basis that Cambodia's arrears were being addressed within the Paris Club framework.

10
•

Public debt will remain sustainable (see Annex II). Once debt-rescheduling
agreements with the Russian Federation and the United States are concluded, and
including IMF debt relief under the MDRI, public sector debt is projected to drop
from 51 percent of GDP in 2005 to 34 percent in 2006 and decline further thereafter.

15.

There are, however, risks to the outlook:

•

A breakdown in the fragile political stability could affect confidence and growth.

•

The phasing out of safeguards restrictions on China could adversely affect garment
exports in the medium term, as could accession to the WTO of regional competitors.

•

The banking sector is gaining strength, but remains a source of weakness.

•

The economy is highly vulnerable to a domestic or regional outbreak of avian flu.
Cambodia was one of the first countries where animal infection was reported, and
more recently there have been cases of human infection and death. Compounding the
risks, Cambodia’s health facilities and epidemic control systems remain poor and no
business continuity plans have yet been drawn up for the financial sector.

16.
The exploitation of recently discovered large offshore oil reserves is likely to
boost the economy significantly, though mainly in the longer run. Contracts have been
awarded for four of six offshore blocks; one of these could contain around 700 million
barrels of oil. Much uncertainty remains as to the scale and fiscal return of these projects but
oil companies’ initial estimates suggest that the oil could start flowing from 2010. Additional
revenues annually accruing to the government within a few years could significantly exceed
total fiscal revenue collected in 2005. The medium-term framework and the DSA will be
updated in 2007 to reflect the expected impact of oil exploration and production as more
information is forthcoming.
B. Fiscal Policy and Public Sector Reforms
17.
The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF)’s medium-term fiscal objectives
are to enhance revenue collection to meet priority spending needs, while continuing to
avoid domestic debt financing. Although total revenue has grown substantially in nominal
terms, it has struggled to keep pace with economic activity, remaining below 11 percent of
GDP. This low revenue buoyancy reflects the fact that the most rapidly growing sectors
(including informal agriculture and garments) are largely tax-exempt; governance problems
also impede revenue collection. The authorities hope to reach the revenue target of around
12½ percent of GDP by 2009 by broadening the effective tax base through further
improvements in administration and enforcement. Staff however emphasized the need to
continue to refine and develop tax policy, particularly in the event that administrative
measures were not sufficient to meet revenue targets.

medium term.
19.
The authorities place strong emphasis on improved revenue administration. Staff
supported this approach, encouraging the authorities to focus on full and equitable
enforcement of the Law on Taxation. Key elements of the authorities’ plans are capturing the
rapidly growing informal sector in the tax base, including through strengthening audits of
taxpayers, and re-organizing the tax department to enhance its efficiency. Customs
modernization will focus on a major IT investment (ASYCUDA), updating the antismuggling plan—smuggling is a major source of revenue loss—and strengthening risk
management. Staff noted that despite the growth in the non-tax revenue base, receipts from
this source have been falling as a share of GDP in recent years and 2006 receipts have been
below expectations. The authorities responded that privatization had reduced dividend
receipts but stressed their commitment to more effective administration and were confident
the budget target would be achieved. They explained new non-tax departments had been
established within the MEF and efforts would be made to ensure all revenues collected by
government agencies are promptly transferred to the Treasury. To address issues of
government revenue loss from nontransparent sales, transfers, and contracts, a Prime
Ministerial Order (PMO) was signed in 2005 requiring the cessation of swaps of public lands
and initiating transparent bidding procedures for future concession contracts.

5

Collection from domestic taxes is projected to build on the momentum achieved in 2005 and early 2006 with
growth in the tax base, and efforts to collect outstanding tax arrears, including from telecommunications
companies. As a result, the approved Budget target is expected to be exceeded by more than 20 percent—the
provision for servicing the rescheduled U.S. and Russian debt would be authorized by the MEF once finalized.

12
20.
The MEF accepted that tax policy measures would need to be considered for the
2007 Budget and beyond. Although it remains confident in the administrative measures
outlined above, MEF will consider the policy measures proposed by 2003’s FAD technical
assistance mission during budget preparation. These include amending VAT rates and
thresholds, increasing excise rates and re-considering property taxation in urban areas.
Petroleum-sector taxation policy will also be clarified and strengthened with FAD support.
MEF will further discuss the 2007 Budget with Fund staff in the autumn.
21.
The authorities committed not to grant tax exemptions beyond the provisions
already allowed in law. The Senior Minister of Commerce, nevertheless, expressed the view
that further tax incentives are required to compete with neighboring countries, Vietnam in
particular, in attracting foreign investment. Staff responded that although tax incentives could
induce FDI at the margin, the current system was already generous and other factors were
more important to Cambodia’s competitiveness (see Chapter III of the Selected Issues
Paper).
22.
Expenditure is being reoriented to support poverty reduction and achieve the
MDGs. Current expenditure is projected to increase by about 1¼ percent of GDP in 2006,
somewhat below the envisaged revenue increase, to make room for financing a greater share
of capital spending. Within this envelope, social spending (excluding wages) will be
increased to 1½ percent of GDP and more resources allocated to rural development.6 Room
will also be made for a gradual increase in civil service pay and a decompression of the wage
structure in the context of a broader civil service reform program. The authorities intend to
use savings arising from the MDRI to implement new rural irrigation projects—such
spending is projected to be about $6 million in 2006. Infrastructure development, including
in the power sector, remains a priority and the authorities are investigating various financing
sources, including public-private partnerships and borrowing from China and the Asian
Development Bank (AsDB). Staff urged that every effort should be made to secure
concessional financing for these projects.
23.
The public financial management (PFM) reform program is key to improving
expenditure performance. Staff supported the wide-ranging agenda of this program (see
Chapter IV of the Selected Issue Paper) and urged the authorities to accelerate its
implementation. The authorities agreed that particular attention needed to be paid to actions
to improve the 2007 Budget, most importantly adopting the new Chart of Accounts. Staff
emphasized the importance of using this to identify clearly and track poverty-reducing
spending and to regularize the exceptional spending procedures such as the Priority Action
Programs. The authorities agreed in principle but noted that these exceptional procedures
were created to ensure that shortcomings in budget execution did not prevent key expenditure

Work is underway to establish a clear definition of poverty-reducing spending linked to NSDP priorities. In
the meantime, spending by key social sector ministries is used as a proxy.

13
priorities from being financed. They preferred to address these shortcomings, including
rationalizing government bank accounts and constructing a database of payment arrears,
before abandoning these procedures.
C. Monetary, Exchange Rate and Financial Sector Policies
24.
The monetary program is predicated on an inflation target of around 5 percent
at end-2006. Broad money is projected to grow by around 20 percent in 2006, as money
demand continues its upward trend. Reserve money growth would be driven largely by net
international reserve accumulation. Net domestic credit from the banking system to the
government is projected to remain unchanged, thereby allowing for year-on-year growth in
credit to the private sector of around 40 percent in 2006.7
25.
The NBC will adhere to its established intervention policy of stabilizing excessive
fluctuations in the dollar exchange rate. Some officials were concerned about the effect a
sharp depreciation in the dollar may have on economic performance but the staff argued that
the overall impact could be favorable (see Box 4). Staff and the authorities agreed that
exchange rate adjustments reflecting shifts in underlying market fundamentals should not be
resisted. The NBC is considering possible strategies for de-dollarization and will develop a
framework paper that would set the scene for developing more effective monetary and
exchange policy instruments in the medium term. They remain, however, concerned that
these initiatives could stretch their limited internal capacity and requested technical
assistance. The staff supported the NBC’s approach of encouraging increased use of the riel
while avoiding imposing restrictions on the use of foreign currencies.”
26.
The NBC aims to enforce prudential norms more strictly to ensure rapid private
sector credit growth does not have an adverse impact on banks’ balance sheets. Given
its still low overall level in relation to GDP, rapid growth in private sector credit is to be
expected. NBC has recently begun to compile financial soundness indicators; they show that
compliance with key prudential

Box 4: Exchange Rates and Competitiveness
Managed floating exchange rate policy has been broadly appropriate for Cambodia. The policy to allow
the exchange rate to be market-determined—as evidenced by the low and stable premium of the parallel rate
over the official rate—while limiting fluctuations in the bilateral exchange rate against the U.S. dollar has
provided a stable base for the

By other indicators, there has been
little progress in improving
80
competitiveness in recent years. Poor
infrastructure, and corruption and red
tape, remain major issues of concern,
with mixed evidence of progress.
According to the World Bank’s “Cost of Doing Business” surveys, there was a decrease in the administrative
costs of starting a business (normalized by per capita income) between the 2004 and 2006 surveys. However,
there were increases in the length of procedures to enforce contracts, and no clear gains in a range of other
measures of red tape, such as the length of customs procedures, labor regulation, or creditor rights. On the labor
front, wages do not appear to have risen in recent years at a pace that poses a threat to external competitiveness,
and there even are indications of a small dip in garment sector wages as export prices declined early in 2005.

Of interest, in a country where most transactions are conducted or priced in U.S. dollars, is the effect of a
possible depreciation of the dollar against other currencies. As almost half of Cambodia’s exports is garments to
the United States—and most inputs, including labor, are priced in dollars—a depreciation of the dollar would have
limited effect on export demand. If anything competitiveness may improve as appreciation of competing countries’
currencies makes their products more expensive in dollar terms. Depreciation against the Euro could additionally
help Cambodian garment exports to Europe, and also make Cambodia a cheaper tourist destination than neighboring
countries with appreciating currencies. However, imports, especially from neighboring countries, would likely
become more expensive—particularly if exporters do not engage in pricing-to-market behavior—contributing to
higher inflation. This would hurt the poor, and partially mute the competitive gains for Cambodian exports.

The NBC Governor agreed to introduce more extensive supervision based on the newlycompleted accounting standards and to enforce prudential regulations more strictly and
concurred with staff that systemically-important banks should be closely supervised. He
emphasized that retaining strong, foreign-owned banks was vital for reinforcing still-fragile
confidence in the banking system and that NBC was anxious not to take measures that could
jeopardize regional banks from continuing to invest in Cambodia. Nevertheless, he
committed to conduct a thorough review of current practices, while refraining from granting

15
new approvals for large exposure loans unless detailed due diligence had been undertaken by
NBC on the guarantee provided.
27.
The authorities are pursuing a number of initiatives to reduce impediments to
financial intermediation. The absence of reliable borrower information and the lack of
enforceability of financial contracts have hampered financial sector development, particularly
for small- and medium-size enterprises. The financial sector blueprint, currently being
updated with the assistance of AsDB, contains a broad range of initiatives to deepen
intermediation. Staff supported NBC’s action to address this, including implementing a
program of legislative and administrative reforms to establish a secure and reliable payments
system and the establishment of a credit information system.8 In addition, a draft Insolvency
Law, developed in collaboration with the Ministry of Commerce, is close to finalization.
28.
NBC officials reiterated their commitment to implement safeguards
recommendations and proceed with anti-money laundering (AML) efforts. The
safeguards assessment completed in March 2004 noted weaknesses in financial reporting,
internal audit and internal control systems. The NBC has started to implement an action plan
to address these weaknesses, in particular the creation, at end-November 2005, of a new
internal audit department and Board-level audit committee. Officials agreed that more rapid
action would be required. This will be reviewed in the context of an update of the safeguards
assessment in the second half of 2006. Draft AML legislation and regulations aimed at
meeting international standards are under consideration. The NBC has issued a decree on
bank guidelines for identifying money laundering and introducing provisions to combat the
financing of terrorism. The draft legislation will need to be passed into law and
implementation commenced by the first quarter of 2007 to enable it to be taken into account
when Cambodia is assessed for its compliance with the international standards in 2007.
D. External Sector Issues
29.
The authorities are undertaking trade facilitation reforms to improve
competitiveness and support export diversification. Reforms that focus on reducing
administrative costs and consolidating the trade inspection process are being implemented
under the World Bank supported Trade Facilitation and Competitiveness Project. Staff urged
the authorities to make a swift decision on the implementation arrangements for the single
window system for processing trade documents. In addition to their importance to trade
facilitation, staff underscored that these arrangements would enable customs modernization
to move ahead.
30.
Commitments under WTO accession and the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)
are expected to facilitate international trade. While commendable progress has been made
8

A Negotiable Instruments and Payment Transactions Law was passed and a Secured Transactions Law
submitted to the National Assembly in 2005.

16
in making wide-ranging changes to legislation required under the WTO accession agreement,
much remains to be done. For AFTA, tariff rates under the Common Effective Preferential
Tariff Scheme will be reduced to a maximum of 5 percent by 2010, and all items in the
temporary exclusion list will be transferred to the inclusion list by 2007. The mission urged
the authorities to reduce tariffs further on a nonpreferential basis to avoid trade diversion.
31.
The authorities stressed their commitment to finalizing agreement on debt
restructuring with the United States and Russian Federation. The United States and
Cambodian authorities have now agreed on the total amount of debt principal and
rescheduling of outstanding obligations is planned in the context of a new Paris Club
agreement. Recent negotiations with the Russian Federation made progress but did not yet
yield agreement over the nature of one claim and the repayment terms for post cut-off debt.
E. Other Structural Reforms
32.
Creating an environment conducive to private-sector investment is essential to
broaden the base for economic growth. A further draft of legislation on anti-corruption (a
core theme of the NSDP) is close to being completed. Substantial technical assistance has
been provided to ensure the legislation is consistent with international standards. Staff
emphasized the importance of safeguarding the financial and operational autonomy of the
anti-corruption secretariat in the draft submitted to the National Assembly. They also
supported the authorities’ reforms focusing on streamlining administrative procedures for
registering a company, and strengthening commercial arbitration processes with support from
the World Bank. The authorities are also taking a number of measures to establish a credible
and transparent legal and judicial system that will inspire confidence in the rule of law in
Cambodia, including a Law on the Status of Judges and Prosecutors, which is critical to the
independence of the courts, and revisions to the draft penal code.
33.
Clear and transparent land policies are essential to curtail land grabbing by the
powerful and to unlock agricultural growth potential. Staff noted that land concessions
have been granted by discretion; only about 7 percent of the area granted as concessions for
agricultural purposes has been cultivated, resulting in significant loss of productive potential,
particularly for the poor. The authorities’ approach to improve the efficient allocation of land
for agriculture includes a program of land titling, which is proceeding at a steady rate for
undisputed land, and ensuring that land concessions are granted on a fair and transparent
basis. Staff urged the authorities to ensure that the implementation of the land concession
sub-decree is fully consistent with the provisions of the 2001 Land Law, and contains strong
provisions for dealing with unsolicited bids to minimize scope for discretion and corruption.

17
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The Cambodian authorities are to be commended for implementing sound
macroeconomic policies in recent years, even while the domestic political environment has
been at times unsettled. Despite the surge in world oil prices, inflation stayed low, and debt
declined in terms of GDP.
35.
Growth has been very robust, but widespread rural poverty highlights the
continued challenges. The narrow growth base has resulted in uneven progress in reducing
poverty—particularly in rural areas—and in growing income disparities. This situation is
neither sustainable, nor desirable over the long term. The staff supports the approach of the
authorities’ NSDP to channel more resources to increasing agricultural productivity through
rural irrigation, improved land allocation, and rural credit.
36.
Overall medium-term prospects are favorable. Growth is expected to remain
robust—and could well exceed the projected rate—and inflation moderate. There are
risks but these are balanced by upside possibilities. Further escalation of oil prices would
impose a major cost, while the phasing out of garment safeguards restrictions on China could
adversely affect prospects for the medium term. However, oil exploitation will likely
significantly boost the economy, mainly in the longer run and provided the opportunities are
well managed. The path of external debt is sustainable, although there are risks of distress
because of the low revenue base. Thus, a prudent borrowing policy—limiting foreign finance
wherever possible to concessional resources—is appropriate. Staff supports the authorities’
efforts to resolve outstanding arrears with official creditors.
37.
The government needs to finance more of Cambodia’s development, reducing its
dependence on aid. Almost one-third of public expenditure is financed by aid. Despite
progress in increasing tax revenue over the last two years, Cambodia’s revenue-to-GDP ratio
continues to be among the lowest in the world, handicapped by a narrow tax base and
difficulties in ensuring revenue collected is received. Current tax regulations should be
strictly enforced, and all revenue collected transferred to the National Treasury. Effort should
focus on strengthening capacity in the tax and customs department, updating the antismuggling plan, and clarifying petroleum-sector tax provisions, but tax policy measures may
also be needed in the 2007 budget. Expanding the scope of tax exemptions would undermine
the revenue effort and have only marginal effectiveness in attracting foreign investment.
38.
The authorities’ plan to reorient expenditure is welcome. Social spending in
support of the MDGs and infrastructure spending to upgrade the country’s physical capital
stock will support achieving the NSDP’s objectives. The funds freed up by the MDRI will
also provide some additional resources for poverty-reducing spending priorities. New
expenditure arrears and recourse to domestic financing should be avoided to maintain fiscal
integrity and support the low inflation objective.

18
39.
Strong ownership and implementation of the PFM reform program combined
with civil service reform would provide for a more credible and effective budget. The
staff fully supports the budget and treasury reforms envisaged under the government’s
program. More rapid implementation of key measures, in particular the introduction of the
new Chart of Accounts and rationalizing government bank accounts is important. Such
measures would strengthen the government’s control over fiscal policy and provide better
monitoring of poverty-reducing spending, as envisaged by the MDRI relief. In the medium
term, moving to a smaller, better-qualified and better-paid civil service is essential to
complement the revenue and financial management efforts and to combat corruption.
40.
The monetary objectives and exchange rate and trade policies are appropriate.
Monetary aggregates will be expected to continue to reflect the increase in financial
intermediation. De-dollarization should remain a long-term objective, but coercive measures
could jeopardize public confidence. Staff supports the NBC’s approach to stabilize excessive
fluctuations in the exchange rate, while allowing the rate to adjust to any shifts in underlying
market fundamentals. The authorities are encouraged to strengthen competitiveness,
including through improved trade facilitation through prompt introduction of ASYCUDA
and the single window, while integrating further within the region.
41.
Strengthening the financial framework through enhanced supervision
enforcement and adoption of remaining legislation is key to promoting sound financial
intermediation. The impact of rapid private sector credit growth on banks’ balance sheets
needs to be closely monitored and the NBC should pay particular attention to the
performance of the two large banks that are now jointly owned. The NBC needs to limit
exemptions on prudential requirements, especially on capital requirements and large
exposure limits. Staff looks forward to the implementation of the laws on negotiable
instruments and secure transactions as a means to create a better functioning payments
system. The submission of the draft anti-money-laundering law to the National Assembly is
welcome as are continued measures to address weaknesses in the control, accounting,
reporting, and auditing procedures of the NBC, as indicated by the safeguard assessment.
42.
Addressing widespread corruption will enhance the business environment as
well as strengthen revenue collection. The proposed anti-corruption law needs to provide
an important pillar upon which future anti-corruption efforts will be based, combined with
the enforcement of existing laws. Staff encourages the authorities to ensure that weaknesses
in the current draft are addressed and the anti-corruption secretariat can be established
promptly. More immediately, the authorities are urged to use the current laws and procedures
to guard against misuse of funds and to investigate irregularities as they come to light.
43.
A sound and transparent framework for managing state land is important for
good governance. Staff welcomes the commitment to cease state asset transactions that are
inconsistent with the Land Law, and to subject all government concession contracts to open
and transparent competitive bidding, which will help strengthen non-tax revenue.

19
44.
The staff welcomes efforts to improve statistics. While there has been considerable
improvement in recent years in this area, continued efforts are warranted for monitoring both
economic and poverty developments. Government agencies should continue to collaborate in
the sharing of data, and statistical operations and agencies receive adequate budget resources.
45.
The authorities have demonstrated ownership of a credible program of
structural reform aimed at tackling the impediments to broad-based growth and
poverty reduction. Their commitment has been demonstrated over the past year by sound
macroeconomic policies and the implementation of measures for which understandings were
reached with the staff in earlier program discussions. The recently completed NSDP provides
a good road map for tackling poverty, although some critical elements of the sectoral strategy
still need to be finalized and costing improved. Moreover, achieving the objectives of the
NSDP will require sustained attention to the broad-ranging structural reform agenda. Once
the outstanding debt arrears issues are resolved staff would support a request for a new PRGF
arrangement that could support the program and help close the gap in financing the mediumterm balance of payments.
46.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place within the standard
12-month cycle.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative

As part of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative the IMF Executive Board on January 5, 2006
approved relief on 100 percent of debt incurred by Cambodia to the IMF before January 1, 2005.
This resulted in all of Cambodia’s outstanding debt to the IMF, a total of SDR 56.8 million
(about US$82 million) being forgiven. The authorities intend to spend the resources over a
number of years, initially on rural irrigation projects. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC)
transferred the full MDRI proceeds to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, effective March
2006.

29
VIII.

Safeguards Assessment:

Under the Fund’s safeguard assessment policy, the NBC is subject to a full safeguard assessment
with respect to the successor PRGF Arrangement. The assessment was completed in March 2004
and specific measures were proposed to address weaknesses in financial reporting, internal audit
and internal control systems. An update is expected to be undertaken in the second half of 2006.
IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Cambodia follows a managed float with no pre-announced exchange rate path. Since
November 8, 1992 the exchange rate arrangement for the riel has consisted of the following two
rates. First, the official exchange rate, which is expressed in riels per U.S. dollar, applies to all
official external transactions conducted by the government and state enterprises. Second, the
market rate, which is determined by the foreign exchange market, applies to all other
transactions. The official exchange rate is adjusted so as to limit the spread between the official
rate and the market rate to no more than 1 percent on a daily basis. On April 30, 2006, the official
exchange rate was CR 4,096 per U.S. dollar and the market rate CR 4,102 per U.S. dollar.
Cambodia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on January 1, 2002.
Cambodia maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions.
X.

Article IV Consultation:

Cambodia is subject to the provisions on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002. The
Executive Board concluded the last Article IV consultation on September 13, 2004 (Country
Report No. 04/328).
XI.

Technical Assistance:

There are currently three resident advisors in Cambodia: a Banking advisor; a Treasury advisor;
and a multi-sector Statistics advisor. A detailed summary of recent technical assistance activities
is attached. Annex III provides a summary of key policy and strategic issues.
XI.

Resident Representative:

The resident representative office was closed in October 1997, and re-opened at endOctober 1999. Mr. Nelmes is currently the Resident Representative.

ANNEX II
Cambodia: Debt Sustainability Analysis9
External debt—of which almost 60 percent is owed to the United States and the Russian
Federation—constitutes over 90 percent of Cambodia’s public debt. At end-2005,
Cambodia’s total external public debt was about $3.2 billion (50½ percent of GDP), while
domestic debt amounted to 3½ percent of GDP, denominated entirely in local currency.
Considerable progress has been made in recent months in resolving the issue of outstanding
debt obligations to the United States and the Russian Federation.
This joint WB/IMF debt sustainability assessment comes to the conclusion that
Cambodia’s debt is on a sustainable path, but the current risk of debt distress remains
high. If debt rescheduling agreements are reached, the risk of debt distress will moderate,
though low revenue collections and extreme external shocks will continue to pose risks to
debt sustainability. The analysis is based on the assumption that real GDP growth will be
sustained at 6 percent and exports will grow at around 9 percent a year, with economic
activity underpinned by garment exports and tourism. Business environment reforms are
expected to help improve competitiveness. Although oil production is expected during the
projection period, the potential impact is not included in the baseline or alternative scenarios
due to uncertainty as to its scale, timing, and fiscal return. Foreign aid is assumed to remain
broadly stable in nominal U.S. dollar terms. On the fiscal front, fiscal consolidation is
expected to begin with the 2006 budget, underpinned by improvements in the tax and
customs administration. The primary balance will improve over the medium term with
improved fiscal performance. New borrowing is projected to be highly concessional and
external debt owed to United States and the Russian Federation is assumed to be restructured
in 2006.
The assessment also incorporates Cambodia’s receipt of debt relief from the Fund
under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). As outlined in the published staff
assessment (12/08/05), Cambodia satisfied the three conditions for eligibility, thus qualifying
to receive immediate debt relief from the Fund of SDR57 million (US$82 million).10 The
impact of this measure on the NPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio is about 1¼ percentage
points, with debt relief providing around 1¼ percent of additional revenue in 2006 that will
be spent over the medium term on poverty reducing projects.
A. The Current Situation
Cambodia’s two largest creditors are the Russian Federation and the United States.
Since Cambodia is not servicing its debt to either creditor and is making efforts to conclude
agreements with both creditors under the framework of the Paris Club, the DSA assumes a

Boards of the Fund and the Bank in April 2005.

Three criteria are: (i) good macroeconomic performance, (ii) implementation of a poverty reduction policy,
and (iii) adequate public expenditure management systems.

33
debt restructuring agreement with the United States and Russia in 2006. As a consequence,
Cambodia’s net present value (NPV) of external debt-to-GDP ratio would drop from
40½ percent at end-2005 to 22½ percent in 2006.
The outstanding differences between the United States and Cambodia, until recently,
have involved the total amount of principal. After clarification of outstanding legal issues,
the countries have agreed on a total obligation of US$162 million. The next steps required to
settle this issue include signing a bilateral agreement based on the 1995 Paris Club agreement
(i.e., flow rescheduling on Naples terms assuming a 40-year maturity, 16-year grace period,
and an interest rate of 3 percent), and calculating arrears up to now. It is expected that
Cambodia would then request a rescheduling of those arrears through the Paris Club. While
the exact terms of such rescheduling are not certain, staff assumes that the Naples terms will
be applied.
Cambodia and the Russian Federation have discussed rescheduling with a stock
operation. They have agreed that (i) after applying the stipulated exchange rate and the
70 percent upfront discount, the total debt would be US$457 million, and (ii) interest rate for
the pre-cut-off-date debt would be about 0.8 percent, with concessional repayment schedule.
However, the countries have disagreed on the classification of US$40 million as either precut-off-date or post-cut-off-date debt, and the interest rate on the post-cut-off-date debt. The
current Fund staff assumption for the macroeconomic framework is (i) the disputed
US$40 million is classified as post-cut-off-date debt, and (ii) the interest rate for the post-cutoff-date is set according to the Russian offer at the latest bilateral meeting.
Cambodia ranks as a ‘weak performer’ in terms of its policies and institutions according
to the latest World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). Indicative
debt-burden thresholds for countries in this category are a NPV of external debt-to-exports of
100 percent, to GDP of 30 percent and to revenues of 200 percent, and debt service ratios to
exports and to revenues of 15 and 25 percent, respectively.
B. Public Debt Sustainability
Cambodia’s public debt burden indicators reflect the country’s weak fiscal revenue
base. The NPV of public debt-to-revenue ratio, which was 348 percent at end-2005, will
remain high at around 182 percent even under the assumption that the bilateral restructuring
agreements with the United States and Russia will be concluded in 2006.11 The ratio will
remain below 200 percent in the medium term, with improved revenue performance as
assumed in the baseline, declining to 161 percent by 2011. However, the debt-to-revenue
threshold is breached for multiple years under all the bounds tests, indicating the risk that low
revenues pose to debt sustainability. Under the baseline scenario, the stock of public debt,
which amounted to 54 percent of GDP at the end of 2005, is projected to decline to
36½ percent in 2006, or around 25 percent in NPV terms. Given the assumption that the

revenue drop in 2006 and increase in 2007.

34
primary deficit improves gradually in the medium term and remains at about 1 percent of
GDP in the long run, the NPV of public sector debt-to-GDP ratio would drop to 8½ percent
by 2026.
Cambodia’s debt sustainability hinges on the improvement of weak fiscal performance.
A continuation of 2005’s fiscal performance would lead to a greater decline in the NPV of
public debt-to-GDP ratio than under the baseline (Test A2). However, maintenance of
primary deficit at the 2004 level—at 3 percent of GDP—would result in the NPV of public
debt-to-GDP ratio remaining above 30 percent and the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio
remaining above 200 percent in the scenario, both above their respective indicative
thresholds. A one-time exchange rate depreciation (Test B4) would raise the NPV of debt-toGDP ratio by 9 percentage points and the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio by 70 percentage
points in 2007 relative to the baseline.12 The difference between this stress test and the
baseline is projected to decrease only slowly over time. However, the debt-service-torevenue ratio remains relatively low in most scenarios since it is assumed that
concessionality of external debt is high in the medium term.
C. External Debt Sustainability
Cambodia’s external debt burden indicators are likely to remain below their indicative
thresholds following conclusion of rescheduling agreements. The baseline scenario,
however, shows that the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio will remain close to the threshold in
the medium term.13 The ratio to GDP of the NPV of external debt will remain below the
30 percent indicative threshold in the medium-term, although breaching the threshold under
some stress tests. The NPV of debt-to-export ratio, however, is 32½ percent in 2006, well
below its indicative debt burden threshold of 100 percent. The debt service-to-exports ratio
remains between 1 and 1½ percent in the long term reflecting the fact that new borrowing is
assumed to be highly concessional.
The ratio to GDP of the NPV of external debt would breach its indicative threshold in
the event of an export shock, indicating that Cambodia’s debt sustainability remains
vulnerable to exogenous shocks.14 Lower export growth would result in a NPV of debt-toGDP ratio of more than the indicative threshold of 30 percent in 2008 and 2009, remaining
above the threshold in the medium term. The NPV of debt-to-export ratio would also
substantially deteriorate by 19 percentage points (relative to the baseline scenario) to
53 percent in 2008. However, the ratio remains below its indicative debt burden threshold.
Debt service ratios would remain below their indicative thresholds throughout the entire
projection period even under the most extreme stress test, since the new borrowing is
12

This test grossly overestimates the negative impact since Cambodia is highly dollarized and nearly all the
transactions are executed in U.S. dollars.

13

14

The temporary drop in the ratio in 2006 is due to the treatment of the MDRI relief as capital revenue.

One standard deviation shock is very large (12 percent) since Cambodia’s exports have expanded very rapidly
for past several years. Cambodia has never experienced such a large negative shock since it started exporting
garment products in mid-1990s.

35
assumed to be highly concessional. If no agreement is reached with the United States and the
Russian Federation, the external debt-to-GDP ratio will remain at a high level. Consequently,
in the absence of debt service to their largest creditors, Cambodia’s debt service payments
will remain low (Figure A-3).
D. Impact of Less-Concessional Loan
The authorities are planning to borrow on less concessional terms. The authorities are
considering financing critical infrastructure investment projects through the Asian
Development Bank’s Ordinary Capital Resource (OCR) lending, which may have only
limited concessionality.15 Additional less concessional resources may be made available from
China, which could add to the debt burden. While it is understandable that better
infrastructure is needed to foster higher living standards and a favorable business
environment, attention should be paid to its implication for future expenditure, given the
country’s low revenue base and weak institutions. Careful assessment is needed to plan for
such large infrastructure investments, and transactions should be monitored closely and
transparently. If these loans are made available to the private sector, with political risk
guarantee being provided by the Government, the contingent liabilities implications need to
be considered. The current staff simulation shows that if such less-concessional borrowing
were limited to US$20 million per year, the revenue impact would be about ½ to ¾ percent in
the medium-term (Figure A-3).
E. Conclusion
Staffs come to the conclusion that Cambodia’s debt is sustainable, and that the current
risk of debt distress is high. Once rescheduling agreements are concluded, the risk will
moderate sharply thereafter if baseline assumptions—improved revenue performance and
sustained growth—hold. The NPV of public sector debt-to-GDP ratio falls below the
indicative threshold in the medium-term after rescheduling of United States and Russian
debts, and the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio remains near its indicative threshold
of 200 percent in the medium-term under the baseline, and is highly sensitive to fluctuations
in macroeconomic and fiscal parameters. While the NPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio is
slightly below its indicative debt burden threshold in the medium-term, stress tests indicate
that an extreme export shock could substantially increase Cambodia’s probability of debt
distress in the medium term. Continuation of prudent economic policies—including
strengthening its revenue base, which currently stands at less than 11 percent of GDP, and
thus improving its primary balance—and export diversification should ameliorate these
concerns and allow debt dynamics to be sustainable. Further, the positive impact of oil
production on exports and revenues in the longer term would obviously reduce the risks
Cambodia faces. Close attention, however, needs to be paid to Cambodia’s debt management
strategy, especially regarding less concessional loans, as it may impair sustainability,
especially in the presence of a low revenue base and weak institutions.

The interest rate of OCR is in line with market rate. The lending period is from 15-20 years and the grace
period is 2-7 years.

7/ Debt services are cash basis until 2005.
8/ Includes effect of MDRI debt relief. Debt rescheduling with the Russian Federation and the United States is also assumed in 2006.

6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 7 years, since the consistent balance of payments data are only available since 1998.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

ANNEX III
IMF Technical Assistance and Donor Coordination
Over the previous decade, Cambodia has received considerable IMF technical
assistance (TA). The most significant period was during the Technical Cooperation
Assistance Program (TCAP) from 2001–03, a joint initiative of the authorities, IMF and
other donors, but it has remained high.
Cambodia is one of ten countries participating in the IMF’s pilot Country Technical
Assistance Strategy Note exercise. The Cambodia strategy note, which was discussed with
the authorities in March, envisages that Fund technical assistance to Cambodia will be
gradually scaled back from the high intensity of recent years and will have narrower focus on
key macroeconomic constraints. Modes of delivery would emphasize the need to build local
capacity and favor subject-specific missions and visits over resident advice. The substantial
capacity gaps that still exist, and the importance of cementing the gains from previous Fund
investment, do mean, however, that Cambodia will continue to be a major recipient of Fund
TA. There are currently three resident advisors in Cambodia: a Banking advisor; a Treasury
advisor; and a multi-sector Statistics advisor.
The objective of TA in banking sector reform has been to create a robust and efficient
banking system—through bank relicensing, strengthening regulations, and improving bank
supervision. The impact of TA in the banking system has been mostly satisfactory as
capacity of the authorities increased, banking sector soundness improved, banking
supervision strengthened, and the new Chart of Accounts was developed. However, further
capacity building is needed in the areas of banking supervision, internal audit and control,
and to engender a payments system based less on cash.
Fiscal TA focused on strengthening revenue administration and budget management.
Significant progress has been made in strengthening the tax administration as reflected in the
implementation of a large taxpayer unit (LTU), improved audits and taxpayer services,
computer system enhancement, identification of missing or improperly classified taxpayers,
and recently the commencement of a functional restructuring. TA to the customs department
has assisted with the drafting of the new customs law and implementing regulations, WTO
accession, anti-smuggling operations, and IT development. Since 2001, assistance in budget
preparation and execution has focused on treasury reforms, strengthening cash management,
and addressing payment arrears. TA in this area yielded only limited tangible results during
the TCAP period, although the diagnosis of the PEM system played an important role in the
development of the Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP) launched at the
end of 2004. More headway has been made recently under the PFMRP, but significant
challenges remain—see Chapter IV of the Selected Issues Paper.
Legal TA aimed to improve the financial sector legal framework, such as in the area of
insolvency. More recently, TA was provided for the drafting of the anti-corruption law and in
the area of AML/CFT, including the development of specialized institutional capacity in
financial investigations and supervision. Cooperation by the authorities has been mixed.

44
Statistical TA has been very effective in improving national accounts, price and foreign
trade data, and balance of payments, government finance, and money and banking statistics.
Significant progress has been made with capacity building as reflected in the creation of a
new consumer price index and improvement in the availability, quality, and compilation
methodologies of data. Considerable progress has also been made in producing monthly and
quarterly GFS reports.
A strong focus on donor coordination has been an important element of recent TA
delivery, for instance in the government’s Sector Wide Approaches (SWAps). Donor
coordination was an important characteristic of the TCAP as well, but was less effective than
envisaged particularly in the area of PEM reform. Unlike the TCAP, the SWAPs seek to
emphasize discussions and agreements at the diagnosis and design stages. TA efforts by
donors—including the IMF, World Bank, AsDB, UNDP, AusAID, and JICA—especially in
the areas of public financial management and legal and judicial reform—are coordinated
through various technical working groups, some of which include the participation of the
private sector. Recently, donors have started to coordinate closely TA activities related to oil
and gas exploration, an area not covered explicitly under the PFMRP.

45
ANNEX IV
Cambodia: Statistical Issues
1.
Despite significant shortcomings in some areas, core economic and financial data
provided to the Fund are generally adequate for surveillance. In March 2002, metadata were
posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board, and Cambodia began participation in
the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System.
2.
Extensive technical assistance from the IMF, UNDP, AsDB, and World Bank has
contributed to substantial improvements in Cambodia’s macroeconomic statistics. A longterm IMF advisor has worked in the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) since October 2001
(with a one-year interruption) to assist the authorities in upgrading economic and financial
statistics. A new Statistics Law was passed by the National Assembly in March 2005.
Technical assistance from the UNDP will facilitate the implementation of the Statistics Law
provisions in relation to establishing governance, coordination, and dissemination
mechanisms, as well as general statistical training.
National accounts and prices statistics
3.
Official GDP estimates are produced annually with support from the AsDB’s
peripatetic expert and a long-term IMF advisor. Revised national accounts series for 2001–04
and preliminary estimates for 2005 have been completed and will soon be released. These
estimates show an upward revision of GDP growth rates for 2001–04 due to the
incorporation of the results of the 2004 household expenditures survey.16 Good progress is
also being made in preparing quarterly national accounts estimates for 2000 onwards.
Nevertheless, the quality of GDP estimates remains hampered by the lack of comprehensive
and reliable sectoral information.
4.
The NIS provides a monthly CPI with a five-week lag; this series was recently
updated with new expenditure weights and rebased to July–December, 2000 = 100. Since
July 2000, the NIS has compiled a quarterly urban CPI for five major provincial cities and
Phnom Penh. A quarterly producer price index was developed, with support from STA and
financing from the AsDB. The experimental producer price index was released in April 2005
and manual entitled “Cambodian Prices Statistics: Concepts, Sources and Methods” was
recently published. However, compilation of the PPI has been discontinued owing to
resource constraints.
Government finance statistics
5.
The Ministry of Economy and Finance provides monthly fiscal data (broadly based
on GFS standards) with a four-week lag. There remain, however, certain weaknesses with
regard to the reliability of source data, coverage, and the economic and functional
classifications of expenditure. Data on donor-financed projects are available with a
considerable lag. Some of these issues are currently being addressed; with the support of a
16

GDP growth rates for 2001–04 have been revised to 7.7, 6.2, 8.6 and 10 percent, respectively.

46
Treasury advisor (FAD) and a Statistical Advisor (STA), the authorities are undertaking a
reform of the government accounting system and budgetary nomenclature (based on the
classification of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001). In addition, several STA
missions to improve GFS compilation procedures and assist with the implementation of the
new methodology have taken place in recent years, the latest in February 2006..
6.
In 2005, the authorities resumed providing monthly fiscal data for publication in IFS
after an interruption of several months and for the first time reported data for publication in
the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.
Monetary and financial statistics
7.
The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) provides monthly data on the monetary
authorities and deposit money banks with a four-week lag. In addition to the accounts of the
monetary authorities and deposit money banks, the NBC also compiles the sectoral balance
sheet and survey for central bank and other depository corporations in accordance with the
methodology recommended in the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. Since
August 2005, the NBC has reported monetary and financial statistics to STA using the
Standardized Report Forms (SRFs).
External sector statistics
8.
The NBC is responsible for compiling balance of payments statistics. Customs data
have substantial coverage and valuation problems arising from the nonrecording of
nondutiable imports, underreporting of re-exports, and weaknesses in customs controls.
While there have been improvements in the quality of foreign direct investment data, private
capital flows are believed to be large and not fully captured in the official data. A range of
international transactions by enterprises, such as payments for imported services, income
payments, and portfolio investment abroad are not included in the data.
9.
Gross external debt data are provided by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, but
public and publicly guaranteed debt by maturity, external debt service schedule and timely
information on disbursements by bilateral donors are not available. In January 2003, the
authorities implemented an International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) to collect
data on international transactions made through the banking system to improve balance of
payments estimates. An STA balance of payments statistics mission in March–May 2004
reviewed source data used for compiling the balance of payments and recommended
improvements; a multisector statistics advisor is currently residing in Cambodia to assist in
improving external sector statistics.

ANNEX V
Cambodia: IMF-World Bank Relations17
The Royal Government of Cambodia’s (RGC) Rectangular Strategy for Growth,
Employment, Equity and Efficiency in Cambodia (2004) identifies improved governance as
“the most important precondition to economic development with sustainability, equity and
social justice.” This analysis accords with that set out in the World Bank’s Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS), which stresses the need to improve governance in order to
maximize the impact of development efforts. As reflected in the new CAS, discussed at the
Board in May 2005, the Bank’s policy dialogue in Cambodia focuses on public financial
management, private sector development, natural resource management, and local
governance, while also addressing the national poverty reduction strategy, legal and judicial
reform, rural development, decentralization, social sector development, and infrastructure.
Bank-Fund collaboration in Cambodia takes place at two levels: (i) through the policy-based
lending program; and (ii) through analytical and advisory services, including in the context of
the technical working groups. The following sections describe that collaboration in the
context of the Bank’s policy dialogue.
National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP). An NSDP Secretariat, chaired by the
Ministry of Planning (MOP) with inputs from the Supreme National Economic Council
(SNEC), has managed the formulation of the RGC’s next five year plan, the National
Strategic Development Plan (NSDP, 2006-2010), approved by the National Assembly in
May 2006. The NSDP, which constitutes the RGC’s second poverty reduction strategy, will
guide implementation of the vision laid out in the Government’s Rectangular Strategy (RS)
and help Cambodia achieve the Cambodian MDGs. The Asian Development Bank (ADB),
the UN system, and Bank have cooperated over the course of 2005 to coordinate technical
support to the NSDP Secretariat, with the Bank and the UN Resident Coordinator both
serving as co-lead donor coordinators in the Technical Working Group on Planning and
Poverty Reduction (TWG-PPR). In addition to this general support on issues of process, the
Bank has provided technical inputs to the NSDP in the areas of public financial management,
civil service reform, and private sector development. Recent and on-going analytical work—
the national Poverty Assessment, the Rural Sector Strategy Note, the Sources of Growth
study, and the transport sector strategy—have also provided additional inputs to the NDSP.
The Fund has ensured that the macroeconomic framework is consistent with its projections
and recommendations and engaged on key structural policy issues.
National Poverty Assessment and Related Initiatives. The Bank, in cooperation with local
research partners, EIC (Economic Institute of Cambodia) and CDRI (Cambodia
Development Resource Institute), has led the production of a national Poverty Assessment,
17

Cleared (May 25, 2006). Questions may be referred to Mr. Taliercio (855-23-217-304 x324).

49
released at the CG Meeting in March 2006. This provided a much-needed update of the
poverty profile (the last such poverty assessment was published over six years ago, using
poverty estimates that are now over eight years old) and, for the first time in Cambodia, a
robust analysis of poverty trends. The analysis is based primarily upon new household
consumption data derived from the 2004 Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey (CSES),
complemented by mixed methods research into local variations and household poverty
dynamics (the Moving out of Poverty Study). The assessment finds that poverty has fallen by
between 10 and 15 percent in the decade since the first household survey was carried out in
1993/4 as the poor that have obtained benefits from high rates of economic growth. However,
the benefits of growth have been very unevenly distributed, with living standards rising far
faster in urban areas and in the highest quintile. Thus, while poverty has been reduced,
inequality has increased dramatically: the Gini coefficient is now 0.42, among the highest in
the Asia Pacific Region.
Sources of Growth Study. The Bank has initiated an assessment of the sources of growth
and employment in Cambodia. In particular, the study will: i) review the relative sectoral
contributions to economic growth and employment over the last decade; ii) identify and rank
the key binding constraints to sustained higher growth and employment; and iii) assess the
potential growth and employment that could be feasible provided the binding constraints are
eased. The Fund is engaged in this study in a peer review capacity.
Rural Sector Strategy. With 85 percent of the population living in rural areas, and
79 percent of the poor mainly depending on agriculture and natural resource for their
livelihoods, economic growth and poverty reduction will to a large extent depend on reviving
the rural economy. In 2003, the Bank initiated the preparation of the Rural Sector Strategy
Note (RSSN), which aimed to identify critical rural development issues and options to
address them. The RSSN was finalized in June 2005 and will provide a basis for further
dialogue with Government and other partners on priorities for agricultural and rural
development. The Bank is also preparing a Land Allocation for Social and Economic
Development project.
Transportation Sector Strategy. Despite significant diagnostic work and investment in
reconstruction and development of infrastructure, transport remains a constraint to overall
and equitable growth. Management of the transport sector remains weak, though there has
been some recent progress. In particular, the absence of a sustainable road maintenance
funding mechanism is a major concern, and the Bank is continuing the policy dialogue on the
issue. Despite the availability of recently completed background and analytical works by
ADB and the Bank, the Government has not yet made significant progress in formulating the
transport sector strategy. The technical work to develop a road law that would govern the
management of the road sector is near completion.
Social Sector Policy Dialogue. In the health sector the key policy issues under discussion
are: (i) improved effectiveness of health financing through improved sector wide planning
and budgeting processes, equity funds (access to health services for the poor), and
contracting with NGOs for improved service delivery and outcomes; and (ii) pay and
employment reform in the Ministry of Health. The recent joint health sector performance
review established maternal and child health as health priorities. In the education sector the

50
Bank has been an active contributor to the Education Strategic Plan and the Education Sector
Support Program. The key policy issues the Bank is focusing on are: (i) disparities in
education participation rates by different regions, income groups, and gender; (ii)
inefficiency and poor quality in education service delivery at primary, secondary, and tertiary
levels; (iii) weak local management capacity; (iv) lack of reliability in education finance
disbursements; and (v) pay and employment reform. Both the education and health sectors
are undertaking public expenditure tracking surveys.
Public Financial Management (PFM). The joint WB-ADB Integrated Fiduciary
Assessment and Public Expenditure Review, 2003 (IFAPER) found that though Cambodia
had made some progress in reforming public expenditure policy and management, it would
have to make much more progress on fiscal, fiduciary, and institutional challenges in order to
implement its development agenda. In comparative perspective, Cambodia’s PFM system
ranks below average (as compared to the low income countries assessed by a joint World
Bank-IMF diagnostic tool), indicating the need for substantial upgrading.
The Government launched a potentially far-reaching Public Financial Management Reform
Program (PFMRP) in December 2004. The PFMRP comprises a detailed, sequenced, and
time-bound action plan, a performance management framework, and measures to address
organizational reform, including staff incentives. A joint effort of ten of Cambodia’s
development partners committed to assist in strengthening the Government’s ability to lead
and implement this agenda and to provide fully coordinated support via a sector wide
approach (SWAp). The Bank will support the PFMRP through the recently negotiated Public
Financial Management and Accountability Project (Board presentation scheduled for June
2006) which will finance, inter alia, the computerization if the government accounting and
payment system. In addition, the Bank is managing a multi-donor trust fund to support the
program on behalf of several other donors. The collaborative approach is supported by the
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) secretariat, as envisioned in the
recent Bank-Fund board paper.18 The Fund has provided extensive TA to the RGC in tax and
customs administration and selected areas in budget management and Treasury operations.
The Bank and Fund have established a productive working relationship on PFM.
Civil Service Reform. The IFAPER found serious problems afflicting the civil service: low
and compressed pay, low skills, and thus low capacity. Low public sector wages provide a
breeding ground for corrupt practices and are a leading cause of Cambodia’s relatively poor
standing on public sector performance. The Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) ranks Cambodia in the fourth lowest quintile among low income
countries on issues pertaining to public sector management and institutions. Though the
Government has recently made some progress, more is required.
The Bank has provided the Government with a significant amount of grant funding to carry
out an agreed set of studies that would provide the analytical foundation for reform. These
studies cover: (i) labor market pay comparator analysis, (ii) pay and employment fiscal
18

“Bank/Fund Collaboration on Public Expenditure Issues,” February 14, 2003.

51
sustainability analysis, (iii) reallocation and retrenchment analysis, (iv) development of a
functional analysis methodology and its application to select ministries, and (v) preparation
of an establishment register. Work on the studies commenced last year but the program is
behind schedule. The Fund has supported the Bank’s program in this area.
In addition, the Bank is working with the Government and other donors to pilot accelerated
pay and employment reform in high priority sectors. The Merit Based Pay Initiative (MBPI),
which is an official Government program, has recently been agreed and is expected to be
implemented first in the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The MBPI provides for
substantial increases in remuneration (with some decompression) for a small group of
officials selected based on merit and regular, appropriate performance management. The
promise of the MBPI is to introduce the principles and practices of meritocracy into the
Cambodian civil service. The Fund has also supported this pilot initiative for the Ministry of
Economy and Finance in the context of the PFM reform program.
Private Sector Development. The Government needs to place a higher priority on structural
reforms to support sustainable, private-led growth. In addition to providing ongoing technical
support to the Government through assistance to the Government Private Sector Forum, the
Bank Group, including the IFC (Mekong Project Development Facility, the Foreign
Investment Advisory Service, and the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility), has
provided an input to the Government's Private Sector Development Strategy through an
investment climate assessment and value chain analysis. The objective of this effort has
provided focus on a three-fold strategy aimed at removing impediments to productivity
growth, to help diversify the economy, and to increase the role of the private sector in service
delivery. The findings of the work to date have identified overlapping trade facilitation,
inspection, and licensing processes of various agencies as contributing to an excessive
regulatory burden and a high incidence of corruption. In light of these findings, the Bank is
focusing its efforts on operationalizing the reform recommendations through the 2005 Trade
Facilitation and Competitiveness Project with participation from other donors, including the
European Commission, AusAID, and IMF. Its key component will streamline import and
export processes, and the Bank and Fund are working together on customs automation. A
sector-wide approach (SWAp) on private sector development is being reviewed in line with
other donors to provide a unified input into supporting required reforms in private sector
development. Initial focus areas for the SWAp are trade facilitation, small and medium
enterprise (SME) development, PPI, and investment climate.
Legal and Judicial Reform, Governance, and Anti-Corruption. In its framework for
improved governance, the Rectangular Strategy identifies “legal and judicial reform” (LJR)
and “fighting corruption” as key factors for success. With support from the Bank, the
Government devised a Legal and Judicial Reform (LJR) Strategy in 2002 (formally adopted
in June 2003). Priority actions with regard to LJR were agreed at the consultative group (CG)
meeting in December 2004. These focused on the passing of eight key laws (Criminal Code,
Criminal Procedure, Civil Code, Civil Procedure, Law on Anti-Corruption, Law on the
Supreme Council of the Magistracy, Law on the Organization and Functioning of the Courts,
and Law on the Status of Judges and Prosecutors). Though progress was made in the
legislative drafting process, none of these laws had been passed by May 2006. Donor efforts
are focusing on improving the ability of the TWG to coordinate among the variety of

52
government agencies where are active in the LJR process. Beyond the legislative agenda, the
RGC has prioritized the following as core reform areas: (a) access to legal and judicial
services and the collection and dissemination of relevant legal and judicial information; (b)
strengthening the market economy and legal and judicial reforms in support of private sector
development; and (c) the creation and support of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.
In line with this agenda, the Bank is: (a) providing support (through the Trade Facilitation
and Competitiveness Project) to the Ministries of Justice and Commerce and the courts to
create a national database of legal information of particular relevance for the private sector;
and (b) conducting analytical work with a view to the design of an IDA grant supporting a
range of access to justice initiatives involving greater citizen participation in issues of
governance at the local level.
Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO). The first proposed PRSO focuses on
public financial management, private sector development, and land resources management
(subsequent PRSOs would broaden the coverage to other priority sectors). The PRSO process
is designed to strengthen the linkage between results and donor assistance. The proposed
operation will help provide support to the implementation of the policy agenda laid out in the
RS and the NSDP. The PRSO is linked closely to the joint monitoring indicators (JMIs)
agreed at the 2004 and 2006 CG Meetings so that the reform program remains governmentowned and led and supported by the entire donor community collectively. The prior actions
for PRSO-1, which are a subset of the CG Meeting JMIs, will need to demonstrate the
government’s commitment to reform, and fiduciary safeguards will have to be adequately
addressed.
The proposed PRSO-1 under discussion with the Government focuses the prior actions on
land resources management, PSD, and PFM. The proposed prior actions focus on key issues
in each of the three areas: in land resources management the prior actions address the issues
of state land management and economic land concessions; in PSD the prior actions focus on
trade facilitation and investment law; in public financial and human resource management
the prior actions focus on budget process and treasury operations, procurement, and
meritocratic pay and employment reform.
Staff have coordinated closely on the proposed PRGF and PRSO programs, and have agreed
on streamlined conditionality arrangements. Though there is proposed conditionality in both
proposed programs on land resources management, PSD, and PFM, the Bank and Fund have
ensured that conditionalities are complementary and mutually reinforcing, while not
overlapping on any specific areas. Comprehensive consultations are on-going, most recently
taking place during the Fund mission in May 2006, but continuing at the country office level
on a regular basis.

ANNEX VI
Cambodia: Relations with the Asian Development Bank
From 1992 through 31 December 2005, the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) approved
$973.4 million in low-interest loans (including $42 million in grants in 2005) to Cambodia to
finance 28 projects and 8 structural reform programs. To date 13 loan projects, for a total of
$333 million, have been completed: (i) Phnom Penh High Voltage Transmission [approved
in 1970, and closed in 1993] (ii) the Special Rehabilitation Assistance Project [approved in
1992]; (iii) Power Rehabilitation Project [approved in 1994]; (iv) Agriculture Sector Program
[approved in 1996]; (v) Basic Skills Project [approved in 1995]; (vi) Rural Infrastructure
Improvement Project [approved in 1995]; (vii) Basic Education Text Book Project (approved
in 1996); (viii) Basic Health Services Project [approved in 1996]; (ix) Phnom Penh Water
Supply and Drainage Project [approved in 1996]; (x) Siem Reap Airport Project (approved in
1996); (xi) Financial Sector Program, Subprogram I [approved in 2001]; (xii) Education
Sector Development Program [approved in 2001]; and (xiii) Emergency Flood Rehabilitation
[approved in 2000].
The sector composition and loan amounts of the remaining portfolio is as follows: agriculture
and natural resources ($58.6 million); education ($40 million); energy ($62.9 million);
finance ($30 million); health, nutrition and social protection ($20 million); industry and trade
($35.6 million); law, economic management and public policy ($10 million); multi-sector
($43.2 million); transport and communication ($158 million); and water supply, sanitation
and waste management ($26.3 million).
During the same period, the AsDB also designed and administered 129 technical assistance
projects amounting to $82.13 million. They were financed through grants from AsDB’s
Technical Assistance Special Fund ($30.6 million), the Japanese Special Fund
($33.4 million), and other sources ($18.3 million). In 2005, the AsDB approved three more
loans: Tonle Sap Water Supply and Sanitation; Financial Sector Program Loan I (Cluster III);
and Tonle Sap Sustainable Livelihoods.
AsDB’s overarching goal in Cambodia is sustainable poverty reduction. AsDB’s Country
Strategy and Program (CSP) will focus on: (i) broad-based economic growth through
investments in physical infrastructure, development of the financial sector, sustainable
development of small and medium-scale enterprises, and investments in agriculture and
irrigation; (ii) inclusive social development through basic education, empowering vulnerable
groups such as women and ethnic minorities, control of communicable diseases, the
provision of rural water supply and sanitation facilities, and community-based sustainable
management and conservation of natural resources in the Tonle Sap Basin; and (iii) good
governance through improving accountability and service delivery, supporting legal,
regulatory and policy reforms, strengthening institutional capacity building, and improving
efficiency and effectiveness of project implementation. A focus on the Tonle Sap basin to
address geographical disparities in development, and a subregional focus to benefit from the
broader opportunities provided by AsDB’s Greater Mekong Sub-region program are also
included. Four cross-cutting themes, namely governance, private sector development,

56
gender, and the environment are also proposed to support the poverty reduction objectives of
the country strategy.
The CSP was developed based on wide ranging consultations with the Government, donors,
civil society, and the private sector. In particular, AsDB, the World Bank, the United
Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID), and the UN agencies
undertook a joint strategic planning process for their country strategies which resulted in
shared analysis and assessments.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Cambodia
On July 7, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Cambodia.1
Background
Cambodia has enjoyed a broad degree of macroeconomic stability in recent years, underpinned
by prudent fiscal and monetary policies. The economy has successfully created new jobs to
absorb the rising working age population, which has been growing at 3 percent annually, faster
than the population. Inflation has remained under control. The economy has withstood
pressures from high world oil prices, albeit with a small deterioration in the balance of
payments. The external debt burden has eased to 51 percent of GDP in 2005, from a peak of
60 percent in 2003. Nevertheless, the country remains poor and governance weaknesses limit
both critical spending and the environment for broad-based development. Growth has been
narrowly based on garment exports and tourism and thus while the overall poverty rate has
declined—from 47 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004—rural poverty remains stubbornly
high, and many Millennium Development Goals appear beyond reach. Low revenue has led to
development spending shortfalls while corruption has contributed to poor government
operations and high costs of doing business.
Real GDP growth rose to 13½ percent in 2005 with all sectors contributing. Largely because of
exceptionally favorable weather conditions, following a drought in 2004, agriculture output grew
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
by around 17 percent. Contrary to earlier concerns of a large negative impact of the termination
of MFA quotas, with the introduction of safeguard restrictions put in place by the United States
and European Union, garment exports continued to expand in 2005, albeit at a slower pace.
After increasing by 50 percent in 2004, tourist arrivals rose by 35 percent in 2005 to nearly
1½ million with a related increase in construction activity. Inflation remained under control—at
end-April 2006, inflation had eased to below 5 percent as the effect of the 2004 drought on food
prices and oil-price shock diminished.
Fiscal policy was cautious, as expenditure restraint and slower donor project execution led to a
decline in the overall deficit to 3½ percent of GDP in 2005, from 4¾ percent in 2004. The deficit
was again more than financed by external aid. Despite greater than budgeted tax revenues and
one-off receipts from the privatization of a state bank, the revenue to GDP ratio in 2005 was
only 10½ percent. Expenditure declined as a share of GDP as capital spending continued its
downward trend—in line with external financing—and current spending grew only moderately.
Financial intermediation continued to expand, in the context of extremely high dollarization.
Broad money and bank deposits grew by about 16 percent (year-on-year) in 2005 and have
picked up pace in early 2006. The banking system, however, remains relatively undeveloped
and concentrated—financial intermediation remains low—private sector credit averaged less
than 10 percent of GDP in 2005, allocated mainly to the services and retail sectors.
External developments were mixed. Robust tourism earnings and tourism only partly offset
higher petroleum prices and strong non-garment imports. The current account deficit (excluding
transfers) widened to 9½ percent of GDP in 2005, but this was financed by an upswing in
foreign direct investment, concentrated in garment, tourism, and construction sectors. The riel
was fairly stable both in terms of dollars and partner country currencies.
Progress has been made on the wide-ranging structural reform agenda. The authorities are
implementing their flagship public financial management (PFM) reform program, which
addresses the weaknesses of Cambodia’s public expenditure management system. In the area
of land policy, the issuances of sub decrees on economic land concessions and on state land
management were significant developments.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Cambodian authorities for their sound macroeconomic
policies, which have contributed to the strong growth performance of recent years. The fiscal
position has improved, inflation remains under control, structural reforms have been
implemented in key areas, and poverty has fallen significantly. Directors considered that, in the
period ahead, the authorities should place emphasis on improving governance and the
investment climate, to lay the groundwork for faster and broader-based private sector growth
and to allow for reducing reliance on aid inflows over the long term.
Directors welcomed the government’s commitment to reorient expenditure toward achieving the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). They observed that greater stress is appropriately
being placed under the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) on reducing poverty,
enhancing physical infrastructure, and improving social services. Given that poverty in rural

3
areas is still high, Directors also endorsed the NSDP’s intention to channel more resources to
increasing agricultural productivity. They encouraged the authorities to strengthen further the
costing and prioritization of the NSDP. They commended the authorities’ intention to use
resources freed up by the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) to further strengthen poverty
reduction efforts.
At the same time, Directors expressed concern that revenue collection continues to be well
below what is needed to support the government’s expenditure objectives. They called for the
full enforcement of current tax regulations and a reining-in of tax exemptions, and they
endorsed the authorities’ intention to enhance revenue administration. They suggested that
additional tax policy measures be considered in the 2007 budget. Directors recommended that
the authorities take early measures to ensure that future proceeds from the exploitation of
recently discovered petroleum reserves, which could be substantial, are well managed. In that
connection, they called on the authorities to participate soon in the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative.
Directors endorsed the current approach to monetary policy, which is constrained by the high
degree of dollarization. De-dollarization should remain a long-term objective. Directors
supported the National Bank of Cambodia’s (NBC) policy of stabilizing excessive fluctuations in
the exchange rate, while allowing the rate to adjust to shifts in underlying market fundamentals.
They encouraged the government to continue deepening Cambodia’s integration into the
region.
Directors called on the government to strengthen the financial infrastructure through enhanced
supervision—particularly of the dominant banks—and enforcement, and through the
development of a more effective payments system. They urged the NBC to limit exemptions on
prudential requirements, especially on capital requirements and large exposure limits.
They encouraged the NBC to continue to address weaknesses in its internal control,
accounting, and auditing procedures, as identified in the safeguards assessment. Directors
welcomed the submission to parliament of a draft law to combat money laundering and the
financing of terrorism.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their prudent borrowing policy—limiting nonconcessional foreign financing. They observed that although the path of external debt is
sustainable, the small and narrow revenue base presents risks. Directors looked forward to an
early resolution of outstanding official bilateral debt issues, which could clear the way for Fund
financial support within the PRGF framework.
Directors encouraged the authorities to accelerate structural reforms to promote equitable
growth, increase competitiveness, and reduce the vulnerability of the economy to risks. They
welcomed the government’s commitment to the comprehensive public financial management
reform program, which should make spending more effective. They encouraged the authorities
to hasten the program’s implementation, in particular by introducing the new Chart of Accounts
for the 2007 budget and by rationalizing government bank accounts.
Directors stressed the need to improve governance to enhance the business environment and
strengthen revenue collection. They emphasized the importance of civil service reform to fight

4
corruption, and urged the authorities to make full use of current regulations to guard against
misuse of funds and to investigate irregularities. They called for the promulgation of an anticorruption law of international standard, and the prompt establishment of an anti-corruption
secretariat.
Directors noted the considerable improvement in statistics in recent years, and encouraged the
government to ensure that adequate budget resources are allocated to this area so that the
macroeconomic and social objectives of the NSDP can be properly monitored.

Statement by Hooi Eng Phang, Executive Director for Cambodia
and Tola May, Advisor to Executive Director
July 7, 2006
Introduction
On behalf of the Cambodian authorities, we would like to thank Executive Directors and
Management as well as donor countries for their continued support for Cambodia, including
the provision of debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) early this
year. We would also like to express our appreciation to development partners of the
Consultative Group meeting held in March 2006 in Phnom Penh for their endorsement of the
Cambodian government’s reform program, and reaffirmation of their continued support. The
authorities are in broad agreement with the staff’s assessment and policy recommendations
and thank staff for the constructive policy dialogue during the recent Article IV consultation.
Leveraging on the opportunities afforded by the donor countries and development partners,
the authorities have continued with efforts to advance the reform program so as to strengthen
economic growth and reduce poverty along with the progress made in promoting democracy,
peace and stability. With prudent macroeconomic management, the economy has achieved
remarkable progress over the last 12 years with GDP growth averaging over 7.6 percent per
annum, while poverty has fallen from 47 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004. These
achievements reflect the success of strong country ownership of national policies and
effective international support, including continued cooperation with the IMF. Despite the
progress that has been made, the authorities are well aware of the challenges ahead in
maintaining high but sustainable rates of broad-based growth and reducing poverty and
inequality, in continuing efforts to attain the Cambodian Millennium Development Goals
(CMDGs).
Going forward, Cambodia will increasingly be exposed to greater international competition.
As such, greater economic diversification, improvements in agricultural productivity and
profitability, and stronger regional integration will be necessary for sustaining high growth
and effective poverty reduction. Therefore, the authorities are committed to accelerating the
reform program as envisaged under the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) for
2006 to 2010.
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects for 2006
In 2005, against the backdrop of continued sound macroeconomic policies, strong aid flows
coupled with a favorable external environment, real GDP growth was at a record high of
about 13½ percent. Growth in 2005 was broad based, largely driven by continued high export
growth, healthy tourism receipts, robust construction activity, and strong agriculture
production bolstered by favorable weather conditions and conducive government policies.
Nonetheless, due largely to the impact of higher oil price, inflation rose to 6¾ percent but has
subsequently been contained below 5 percent by the end of April 2006.
Looking ahead, economic prospects continue to be favorable in 2006 and into the medium
term, underpinned by ongoing political stability, active private sector initiatives, progress in

2
reform efforts, and continued aid flows and foreign direct investment. Nevertheless, the
authorities are well aware of risks to the outlook from an avian flu pandemic, high oil
prices, uncertainty in the garment export market, and the weather-dependence of the
agriculture sector. Taking all this into consideration, the authorities are in broad agreement
with the staff’s projection for real GDP growth of 5 percent in 2006, but are of the view that
there is potential upside to the forecast given the continued progress in structural reforms and
prudent macroeconomic policy management.
Fiscal Policy
Fiscal policy continues to remain prudent. In 2005, as indicated by staff, expenditure was
restrained and slower donor project execution led to a decline in the overall deficit to 3½
percent of GDP in 2005 from 4¾ percent in 2004. Revenue collection exceeded the annual
budget projections, but remained low at 10.8 percent of GDP. However, progress has been
made since early 2006 to improve revenue collection, with the authorities working
concertedly towards achieving total revenue of 11.3 percent of GDP for 2006. To improve
revenue collection, measures have been taken to enforce the Law on Taxation, broaden the
tax base on the informal sector, and strengthen the tax audit. Other measures include
reorganizing the tax department, modernizing the customs department, creating a non-tax
revenue department, and upgrading the anti-smuggling plan. In addition, the authorities have
made efforts to ensure that all tax revenue collected must be immediately deposited into the
National Treasury, and to prohibit any tax exemptions beyond the limit allowable under the
Law on Investment. The 2005 Prime Minister Order has also helped initiate a transparent
bidding procedure for future government concession contracts.
On the expenditure side, greater focus will be put on supporting poverty reduction and
achieving the CMDGs. Social spending is projected to be about 1½ percent of GDP in 2006
with more resources being allocated for rural development. Current expenditure is projected
to increase by only about 1¼ percent in order to provide greater resources for capital
spending. In line with the civil service reform program, civil service salaries are projected to
increase but at a gradual pace. The authorities plan to utilize the initial $33.38 million of
freed-up MDRI resources to support the irrigation project in the eastern part of the country.
The authorities are aware of the need to source for concessional financing, and as such, are
actively seeking alternative financing from China and the Asian Development Bank (AsDB)
for infrastructure investment in sectors such as the energy sector, to support growth.
Over the medium-term, the fiscal policy objectives are to enhance revenue performance and
re-orient expenditures to meet pro-poor priority spending. In order to meet these objectives,
the authorities adopted the Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFM), a
comprehensive multi-year reform program, in late 2004. The PFM is designed to upgrade
public finance in order to provide effective support for growth and poverty reduction through
the promotion of good governance. The authorities agree with staff on the need to pay close
attention to measures to improve budget management in the 2007 budget, including the
adoption of the new chart of account and the development of a system for tracking poverty
spending.

3
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy and Financial Sector Reform
With respect to monetary policy, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) has maintained a
prudent monetary policy stance aimed at maintaining price stability. Inflation will be kept
below 5 percent in the near-term and at about 3½ percent over the medium-term. During
2005, broad money and bank deposits had grown by about 16 percent (year-on-year) with an
upward trend continuing into early 2006, reflecting robust economic activity and improved
confidence in the banking system as a result of political stability. Credit to the private sector
grew by about 30 percent but accounts for only around 10 percent of GDP. The low level of
financial intermediation reflects the still inadequate legal framework. Efforts have been made
to address this through the adoption of the law on the Negotiable Instruments and Payment
Systems in 2005. The law provided an important legal framework for the NBC to work
towards developing an effective money-market, inter-bank market and payment system with
the assistance of the IMF and AsDB.
The NBC will continue with the managed float exchange rate policy and no interventions
have been and will be made to target a specific level of exchange rate. Interventions are only
made to limit exchange rate volatility. Despite the growth in bank deposit and lending as
stated above, the share of the local currency, riel, in total bank deposits and lending was as
low as 4 percent and 6 percent respectively reflecting the highly dollarized nature of the
economy. While the Cambodian authorities would like to encourage greater use of the local
currency, they would like to emphasize that they have no intention whatsoever to impose
restrictions on the use of foreign currency. They envisage that greater use of local currency
would develop as an outcome of economic development.
On the financial sector front, bank supervision efforts continue to focus on ensuring a sound
banking system. With the success of the banking system restructuring in 2000–01 the
banking sector has remained relatively stable. The NBC’s capacity in conducting both on-site
and off-site bank supervision has been enhanced. Normally, all banks are subject to at least
one on-site examination every two years, but based on the assessment of the supervisor,
banks can be subjected to more frequent assessments, if deemed prudent. The NBC is aware
of the high concentration and market share in the banking sector of two local banks. These
banks are among the banks that supervisors conduct on-site examinations at least once a year.
The NBC has also met with the Board of Directors of the bank that has not complied with
prudential regulations to discuss measures taken to enhance operational and credit risk
management. With respect to exemptions for large exposure limits, the NBC is fully
cognizant of the associated risks and will grant exemptions only in cases where due diligence
reveals that the loan is fully secured and the risk is fully covered.
The NBC has also issued additional banking regulations to enhance the banking system,
including measures on anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism in
anticipation of the approval of the AML/CFT law. The draft law, with the help of IMF
technical assistance, has been discussed at the inter-ministerial level and is now awaiting
approval by the National Assembly. The draft law also envisages the establishment of the
Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) at the NBC with active participation of related ministries,
including the Council of Ministers, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Interior and the
Ministry of Economy and Finance.

4
Structural Reform
On the structural front, private sector development, competitiveness and trade facilitation are
the main features of reforms in 2005 so as to put in place the necessary conditions to support
greater trade openness following the accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in
2004. With support from the World Bank, the authorities have pressed forward with the trade
facilitation agenda, which is aimed at reducing the cost of doing business, such as reducing
the time and cost incurred for import and export clearance. A number of regulations have
also been issued including the sub-decree on risk management strategy, the sub-decree on the
creation of special economic zones, the Law on Concessions, and the sub-decree for the
amended Law on Investment. Cognizant of the importance of nurturing a vibrant small and
medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector, the government has also launched the Small and
Medium Enterprise Development Framework, which is a blueprint for the development of
the SME sector. Towards this end, the NBC has introduced the Credit Information System
(CIS) and prepared the legal framework for leasing activity to improve SME access to
financing.
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
The authorities have committed to utilizing the freed-up MDRI resources in a transparent,
accountable and efficient manner in order to accelerate poverty reduction towards meeting
the CMDGs. The proceeds from the MDRI will be focused on investment in rural areas since
rural poverty remains high. The government has initiated a three-year project amounting to
$33.38 million of the MDRI proceeds for investment in irrigation projects in the eastern
provinces so as to improve agriculture production and reduce rural poverty in those areas.
Governance
The anti-corruption law is being revised in order to accommodate and comply with
international standards. As suggested by staff, the authorities will ensure that the AntiCorruption Secretariat has an independent status and the requisite financial resources will be
earmarked in the 2007 budget.
Debt Issues
The outstanding debt issues are viewed as the main impediment to economic growth and
poverty reduction. In this regard, the Royal Government of Cambodia is committed to
resolving the outstanding debt issues as soon as possible in order to bring closure to debts of
the Cold War era and pave the way forward for the rebuilding and continued development of
Cambodia. Nevertheless, the debt issue has to be resolved within the constraints of
Cambodia’s financial capacity without compromising efforts in poverty reduction and
achieving the CMDGs. The provision of debt relief to Cambodia under the MDRI
acknowledges the limited financial capacity of the country and its level of poverty as well as
the need to meet the CMDGs. In this regard, the Cambodian authorities urge the major
creditors, especially the United States and the Russian Federation, to seriously consider
Cambodia’s request for concessional terms and to reach a consensus agreement as soon as
possible to allow Cambodia to enter into a new PRGF program to accelerate poverty
eradication efforts. The total debt stock with the United Sates has finally been reconciled

5
after numerous bilateral rounds of verification and adjustments. With regard to debt owed to
the Russian Federation, a few differences still remain after the last meeting in March 2006
between the two parties. In view of the urgent need for a PRGF program to support
development and poverty eradication efforts, the Cambodian authorities urge the Russian
authorities to consider favorably their request for concessional terms for post 1985 debt.
National Strategic Development Plan
The NSDP is a unified national poverty reduction strategy that carries forward the
achievements gained from the implementation of the Government’s 2004 Rectangular
Strategy, the second Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2001-05 and the National
Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2003-05. The NSDP has been formulated through a highly
inclusive process involving wide ranging consultations with all stakeholders within and
outside the government, and as such, presents a true consensus on the priority strategies to be
pursued. The authorities have placed emphasis on the implementation of the focused and
prioritized Public Investment Program (PIP), a three-year rolling program adopted in January
2006, as the key to success for the implementation of the NSDP. The authorities agree with
the staffs’ assessment as stated in the JSAN. The authorities assure the Fund of their strong
ownership of the strategy. In essence, the NSDP provides an overall strategy and common
framework for the government and development partners to align their resources and efforts
for achieving the envisaged goals and the Cambodian authorities hope to work with their
development partners to realize their development goals.
Conclusion
The Cambodian authorities give high priority and importance to a heavy reform agenda and
during the recent Consultative Group meeting in Phnom Penh, the donor community had
welcomed and acknowledged the satisfactory achievements to date. They have agreed to
work in partnership with the authorities to help lift Cambodia out of poverty. The authorities
have successfully maintained a strong and stable macroeconomic environment with a
credible poverty reduction strategy and strong country ownership of policies despite the
absence of an IMF program in place. Against such a backdrop, the Cambodian authorities are
optimistic about a PRGF program in the near future in order to support their ongoing
developmental and reform efforts. The PRGF program is important for Cambodia as it allows
staff to evaluate and assess the progress of reforms, be actively involved in the formulation
and implementation of sound policies, as well as to endorse Cambodia’s achievements. The
program will provide much value added and impetus to the Cambodian reform agenda as
well as development and poverty reduction efforts to achieve the CMDGs. The authorities
therefore hope that Executive Directors will support Cambodia’s request for the PRGF
program.
