KEY ISSUES
The economy is reviving. Output is poised for a modest recovery in 2013 after again
registering disappointing growth in 2012. Maintenance-related outages will continue to
hamper the energy sector, but the non-energy sector should grow around 2½ percent.
Core inflation remains moderate and staff estimates considerable slack in the economy.
Policy should support the economy in the short run. The overall fiscal deficit is
expected to grow to 2½ percent of GDP in fiscal year 2012/13, which provides broadly
appropriate support for growth, along with still-accommodative monetary policy.
Sustainable growth requires reconsidering fiscal policy. Fiscal policy should be
placed in the long-term context of the country’s non-renewable resource endowment.
A gradual path of fiscal adjustment that allows the economy to enjoy the fruits of its
energy sector wealth well into the future is achievable by a combination of revenue
reforms and current spending restraint. In particular, subsidies are on an unsustainable
path, with fuel subsidies particularly difficult to justify. This strategy should create space
to ramp up development spending over time.
Progress in protecting against financial vulnerabilities should be sustained. The
passage of a new Securities Act should be followed by legislative reforms in the
insurance, credit union, and pensions sectors. Key nonbank systemic financial institutions
should be brought within the regulatory perimeter.
Structural reforms are needed to foster a diversified economic base. Achieving a
more diversified base will require investment outside of the energy sector. This will, in
turn, require structural reforms to increase the government’s capacity to implement its
development budget, along with initiatives to improve the country’s competitiveness in
attracting private sector investment.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
The economy is poised for a modest recovery in 2013 after disappointing growth in 2012, while core
inflation should be moderate against a background of still considerable slack in the economy. Fiscal
policy is expected to turn somewhat stimulative and monetary policy should remain accommodative.
The external position is strong and financial institutions appear sound.
1.
The economy again registered
disappointing growth in 2012, hampered by
supply constraints. Real GDP growth was
estimated to be 0.2 percent (Table 1). Energy
output continued to be held back by
maintenance operations. Non-energy output was
severely hampered in the first half of the year by
an industrial dispute in the cement industry that
had broad spillover effects. However, this sector
picked up in the third quarter, registering yearon-year (yoy) growth of 2.2 percent, while retail
sales rose at a relatively strong 9 percent pace in
the same quarter.

Headline inflation rose but core inflation remained moderate. Headline inflation rose to
an average of 9.3 percent for 2012, due to a mid-year spike in food prices. The use of Carli indices

about 5 percent. However, there appears to be
substantial underemployment not captured by the data, as some of the labor force is employed via
social programs that do not provide full-time employment (Box 1).

A Carli index uses arithmetic averages of price changes, a methodology which is not transitive. This means that an
upward price movement in one period that is reversed in the next nonetheless increases measured inflation. The bias
is greater when prices are volatile or exhibit seasonal variations (both of which are prominent features of food prices
in Trinidad and Tobago).

3.
The economy is poised for a modest recovery in 2013, with staff projecting real GDP to
grow 1½ percent. While the energy sector is expected to register only marginal growth due to
further significant maintenance-related outages in the fall, the non-energy sector should grow
around 2½ percent. The main drivers are expected to be finance, distribution, and construction. Staff
estimate that there was considerable slack in the economy in 2012, with non-energy output
remaining some 4 percent below potential. While data limitations put a wide band of uncertainty
around this estimate, negative growth in the non-energy economy in the three years prior to 2012,
as well as relatively quiescent core inflation and slow credit growth, support the assessment that
economic slack is likely to be significant.
4.
The fiscal position realized a deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2011/12
(October–September) from near balance the previous fiscal year. The result was more than
explained by a decline in energy revenues of
10

on the order of 2.9 percent of GDP, and which are
only reflected in the budget to the extent they are cleared in any given year. In addition, there are
ongoing delays in VAT refunds, due largely to cumbersome audit processes. The non-energy
primary balance, a measure of the structural fiscal position, tightened by 0.8 percent of non-energy
GDP, suggesting that fiscal policy was mildly contractionary in FY 2011/12.2
5.
Gross nonfinancial public sector debt is manageable at 39 percent of GDP, of which
external debt is only 7 percent of GDP. The debt increased by some 6 percentage points of GDP
in 2012, but nearly all of that was due to the issuance of bonds to compensate former policyholders
of CLICO, a failed insurance company. It is expected that half of the CLICO debt should be retired in
2013 as policyholders convert the bonds to equity holdings in former CLICO assets currently held by
the government.
6.
Staff projects a deficit of 2½ percent of GDP for FY 2012/13, due primarily to
payments of wage negotiation settlements and a further increase in subsidies and transfers. In
addition, exemptions and zero-ratings on the value added tax (VAT) introduced in the fourth quarter

The non-energy primary balance is defined as the overall balance minus energy revenues and interest payments.

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

of 2012 are likely to reduce revenues by 0.2 percent of GDP. The estimate assumes development
spending achieves the budgeted 4.5 percent of GDP, although such spending has lagged to date
and the development budget is historically underspent. Subsidies were reduced on premium
gasoline with the FY 2012/13 budget in October 2012, but this is thought not to have led to
substantial savings in view of the reported widespread switching by consumers to more heavily
subsidized super gasoline. The FY 2012/13 budget introduced the goal of achieving a balanced
budget over the ensuing four years by reducing the deficit a minimum of 1 percentage point a year,
albeit predicated on a deficit target for this year of 4.6 percent of GDP.
7.
The external current account is estimated to have deteriorated slightly in 2012. The
trade balance was little changed as a drop in energy exports was offset by a concomitant drop in
energy imports, but the services balance deteriorated slightly due to increased dividend outflows.
The capital and financial account moved substantially more into deficit, despite a pickup in foreign
direct investment (FDI), as other private sector capital outflows are estimated to have picked up
sharply. Although little detail is available, this is consistent with the anecdotal view that there were
significant portfolio outflows due to limited domestic investment opportunities and low returns on
local fixed income instruments, combined with rallies in global equity markets.
8.
The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) has done better at adjusting the
amounts auctioned at the de facto stabilized exchange rate, thus avoiding significant queuing.
The CBTT is a key player in the market as it intermediates the foreign exchange paid by energy
companies in royalties and taxes to the government. Previously, uncertainty regarding CBTT sales
had sometimes led to temporary scarcity and queuing. The structure of the foreign exchange regime
is broadly unchanged but the central bank introduced a new wholesale auction system in May 2012
in which part of their sales was auctioned to dealers using competitive bidding. However, dealers
still must sell their foreign exchange within a spread of 1 percent of the noncompetitive rate, so that
both the amounts auctioned and the exchange rate are ultimately administratively determined.3 The
real effective exchange rate appreciated by 4½ percent yoy at end-2012.
9.
Gross official reserves remained strong at US$9.2 billion at end-2012 (equivalent to
12½ months of imports of goods and non-factor services). However, trend accumulation reversed
during the year, with reserves falling by US$700 million from their peak in April 2012. Staff project a
slight further erosion of the current account surplus in 2013 as the recovery in energy exports is
more than offset by higher fuel and non-energy imports. As the economy revives, capital outflows
should abate, helping to contain further losses in reserves. The Heritage and Stabilization Fund (HSF)

financial assets. However, there is no
evidence so far of overheating, with house prices increasing by only a little over 1 percent a year on
average since 2010, and banks reporting that mortgage lending standards have not been eased,
with still relatively conservative loan-to-value and loan service-to-income ratios. With credit demand
still low, the central bank continues to mop up the considerable excess liquidity in the system
through voluntary term deposits, having already reached its legal ceiling on open-market sales of
short term treasury securities. The authorities are also issuing a TT$1 billion long-term government
bond in the second quarter of 2013 to further assist in the domestic absorption of liquidity. The
operation is being undertaken purely for monetary purposes, with the proceeds of the bond being
held in a frozen account at the central bank on behalf of the government.
11.
The financial sector appears sound, but some nonbank Systemically Important
Financial Institutions (SIFIs) remain largely outside the regulatory perimeter. Commercial banks
are liquid, profitable, and well capitalized. Non-performing loan (NPL) rates fell from 6.3 percent in
2011 to 5.4 percent in December 2012, partly through loan restructuring and asset transfers to
nonbank subsidiaries, and banks have increased special provisions on impaired assets from 28 to 40
percent over the 12 months to December 2012. Mortgage NPLs remain low at 0.5 percent as of
September 2012. Non-banks remain well capitalized, but some are relatively lightly supervised.

legislation, passed at the end of 2012, has enhanced the powers of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) to fulfill its multiple mandates of market regulation, promotion, and reducing
systemic risk. Other legislative reforms are pending, notably new laws to modernize insurance
regulation, including by introducing risk-based regulation and supervision, and on bringing credit
unions into the central bank’s regulatory perimeter, both expected for 2013. Laws on pension reform
are expected for 2014. The National Insurance Scheme has adjusted the contribution rates starting
in March 2013 and plans a further adjustment next year. Such adjustments are estimated to extend
the viability of the fund until approximately 2046, according to the latest actuarial review. In
addition, the government will be floating 20 percent of First Citizens Bank, currently 100 percent
government-owned, in 2013. The authorities are also commencing work on a national financial crisis
management plan. On Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
issues, the authorities are preparing to implement revised FATF standards and have established a
cross-ministerial committee to strengthen AML/CFT cooperation. In addition, the authorities should
emphasize effective implementation of their AML/CFT legal and institutional frameworks.
13.
While challenges remain, a final resolution of the problems stemming from the failure
of CLICO (a systemically important insurance company) in 2009 is in sight. The government has
achieved final settlements with most former policyholders, apart from a small number that have
successfully sued the government for full repayment in the high court (the government has
appealed). If the case is not reversed on appeal, the additional cost to the government is expected
to be around TT$300 million (0.2 percent of GDP). Complex negotiations are ongoing with
shareholders to recover value from CLICO’s assets, but it is hoped these will be resolved by midyear, and there are still hopes that most of the costs of the bailout of CLICO can eventually be
recouped.
14.
Progress has been made with respect to a number of policy recommendations from
the 2011 Article IV consultation. The 2012/13 budget statement introduced for the first time a
medium-term target for fiscal consolidation and the authorities are undertaking a review of the nonenergy tax policy regime, with some measures intended to be introduced in the 2013/14 budget.
However, work remains to be done in developing a strategy to smooth consumption over the long
term and spur investment. Significant progress has been made in addressing the challenges
stemming from CLICO’s failure and in implementing some of the 2011 FSSA recommendations,
notably passage of a new securities law. The HSF framework is still under review but is expected to
clarify the HSF’s objectives. Much remains on the structural reform agenda, but the authorities are
focused on taking measures to improve Trinidad and Tobago’s global competitiveness rankings.
Finally, progress on improving the statistical database has been mixed, due to still existing
significant resource constraints on the Central Statistical Office (CSO).

RISKS AND MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
15.
In the near term, risks to the recovery appear slightly to the downside. Energy sector
output, fairly inelastic to price declines in the short term, should be governed primarily by supply
conditions. In this regard, the authorities are partnering with the industry to coordinate maintenance
outages across the upstream and downstream energy sectors to limit the risk of further supply
disruptions from maintenance operations (as has occurred in the past). Should maintenance-related
outages prove more severe than expected, the appropriate policy response would be to buffer the
budgetary and economic impact by following the rules that would dictate lower contributions to the
HSF. There are downside risks to non-energy sector growth should development spending be
under-executed. While domestic financial institutions appear sound, there have been some adverse
financial developments in the Caribbean region that should be carefully monitored, along with
potential channels of contagion to the domestic financial system, which could come through direct
ownership links between regional and Trinidad and Tobago institutions, including in the insurance
sector, or through portfolio losses for Trinidad and Tobago institutions from claims on regional
institutions. Funding links with the region appear likely to be limited. Information on the extent and
incidence of exposures, including for nonbank financial institutions, is scarce, however. Possible
contagion from the trade channel would be small.
16.
Although a sharp decline in international energy prices would likely have little shortterm effect on output, the fiscal position and external reserves would suffer, although the
budget is based on quite conservative assumptions about energy prices. Staff estimate that a
gradual decline in energy prices of 30 percent from their 2012 level until 2015 would result in a fiscal
deterioration of 3.8 percent of GDP during the period vis-à-vis the passive scenario, while net
international reserves (NIR) would fall by more than US$0.6 billion by 2015 compared to the
baseline.5 A modified, more extended shock scenario that prolongs the lower 2015 prices until 2018
would further weaken the fiscal stance, leading to higher public debt by about 10 percentage points
of GDP, while the current account surplus would be about half that of the baseline in 2018.
17.
Over the medium term, potential growth will depend on investment and structural
reforms. Energy sector output, which comprises some 45 percent of economic activity, should
continue to recover as natural gas production returns back to near the previous peak levels of 2010,
although oil production, barring significant new discoveries, should continue to face a gradual
natural decline as reserves are exhausted. The country has so far successfully navigated the
challenge of the shale gas revolution, which has depressed natural gas prices in the United States,
by finding other, still lucrative markets for its liquefied natural gas. In addition, a number of
developments presage increased future exploration and production activity in the energy sector.6
5

Such a drop would be consistent with a 68 percent confidence interval of baseline WEO projections, as derived from
futures prices on Mar 12, 2013.
6

Following a prolonged period when no new blocks were allocated for exploration, a successful deepwater bid round
was conducted in September 2012 and two more rounds are expected in 2013, one for land acreage and the other
for deepwater exploration. New investment generated from the 2013 prospective rounds would materialize in the

Potential output in the non-energy sector will depend on effectively implementing public
investment plans, itself dependent on improving the public sector’s implementation capacity, and
improving the climate for private sector entrepreneurship and capital formation.

In the short term, allow the rules that would curtail

However, should it appear the shock may not be
temporary, the authorities should be prepared to
frontload fiscal adjustments. Over the medium
term, there remains a need to diversify the
economic base by structural reforms and investment
outside the energy sector.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
After several years of sub-par growth, the economy is expected to recover in 2013–14. Macroeconomic
policy should remain supportive of this recovery in the near term. For the long run, it will be critical to
take decisions now to ensure that the fruits of the country’s non-renewable resource endowment can
be shared across future generations, as well as more equitably across current generations. This will
require putting fiscal policy in the appropriate long-term context, returning to fiscal surpluses while
tilting spending towards investment and ensuring current spending is targeted more towards
benefiting the most vulnerable segments of society. There is also ample scope to reform the
government’s non-energy revenue regime. The accommodative monetary policy stance remains
appropriate to support the recovery of credit. Critically, even as growth revives, unlocking Trinidad and
Tobago’s full potential will require a wide variety of structural reforms to increase economic efficiency.
Fiscal policy should support activity amid a reengineering of the composition of spending
18.
The mission suggested that the fiscal stance for this year should continue to aim to
support economic activity in view of the slack in the economy. There is space for such a
supportive stance given still relatively manageable levels of public sector debt and moderate core
inflation. Staff estimates that current policies should result in an overall deficit of around 2½ percent
of GDP for FY 2012/13 (which ends September 30, 2013), which appears broadly appropriate. That
said, given the role of supply constraints and structural challenges in limiting economic potential,
the authorities will need to be alert to the risk that demand stimulus could result in higher inflation
or imports.
19.
There is an urgent need to reengineer the composition of spending. Subsidies and
transfers are on an unsustainable path, eating up a rapidly growing share of total spending, from
45 percent in FY 2007/08 to 53 percent in FY 2012/13 (Box 3). While some subsidies and transfers
can be justified as improving equity or fostering positive externalities, others are poorly targeted at
rich and poor alike and some may impose negative externalities. Of particular concern are costly fuel
subsidies, which disproportionately benefit the wealthy and contribute to severe road congestion
that is materially harming productivity.7 In addition, the authorities and private sector participants
noted they believe employment programs may be providing disincentives to seek more productive
employment. Other subsidy and transfer programs should also be evaluated against the criteria of
whether they help to provide “public goods” and/or improve income distribution.
20.
The authorities agreed that subsidies and transfers needed to be reined in, but
cautioned that this would be done over time to ease adjustment costs. The authorities
expressed concern that overly rapid removal of fuel subsidies risked increasing inflation
expectations, and it would be better to remove them over a medium-term horizon to minimize this
7

The fuel subsidy is partially covered by a special levy of four percent on the value of crude oil produced by large
producers. In FY 2011/12, less than one fifth of the total bill was paid for with proceeds from the special levy.

risk. In addition, they pointed to their development of a national strategy of encouraging conversion
of motor vehicles to the use of compressed natural gas (CNG), which, if successful, would, over time,
reduce the cost of fuel subsidies, which are granted only on petroleum-based fuels. Staff noted that
removing fuel subsidies would withdraw demand and make sustaining excessive price increases
difficult, and would be a particularly effective incentive to encourage the shift towards use of CNG.
21.
There is scope to ramp up development spending over time. The main priorities are for
the development of infrastructure including ports, roads, and telecommunications, as well as
building human capital through improvements to health and education. However, this will need to
be done in parallel with structural reforms aimed at increasing the government’s capacity to
implement projects. The authorities noted that they intend to pursue increased use of Public-Private
Partnerships (PPP) to help overcome capacity constraints on development spending. Staff welcomed
this, but cautioned that the government should adhere to international best practices, including by
adopting a sound legal and institutional framework to contain fiscal risk (Box 4).

There is substantial scope to improve the efficiency and incidence of revenue
collection in the non-energy sector. A range of options is available. Given current inefficiencies in
the tax regime, it should be possible to take measures aimed at increasing total revenues through
broadening tax bases and increasing targeted tax rates, while also increasing the efficiency and
progressivity of the tax system. Capitalizing on recommendations provided by recent Fund technical
assistance, the authorities noted they are preparing a package of tax reforms that they intend to
introduce as part of the FY 2013/14 budget. Once policy reforms have been introduced, the

authorities intend to focus on improving the efficiency of tax administration, including through the
introduction of electronic filing mechanisms and enhanced compliance controls.
Over the longer term, fiscal policy should aim to save more resource wealth
23.
The medium-term goal laid out in the budget statement of improving the fiscal
balance by a minimum of one percent of GDP a year, starting in FY 2013/14, is appropriate.
However, the authorities have not yet announced a specific set of policies to achieve this goal, and
on current policies, the fiscal balance and debt ratios would continue to worsen over time,
reinforcing the need for fiscal adjustment. Starting from the staff’s estimated fiscal deficit for
FY 2012/13 of 2½ percent of GDP, passive baseline policies would lead to an overall deficit of
4½ percent of GDP by 2018. An active scenario that pursues an adjustment of roughly 1 percent a
year on average relative to the baseline would lead to fiscal balance by the end of the period. In
addition, assuming that growth revives on the timetable envisaged, it would be cyclically
appropriate to begin on this adjustment path in FY 2013/14 (although countercyclical stimulus
would still be warranted should the recovery be delayed). Moreover, it is achievable, even while
gradually ramping up spending on public investment, given the scope for increasing non-energy
sector revenues and reducing subsidies and transfers. Should downside risks on energy prices
materialize, in the first instance, the HSF would serve as a buffer as the rules would lead to
contributions being curtailed or eliminated if energy prices are lower than projected. However, the
authorities should also be prepared to frontload the fiscal adjustment (thereby delivering a larger
total fiscal adjustment in net present value terms) should it appear that a downside energy price
shock may not be temporary.

However, fiscal policy needs to be placed in a longer-term context that takes into
account the country’s non-renewable resource endowment. The long-term fiscal path will be the
most critical element in determining how that endowment is used to secure the long-run prosperity
of the country. A strategy should be developed to optimize the use of that endowment over its
expected lifetime. Fiscal rules (broader than those adopted for the HSF) should be adopted to
safeguard the implementation of the strategy against political pressures and shield the country
against temporary fluctuations in energy sector prices. They should also be flexible enough to take
into account new energy reserves that may be discovered over time, which could serve to temper
the pace of fiscal adjustment.
25.
Staff developed an illustrative long-term active fiscal path, drawing on the Fund’s
recent work on macroeconomic frameworks for resource-rich developing countries.8 The main
policy elements in that path are a tax reform

the VAT that rationalizes exemptions without a
rate increase, a phased in property tax reform, and a revision of the personal and corporate income
taxes to make them more progressive and modern, while also simplifying the schemes by
eliminating multiple exemptions and deductions accumulated over time.
A preliminary analysis suggests that this policy path, which would cut the non-energy fiscal deficit
from 18½ percent of GDP now to 11 percent by 2020 (an average adjustment of a little over
1 percent of GDP per year) would smooth fiscal consolidation over 40 years and put the debt/GDP
ratio on a declining path. Adjustment paths that would allow energy sector wealth to be consumed
through 2070, or even, in a more extreme case, through perpetuity, would require stronger fiscal
efforts. While such fiscal effort will require careful planning and persistence, the sustainable levels of
non-energy deficits are within reach, as they were the norm in Trinidad and Tobago a decade ago
before the significant current spending expansion that took place in the mid-to-late 2000s (the
average non-energy deficit during 2000–05 was 7½ percent of GDP). The authorities generally
agreed with the staff’s proposed long-term fiscal approach.
26.
As recommended in previous Article IV consultations, staff advocated placing the rules
for contributing to the HSF in the context of a broader strategy to manage the long-run
8

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

sovereign balance sheet. The practice of placing all investments abroad remains appropriate for
insulating the non-energy economy from a loss of competitiveness that would ensue if too much
energy sector wealth was injected into the domestic economy. Similarly, the relatively conservative
portfolio management practices of the HSF are important to protect the vessel of the country’s
savings. The HSF governance structure compares well to international best practices for Sovereign
Wealth Funds (SWFs), set forth in the Santiago principles, especially on transparency and
accountability.9 However, staff suggested that, in the medium term, sustained transfers into the HSF
should be conditioned on a return to fiscal surpluses within the same fiscal year. While the “habit of
saving” embedded in the current HSF contribution rules has merit, such a policy reform would
ensure net wealth is increasing, rather than leading the government to borrow to save. In addition,
the risk of overly large withdrawals could be contained by reducing the maximum withdrawal rule
and raising the minimum balance. The authorities believe that the current rules are appropriate,
given their view that the purpose of the HSF should be to save a portion of the earnings from
energy exports. They also noted that they were giving consideration to whether to emphasize more
the savings (heritage) aspect of the HSF, as has been the practice to date, and possibly to carry out
the already authorized stabilization aspect via a separate entity.10
Monetary policy should be accommodative for the present as financial reforms continue
27.
Monetary policy should remain accommodative for the present in order to support the
nascent recovery. However, low interest rates may be contributing to portfolio outflows (combined
with a lack of confidence in the local economy) and spurring purchases of interest-rate sensitive
goods (automobiles and housing). Thus, staff noted that the CBTT should closely monitor a range of
indicators, including credit growth, excess liquidity, real estate prices and (to the extent possible)
portfolio outflows in order to assess the timing of a future tightening of the policy rate. The impact
of monetary policy on credit currently appears limited with the effectiveness of the monetary
transmission mechanism curtailed by banks’ ample excess liquidity. The CBTT will need to continue
to absorb such liquidity, though consideration could be given to more market-based forms of
absorption, such as auctioning off special deposits rather than providing them at a fixed rate. These
would provide the CBTT with improved market signals and may also be less costly. The authorities
agreed with the recommended stance, noted that substantial liquidity absorption would be needed
for the time being and that they had reactivated a liquidity management committee to better
forecast liquidity developments.
28.
The authorities noted that progress towards passage of needed financial legislation
was on track. In addition, the authorities noted that they are continuing to improve the conduct of
bank stress testing, with the help of Fund technical assistance, and are also working to bring key
SIFIs within the perimeter of regulation and supervision. In addition, to forestall potential risks

The stabilization element of the HSF, if used, would be aimed at better insulating the budget against fluctuations

related to financial contagion, the authorities should work expeditiously to develop their national
financial crisis management plan, as well as collect more detailed information on the potential
channels of contagion, including via a better understanding of links between Trinidad and Tobago
financial institutions and the region.
29.
The adequacy and timing of central bank sales of foreign exchange appear to have
improved and discussions with market participants suggest that the queuing experienced at
the end of 2010 has abated. The introduction of a central bank auction system to allocate some of
the central bank’s foreign exchange to banks has introduced a modicum of flexibility into the
wholesale allocation system. However, the central bank still determines the allocated amount
administratively while determining the exchange rate paid by the dealers’ end customers within
narrow limits, so that foreign exchange is not allocated in a true market clearing fashion, suggesting
queuing could arise again. The improved supply of foreign exchange to the market has entailed a
modest decline in the level of reserves in the last 8 months, though the level remains strong. The
system could be gradually made more market-based, via an increased private sector role, to deliver
to dealers the total amount of foreign exchange demanded. This would obviate the need for
strategic bidding for excess reserves, which may be obscuring demand signals. Staff reiterated the
recommendation of the previous Article IV consultation that over the medium term, allowing the
exchange rate to fluctuate within a wider band through higher bid-ask spreads could allow pricing
to play a bigger role in equilibrating the market. Authorities indicated that they are not
contemplating changes to this system at present.
30.
While the exchange rate still appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals, there
are early indications that might suggest the non-energy sector of the economy has become
less competitive (Box 5). The real effective exchange rate appreciated through the year, although it
remains within the 95 percent confidence interval of the estimated equilibrium level for 2012. The
macroeconomic balance approach also suggests the rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
However, the external sustainability methodology does find some degree of overvaluation, reflecting
a need for additional savings of energy income to improve intergenerational equity, that is, to
ensure that the current generation does not receive a disproportional share of the net present value
of the country’s natural resource wealth. Moreover, the modest drop in reserves and a second year
of deterioration in the non-energy current account may suggest a loss of competitiveness at the
margins.
Structural reforms will be required to unlock the economy’s potential
31.
The potential for Trinidad and Tobago to diversify its economy and enhance growth
prospects will depend critically on undertaking much-needed structural reforms. In particular,
the ability to invest in productive capital and infrastructure is constrained by inefficiencies in the
public service and by bureaucratic impediments to private investment in the non-energy sector.
Alleviating these constraints will be critical to preparing the economy for a future in which it will be
less able to rely on energy resources as its primary economic base. In particular, while investment in
the energy sector is undertaken by the private sector, public investment should focus on building up
the capacity of the non-energy economy in order to foster economic diversification.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

32.
The public service is beset by severe challenges in hiring and retaining qualified staff.
Many senior public servants have not been confirmed in new positions in which they have served for
years, and too many functions are carried out by staff on short-term contracts. This has caused low
morale, excessive turnover, and a loss of institutional memory. Consequently, the public service is
unable to carry out many critical functions accurately and expeditiously. Increasing public and
private sector investment will thus require a thoroughgoing rethink of the public service. Among
other things, staffing processes and institutions need to be modernized. In addition, streamlining is
needed to help reverse a proliferation of overlapping sets of institutions and programs, and in many
cases a lack of coordination and clear reporting lines. The authorities broadly concurred with the
analysis and noted that they have established a working group to transform the public service, in
particular, to improve staff recruitment practices.
33.
There are also significant impediments to private sector entrepreneurship and
investment, as recently highlighted by the World Bank’s Doing Business Survey. Some of these
impediments are themselves the result of the inefficiencies noted in the public service. In addition, it
will be critical to address the high level of crime and perceptions of a lack of transparency to help
encourage investment. Passage of a best-practice procurement law could thus help foster business
formation and diversification. The authorities place high priority on improving their rankings, and
noted that initiatives are underway to streamline administrative procedures for corporate
registration and construction permits, and to improve information sharing among relevant agencies
to speed up customs clearance.
34.
Staff welcomed the recent passage of the new Securities Act and encouraged timely
adoption of other critical financial sector legislation, including the new Insurance Act. The
securities legislation provides authority to the SEC to fulfill its mandate to minimize systemic risk. A
risk-based capital regime should be introduced for the securities sector expeditiously. Special focus
should be placed on SIFIs, in line with new thinking on international best practice. The government
should also give priority to introduction of appropriate insolvency frameworks, including corporate
bankruptcy and bank resolution legislation. The authorities fully agreed and noted that they were on
track for introducing key elements of financial sector legislation, including in the insurance sector,
credit union supervision, and pension reform. They noted, however, that the pension system will be
challenged by demographic developments, as the dependency ratio is projected to increase over
time.
35.
Although data are broadly adequate for surveillance, progress on improving the
statistical database has been mixed. Shortcomings persist in the timely delivery and quality of
macroeconomic data. For example, there have been repeated delays in the introduction of improved
CPI and GDP methodologies, trade data are delayed over a year while the Automated System for
Customs Data (ASYCUDA) system is introduced in customs, and labor market data are delayed and
fail to capture underemployment. These shortcomings largely reflect resource and capacity
constraints in the national statistical office, and staff encouraged a rapid resolution of these
problems. In addition, there are major gaps in the understanding of portfolio flows. The central bank
is, however, upgrading its compilation system for balance of payments and international investment

position (IIP) data with a view to subscribing to the Special Data Dissemination Standard. The
authorities agreed that improvements in statistics are urgently needed.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Trinidad and Tobago appears to be turning a corner as growth revives. There are
already signs of a nascent recovery in the non-energy sector, while in the energy sector there is light
at the end of the tunnel as significant maintenance operations should wind down in 2013. There
appears to remain scope for accommodative macroeconomic policy for the short term, until a
revival of growth is firmly entrenched. In this respect, the main downside risks to near-term
prospects appear to be primarily external, including declines in commodity prices, or a global
downturn that could slow demand for Trinidad and Tobago petrochemical products.
37.
The authorities should expeditiously turn toward the challenges of managing an
economy that has benefited from a rich, but non-renewable resource base. This will require
putting fiscal policy in a long-term context, saving for future generations while improving equity by
better targeting of current expenditures towards the most vulnerable segments of society. In
addition, greater public investment as well as structural reforms will be needed to unlock the
country’s economic potential and foster diversification beyond the relatively narrow resource base
on which the country’s prosperity is currently based.
38.
The broad fiscal stance appears appropriately supportive, but the authorities should
be alert to the risk that stimulative policy could result in higher inflation or imports, and the
composition of spending is excessively tilted towards current consumption. Subsidies and
transfers continue to claim a high and rising share of expenditure, and remain very broadly targeted.
Fuel subsidies, in particular, are difficult to justify in view of their budgetary cost, regressivity, and
contribution to traffic congestion. The authorities should commit to a firm program of removing the
fuel subsidies over time, drawing on the increasing store of global experience in this area.11 They
should also take stock of, and rationalize, the panoply of employment support programs, some of
which overlap and may be undermining labor force competitiveness and contributing to
underemployment. There is also ample scope to improve the efficiency and buoyancy of revenue
collection, and the authorities should take advantage of the opportunity provided by the
forthcoming budget to introduce revenue measures that will broaden the revenue base and improve
the progressivity of the system. Finally, the authorities should work to reduce the outstanding stock
of arrears, notably on energy subsidies, in order to increase transparency and improve the
predictability of cash flows for businesses and households.
39.
The authorities have taken a welcome step by introducing a medium-term target for
fiscal consolidation in the 2012/13 budget. They should move now towards identifying measures
to achieve those targets, and designing a fiscal framework that more systematically takes into
11

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

account intergenerational equity. This will require setting clear and firm targets for long-term fiscal
policy, on a time-scale that extends the benefits of current natural resource wealth to future
generations. In addition, the HSF should be managed as part of an integrated national balance
sheet, with rules that ensure contributions are made out of real savings, rather than from
borrowings. The authorities should also begin now to put in place expenditure and revenue
measures to, over the long term, encourage a more diversified economic base while better
protecting the most vulnerable segments of society. Consideration should also be given to adopting
fiscal rules, including possibly a fiscal responsibility law, to protect such a framework against future
political pressures.
40.
Accommodative monetary policy remains appropriate as the economy regains its
footing and given quiescent core inflation, although it will be necessary for some time to absorb
substantial amounts of liquidity. Nonetheless, the authorities will need to monitor potential signs of
unwanted side effects of such policy, including portfolio outflows and excessive credit to the real
estate sector, though to date, there appears to be relatively little cause for concern.
41.
The de facto stabilized exchange rate regime has served the economy well and the
improved calibration of foreign exchange sales by the central bank has avoided queuing.
Nonetheless, the central bank still determines the quantities auctioned off administratively, and
could consider a greater role for the market in clearing the foreign exchange market.
42.
There has been welcome progress in modernizing financial regulation and the
authorities should continue to push ahead with additional reforms in the pipeline. Particular
priority should be placed on passing insurance legislation and bringing non-bank SIFIs into the
regulatory perimeter.
43.
Structural reforms need to be at the core of actions to increase Trinidad and Tobago’s
competitiveness. Such reforms are needed to lay the groundwork for both the public and private
sector investment that will be needed to develop the non-energy sector as a key partner in the
economy. Given the need for a more effective public service to implement the public sector
investment program, great priority should be accorded to modernizing and rationalizing hiring
practices and streamlining overlapping institutions and programs. The mission welcomes the
initiatives to improve the country’s competitiveness rankings, and calls for consideration to be given
to implementing best-practice legislation in public procurement, to enhance transparency and
competition, and insolvency frameworks to provide structured and orderly market exits.
44.
Particular urgency should be given to improving the quality and timeliness of
statistics. In some areas, timeliness has regressed as resources of the CSO have been diverted
towards conducting the 2011 census. A plan to improve the functioning of the CSO, developed with
the assistance of the Swedish statistical authority, could form the basis of a reform.
45.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Temporary government employment programs have
buffered the unemployment rate from the economic volatility of recent years. The government has
introduced various employment support and training programs under the Social Sector Investment Program (SSIP)
to reduce high unemployment. The two largest programs are the Unemployment Relief Program (URP)
(introduced in 1992) and the Community Environment Protection and Enhancement Program (CEPEP) (introduced
in 2002), which provide unskilled or semi-skilled people with temporary jobs at wages exceeding the minimum
1
wage. URP provides 3 consecutive two-week jobs and allows re-registration after a three month break. CEPEP jobs

Box 2. Trinidad and Tobago: Implementation of Key FSSA Recommendations
and Other Financial Reforms
The authorities have continued progress on the implementation of the 2011 FSSA’s main recommendations,
particularly with regards to the resolution of the CLICO crisis, where the vast majority of former policyholders have
now been compensated. Supervisory reforms already in place include: semiannual stress testing for commercial
banks, currently being enhanced with support from CARTAC; a new system of administrative fines for regulatory
violations; and a program to enhance supervisors’ technical skills through special advisors and technical assistance.
Areas where new regulation and practices are in progress but not completed include: consolidated supervision;
elaboration of a national financial crisis management plan; and a financial institutions’ resolution framework. More
attention may be required to improve liquidity risk standards and bank information disclosure, and
implementation of legislative reforms, once they are passed.
With respect to structural reforms recommended in the FSSA:


Regulatory Perimeter of the CBTT. The authorities expect to address this recommendation under a new
SIFI framework to be prepared in line with international standards. It is expected that the CBTT will
increase its scope of supervision to include systemically important nonbank financial institutions.



Insurance. A revised version of the insurance bill proposed in 2011 is expected to be tabled before
Parliament in 2013. The new law includes key features of Solvency II, including new rules for valuation of
liabilities, risk-based capital, and the phasing out of statutory funds. The project has wide support and the
CBTT has already implemented an actuarial unit to improve its supervision capacity. In addition,
supervisors have started a pilot project of stress testing for insurers.



Credit Unions. A draft bill bringing credit unions under the regulation and supervision of the central
bank has been proposed but has not yet reached Parliament. The bill includes the creation of a deposit
insurance-type scheme.

In addition to reforms stemming from FSSA recommendations, there has been progress in other areas:


Securities Act. A new securities law enacted at end-2012 has enhanced the powers of the Exchange
Commission (SEC) to fulfill its multiple mandates of market regulation, promotion, and reducing systemic
risk. The act also focuses on the protection of individual investors from unfair, improper and fraudulent
practices, and aims at increasing the efficiency of securities markets.



Pension Bill. A bill to regulate private employers’ pension plans is also under preparation.

possibility of running such intra-public sector arrears makes the total cost of the fuel subsidy less transparent

The fuel subsidy is regressive. A blanket subsidy on fuel prices leads to higher income brackets of the population
receiving a more than proportional share of the subsidy. A recent estimate is that almost 45 percent of direct and
indirect benefits of the subsidy are enjoyed by the richest segment of the population, compared with 4 percent going
to the poorest. By proportion of income, the subsidy is estimated to be equivalent to almost 8 percent of the income

Box 4. Public-Private Partnerships: Best Practices and Lessons for Trinidad and Tobago
The 2012/13 budget announced government plans to promote Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to
support infrastructure development and service delivery. As part of efforts to alleviate infrastructure
bottlenecks, the government seeks to partner with the private sector, which is expected to design-build-financeoperate-and maintain capital assets according to the government’s specifications. The budget outlined several
projects in various sectors of the economy to which PPPs could apply, possibly commencing this year.
With technical assistance from the IDB, the government is building capacity to design and implement PPP
projects. In 2011, the IDB approved a grant of US$0.9 million for an ongoing program, which aims to strengthen
the government’s capacity to select, structure, negotiate, and manage PPPs using two pilot projects. A cabinetapproved national PPP policy and governance framework in 2012 created a 9-member Ministerial Committee
chaired by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), a PPP Unit, an execution team, and a contract management team. The
PPP Unit is headed by a coordinator but has yet to be fully staffed. There is draft public procurement legislation,
which is being proposed to replace the outdated Central Tenders Board (CTB) Act.
International best practice suggests the following elements are critical to success:


1

PPP projects should be integrated into the budget cycle and the medium-term fiscal and debt
sustainability frameworks. This ensures that PPP projects compete with other projects for limited
budgetary resources on a level playing field. In this way, only those projects that are fiscally affordable and
do not jeopardize fiscal sustainability would go through, regardless of how they are procured
(i.e., traditional public procurement or PPP).



A sound legal and regulatory framework is needed. This would include a legal framework that covers
all aspects of the PPP process. In practice, many countries have legislation on public procurement, PPPs,
and fiscal responsibility. In the absence of such legislation, it is advisable to consolidate all applicable laws
and principles relating to PPPs. The legal framework should be supported by effective dispute resolution
mechanisms. The aim is to reduce the high transaction costs typically associated with PPP projects.



General principles for risk-sharing arrangements in the context of PPPs should be stated in the
legal framework. Based on such general principles, PPP contracts should detail specific risk-sharing
arrangements between public and private partners. As a long-term and often complex agreement
between the government and a private partner, PPPs are prone to uncertainties and entail a range of
risks––political, construction, financial, demand, environmental, etc. Clarity about each party’s exposure to
the different risks would be critical in determining and managing firmed and contingent obligations.



Quality public institutions, including a dedicated PPP unit in the MOF with sufficient institutional
capacity, are needed to facilitate solid investment analysis and management. In particular, managing
fiscal risks requires a sufficiently strong institutional framework to deliver public services efficiently and to
avoid impediments to private investment. PPPs require a coherent approach with a clear allocation of
responsibilities between the MOF and line ministries. A PPP Unit within the MOF with financial, legal,
economic, and project management skills should coordinate and manage the process, including by
putting in place a system to assess whether a project is affordable, represents best value for money (VfM),
and does not jeopardize fiscal sustainability.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

Box 4. Public-Private Partnerships: Best Practices and Lessons for Trinidad and Tobago (continued)


The ministry of finance should retain gate-keeping functions. A system of gateways are measures put
in place that empower the MOF to give approval at specific stages of the PPP process, and to stop any
project that does not satisfy the VfM and affordability criteria. The PPP unit could be helpful in ensuring
that gateways are followed.



Limiting fiscal risk is critical. Country experiences suggest that a challenge for PPPs is not only failure to
account for and report past transactions appropriately, but fully recording and disclosing future firmed or
contingent financial obligations. In this regard, adopting the International Public Sector Accounting
2
Standards (IPSAS) is highly recommended. To contain fiscal risk, government could impose ceilings on its

exposure to PPP operations, including contingent liabilities.


Political commitment and public support is essential. All stakeholders should be aware of the relative
costs, benefits, and risks associated with PPPs.

Box 5. External Stability Assessment
This box assesses the external sector competitiveness of Trinidad and Tobago using CGER methodologies tailored to
energy exporting countries. Estimates from the equilibrium real exchange rate and the macroeconomic balance
approaches indicate that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. The external sustainability approach,
which reflects the temporary nature of non-renewable energy income, suggests a need to further increase already
relatively high current account surpluses in the medium term to offset
the eventual decline in energy income.

The real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by
4.5 percent (y/y) at end-2012. A mid-year spike was caused by a
sharp and temporary rise in food price inflation, although that was
exaggerated by a methodology that overestimates food price
inflation.

the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. In this
approach, the current account norm is computed based on the

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks. Figures in the
boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being presented. Ten-year
historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the information is used to project
debt dynamics five years ahead.
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2010, with real
depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic
inflation (based on GDP deflator).

The World Bank’s last Country Assistance Strategy for Trinidad and Tobago was discussed at the Board
in 1999 and covered the period 1999–2001. The current World Bank program includes a reimbursable
advisory services program with five components and a program of non-lending technical assistance. The
trust fund supporting the Nariva ecosystem restoration and carbon sequestration ended in December
2011.
Reimbursable Advisory Services
Reimbursable Advisory Services Program: The RAS agreement with the Government of Trinidad and
Tobago covers five areas: (i) Pension Systems Harmonization; (ii) Public Debt and Cash Management; (iii)
Doing Business Reform; (iv) Investment Promotion Special Economic Zones; and (v) Broadband Strategy.
Discussions between the Bank and the Government were initiated during the Annual Meetings of 2009.
Since then, the Government has also asked the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to look at
improving the environment for public-private partnerships. This work to be carried out by the World Bank
Group could serve as a model for other countries as the areas covered are necessary for improving
government performance and sustainable and equitable growth.
Technical Assistance
Nariva Ecosystem Restoration and Carbon Sequestration: The program supported an ongoing project
in Trinidad and Tobago which is funded under the World Bank’s BioCarbon Fund (BioCF). The
development objective was to contribute to efforts to restore and conserve the Nariva wetlands on the
eastern shore of Trinidad, through the recognition of the services it provides as a carbon sink and a
biodiverse ecosystem. This objective was achieved through actions designed to restore and conserve
about 1160 hectares of its associated forest stands. The Bank’s support to this project in Trinidad and
Tobago under this Trust Fund was for US$50,000.
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes - Accounting and Auditing (ROSC): In September
2010, the Bank encouraged Trinidad and Tobago to carry out a ROSC. The study would be highly
beneficial for the development of accounting and auditing standards in the private sector, State-Owned
Enterprises and also the financial sector. A coordinator was appointed in the ministry of finance to liaise
with the World Bank’s ROSC team.
Supporting Economic Management in the Caribbean (SEMCAR): A CIDA financed program
coordinated by the Bank, focuses on identifying the key changes in institutional reforms, improvements
in business processes and actual work practices that need to take place in tax, customs, and PFM areas.
The first phase (April 2011–December 2013) covers 3 years at a budget of US$18.3 million. Trinidad and
Tobago is one of the first countries in the region to benefit from this program.

Entrepreneurship Program for Innovation in the Caribbean (EPIC): InfoDev in partnership with CIDA
in 2010 launched a regional program to create and grow MSMEs across the region amidst persistent
market challenges. Trinidad and Tobago has been selected as one of the countries to benefit from this
initiative, which will continue through 2018. A total of US$19 million is being set aside for this project,
which will aid in start up, upgrading skills and providing seed funding to promising MSMEs.
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI): At the International EITI conference in Paris on
March 2, 2011, Trinidad and Tobago was officially granted candidate status for EITI. The Ministry of
Energy & Energy Affairs (MEEA) publicly confirmed the Government's commitment to EITI and committed
to making Trinidad and Tobago's energy sector one of the most transparent in the world, as well as to
work closely with civil society.
Partnership for Private Sector Development (PPSD): This program is estimated to run from 2008
through 2013, with the objective being to increase access to financial services to undeserved MSMEs,
promote regulatory simplification as an aid to private sector development and catalyzes PS participation
and investment in transport, power, water, and communication infrastructure. This is being financed by
CIDA with the IFC as the trustee.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK (IDB)
(As of March 2013)
Financing
The IDB approved the new Country Strategy with Trinidad and Tobago in November 2011. This strategy is
the reflection of the enhanced relationship with the county and envisages a financial envelope for 2011–
2015 for around US$1.6 billion.1 The 2010 approvals represented a substantial increase from the previous
years, implying significant positive cash flow in 2010–2011. While there was an increase in disbursements
of investment loans, there were no policy-based loans in 2012, thus resulting in a negative net cash flow.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
While data coverage is broadly adequate for surveillance, important shortcomings persist in terms of the
timely delivery and quality of most macroeconomic data, including national accounts, prices, external
sector, labor market, and non-banking financial institutions. This situation largely reflects resource and
capacity constraints in the national statistical office. Technical Assistance from headquarters and CARTAC
is helping address these issues. Trinidad and Tobago has indicated its intention to work towards
subscription to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). One of the key issues impeding
subscription to the SDDS is the unavailability of current/constant price Gross Domestic Product estimates
on a quarterly basis (QGDP). In addition, improvements need to be made in external sector statistics to
meet SDDS requirements. The institutional framework also needs to be revised to facilitate the
compilation, reporting, and collaboration among the Central Bank, the Central Statistical Office (CSO),
and the Ministry of Finance (MoF).
Real sector statistics
In recent years, the CSO has improved the estimation of the national accounts by upgrading the coverage
of production of the large gas sector and the estimation of the value added of the services sectors. The
methodology to estimate inflation has been revised with technical assistance from CARTAC. The new
method corrects flaws that created a significant upward bias, primarily in the food component.
Implementation of the improved methodology commenced mid-2012. Further work is needed to revise
the producer price index to meet international standards. There is also a need to review the calculation of
the GDP deflator, which also may be subject to measurement issues. Compilation of the expenditure side
of GDP as well as current/constant price GDP estimates on a quarterly basis (QGDP) should receive
attention in coming years.
Government finance statistics
The MoF compiles fiscal data using a national classification system for government transactions and debt
of the central government. The compilation follows the GFSM 2001 methodology on a cash basis. Data
on public enterprises and statutory bodies are compiled and published once a year. These data are
compiled by three different divisions of the MoF and are subject to differences among them, particularly
with respect to transfers.
Monetary and financial statistics
The monthly monetary accounts for other depository corporations (ODCs) currently covers only financial
institutions that are licensed by the central bank under the 1993 Financial Institutions Act. ODCs not
licensed only report voluntarily on a quarterly basis. No data are reported by credit

unions. The lack of these data has prevented the compilation of a more comprehensive Depository
Corporation Survey. The authorities should also consider developing systems for reporting balance sheet
accounts for the mutual funds, with a view to compiling a comprehensive financial survey. Trinidad and
Tobago has made progress but has not yet migrated to the standardized report forms (SRFs) for the
submission of monetary statistics.
External sector statistics
Quarterly aggregate balance of payments estimates and annual balance of payments data are
disseminated by the central bank in its national publications. Annual balance of payments data are also
sent to STA, although with considerable delay. In recent times, TA missions in balance of payments
statistics have provided assistance on the compilation of the International Investment Position, the
proper classification of dividend flows by energy sector companies, and on the other required
improvements for the prospective subscription to the SDDS and implementation of the Balance of
Payments Manual sixth edition. In collaboration with the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank plans to
expand its current debt reporting system to include comprehensive coverage of external loans and
domestic debt of the entire public sector, as well as publicly guaranteed debt, through the migration to
the CS-DRMS system.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 12, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation Discussions with
Trinidad and Tobago
On June 14, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2013 Article IV consultation discussions with Trinidad and Tobago.1
The economy of Trinidad and Tobago is poised for a modest recovery in 2013, after
disappointing growth in 2012 that was due largely to supply constraints, including maintenance
operations in the energy sector and an industrial dispute in the non-energy sector. The staff
projects real gross domestic product (GDP) growth of some 1.5 percent in 2013, with risks
slightly to the downside, should development spending be under-executed. Headline inflation
rose to 9.3 percent in 2012, but core inflation, which excludes food prices, remained moderate at
3.1 percent, and has since fallen further to 2.2 percent in March 2013. Unemployment is low at
about 5 percent, but underemployment remains significant. The external current account surplus
fell slightly on increased dividend outflows, but remained high at 10 percent of GDP. Gross
official reserves remained strong at US$9.2 billion at end-2012 (some 12.5 months of imports).
The central government realized a deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2011/12 (October–
September), after near balance the previous year, and was more than explained by a decline in
energy revenues due to output shortfalls. Gross government debt increased by some 6 percentage
points of GDP to a still-manageable 39 percent of GDP. Most of this increase relates to a one-off
issuance of bonds relating to a failed insurance company (CLICO), about half of which is
expected to be retired in 2013.
Despite accommodative monetary policy, private sector credit growth was modest. The Central
Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) cut its policy repo rate to 2.75 percent in September 2012.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

The CBTT continues to mop up considerable excess liquidity via voluntary term deposits by
commercial banks and a recent TT$1 billion government bond. Commercial banks remain well
capitalized, profitable and liquid, and the end-2012 non-performing loan (NPL) ratio fell to 5.4
percent.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the signs of economic recovery, fueled by growth of the
non-energy sector. They agreed that the authorities’ macroeconomic policies are appropriately
supporting the recovery in the near term given downside risks. Over the longer term, the policy
priority should be to recast fiscal policy in the context of the country’s non-renewable resource
endowment while pursuing structural reforms aimed at diversifying the economic base.
Directors commended the authorities’ adoption of a medium-term fiscal consolidation target.
Specific measures should be identified, which would also improve the composition of public
spending. This should include the phasing-out over time of poorly-targeted and unsustainable
subsidies (notably on fuels) and transfers, while protecting the most vulnerable segments of
society and priority social spending. Looking ahead, Directors recommended adoption of a
longer-term strategy embodied in a fiscal framework to extend the benefits of current natural
resource wealth to future generations. Increasing non-energy revenues and containing current
expenditure to raise development spending over time will be important.
Directors supported the accommodative monetary stance, given subdued underlying inflation and
economic slack. Nonetheless, overall credit developments, especially in the real estate sector,
and excess liquidity in the financial system should be closely monitored in determining the future
direction of monetary policy.
Directors noted that the financial sector appears sound, and welcomed progress on financial
sector reforms, including the 2011 Financial Sector Assessment Program recommendations.
They encouraged the authorities to continue enacting legislation under preparation and expand
the regulatory perimeter to include non-bank systemically important financial institutions.
Directors underscored the need for structural reforms to facilitate economic diversification and
improve competitiveness, and, in this context, welcomed the authorities’ commitment to improve
the business climate. They also encouraged the authorities to press ahead with efforts to improve
the effectiveness of the public service to support investment and facilitate diversification.
Directors noted that while economic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes,
efforts to improve their timeliness and quality should be a priority.

Statement by Paulo Nogueira Batista, Executive Director
and Kevin Finch, Advisor to the Executive Director
June 14, 2013
1.
The authorities of Trinidad and Tobago wish to thank the staff mission, headed by Mr.
Canetti, for their judicial diagnostic of the economy, its prospects and potential risks. Couching
the discussions in a medium-long run framework was appropriate, given a broad measure of
near-term macroeconomic stability.
Recent Economic Developments
2.
After declining by 2.6 percent in 2011, real GDP was estimated to have expanded by
0.2 percent in 2012. The headline growth recorded was not truly reflective of the turnaround in
economic activity, particularly in the job-creating non-energy sector, which grew by
3.6 percent. Economic growth was suppressed by the lackluster performance of the energy
sector (-4.7 percent) which accounted for 46 percent of GDP. Supply curtailments in the
upstream energy sector continued in 2012, as major producers conducted routine maintenance
of offshore infrastructure. In the non-energy sector, the financial services sector performed well
as banks continued to post healthy profits despite weaker credit demand. The construction
sector also recovered following the legal resolution of an industrial dispute involving the
country’s main cement supplier, Trinidad Cement Limited.
3.
Inflation trended downwards as pressures on food prices subsided. Headline inflation
measured 5.5 percent on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis to April 2013 after reaching as high as
12.6 percent in May 2012. Notwithstanding a brief uptick in October 2012 following the
increase in the price of premium gasoline, core inflation remained well anchored at around
2 percent. Pursuant to technical assistance (TA) from STA/CARTAC, the Central Statistical
Office (CSO) updated its methodology for the Index of Retail Prices, thereby correcting the
upward bias particularly reflected in the food sub-index. The new index is expected to be
published in the fourth quarter of 2013 following an initial testing period.
4.
Fiscal policy continued to be geared towards supporting the economic recovery. For
fiscal 2012, the outturn showed a deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP. The fiscal impulse was less
than expected as both current and capital expenditure were lower than budgeted. The
authorities noted staff’s comments on the level of expenditure on transfer and subsides,
particularly on the fuel subsidy. The issue of minimizing/eliminating fuel subsidies is engaging
the authorities’ full attention. A plan for the phased reduction in fuel subsidies along with a
strategy to promote increased usage of compressed natural gas in the transport industry is
underway. A cabinet-appointed committee is also examining the issue of fuel subsidies. A
report will soon be submitted for cabinet’s consideration.
5.
The government remains committed to saving a portion of the proceeds from its nonrenewable resources for future generations through the Heritage and Stabilization Fund (HSF).
A statutory review of the HSF, due every five years, was recently completed. The proposed

changes were not radical but sought to streamline the operations of the fund and clarify deposit
and withdrawal rules. Staff argues that making transfers to the HSF while the overall fiscal
position is in deficit is tantamount to borrowing to save. However, the authorities stress that
deposits are governed by the HSF law which dictates that transfers to the fund must be made as
long as actual energy revenues surpass budgeted energy revenues by more than 10 percent.
Thus, deposits to the HSF are independent of the overall fiscal balance. Furthermore, the
authorities’ conservative approach towards estimating energy prices for budget purposes has
served the country well and has facilitated the building of this important buffer.
6.
Public debt rose to 45.6 percent of GDP in 2012, but is already on decline as debt
related to the CLICO settlement is exchanged for units in the CLICO Investment Fund1.
Approximately TT$3 billion of government debt was exchanged during the first quarter of
2013. In addition, a debt management committee has been formed to provide oversight to debt
strategy formulation and implementation, develop an annual borrowing plan and ensure
coordinated operations among key institutions involved in debt management.
7.
Monetary conditions remain accommodative. The repo rate, the main policy rate, was
reduced to a historic low of 2.75 per cent in September 2012 after remaining unchanged for
more than a year. Credit granted to the private sector was sluggish, rising by 2 percent in March
2013 (y-o-y). However, credit granted for real estate mortgages continued to be robust,
increasing by 9.3 percent. At this juncture, there are no indications of a housing “bubble”. The
house price data collected by the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) showed
negligible movements. Also, mortgages are fully collateralized and commercial banks utilize
very conservative loan-to-value ratios of around 80-85 percent. The Financial Institutions
Supervision Department of the CBTT continues to monitor mortgage lending of the various
commercial banks.
8.
Surplus liquidity in the financial system persists. Excess liquidity rose to a daily average
of more than TT$6 billion in May 2013, more than double the level at the start of the fiscal
year. Having reached the statutory ceiling for the issuance of short-term government securities,
the authorities intend to issue TT$3 billion in longer-term treasury bonds in 2013 to absorb
excess liquidity. Of this amount, a TT$1 billion government bond was issued in May 2013. The
bond was heavily oversubscribed, attracting bids close to 300 percent of the face value. A
Liquidity Management Committee, comprising representatives from the Ministry of Finance
and the Economy (MOFE) and CBTT, was reactivated in October 2012 in order to improve the
coordination of fiscal and monetary policies.
9.
The authorities broadly agree with staff’s assessment of the exchange rate and the
foreign exchange market. The foreign exchange management system now includes a new

auction system which commenced in June 2012. This introduced a more market-based
approach to foreign exchange sales by CBTT to authorized dealers. Despite heavier demand for
foreign exchange in 2012, commercial banks reported balanced market conditions, with no
instances of queuing.
Short-term Economic Outlook
10.
The authorities have projected economic growth of 2.5 percent for 2013. However,
Fund estimates are a bit more conservative at 1.5 percent on account of the anticipated effect of
maintenance outages in the energy sector during the third quarter of 2013. To minimize the
impact of the planned shut-in, the Ministry of Energy and Energy Affairs held discussions with
several upstream and downstream companies to coordinate maintenance outages. These
outages represent the only major risks to the country’s energy sector earnings in the short-term.
Medium-long term risks include lower gas prices as a result of possible LNG exports from the
US from 2016. Despite this however, expectations are for natural gas demand to outstrip the
growth in supply going forward, driven in the main by Asian countries and by the growing use
of natural gas in the transportation industry.
11.
In the non-energy sector, growth is expected to be propelled by the construction,
distribution and financial services sectors. On the latter, negotiations between the government
and two transnational banks resulted in an agreement to relocate their back-office processing
functions for 20 countries to Trinidad and Tobago. Both initiatives are expected to generate at
least 500 new full-time jobs. Two additional agreements of this nature with other financial
institutions are expected by end-2013.
Financial Sector Developments
12.
The Securities Industries Act was passed in December 2012. Key provisions of the Act
include greater disclosure requirements, broader information sharing with other regulators and
power for the Securities and Exchange Commission to conduct on-site compliance reviews of
its registrants. Other pieces of financial sector legislation are on-track for passage. The
Insurance Bill was revamped and should be approved by parliament in the latter part of 2013.
Consultations on a draft Credit Union Bill are ongoing with a view to have legislation in place
by end-2013. Towards the end of 2014, legislation for occupational pensions is expected to be
laid in parliament.
13.
Trinidad and Tobago was taken off the FATF watch-list in November 2012 after a more
robust AML/CFT framework was put in place. The authorities are preparing for an assessment,
using FATF’s revised methodology, during the first quarter of 2014. The current focus is on
building the enforcement capacity of the Financial Intelligence Unit. On financial crisis
resolution, a national crisis management plan was drafted by the CBTT and updated in early
2013. The authorities are requesting TA from the Fund to ensure the plan aligns with
international best practice. Plans are also on track for a July 2013 IPO of a 20 percent stake in
the state bank.

Structural Reforms
14.
Tax system reform. FAD TA on comprehensive tax reform in Trinidad and Tobago will
inform government’s plan to transform the tax structure and improve tax collections. The
cabinet is reviewing the findings and recommendations of the report, with a view to including
new measures in the fiscal package for 2013/14. The authorities estimate that the measures
under consideration, once implemented, could close the fiscal gap. Once the tax policy issues
are settled, the authorities intend to examine tax administration measures more intensively and
look forward to the continued support of the Fund in this regard. Some measures to strengthen
tax compliance are already taking shape. For example, mechanisms to facilitate the electronic
filing of tax returns will move forward this year following the passage of the Electronic
Transactions Act, 2011.
15.
Improving the business climate. The authorities are in the midst of implementing the
Enabling Business Competitive (EBC) Strategy for 2011-2014. The EBC, co-funded by the 10th
European Development Fund, is a four-year sector development plan targeted at supporting
sectors which the authorities have identified as key to creating a robust competitive business
environment. The authorities have also requested TA from the World Bank to develop an
insolvency law and to establish a commercial court.
16.
Sustainable growth, diversification and governance. The authorities recognize that in
order to engender sustainable and inclusive growth, structural transformation of the economy,
undergirded by improvements in competitiveness and productivity of the non-energy sector, is
imperative. With the private sector lacking the necessary firepower to drive the transition,
government is leading the way with the adoption of the public-private partnership (PPP) model
for investment. Government approved a framework to govern PPPs in May 2012. A PPP unit,
partially funded by the IDB, was established in the MOFE with the responsibility for
identifying and monitoring PPP projects. Accountability and transparency are also being
improved. The government produced an “Annual Report on Performance” in early 2013. The
report, which will be prepared on an annual basis, focuses on the performance and results of
government ministries, agencies and departments in relation to the five priority areas of
development within the authorities’ Medium-Term Policy Framework.
Statistical Issues
17.
The authorities are cognizant of the statistical challenges and are working towards
improving the quality and timeliness of data. CBTT has developed a three-year plan to improve
the balance of payments and monetary statistics, strengthen timeliness and dissemination, work
with the CSO on rebasing and developing a quarterly GDP series and finalize the
implementation of the Commonwealth-based debt monitoring system (CS-DRMS).
