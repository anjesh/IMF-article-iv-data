STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Nigeria has a large and diverse economy that has achieved a decade of strong
growth, averaging 6.8 percent a year. However, Nigeria still lags peers in critical
infrastructure and has high rates of poverty and income inequality. The sharp decline in
oil prices in the second half of 2014 underscores the challenging but compelling need to
address remaining development challenges.
Outlook and Risks. In 2015, oil exports are projected to decline by 6 percentage points
(ppts) of GDP and oil revenue by 2.4 ppts of GDP from 2014 levels, with a reduction in
the current account balance and loss in international reserves. A sharp contraction in
public investment and domestic demand is projected to reduce growth to 4¾ percent,
with inflation increasing to 11½ percent from the effects of exchange rate depreciation.
These developments also increase risks to the banking sector, given its significant
exposure to the oil industry and the potential for capital outflows. The outlook is subject
to significant risks, both external (changes in oil market developments and investor
sentiment) and domestic (uncertainty from the election outcome and security situation).
Managing adjustment. The authorities adopted bold policy actions in November 2014—
an adjustment in the official foreign exchange rate and band, tightening of monetary
policy rates, and spending cuts totaling 1.7 ppts of GDP in the proposed 2015 budget.
As the oil price fall appears more permanent than temporary, additional policies will be
needed, including greater flexibility in the exchange rate and further fiscal adjustment,
particularly in state and local governments. It will be essential to ensure that fiscal
adjustment is achieved without endangering the delivery of critical public services.
Boosting inclusive growth. The authorities have a comprehensive economic
transformation agenda, designed to boost growth, create new job opportunities, and
reduce poverty. With recent oil market developments, however, non-oil revenue
mobilization (including an increase in VAT rate) is more urgent than ever and is critical
for creating the fiscal space necessary to implement the transformation agenda. Further,
the national infrastructure investment plan needs careful prioritization, as financing the
entire plan would be a challenge, even with more supportive financial conditions and
good progress in financial inclusion.

CONTEXT
1.
Nigeria has achieved a decade of strong growth from a large and diverse economy.
Economic growth averaged 6.8 percent a year over the past decade, with the economy accounting
for 35 percent of the GDP for Sub-Saharan Africa. While the economy is diverse, with services
accounting for over 50 percent and oil only 13 percent of GDP in 2013, the oil sector remains a
critical source for fiscal revenues and foreign exchange (Figures 1 and 2). Growth has been driven by
the non-oil-sector and private consumption, but Nigeria still lags peers in critical infrastructure
(Figures 3 and 4), has high rates of poverty (33 percent in 2012/13) and income inequality, and faces
development challenges (Annex 1).
2.
The sharp decline in oil prices in the second half of 2014 underscores the challenging
but compelling need to address remaining development challenges. Sharply lower oil revenues
to each tier of government will strain efforts to address social and economic disparities. In addition,
the international environment is less accommodating, with uncertainty about the future of oil prices
and the implications of the election (in March 2015) outcome increasing investors’ risk aversion.

3.
The authorities continue to advance their policy agenda, drawing on past discussions
with staff (Annex 2). Public financial management systems have been strengthened by expanding
the coverage of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) and information management systems to most
Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs). Financial sector supervision has advanced through
the implementation of Basel II/III, adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),
implementation of the framework for consolidated supervision, strengthening of cross-border
supervision (e.g., the use of memoranda of understanding (MOUs), joint inspections, and

participation in various Colleges of Supervisors), and enhancements in macroprudential oversight.
The legacy debt overhang in the power sector was solved, paving the way for investment to increase
gas production; the seed and fertilizer program helped improve food security to rural farm
households (including women farmers); and institutions and instruments have been established to
boost affordable housing, promote skills acquisition and entrepreneurship training, and improve
access to finance for small- and medium-sized enterprises.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.

Recent macroeconomic performance has been strong.



Real GDP grew by 6.1 percent in Q3 2014 (y-o-y): the non-oil sector (crop production, textiles
and footwear, telecommunications, and real estate) remained robust (up 7.3 percent), but the oil
sector declined by 3.6 percent, mostly driven by an increase in intermediate costs.



Inflation remained within the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) 6-9 percent target range, declining
to 8 percent at end-2014. (Figure 5).



Key banking system financial soundness indicators remain above prudential norms and CBN
stress tests indicate overall resilience. This is despite slight declines in overall capital adequacy,
liquidity, and profitability, and a small increase in non-performing loans in the first half of 2014
(Figures 6, 7 and 8, Annex 3). Earnings have been affected by the commencement of banks’
annual payments (of 0.5 percent of total assets) into the Banking Sector Resolution Cost Fund.
Banking sector performance has varied by institution-size (Figures 6 and 7), with medium and
small banks underperforming larger banks, and two smaller banks requiring some
recapitalization in the second half of 2014 after falling below the 10 percent minimum capital

adequacy ratio. The risk profile of banks has also evolved, with increased foreign currency
exposures, both on the lending and funding sides, though the net open foreign exchange
position remains small (about 6 percent of total capital) (Annex 3).



Credit to the private sector grew 28½ percent in 2014, compared with 24 percent in 2013.
Lending to the oil and gas, construction, and power and energy sectors have grown
particularly fast, though exposures to the construction and power and energy sectors
remain relatively small (at 5 percent and 4 percent of total loans respectively) (Figure 9).



The spread between prime and maximum lending rates widened to 9.5 percentage points.
(Figure 10).



The trade surplus, $43.8 billion (or 8.4 percent of GDP) for 2013, is about 23 percent lower
(2014 Q1-Q3), from lower oil exports and continued strong growth in imports. Remittances
and income outflows (mostly oil profit repatriation) have been steady, with fluctuations in
capital flows (including errors and omissions) driving reserve movements (Figures 11
and 12).

The risk of debt distress remains low (Debt Sustainability Analysis). Total debt is
12.4 percent of GDP, with external debt only 1.7 percent of GDP and mostly from
International Financial Institutions (IFIs) on concessional terms. However, about
30-40 percent of Federal Government (FG) domestic debt was held by non-residents at
end-2013. Moreover, FG debt service on total public debt is nearly 9 percent of general
government revenue, a high ratio compared to an average of 5.5 percent in developing and
emerging economies.



5.
The authorities have taken bold policy actions to manage near-term vulnerabilities,
but challenges remain.


With oil production below the budget target of 2.38 million barrels per day (bpd) (Figure 13) and
the sharp fall in the oil price (Figure 14) the 2014 FG deficit is projected to increase by
0.2 percentage points of GDP above its target of 1 percent of GDP. The Excess Crude Account
(ECA) reached $2.0 billion by end-2014—well below the $6.3 billion required to cover a one-half
standard deviation shock to oil receipts. The fiscal authorities responded swiftly to the oil price
developments by submitting a revised 2015 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) in
December, with a benchmark oil price of $65 per barrel (pb) compared to the $78 pb in the
original MTEF (submitted in October).



The November 24-25 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) adjusted the exchange rate and
tightened the monetary policy stance. The midpoint of the official retail Dutch Auction System
(rDAS) rate was adjusted from N155 to N168 per U.S. dollar (a 8 percent adjustment), and the
band widened from ± 3 to ± 5 percent, bringing the rDAS rate more in line with the interbank
foreign exchange market (IFEM) rate. In parallel, to maintain market confidence, the central bank
also raised the monetary policy rate (MPR) from 12 percent to 13 percent and the cash reserve
requirement on private sector deposits from 15 percent to 20 percent. Initial market reaction
was positive, but pressures re-emerged as oil prices fell further.

The equity market also declined sharply in 2014 as oil price continued to decline (Figure 15).

Gross international reserves (GIRs) stood at $34.25 billion at end-2014, a decline of
$8.5 billion from end-2013 (Figure 16). After stabilizing in the middle of the year, reserves declined
in the fourth quarter as the CBN intervened to support the exchange rate in the face of falling oil
prices and increased capital outflows.

Exchange rate. The foreign exchange market remains segmented, with the IFEM and Bureau
de Change (BDC) rates trading at premia over the rDAS rate (Figure 17), creating market distortions.
Although the wedge narrowed on the November MPC decision, pressures persist and the IFEM
continues to trade outside the 5 percent official band; the spread between the period average IFEM
and rDAS rates reached 12 percent in January. In effective terms, the value of the naira changed by

OUTLOOK, RISKS, AND SPILLOVERS
9.
The outlook is for growth to moderate as the economy adjusts to permanently lower
oil prices. In 2015, oil exports are projected to be $52 billion (down from $88 billion in 2014), a
reduction of 6 percentage points of GDP, which is projected to reduce the external current account
balance and international reserves. Fiscal oil revenues are projected at 3.4 percent of GDP (down
from 5.8 percent in 2014), limiting fiscal spending. Staff projects that these aggregate demand
shocks could lower growth by about 1½ percentage point from 2014 to 4¾ percent in 2015—the
overall impact on non-oil sector GDP will come from cuts in public investment and a reduction in
real purchasing power of oil receipts (see Selected Issues Paper (SIP)2 for a more complete
discussion). The depreciation of the exchange rate will add to inflation, reflecting the pass-through
of higher domestic prices for imports, but the effect is likely to be contained, in part due to lower
food prices from increased local production of staple food crops. The outlook is compromised by
low fiscal and external buffers, which have reduced the capacity to absorb shocks relative to the
experience of the 2008-09 financial crisis.
Authorities’ views: The authorities reiterated their determination to implement appropriate
measures to manage risks. They agreed that the oil price shock is significant and, at least in part,
permanent, but saw a smaller effect on economic activity than staff, owing to measures targeted at
sectors critical for growth (agriculture, power, small enterprises) and the impact of remittances. They
noted that rising food self-sufficiency would limit the pass-through to inflation and activity in
housing construction would continue.
10.

Risks are on the downside (Risk Assessment Matrix, Box 1).



External. Investor sentiment could deteriorate rapidly depending on a further decline in oil
prices, and developments in the region and the rest of the world (e.g., outlook for AEs and EMs).
Any of these could trigger capital outflows, putting pressure on the exchange rate and GIRs.



Domestic. Security risks could increase owing to election-related violence, as well as an
intensification of the insurgency. Election results if disputed could lead to a prolonged period of
uncertainty, disrupting reform efforts, and in turn adversely affect the investor sentiment.

Nigeria currently maintains a multiple currency practice (MCP) related to the CBN rDAS.

Drawing on input-output tables, staff estimates the fiscal multiplier to be about 0.4.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff).

The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent,
“medium” a probability between 10 percent and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 percent and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the
source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Inward and outward spillovers through trade channels can amplify risks.
The source of inward trade spillovers is shifting from traditional (EU and USA) trading partners to
Asian countries, in particular China and India, reflecting the evolution of global energy markets



Although small, Nigeria’s exports to Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
countries have been increasing, from $1 billion in 1990 to about $6 billion in 2013. The
implementation in January 2015 of the Common External Tariffs (CET) for ECOWAS member
countries is expected to reduce incentives for informal trade and simplify customs procedures,
potentially increasing recorded trade volumes (SIP: Promoting Economic Transformation).



Moreover, the slowdown in Nigeria will adversely affect informal exports to Nigeria. Anecdotal
evidence indicates that goods that are subject to import restrictions in Nigeria (e.g., rice) have
become key export goods for neighboring countries. Those informal exports to Nigeria are
important sources of income for some neighboring countries and outward spillovers may be
nontrivial.

12.
Growing cross-border activity of Nigerian-based banks has increased the scope for
spillovers through financial channels, along with regulatory and supervisory challenges. Nine
banks have a significant presence in Benin, the Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. For
example, United Bank of Africa has a meaningful market share (assets between 3 percent and
7 percent of GDP) in Liberia, Benin, and Burkina Faso, while Guaranty Trust Bank is systemically
important (assets greater than 7 percent of GDP) for the Gambia. The effectiveness of cross-border
supervisory cooperation was recently demonstrated when two subsidiaries operating in the Gambia
were subject to regulatory action in May with minimal spillovers.

POLICIES
13.
Discussions focused on policies and reforms to support the authorities’ strategic
objectives of preserving macroeconomic stability, sustaining inclusive growth, and reducing
poverty and inequality. Staff sees the need to balance monetary, fiscal, and financial sector policies
in the short term to address increased vulnerabilities, while implementing broad structural reforms
to foster higher and more inclusive growth. In particular, opening up fiscal space to allow for
investment in productivity-enhancing infrastructure, especially in power and transportation, would
facilitate the transition from consumption-led growth to private-investment led growth.

A. Addressing Near-Term Vulnerabilities
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
14.
Recent developments have highlighted the challenges facing the monetary authorities,
and risks to the current monetary and exchange rate policy framework. Monetary policy is
driven by the CBN’s commitment to maintain a stable official exchange rate. Thus, international
reserves have to adjust to balance supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, and the CBN
has less room to manage its inflation target via monetary expansion or contraction. Moreover, the
increased use of administrative measures in the money market, liquidity injections through
intervention schemes that have contributed to increases in private sector credit, and the
maintenance of a tight monetary policy stance can send mixed signals to market participants.
Further, structural liquidity cycles have added to volatility in financial markets, resulting in sharp
spikes in overnight rates.3 Staff sees clear tensions in the current operation of the monetary and
exchange rate policy framework that attempts to maintain a peg against a strongly appreciating U.S.
dollar while the economy attempts to adjust to a large adverse terms-of-trade shock. Staff sees the
appropriate focus as allowing greater flexibility in the exchange rate to facilitate the adjustment to
external shocks. In this context, a further tightening may be needed to avoid a disorderly adjustment of
the exchange rate.
Authorities’ views: The authorities view exchange rate stability as a key plank in maintaining
macroeconomic stability, and consider that a stable naira is not incompatible with managing
inflation through open market operations and other monetary instruments.
15.
The 2014 period average exchange rate was moderately overvalued (Annex 4, Text
Table 1). The official exchange rate did depreciate in November, but the widening gap with the
interbank market rate along with a further fall in the oil price suggest a continued misalignment.
Reserves are six months of prospective imports, but slightly below the lower-end of the
3

The CBN faces “structural” liquidity cycles, which can amplify shocks and increase risks, including the monthly
disbursements by the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) to State and Local Governments (SLGs),
which hold bank accounts in deposit money banks (DMBs). The introduction of the Treasury Single Account (TSA)
attempts to address the issue, but TSA coverage is still incomplete and has not extended to the SLGs.

100-150 percent of the emerging market reserve adequacy metric, in large part owing to the fall in
reserves in 2014 and the buildup of liabilities to non-residents in recent years.
16.
Further liberalization of the foreign exchange market would facilitate macroeconomic
adjustment. Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to gradually move toward greater flexibility in
the exchange rate, while noting that the stable naira policy has helped underpin market confidence.
Staff encourages measures to minimize the wedge across or unify the segments of the foreign
exchange market, rather than through administrative measures taken in recent months, and to
develop market-based hedging instruments. Nigeria continues to avail itself of the transitional
arrangements of Article XIV, although it no longer maintains any restrictions under Article XIV. Staff
encourages the authorities to accept the obligations under Article VIII, noting the enhanced
integration with international markets.
Authorities’ views: The authorities consider the current level of the official exchange rate to be
close to its equilibrium value. Further, strong growth prospects suggest that Nigeria would remain
an attractive prospect for foreign investors, implying continued capital inflows. The authorities
monitor closely the various segments of the forex market and indicated their commitment to pursue
intervention and prudential measures to preserve the smooth functioning of the market.

17.
Financial stability has been maintained, but challenges to asset quality are emerging
(Annex 3). Loan portfolios are vulnerable to the decline in oil prices given their concentration in the
oil sector (24 percent of total loans as of 2014 Q2) and a significant proportion of total loans are
denominated in foreign currency (21 percent as of 2013 Q4), only some of which will be mitigated
by natural hedges. Consequently, movements in the exchange rate can impact credit quality. Large
banks have strengthened their capital, providing greater capacity to absorb losses, but medium and
smaller banks may be more vulnerable to an increase in NPLs. Staff welcomes the new prudential
guidelines to limit foreign currency exposure, increased capital weighting on concentrated exposures,
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

NIGERIA

and efforts to enforce compliance with the existing provisions controlling SLG access to credit. Staff
recommends continued vigilance, including through stress testing of individual banks’ balance sheets,
and enhanced supervisory oversight of those banks that are relatively weaker. Also, to mitigate
potential foreign currency liquidity risks, staff sees merit in considering a reserve requirement on
foreign currency deposits, which now represent about 20 percent of total deposits.
Authorities’ views: The authorities agreed that continued vigilance is needed, noting that they
remain fully committed to sustaining financial stability and that their recent prudential actions
highlight their readiness to introduce “speed bumps” where systemic vulnerabilities are emerging.

Fiscal Policies
18.
Given limited buffers, the draft budget appropriately tightens the fiscal stance. Relative
to 2014, staff projects that oil revenue will drop by 2.4 percentage points of GDP. The MTEF
envisages a gradual increase in non-oil revenues (0.1 percent of GDP in 2015), with a reduction in
expenditure of 1.7 percent of GDP (1 percent from lower fuel subsidies, 0.2 from lower capital
spending, and 0.5 from adjustment by SLGs). The projected overall impact is an increase of
0.3 percentage points of GDP in the consolidated government deficit. However, fiscal buffers remain
weak and, absent additional fiscal adjustments, staff projects that the ECA could be depleted by
end-2015 (SIP: Oil Sector Developments). In addition, with FG capital spending envisaged at
0.4 percent of GDP, the ability to delay capital spending as an informal buffer, as has happened in
previous years, is limited. Staff welcomes the announced steps to increase revenue through enhanced
revenue administration and excise taxes and fees on luxury goods and services. Nevertheless, staff sees
the need to identify additional contingency measures to contain recurrent expenditures and boost
non-oil revenues in 2015—such as accelerating potential reforms to VAT and CIT (¶20)—to prevent the
ECA from being fully depleted. .
Authorities’ views: The authorities noted they would take measures to preserve the ECA at least at
$1billion in 2015, highlighting that they contained ECA withdrawals in 2014, a pre-election year.
Also, they indicated they have identified measures for curtailing recurrent expenditure.
19.
State and local governments face a challenging adjustment. Staff estimates that the
existing revenue sharing formulas imply that SLG revenues fall by about a quarter billion dollars for
each $1 drop in oil prices. In addition, given the low levels of the ECA, SLGs may not have recourse
to augmentation or special distributions (equivalent to an average of 9 percent of their revenue over
2011-2013) to fund their expenditures. With limited room for financing and, absent increases in
independently generated revenue, the revised MTEF implies an adjustment in SLG expenditure of
about 15 percent in real terms relative to 2014. Achieving such a rationalization without impeding
delivery of critical public services or the accumulation of arrears will require careful prioritization,
especially in capital projects (45 percent of SLG expenditures), and better monitoring of the
evolution of SLG accounts payable. Staff encourages the authorities to further improve public financial
management across all levels of government, including through improved coordination and
capacity-enhancement activities. In the long-term, it could be important to review the fiscal federalism
arrangements—minimizing the duplication of programs (and taxes) and enhancing accountability—to

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

help address more efficiently the socio-economic disparities across states (SIP: Promoting Economic
Transformation).
Authorities’ views: The authorities have started to engage subnational governments on the need
for budget adjustment. Following the budget price adjustments, the Federal authorities have
informed the states of the much lower oil revenue expected for 2015 and the need to prioritize
spending. The authorities acknowledge the benefits of a state-by-state approach, recognizing that
the states with lower capacity are likely the ones with little internally generated revenue. The
authorities aim to build capacity at the SLG level, including through collaboration with the State
Commissioners of Finance and workshops with international experts.
20.
There are near-term refinancing uncertainties. The government faces significant
refinancing needs in the first four months of 2015, including a benchmark bond (about N500 billion)
falling due in April, but financing costs have risen significantly—the spread between the Nigeria
2023 Eurobond and the reference U.S. Treasury was 442 basis points at end-December, over
220 basis points wider than the low for 2014 (Annex 5). Staff noted that active engagement with
investors and preserving cash buffers can help mitigate refinancing risk.
Authorities’ views: The authorities are monitoring market developments closely and noted that
they are projecting financing costs to increase in 2015. However, they remain confident that demand
from domestic investors, especially pension funds, would ensure sufficient demand for new bonds
and facilitate a smooth refinancing.

B. Medium- to Long-Term Growth Agenda
21.
Non-oil revenue mobilization is a key fiscal priority. Non-oil revenue is just 4½ percent
of non-oil GDP—compared to an average of 10-15 percent of non-oil GDP for other oil producers—
providing inadequate financing for infrastructure and social needs, and leaving the budget
vulnerable to oil shocks. A feasible target could be to raise non-oil revenue by 1½ percentage points
of GDP by 2017, to achieve a sustainable non-oil primary balance (Text Table 2). This will require
continued efforts for enhancing revenue administration and policy adjustments consistent with
Nigeria’s well-diversified economy:


Administration: On-going reforms are gradually bearing fruit—CIT collections, for example,
improved by 0.2 percent of non-oil GDP in 2014 after being stagnant during 2010-13. To ensure
the durability of these reforms it will be important to establish qualitative benchmarks, such as
the average length of the audit cycle, share of tax filings submitted before due date, and
amounts recovered out of tax debt outstanding.



Policy: The authorities’ ongoing initiatives to modernize and simplify tax laws provide an
opportunity to enhance tax policy. For VAT, the existing 5 percent rate is among the lowest in
the world. Reforms should aim to maintain a single rate, keep exemptions to a minimum, and
could allow input credits for capital goods and services. For CIT, the priority would be to limit

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

NIGERIA

the renewal of exemptions, in particular those derived from pioneer status, to broaden the tax
base.
Authorities’ views: The authorities agreed that non-oil revenue effort was low and that revenue
mobilization was essential to meet capital investment and social expenditure. In this context, they
shared the achievements to date of the tax administration reforms and planned improvements in
registration, auditing, and communications, which are expected to yield an additional $0.5-1.0 billion
in 2015. They acknowledged the low VAT rate and pointed to the potential importance of higher
VAT collections for the SLGs —85 percent of VAT receipts are distributed to subnational
governments. The authorities reiterated the importance they attach to further enhancing tax
administration and increasing remittances from revenue-generating agencies, but considered broad
tax reform, including VAT and CIT reforms as essential to their medium-term fiscal strategy.

22.
Ensuring efficiency of public spending is critical. The absolute level of consolidated
government expenditure, at 12 percent of GDP in 2014, is low by international standards: an average
of 20 percent for low income, 31 for the emerging, and 41 for the advanced economies.
Infrastructure gaps and social needs suggest scope for scaling and composition tilting, subject to
resource availability. With projected revenue tightening further in 2015, it will be important to
ensure that available resources are used efficiently to meet government’s priorities. Key actions
include the implementation of ongoing efforts to prioritize the limited capital expenditure budget
and control of recurrent expenditure via Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms (including

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

expanding TSA, the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Management System (IPPIS) and the
Government Integrated Financial Management System (GIFMIS) to all MDAs). Staff noted that
enhancing the efficiency of expenditure is crucial to muster support for envisaged tax reforms. Staff
encourages the authorities to conduct a selective review of expenditure to identify durable efficiency
enhancing reforms. Ideally, this review, together with the ongoing prioritization of capital projects,
should become a part of the budget preparation process. Staff welcomes the discussion of contingent
liabilities in the MTEF and encourages the full and transparent disclosure of all current and future
budgetary costs and fiscal risks related to Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)s, which are likely to gain
prominence in the years to come as Nigeria attempts to close the infrastructure gap.
Authorities’ views: The authorities aim to remain fiscally prudent. Although the level of spending is
relatively low, the authorities still see scope to curtail further current spending in the short term
while protecting key programs in priority areas, including health, education, infrastructure, and
security. They aim also to reprioritize capital projects to improve efficiency. In the medium term, any
expansion of the spending envelope should be supported by additional non-oil revenue. On PPPs,
the authorities agreed on the need for a careful approach, but indicated that these risks are minimal
at present—strict selection criteria are being observed and only a handful of PPPs have been
approved, with very little government exposure. The authorities agree with the need for disclosure,
but questioned whether the MTEF is the right vehicle.
23.
Financing the infrastructure investment plan will be a challenge. The National
Infrastructure Investment Plan (NIIP) has identified new investment needs of about $30-50 billion a
year. With domestic savings sufficient to finance about a third of the NIIP, this risks crowding out
private sector investment (SIP: Promoting Economic Transformation), especially in the event of
reduced foreign portfolio inflows. Consequently, external financing may be needed to fill the gap.
(Annex 5). Staff recommends that to minimize risks to debt sustainability, especially given the
deterioration in financing conditions, implementation of the NIIP should be carefully prioritized and
program objectives adjusted as needed.
Authorities’ views: The authorities agreed that implementation of the NIIP would need to be scaled
to resource availability, including through careful prioritization. In that context, they consider that
implementation of the new manual on project selection will prove very effective. They indicated,
however, that they do not see external market borrowing as a solution and that new external
borrowing will be focused on available concessional sources.
24.
Lower oil prices provide an opportunity to phase out fuel subsidies. The recent drop in
crude oil prices (and lower petrol and kerosene prices) could facilitate the completion of the subsidy
reform, which started in 2012. Staff recommends introducing an independent price-setting mechanism
to smoothly pass through international price changes to domestic prices and gradually eliminate fuel
subsidies. This could generate fiscal savings of about 0.5 percent of GDP per year in the medium term.
Staff encourages the authorities to review possible mitigating measures to protect the most vulnerable,
including boosting targeted cash transfers through the Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment
Program (SURE-P), and to transparently communicate the government’s strategy in this regard.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

NIGERIA

Authorities’ views: The authorities expressed their commitment to subsidy reform, and indicated
they were considering options, timing, and modalities of implementing these reforms in light of the
decline in oil prices.
25.
There is scope to improve budget preparation and reporting. Oil revenue projections
have been inaccurate, assuming higher revenue-to-market value of oil production than actually
realized. As a result, realized oil revenue is only slightly higher than projected in the budget even
when market oil prices are substantially higher than the budget oil price. In addition, reporting of
implicit oil subsidies could be enhanced. Staff encourages the authorities to review oil revenue
forecasting, and recommends expanding fiscal reports from the Office of the Accountant General of the
Federation (OAGF) to show gross and net oil revenues and implicit subsidies.
Authorities’ views: The authorities noted that improved revenue forecasting would be helpful and
information on subsidies could be reported better, but cautioned about potential delays in reporting
given that source data are preliminary and often subject to revisions.
26.
Significant progress has been made in strengthening the supervisory and regulatory
framework of the banking system, based on the recommendations of the 2012 FSAP. In
addition to the implementation of IFRS and Pillars I and II of Basel II/III, the authorities have
implemented a framework for the enhanced supervision of systemically important banks (DSIBs).
Work continues on strengthening cross-border supervision, and collaboration with host regulators
continues to deepen (Annex 3). These trends are also reflected in other domestic supervisory
counterparts (e.g., the Securities and Exchange Commission, National Insurance Commission), with
the Financial Supervision and Regulation Coordinating Committee (FSRCC) helping to deepen
internal supervisory collaboration, contributing to enhanced oversight of holding companies, the
implementation of the framework for consolidated supervision, and preliminary work on systemic
risk monitoring. Staff welcomed the progress and encouraged the authorities to sustain their focus on
these issues. In particular, staff looks forward to the implementation of the new framework for
oversight of holding companies; the completion of the ongoing work on recovery and resolution
planning; and further efforts to address weaknesses in banking sector corporate governance, and
strengthen cross-border and consolidated supervision.
Authorities’ views: The authorities reiterated their commitment to ensuring the stability and
integrity of the financial system.
27.
Enhancing financial inclusion will promote inclusive growth. Financial inclusion is low
(only a third of the adult population has a deposit at a financial institution). Initiatives are underway
that could significantly increase the penetration of formal financial services. These initiatives, some
organically grown and others public sector led, are found in the banking, pension fund, and
insurance sectors, with many seeking to leverage mobile payments platforms and agents networks
(SIP: Promoting Economic Transformation). Some mobile payment services are also considering
expanding to quasi-deposit-taking services, complementing traditional/informal group savings
clubs. Staff stressed the importance of ensuring the stability and integrity of the financial system to
build confidence and ensure meaningful financial inclusion. In particular, the authorities should

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

remain watchful that gaps in regulatory oversight do not emerge given the multiplicity of parties
involved in delivery (agents, payments systems, financial institution). For instance, protection of quasideposits held in e-wallets should be reviewed and mobile payment systems should also be subject to
the Anti-Money Laundering (AML)/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) requirements in line
with international best practices.
Authorities’ views: The authorities acknowledge that the regulatory framework will need to evolve
as new products emerge. The effectiveness of these efforts will be supported by the in-house
expertise of CBN staff employed from the industry and engagement with stakeholders through the
National Payment Systems Board.
28.
Private sector-led growth would benefit from competitiveness-enhancing
improvements to the business climate and reforms to facilitate trade. Staff noted that
accelerating the power and oil sector reforms, including the passage of a sound Petroleum Industry
Bill, could lead to a significant reduction in the cost of electricity, a key constraint for many
businesses. Further, coordinating the enforcement of the tax regime amongst the federal
government and the state and local governments could relieve a significant cost of doing business.
Staff encourages a review of tariff policy (removal of import bans and levies on imports) to maximize
the benefits of trade agreements such as the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS)’s Common External Tariff and to continue to work on agreements that would facilitate
trade.
Authorities’ views: The authorities view power as a priority sector and key to promoting growth.
They noted that funding issues associated with legacy debt of the newly privatized power
generation companies have been addressed by the CBN providing funding through the Power and
Aviation Intervention Fund. They noted the need for a unified market for gas to complement
reforms in transmission and distribution in the power sector. The authorities acknowledge the need
to continue to enhance the business climate, including in terms of coordination with tax authorities
at the state level to address tax duplication issues. They indicated that the terms of the Economic
Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union (EU) remain under discussion, including on
ensuring appropriate market access for Nigerian exports to the EU (SIP: Promoting Economic
Transformation).
29.
Efforts are underway to make growth more inclusive and generate additional jobs. A
skills mismatch and the gap between the rate of job creation in the formal sector versus the number
of youth entering the job market are resulting in youth unemployment and underemployment,
which could become more acute as the economy slows. Ongoing initiatives include expanded
vocational training, grants to foster entrepreneurial talent, and job creation via YouWin and the
Graduate Transient Job Creation program funded by SURE-P. Staff noted the importance of
protecting funding for these programs, as well as other programs aimed to improve maternal health,
keep children in school, and promote higher female participation and gender equality in the
workplace. Standardization of application processes, post-program evaluations (as in the case of
SURE-P), and clear exit strategies could also help ensure the cost effectiveness of these programs.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

NIGERIA

Authorities’ views: The authorities stressed the importance of achieving the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) and their commitment to protect associated social programs, such as
the budget for polio vaccinations, Malaria, and HIV, education, security, and core infrastructure
(power, critical road transportation and agriculture). With World Bank assistance, the authorities also
plan to continue building the social safety net, including developing a conditional cash transfer
scheme to promote primary and secondary education and improve maternal and child care.
30.
Special financing schemes for private sector growth need to be carefully evaluated.
Such schemes constitute quasi-fiscal activities, implying the spending of public resources (Box 2 and
SIP: Promoting Economic Transformation). While there is some evidence of a positive impact on
capacity and employment, the relative effectiveness and costs of each scheme (or the totality of the
schemes) has not been assessed and the implicit subsidies can have distortive effects on resource
allocation. Staff recommends that interventions should be carefully targeted with a clear exit strategy,
and with a clear assessment of how the results of each program contribute to the sustainability of
funding. In addition, staff emphasized the broader benefits of focusing resources on improving the
enabling environment for business through infrastructure investment and improved administrative
efficiency.
Authorities’ views: The authorities are committed to ensuring interventions are well-targeted and
transparent. However, they see these as an appropriate policy focus and in line with the
unconventional monetary policy actions taken in other jurisdictions.
Box 2. Quasi-Fiscal Activities—Subsidized Credit from Public Financial Institutions
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and other public financial institutions (PFIs) play a role as
agents of fiscal policy in Nigeria. These activities affect the overall public sector balance without
affecting the FGN budget deficit. The implicit subsidies associated with subsidized lending (or
on-lending)—calculated as the maximum lending rate minus subsidized interest rate times the
credit extended since inception—through the CBN is estimated at about N140 billion in 2014,
about 17 percent of FG capital expenditure.
Key schemes are: the commercial
agriculture credit scheme (CACS);
the agricultural credit support
scheme (ACSS); the refinancing and
rediscounting scheme (RRF)
operated by the Bank of Industry
(BOI) to restructure banks’ existing
loan portfolios to manufacturers;
and the power and aviation
intervention fund (PAIF) also
operated by the BOI.

Ongoing efforts to enhance transparency and monitoring of oil sector transactions
could help reduce oil theft/deferred production. Oil production losses fell to about 150 thousand
bpd in 2014, reflecting less frequent pipeline shutdowns, but theft and vandalism continue. Staff
welcomed the authorities’ development of a strategic analysis, including trends and typologies, of the
financing of terrorism within the AML/ CFT framework. It supported plans to undertake and publish in
2015 a similar analysis of oil theft, and require financial and non-financial sector supervisors to use
risk-based approaches in controlling oil theft/money-laundering and report all suspicious activities to
the relevant authorities. Staff supports the on-going efforts for the automation of oil-related data
collections by Nigerian Extractive Industry Transparency Initiatives (NEITI) to improve the timeliness of
data reconciliation and urged the publication of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers audit report of Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
32.
Data have improved significantly, but more needs to be done. Nigeria has come far (e.g.,
the rebasing of the national accounts, a new General Household Survey, and regular publication of
FSIs). Continued efforts are needed in: (i) BOP—large errors and omissions, large other investment
flows, and greater use of survey data; (ii) refining the CPI and PPI; and (iii) completing censuses of
business and agriculture, and the Household Living Conditions Survey to improve the basis for
compiling macroeconomic data, including the next rebasing (2015) of the national accounts (Box 3,
Annex 5, and SIP: Promoting Economic Transformation).
Box 3. Improving External Sector Data
Nigeria has been improving external sector data, with the support of

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Nigeria has achieved several years of strong growth, gradually diversifying the
economy away from oil, but challenges remain. Growth has been driven by the non-oil sector
and private consumption, but is yet to reduce poverty and income inequality has widened.
Infrastructure gaps and weak institutions constrain growth prospects.
34.
The adjustment to a lower level of oil prices will slow growth and create difficult
policy choices. The oil price collapse, which is expected to be at least partially permanent, has
significantly impacted the economy. The initial policy response—tightening of fiscal policy, gradual
exchange rate depreciation, use of some of the reserve buffer—has been appropriate, but further
adjustment will be needed in 2015. To this end, achieving the proposed fiscal consolidation in 2015
will require determined efforts to improve the efficiency and prioritization of spending, ensuring
essential public services are not impaired and the implementation of the capital budget is carefully
scrutinized. As much of the burden of adjustment falls on the state and local governments, it will be
critical to provide appropriate support to these administrations to ensure effective budgeting.
35.
Mobilizing additional non-oil revenues will be critical to expanding fiscal space and
public service provision over the medium-term. Non-oil revenues are substantially below the
levels of other commodity-based economies. Ongoing initiatives to strengthen tax administration
have produced welcome improvements in collections, but determined efforts to rein in exemptions
would help to broaden the tax net, while tax rates should also be kept under review. Improving oil
revenue management, while scaling back fuel subsidies, would also provide additional fiscal space
and enable a shift in the composition of expenditures towards pressing social and development
needs. In the long term, it might be appropriate to review the revenue sharing arrangements to help
address the socio-economic regional disparities.
36.
The effectiveness of the monetary and exchange rate policy framework can be
improved, including by allowing greater flexibility in the rDAS exchange rate. It is important
for the CBN to maintain its focus on inflation. While exchange rate stability helps contain inflationary
pressure given the high dependency on imports, exchange rate adjustment can play a key role in
enabling the economy to adjust to a large external shock, whereas the rigidity in the rDAS had given
rise to a situation where the current level of exchange rate is considered moderately overvalued with
respect to the level implied by Nigeria’s fundamentals and reserves are low relative to EM metrics.
The wedge between the rDAS and IFEM exchange rates perpetuate distortions and should be
eliminated, preferably by unifying the market rather than through administrative measures.
37.
Vulnerabilities remain high. With both fiscal and external buffers lowered further in 2014,
prolonged uncertainty about future oil prices and domestic political and security developments
could adversely impact investor sentiment and the overall assessment of the economy. Financial
sector data and stress tests show resilience, but the concentration of risks and foreign currency
exposures need to be monitored carefully. Recent progress in strengthening supervision/regulation
both for DSIBs and cross-border should be continued and it is important to advance work on

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

deepening financial market development, including for introducing hedging instruments. Moreover,
communication is especially critical in helping sustain foreign investor confidence and mitigate the
risk of capital flight and disorderly markets.
38.
Data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but there are some areas for improvement.
Progress has been made in strengthening national accounts data and new household survey, but
additional efforts are needed on BOP data, in particular on capital outflows.
39.
The longer-term challenge is to successfully position the economy on a path to lower
oil-dependency and a diversified and competitive non-oil sector. The on-going transformation
agenda establishes a clear strategic direction, but greater prioritization would be helpful to ensure
rapid progress on key reforms and the efficient use of available resources. Further development of
core infrastructure, reducing business environment costs, encouraging high value-chain sectors,
improving access to finance, promoting employment of youth and female populations, and
advancing human capital development are all key steps for not only raising growth, but also making
it more inclusive.
40.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Annex 2. IMF Surveillance: Follow-up on Policy
Recommendations
In its continued effort to best serve member countries, the IMF follows up on policy advice and
recommendation discussed during its past annual Article IV surveillance mission. The following is a
list of policy issues and recommendations that were discussed in the past Article IV mission and
were also covered in the last staff report.
The 2013 Article IV Staff Report noted that polices should focus on:






Boosting external and rebuilding fiscal buffers.
Avoiding spending pressures from the political cycle.
Improving oil-revenue management.
Undertaking structural reforms to boost growth and job creation.
Strengthening governance frameworks.

Authorities Feedback:
Reserves declined by $8.5 billion in 2014, bringing them to the bottom of the Fund’s reserve
adequacy range. Reserves could fall below the range starting in 2015, suggesting that rebuilding
external buffers should remain a high priority. The authorities also acknowledged the need to
continue their efforts to enhance the business climate, including in terms of coordination with the
tax authorities at the state level to address issues of tax duplication. They also noted the number of
initiatives they are undertaking to boost growth and job creation (SIP: Promoting Economic
Transformation on Current Initiatives).
On Fiscal Issues:
 Adoption of a conservative oil benchmark price and oil production level in the 2014 Budget.
 Freezing allocations for salaries.
 Focusing on completing existing capital projects in the 2014 budget.
 PFM reforms-—notably the extension of the TSA and information systems in key federal
institutions.
 Improving oil revenue management.
 Programs to fight poverty and alleviate inequalities are welcome.
 Implementation of strong monitoring and evaluation frameworks should help improve service
delivery at low cost.
Authorities Feedback:
The authorities pointed to progress on several of these fronts, including using conservative budget
assumptions for the oil price and production, a declining wage bill as a share of GDP, and a realistic
capital budget reflecting execution capacity. PFM reforms are well underway with the TSA covering
551 out of 821 FG entities and accounting for 75 percent of the FG budget. To improve oil revenue
management, the authorities are including kerosene subsidies explicitly in the 2015 budget and are

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

considering implementing a rule-based budget oil price. The authorities are taking actions to
strengthen the social safety net, including plans to introduce a conditional cash transfer program
tailored around school attainment and maternal and child care health clinic visitations.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies:
 Staff encouraged greater reliance on open market operations to guide short-term interest rates.
 In the event of persistent pressures, greater flexibility in the exchange rate may be needed to
respond to shocks.
Authorities Feedback:
Authorities confirmed that they actively use OMOs to guide short-term interest rates.
The official exchange rate was devalued by 8 percent and the band around it was increased to
+/-5 percent from +/-3 percent. The authorities intend to move gradually toward greater flexibility.
Financial:



Implementation of key recommendations of the 2012 FSAP Update.
Enhanced onsite inspections of Nigerian banks operating abroad, particularly in countries where
the supervisory framework is less developed than in Nigeria.

Authorities Feedback:
Significant steps to address these recommendations have been taken as outlined in the Annex. Key
actions still outstanding include the recommended update to the BOFI and NDIC Acts; however,
draft Bills are with the National Assembly and will hopefully be passed in 2015.
The authorities have undertaken 15 onsite inspections of Nigerian bank subsidiaries in the past two
years and have participated in a range of College of Supervisors' meetings.
Structural Reforms:







Increase the delivery of power.
Broaden the agricultural base.
Increase access to finance for SMEs.
Recently introduced high tariffs on selected agricultural products create distortions and should
be temporary, with sectoral growth underpinned by improvements in competitiveness rather
than by protectionist measures.
Regular reviews of specialized credit and guarantee schemes should be undertaken to detect
problems early and improve effectiveness.

Authorities Feedback:
The authorities view the power sector as the key for unleashing Nigeria’s growth prospects. They
noted that the debt issues of the newly privatized power generation companies have been resolved
and investment plans for building capacity are on track. In addition, the authorities noted that
implementation of the agriculture transformation agenda is yielding positive economic effects.
Higher productivity through the growth enhancement support (GES) program, using the E-wallet to

provide targeted support for seeds and fertilizers, generated higher incomes for farmers, and
contributed to the creation 2.7 million jobs over the last two years. In addition, improvements to the
business environment have increased private investment, generating returns in the form of
increased food supply. The authorities reaffirmed their commitments to ensure that interventions
are targeted and transparent.

Annex 3. Update on Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
The 2012 FSAP update analyzed developments in Nigeria’s financial sector since the 2009 banking
crisis and highlighted some key risks. This annex provides a brief update on developments in the
banking sector since then.
The resilience of the banking sector has improved significantly since the banking crisis;
however, there has been some small deterioration in the first half of 2014. The industry-wide
capital adequacy ratio (CAR) declined by 0.8 percentage points to 16.4 percent (Figure A3.1), the
liquidity ratio declined marginally by 1.1 percentage points (Figure A3.2), while non-performing
loans increased marginally by 0.3 percentage points to 3.5 percent (Figure 3.3); however, these
remain better than the prudential minimum standards. This deterioration in CAR has been
concentrated in small- and medium-sized banks (down by 3.6 and 2.3 percentage points to
14.4 percent and 16 percent respectively). In particular, the CAR of two banks temporarily fell below
the statutory minimum of 10 percent requiring an increase of capital. Looking ahead, banks’ ability
to raise fresh capital at a reasonable cost will be constrained by the negative developments in
sovereign spreads and general decline in the stock market (Figure A3.4).
The risk profile of banks has also changed, with foreign currency exposures (both assets and
liabilities) increasing. In particular, dollarization has increased from 15 percent of deposits in 2011
to 23 percent by end-2014(Figure A3.5). In addition, banks have taken advantage of supportive
global conditions to access international capital markets, issuing $3.7 billion of debt since 2011,
implying that about 20 percent of total liabilities are now denominated in foreign currency. While
this level of exposure would not necessarily point to any need for immediate concern, the relative
importance of these liabilities will automatically increase with the depreciation of the exchange rate.
Similarly, the exchange rate impact on the asset side will also increase the relative importance of
foreign currency loans, which were 21 percent of total loans as of end-2013 (Figure A3.6). Given the
exchange rate pressures, it will be important to monitor the credit quality of foreign currency assets
(which may be linked to exchange rate developments), and potential liquidity mismatches that could
also expose banks on the liabilities side. To contain such exposures the CBN has reduced the upper
limit on foreign currency borrowing from 200 percent to 75 percent of shareholders’ funds and
required banks to (i) maintain a stock of high-quality liquid foreign-currency assets; and (ii) establish
foreign currency contingency funding arrangements with other financial institutions.1
Credit concentration continues to be a concern, especially given the decline in the oil price
and its impact on the fiscal position. Lending to sectors most exposed to these negative shocks—
oil and gas, power and energy, and state governments—represent 24, 4 percent and 7 percent of
the loan book respectively. To help mitigate concentration risk going forward, the CBN has

total credit from 100 percent to 150 percent, proposed a risk weighting of 125 percent if total
lending to the oil and gas sector exceed 20 percent, emphasized the importance of strong credit
assessment and risk management of these exposures, and required banks to undertake a stress test
to evaluate the impact of oil prices (including on public sector credit) on banks’ balance sheets.
Cross-border risks are also evolving, given some deterioration in operating conditions in
other African countries. After a period of expansion into other parts of Africa (bringing the number
of foreign subsidiaries of Nigerian banks to 64 as of end-2013), two banks divested themselves of
their operations in West and East Africa in 2014, while one has yet to commence (approved)
operations in Southern Africa. In addition, two other foreign subsidiaries of Nigerian banks were
subject to regulatory actions and intervened by the Central Bank of the Gambia, of which one
remains under the direct control of the supervisor.
Nevertheless, as noted in the CBN’s June 2014 Financial Stability Report, the system remains
resilient to significant shocks to credit, interest and exchange rates. The authorities’ analysis did
illustrate, however, the relative vulnerability of small banks. In particular, a 200 percent increase in
NPLs, which would be equivalent to a complete loss on 7 percent of all loans, would result in eight
small banks becoming insolvent.2
Supervisory examinations point to some continuing weaknesses in governance, which were
also highlighted in the 2012 FSAP update. Ongoing examinations of the deposit money banks by
the CBN, including jointly with the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Company (NDIC), confirms that these
remain a source of vulnerability. In addition, compliance with regulations on foreign exchange
transactions is weak, potentially constraining the effectiveness of both monetary and prudential
policies. However, there has been welcome progress in strengthening internal audit and financial
analysis. In addition, the authorities have recently issued a new Code of Corporate Governance for
Banks and Discount Houses and they have taken the first steps in ensuring the competency of bank
directors by undertaking a baseline assessment against the newly introduced Competency
Framework. This baseline assessment indicated that only 35 percent of directors were considered to
have met the minimum requirements, largely due to a lack of professional qualifications. Banks have
been required to submit remedial plans which will be monitored by the authorities.
Deficiencies in risk management have also been revealed by these examinations. In response,
the CBN has held some workshops for banks’ risk management officers, and banks have been
reminded to minimize currency and maturity mismatch with respect to foreign currency borrowing
and lending.3

2

The stress scenario tested by the CBN is a single factor shock. Staff estimates suggest any required recapitalization
of these banks to the minimum 10 percent CAR could cost about N200 billion (¼ percent of GDP.

AMCON
Two of the three bridge banks acquired by AMCON at the time of the crisis have been sold.
AMCON had recapitalized three bridge banks at a cost of N737 billion with a 25 percent target
recovery rate (or N184 billion).4 The sales of Mainstreet and Enterprise bank were completed in
October 2014, with HBC Investment Services (a unit of Nigerian Heritage Banking Company)
acquiring Enterprise and Skye Bank acquiring Mainstreet. The recovery on the sales was 42 percent
and 32 percent of the initial investment (relative to the target 25 percent). The sale of Keystone is
slated for 2015; in anticipation, Keystone has divested itself of its businesses in Sierra Leone, and
Liberia and has been advised to enter its Gambia subsidiary into voluntary liquidation following the
loss of its banking license. Keystone is also planning to sell its insurance and healthcare units.
As of October 31, 2014, all remaining AMCON bonds held by the private sector (N867 billion)
have been redeemed. This followed the earlier redemption of bonds maturing in December 2013
(N734 billion in private sector hands). To help finance these redemptions, bonds held by the CBN
(N3.5 trillion) were restructured into a 10 year bond (N 3.8 trillion) carrying a 6 percent coupon. The
residual redemption needs were financed from the proceeds of asset sales (including N165 billion in
recoveries on non-performing loans and the sale of the bridge banks) and the Banking Sector
Resolution Cost Fund, with part of the proceeds met by the transfer of government securities from
AMCON to bondholders. The authorities indicate they are confident that the remaining liabilities (all
held by the CBN) can be met from the expected proceeds of asset recoveries and anticipated
contributions (including an annual N50 billion from the CBN) to the Banking Sector Resolution Cost
Fund. All banks have paid their 2013 contributions of 0.5 percent of total assets.
The ongoing status of AMCON remains unclear. In September 2013, AMCON assumed ownership
of and recapitalized, an insolvent discount house at a cost of about N100 billion. The authorities
believe this intervention was warranted given the exposure of a number of pension funds to the
institution; plans are underway to transform the entity into a merchant bank and sell it in 2015.
Despite this action, the authorities indicated the intention that AMCON should no longer purchase
distressed assets remains in force.

Regulatory and Supervisory Development
The authorities continue to take important steps to strengthen their supervisory and regulatory
framework.


Oversight of domestic systemically important banks (DSIBs). Eight DSIBs were initially
identified (May 2013); however, as of December 2014, only seven still qualified. This has been
followed by the introduction of an enhanced framework for their regulation and supervision
(Sept 2014), which will come into effect in March 2015. Under this framework, the identified
DSIBs would be required to meet higher capital adequacy requirements: a minimum CAR of
15 percent; Tier 1 capital should constitute at least 75 percent of the bank’s qualifying capital;
and would face an additional (higher loss absorbing (HLA)) capital surcharge of 1 percent to be
met with Common Equity Tier 1 capital.5 They will also be required to carry out solvency and
liquidity stress tests (under standardized parameters advised by the CBN) on a quarterly basis (to
be reviewed by the CBN), be subject to more intensive supervisory effort (including an expanded
reporting requirement), and to maintain and update a recovery plan (by January 1 of each year).



Implementation of Basel II/III. Full implementation of Pillar I commenced on October 1, 2014,
following a parallel run of Basel I and II capital adequacy ratio computations from January to
September 2014, based on the CBN guidance note released in December 2013. In addition, all
banks and discount houses have submitted their Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process
in compliance with Pillar II. Implementation of Pillar III (on disclosure requirements) has also
begun.



Adoption of IFRS. IFRS has been adopted by the banking sector, with two rounds of annual
financial statements now produced under IFRS. The standard is also being rolled out to
non-bank financial institutions, with discount houses, credit bureaux, and some other financial
institutions issuing IFRS-compliant financial statements for year ending December 2013.



Cross-border supervision. The CBN is focusing on executing Memorandum of Understandings
(MOUs) (to facilitate information sharing and joint supervisory activities) and engaging in
Colleges of Supervisors and cross-border examinations. As of end-2013, 14 MOUs had been
executed with host countries, including where Nigerian subsidiaries are systemic in their
jurisdictions, and one is about to be signed (with Mauritius). On-site examinations of 13 foreign
subsidiaries were undertaken in 2013, eight of which were joint with the host supervisor; two
more were undertaken in 2014. A college of supervisors for the United Bank of Africa (UBA) was
inaugurated in 2014. In parallel, work on a crisis management framework for cross-border
institutions is ongoing. The authorities indicate that MOUs have proved effective and that
cross-border collaboration with other supervisors is good. For instance, the CBN was fully

international banking license respectively.

informed of the circumstances surrounding the intervention of the two subsidiaries in the
Gambia.


Consolidated supervision and supervision of holding companies. The Financial Services
Regulation Coordination Committee (FSRCC) has developed a Framework for Consolidated
Supervision of Financial Institutions (August 2013), which has been implemented since January
2014. In addition, the CBN has issued guidelines (in 2014) to facilitate the regulation, supervision
and operation of financial holding companies.



Macroprudential oversight. The FSRCC has begun taking steps to transform itself into a more
comprehensive Financial System Stability Committee. In particular, the Financial Sector
Soundness Sub-Committee has been tasked with developing a financial stability dashboard, with
the initial version discussed in November 2014. The dashboard is focused on facilitating the
ready monitoring of risk as it evolves in key areas, including not only the macroeconomic
environment but also each of the key financial sectors, and summarizing the key vulnerabilities
and potential policy responses.



AML/CFT. Since the 2012 FSAP update, the authorities have been active in strengthening the
framework for Anti-Money Laundering (AML)/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT). To
support the broader financial inclusion agenda, tiered-Know Your Customer requirements have
been introduced to facilitate account opening and operation (within limits) even with basic
identification (e.g., a telephone number). In addition, several CBN circulars have been issued
relating to different aspects of AML/CFT; the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has issued a
strategic analysis on terrorism financing, providing clear guidance on indicators of terrorism
finance that can be monitored; and the authorities have provided training to the financial sector
on various aspects. These efforts have led to Nigeria being removed from the Financial Action
Task Force (FATF) list of jurisdictions with significant deficiencies in their AML/CFT regimes.
Nigeria is due to undergo a FATF mutual evaluation in 2016; in that context, the Presidential
Committee on Financial Action Task Force is overseeing the preparation of a national risk
assessment, which is anticipated to be completed in 2015. In addition, the FIU is planning
additional strategic analyses covering fraud and oil & gas theft issues within the next year. With
new channels of financial activity likely to emerge, especially within the context of financial
inclusion, staff encouraged enhanced vigilance and broadened oversight to adequately capture
these in the framework and ensure the continued integrity of the financial system.



Building supervisory capacity. The CBN and NDIC continue to deepen their supervisory
capacity, including through a variety of training activities, in particular in the areas of IFRS and its
interaction with prudential guidelines, and on key aspects of Basel II/III. In addition, the FSRCC
facilitates a range of joint initiatives, including on IFRS and consolidated risk-based supervision,
to enhance capacity across national financial supervisors.

Annex 4. External Sector Assessment
Current and financial accounts and exchange rate
Nigeria’s current account balance has been falling despite high oil prices (Figure A4.1). Oil and
natural gas exports predominate, comprising over 90 percent of total exports of goods and services,
but have stagnated in recent years, declining from over 25 percent of GDP before 2009 to about
15 percent of GDP in 2014. Other items in the current account have not compensated, as non-oil
exports remain below 1.5 percent of GDP and the current account deficit excluding petroleum
products has fluctuated at between 9 percent and 13 percent of GDP (Figure A4.2).

The real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated by a cumulative 29 percent since 2011
(Figure A4.3). This is largely the result of faster inflation than among trading partners, as the central
bank has kept its official rate for the naira in a narrow range against the U.S. dollar. The stronger
dollar has led to an appreciation of 6 percent in the nominal effective exchange rate since 2011.
Caution is warranted in interpreting the valuation of the naira for both theoretical and practical
reasons. As an oil producer, Nigeria should be seeking to accumulate financial assets via current
account surpluses to preserve at least a portion of the oil wealth for future generations. On the
other hand, as a low-income developing country with substantial development needs, a case could
be made for using the oil proceeds for infrastructure investment. Data gaps also add uncertainty to
the estimates, as errors and omissions outflows in the balance of payments since 2005 have been
nearly as large as the sum of current account surpluses (Figure A4.4), suggesting imprecision in
existing estimates of the current account balance and/or the net foreign asset position. Since these
unrecorded outflows have been large and persistent, they are factored into the assessment. Finally,
there were large shifts in fundamentals—namely, the oil price—at the end of 2014, to which the
economy is in the midst of adjusting.

Estimates of external equilibrium suggest the naira is moderately overvalued. In particular:


Under the External Balance Assessment methodology,1 the current account balance is modeled
as a function of its fundamentals (fiscal balance, private credit, change in reserves, net foreign
assets, oil and gas trade balance, relative income, relative GDP growth, demographics,
institutional environment, terms of trade gap, and output gap). The norm is raised by the
amount of errors and omissions outflows as maintaining external sustainability would require
running a higher current account balance to compensate (on the grounds that the errors and
omissions are a combination of unrecorded current account debits and structural capital
outflows). On this basis, the current account norm is estimated to be a surplus of 3.8 percent of
GDP (Table A3.1). The current account balance is forecast at a surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP for
2014, suggesting a gap of 1.7 percent of GDP and an overvaluation of 14 percent of GDP.2
Policies reduced the gap by 0.3 percent of GDP, suggesting that the overall macroeconomic
policy stance was not significantly hindering external sustainability. These findings point to the
need for structural policies to boost non-oil exports from their current low levels.



Under the external sustainability approach, the current account norm including errors and
omissions is set at the level that would stabilize net foreign assets-to-GDP at the end-2014 level,
taking into account the medium-term forecast. Given Nigeria’s status as an oil exporter and the
associated volatility of its current account receipts, the liquid component of net foreign assets is
emphasized. For this reason, Nigeria’s net foreign direct investment position (minus 13 percent
of GDP at end-2014) was excluded; other net foreign assets are estimated at about 7 percent of

better than the EBA-lite model did.

Accounting for only half of errors and omissions outflows in the norm does not change the finding of moderate
overvaluation.

GDP at end-2014. On this basis, the estimated norm is 2.0 percent of GDP, compared to a
medium-term forecast for the current account balance of 0.2 percent of GDP. A depreciation of
15 percent would be sufficient to reach the norm (Table A4.1).
A price-based approach that directly models the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) as a
function of its fundamentals (the terms of trade, relative income, government consumption, net
foreign assets, and remittances) within a panel framework finds that the naira is overvalued by
about 12 percent. However, given the historical volatility of Nigeria’s REER and the fit of the
model, the moderate overvaluation suggested by this approach should be viewed with caution.

Positive numbers indicate overvaluation. Elasticity of current account to real exchange rate gap is 0.12.

The results from the three approaches, viewed together with other information, suggest that the
exchange rate is moderately overvalued with respect to the level implied by Nigeria’s fundamentals.
In particular, the margin between the interbank and official exchange rates remained at 8-10 percent
in late 2014 despite the devaluation of the official rate, suggesting that demand at the official rate
continues to outstrip supply.
Reserve adequacy
Gross international reserves peaked in 2008, and have since fallen in both absolute terms and
relative to balance of payments flows. Reserves were $34.3 billion at end-December, down from
$42.8 billion at end-2013, and sufficient to cover 6 months of the next year’s projected imports
(Figure A4.5). Import cover ranged from 8-12 months through 2008.
Capital flows are becoming increasingly important to the reserves position as financial integration is
rising (Figure A4.6). Inflows to domestic government debt securities have been particularly strong
since 2011, amounting to over $18 billion or more than 3 percent of GDP (Figure A4.7).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

NIGERIA

Given these developments, reserve adequacy is being assessed against the emerging market reserve
adequacy metric instead of the metric for low-income countries.3 The emerging market metric
assesses reserves against potential balance of payments pressures: exports, broad money,
short-term external liabilities, and medium- and long-term external liabilities. The latter two
categories include all portfolio investment and other investment liabilities to non-residents,
irrespective of the place of issuance. The metric applies coefficients to each of these quantities
based on their behavior in previous episodes of balance of payments pressure. The coefficients vary
depending on exchange rate regime, with floating regimes requiring a lower level of reserves than
other regimes. Given the stability of the naira against the dollar since 2011, predominantly reflecting
central bank intervention, the regime is classified as a managed arrangement. The approach
recommends reserves amounting to 100-150 percent of the estimated metric—reserves beyond this
range were not found to have an additional impact on the frequency or severity of balance of
payments crises.
By this metric, the level ($34.3 billion) of reserves at end-December 2014 is below the low end of the
100-150 percent ($35-$52 billion) range (Figure A4.8). Reserves had been above the upper bound of
the adequate range through 2009 and in the upper half of the range through 2013. The reduction
relative to the metric owes to the decline in reserves in 2014 and increase in liabilities to nonresidents in recent years (Figure A4.9).

3

The emerging market metric assigns a greater role to capital flows than does the metric for low-income countries.

Annex 5. Debt Portfolio Analysis
Effective management of federal government debt remains a policy priority. While, overall,
Nigeria’s federal government debt is relatively low (10 percent of GDP), the debt servicing burden is
substantial with interest payments alone absorbing about 29 percent of revenues.
There is significant exposure to market risk in the portfolio. 85 percent is in the form of debt
securities and consequently vulnerable to changes in market sentiment (Figure A5.1). This risk is
concentrated in refixing (or interest rate) risk; exchange rate risk is relatively low at present with only
13 percent of the portfolio denominated in foreign currency (comprising both Eurobonds and
multilateral and bilateral loans).1
Refixing risk is significant with N 3.3 trillion (43 percent of debt securities or 4 percent of
GDP) of domestic bond and Treasury bills falling due in 2015. Further, almost 60 percent of
these securities are due by end-April (Figure A5.2 and A5.3). Nigeria has enjoyed good quality
market access—both in international capital markets and in the domestic market—readily issuing
long-term fixed rate bonds (up to 20-years in the domestic market). Consequently, the residual
maturity of the securities portfolio is relatively long at 4.5 years.
Highlighting that vulnerability has been the recent deterioration in market conditions. Nigeria
has underperformed in the international markets—for example, the spread to Gabon (also BB-) has
widened over 40 basis points since its low in July (Figure A5.4). Similarly, conditions in the domestic
market have also deteriorated, with yields having increased by around 280 basis points since
September.
The authorities have set specific strategic targets with respect to the portfolio composition. In
particular, the proportion of foreign currency debt is anticipated to increase to about 40 percent.
This would add significantly to exchange rate risk. In contrast, the goal is to reduce refixing risk in
the domestic debt portfolio by reducing the proportion of short-term debt to 25 percent of the total
(from 36 percent currently), which coupled with more external debt would result in an overall
reduction in refixing risk.
Simulating a medium-term financing strategy consistent with these goals, and taking account
of current market conditions and projected economic environment, indicates that debt will
remain contained to about 11 percent of GDP by 2019. In particular, this strategy envisages an
increase in external borrowing from all sources. The authorities indicate that existing official sector
arrangements provide for substantial new disbursements, including from China’s EXIM bank and
India on the bilateral side, and ADF and IDA on the multilateral side (though new multilateral debt
will now be on commercial terms). External market-based borrowing is also likely to increase—plans
1

Exchange rate risk is further mitigated by the relatively long residual maturity of the Eurobond portfolio of 6.2 years,

to launch a Diaspora bond are well advanced with a target of up to $300 mn for the inaugural issue,
and the authorities are actively lobbied by market participants for a new Eurobond issue. However,
reflecting the assumed increase in borrowing costs, which would see the average interest cost on
the overall portfolio increase from about 10 percent to over 11 percent, the debt servicing would
increase from 29 percent of revenues to over 35 of revenues by 2019.
The resilience of the debt portfolio also looks to be contained, even assuming significant new
external borrowing and a general deterioration in financing costs relative to the past. In
particular, stress scenarios that explore the impact of a widening of sovereign spreads, an increase in
domestic yields, and further exchange rate depreciation suggests that debt-to-GDP would only
increase by a maximum of 0.5 percent relative to the baseline.
However, the extent of the debt servicing burden means prudent management of debt should
remain a policy priority. While the overall debt burden would remain contained under stress, the
interest burden would increase further by an additional 4 percent of revenues bringing the total
burden to around 40 percent of revenues. Consequently, to ensure sufficient space to finance
desired investment, the authorities should continue to follow a prudent approach to borrowing,
remain vigilant to the trade-offs between cost and risk, and ensure the proceeds from borrowing is
managed to secure the maximum return on investment.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By
Ranil Salgado and David
Robinson (IMF) and John
Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the International Development Association (IDA)

Nigeria remains at a low risk of public external debt distress under both the baseline
macroeconomic assumptions and in stress scenarios.1 This holds even with a baseline
scenario incorporating the sharp decline in oil prices in late 2014. Overall public debt is at
a low risk of distress under the baseline, with implementation of the authorities’ fiscal
consolidation plans important for maintaining public debt sustainability. Stress scenarios
suggest that a permanent shock to economic growth or a further decline in global oil
prices would put pressure on the debt ratio unless offsetting measures were taken. In
particular, the public debt service-to-revenue ratio is high, underlining the importance of
mobilizing revenues. Data deficiencies suggest caution, especially regarding large errors
and omissions in the balance of payments (possibly reflecting an underestimation of
current account debit transactions)2 which lead to large observed residuals in the external
DSA presentation.

1

The LIC debt sustainability framework (DSF) provides a methodology for assessing external debt sustainability
which is guided by indicative, country-specific, debt burden thresholds based on the relative strength of a country’s
policies and institutions. Given Nigeria’s rating of 3.5 (medium performer), which is the three year average of the
World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), the relevant country-specific thresholds are a PV of
external debt to GDP of 40 percent, a PV of external debt to exports of 150 percent, and an external debt service to
exports ratio of 20 percent.
2

For instance, errors and omissions averaged -4.4 percent of GDP from 2009-2013.

B. Macroeconomic Assumptions
2.

The assumptions used in the baseline scenario for 2014–34 are:



GDP grows as in the staff report baseline through 2020 before accelerating in the
medium term as structural reforms take hold, averaging 6.1 percent in 2014–34 (below
the average of 6.8 percent assumed for the 2013–33 analysis, and below the 6.8 percent
historical average).



Consistent with the recent decline in oil prices and their expected path in the medium
term (based on the January 2015 World Economic Outlook (WEO) projections), the
analysis assumes a Nigerian oil price of $100 per barrel in 2014, falling to $52.8 per barrel
in 2015, recovering moderately by 2020 to $73.7 dollars per barrel, remaining constant in
real terms thereafter.4



The non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) of the general government is expected to decline
from 8.1 percent of non-oil GDP in 2014 to about 4.7 percent of non-oil GDP in 2020. In
the baseline scenario, given Nigeria’s current low levels of government expenditure, this

is implemented as keeping primary expenditure-to-GDP relatively flat at its planned 2015
level and increasing non-oil revenue.5 This takes into account the consolidation plans
embedded in the 2015–17 Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, including policies to
raise non-oil revenue and control operating expenses. On that basis, the Excess Crude
Account accumulates gradually, reaching about 1 percent of GDP by 2020. With the
importance of oil revenue to the economy and fiscal accounts expected to decline over
time, the NOPD would continue to adjust, arriving at a deficit of about 2.5 percent of
GDP in 2034.




Given the expected behavior of oil prices and production volumes that are projected to
be flat, exports are assumed to grow less rapidly than the rest of the economy
notwithstanding the projected continuation of the recent rapid growth in non-oil
exports.6 Imports are projected to grow in line with the non-oil economy. Consequently,
the current account surplus declines to 0.2 percent of GDP by 2020, and turns into a
deficit of ½ percent of GDP by 2034.
N400 billion of contingent liabilities from the Asset Management Company of Nigeria
(AMCON) bonds are assumed to materialize as ultimate fiscal cost for the federal
government in 2023 (equivalent to 0.16 percent of GDP in 2023).7

C. External Sustainability
Baseline
3.
In the baseline scenario (Table 1 and Figure 1), the nominal gross external debt burden is
projected to gradually increase. The external debt-to-GDP ratio would rise from 1.7 percent in
2013 to 5.5 percent in 2034. The debt service-to-exports and the debt service-to-revenue ratios
also rise gradually during the projection period. All debt and debt service indicators remain well
below their respective threshold levels throughout the projection period.

Stress Tests
4.
Standardized stress tests were carried out (Table 2 and Figure 1). The scenario shocking
export values was run for 2016-17, since the baseline for 2015 already incorporates a large
decline due to the fall in oil prices. Under all scenarios: (i) the PV of debt is not likely to exceed

5

See “Raising Non-Oil Revenue” in Nigeria: Selected Issues for a discussion of options.

6

Oil exports account for over 90 percent of exports and through 2013 about 70 percent of government revenue.

7

The Sinking Fund is estimated to be worth N6.1 trillion at the end of 2023 based on annual contributions of
0.5 percent of total assets by Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) (about N24 trillion at end-2013) and N50 billion
annual contributions by the CBN, all accruing a 10 percent nominal return. The fund will be used to pay net
interest expenses on its bonds and to fill the gap in AMCON’s balance sheet (assets and liabilities were about
N2.5 trillion and N6.0 trillion, respectively, as of end-2013).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NIGERIA

10 percent of GDP throughout the projection period; and (ii) the PV of debt-to-exports ratio is far
below its indicative debt burden threshold of 150 percent.

D. Fiscal Sustainability
Baseline
5.
Gross debt of the federal and state governments is estimated at 13.4 percent of GDP at
end-2014, up from less than 10 percent of GDP through 2010, and is projected to rise modestly
during the forecast horizon (Table 3). Debt service and debt-to-revenue ratios are also projected
to increase relative to recent history and previous forecasts, as a result of the rising level of debt
and the recent decline in oil prices and oil price futures. This illustrates Nigeria’s reliance on oil
revenue in government funding, and underscores the importance of mobilizing non-oil revenue
to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in oil prices. The current structure of domestic debt is
favorable, with all debt carrying a fixed interest rate and the average maturity at 4.5 years.
Similarly, external debt is largely on concessional terms other than the Eurobonds, and is
contracted at long maturities. The forecast assumes an increase in the share of external debt
contracted at commercial terms, with the grant element of external disbursements falling to less
than 10 percent during the projection period. Oil and gas revenue is projected to decline as a
share of GDP due to the recent drop in prices and flat production volumes going forward. It is
assumed that the authorities will reduce expenditure or raise non-oil revenue in the medium
term to offset this decline. Thus, these findings are highly sensitive to the resolute
implementation of fiscal consolidation.

Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
6.
The stress tests underscore the need for fiscal policy to adjust to the economic
environment. In particular, the present value of debt in 2034 would increase to 40 percent of
GDP if the primary balance is kept unchanged at its 2014 level (Table 4 and Figure 2). Public debt
dynamics could also become adverse if growth is permanently lower than in the baseline, with
gross public debt rising to 33 percent of GDP in 2034. In such adverse scenarios, the debt
service-to-revenue ratio would increase substantially from current levels and fiscal policy would
need to adjust accordingly. Temporary shocks would be unlikely to significantly alter the
conclusion that the risk of debt distress is low, as the other macroeconomic shocks considered
do not bring about significant changes in the projected debt ratio.8 However, in the presence of
shocks to either the primary balance or to other debt-creating flows (contingent liabilities), debt
service-to-revenue ratios would increase, illustrating the importance of rebuilding fiscal buffers
over the medium term. To the extent that the staff’s fiscal policy assumptions under the baseline
scenario (including gradual improvements in the primary deficit over the medium term) do not
materialize, risks to debt sustainability would be higher.
8

The shock to the primary balance is performed for 2016-2017, with half the shock coming from lower revenues.
This scenario illustrates the impact from oil prices remaining at about current levels over that period.

E. Authorities’ views
7.
The authorities concurred that both external and overall public debt risks were low
provided that their fiscal consolidation plans are implemented as intended. They agreed,
however, that timely policy responses would be necessary in the event of a prolonged economic
growth shock or further substantial decline in oil prices.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement. The Central Bank of Nigeria
(CBN) explicitly aims to maintain an exchange rate fundamentally driven by market forces, but
intervenes to reduce volatility and to counteract speculative attacks on the national currency. In
recent years it has maintained an exchange rate band vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar (the band was
increased from ±3% to ±5% in 2014) and has recently allowed adjustment of the band’s midpoint in
response to market forces (the last adjustment in November 2014). The de facto exchange rate
arrangement is also other managed arrangement. In spite of some stability of the Naira-U.S. dollar
exchange rate, the nominal effective exchange rate has fluctuated considerably in recent years. The
CBN publishes information on its interventions through auctions on its website; and data on
interventions in the interbank market are disseminated. Nigeria is a signatory to the W-ERM II of the
WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the naira and the U.S. dollar be
maintained within ±15% around the central rate. The CBN has opted to use a narrower band. The
foreign exchange market comprises the Dutch Auction System (DAS), the interbank, and bureau de
change segments. Multiple currency prices are a technical characteristic of the Dutch auction system
and give rise to a multiple currency practice under Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement.
Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the CBN was subject to a full safeguards assessment
with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement that expired on October 31, 2001. The assessment, which
included an on-site visit, was completed on November 28, 2001. The assessment concluded that
vulnerabilities existed in the areas of financial reporting and legal structure of the Central Bank.
Article IV Consultation
Nigeria is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The previous Article IV
consultation was concluded on February 21, 2014.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of December 31, 2014)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Macroeconomic data are broadly adequate for surveillance; however data deficiencies—in
particular, inadequate information on subnational public finances and large errors and omissions in the
balance of payments—remain. The Statistics Act of 2007, which established the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS) as the main coordinating agency for data management, has led to a number of
improvements, including better information sharing between data producing and collecting agencies.
There has been an improvement in the compilation of timely and internally consistent data, for
example, the Government Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS) is now used
for budget preparations and the coverage of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) is increasing. These
efforts however need to be extended to the subnational levels.
National accounts: Basic statistics are extensively available for the compilation of national accounts
and the NBS employed major methodological updates in 2014 by adopting the System of National
Accounts (SNA 2008 version), the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC revision 4). The
weaknesses associated with the reliance on the consumer price index to construct the constant price
GDP series has improved by developing the supply and use table (SUT) framework (first time in its
history) and collecting producer price data. The introduction of additional indices, such as a producer
price index, would facilitate more accurate estimation of the constant price measure. The authorities
have received and continue to receive Technical Assistance (TA) from the Fund, World Bank, and
African Development Bank in completing a GDP rebasing exercise and for the next rebasing in 2015.
The rebased GDP (base year=2010) and supply and use table reflected the significant change that has
taken place in the structure of the economy since the previous rebasing in 1990. In addition, the
conduct of a census of businesses, a census of agriculture, and a household living conditions survey in
2014 will contribute to further improvements in the measurement of GDP.
Prices statistics: The official monthly consumer price index (CPI), a composite of urban and rural price
data, is available on a timely basis. The index has been re-referenced to November 2009=100, using
the 2003/04 National Consumer Expenditure Survey to update the 1996/97 survey-based expenditure
weights. Work is also underway to assess the concepts and methods used to compile the consumer
price index (CPI).
Government finance statistics: The most pressing shortcoming is related to inadequate data
coverage, particularly of the subnational governments, which comprise almost one half of total
government expenditure. The federal government has limited information on the subnational
fiscal accounts, making it difficult to target a consolidated fiscal balance; efforts to address this
issue have been stymied by constitutional restrictions. The CBN disseminates survey data on state
and local governments budgets, but responses do not necessarily follow the same definitions, and
these data are not consolidated with data from other levels of government. To facilitate the timely
preparation of a consolidated set of fiscal accounts, however, governments at all levels need to
use budget classification, chart of accounts, and accounting systems that will allow consistent

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

NIGERIA

classifications of the data. Current plans for nationwide adoption of International Public Sector
Accounting Standards (IPSAS) on a cash basis at the Federal and State levels by end-2015 should
be instrumental to this end. There is also a need to formalize the publication of government
accounts on a monthly or quarterly basis and to increase coverage to report on the operations of
parastatals.
Monetary and financial statistics: There have been significant improvements in the compilation
of monetary statistics. There is need for more granular measures of commercial banks’ foreign assets
and liabilities. The definition of the other depository corporations (ODCs) sector should also be
extended beyond commercial banks to also capture other deposit-taking financial institutions, such as
merchant banks and non-interest banks.
Financial soundness indicators: A broad range of information on the financial sector, including both
core and a number of non-core financial soundness indicators, is compiled by the CBN. The CBN is
currently working with support from STA to improve the methodology used to compile FSIs and
enhance the consolidation basis to capture cross-border activities of Nigerian bank subsidiaries and
branches.

Balance of payments: There have been significant efforts to improve the compilation of Nigeria’s
balance of payments data in recent years. Supported by IMF technical assistance, the authorities have
expanded the range and improved the quality of data sources, aimed at strengthening the balance of
payments and producing an international investment position.
There are however still large errors and omissions in the balance of payments, which complicate the
assessment of external sustainability. There is a need for improved validation of transactions reported
by banks, measurement of transactions outside the banking system, appropriate treatment of
transactions of enterprises in free trade zone (using a residency criterion) and improved coverage of
estimates of the external assets and liabilities of the banking sector. The DFID/GDDS Phase III Module,
launched in 2010 and covering a five-year period, is helping improve source data by recording more
accurately cross-border private capital flows and stocks.
The authorities have not yet initiated compilation of international reserves data in line with the Data
Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity.
External debt: Public external debt data are of good quality and available on a timely basis. The Debt
Management Office (DMO) is collaborating closely with the CBN to extend the coverage of their
database to include private sector liabilities and foreign investment in domestically issued debt
securities.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Prepared By

African Department

This supplement provides information that has become available since the issuance of
the staff report on February 17, 2015. The information does not alter the thrust of the
staff appraisal.
1.

Political and Economic Developments.



On Saturday, February 7, the Independent National Electoral Commission announced
that it was postponing general elections by six weeks—Presidential and
parliamentary elections are now scheduled for March 28, and state elections for
April 11. The postponement was based on the advice of the security forces that they
could not guarantee the peaceful conduct of elections given the launch of a major
offensive against Boko Haram.



Financial markets continue to weaken and remain volatile. In the week following the
postponement of the elections, the Nigeria Stock Exchange lost 6 percent, bond
yields widened 100 basis points, and sovereign spreads by almost 40 basis points,
and in the interbank foreign exchange market (IFEM), the naira depreciated by
4½ percent with the spread between the rates in the IFEM and the retail Dutch
Auction System (rDAS) window exceeding 20 percent.



Reflecting ongoing intervention in the IFEM, gross international reserves (30-day
moving average), which ended 2014 at $34.5 billion, have further declined to
$32.3 billion as of February 19.

2.


Policy Development.
On February 18, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) closed the rDAS window at which
it had been providing foreign exchange for a specific list of activities at a rate of
N168 per U.S. dollar with a band of ±5 percent. All foreign exchange demand is now
to be met in the IFEM, with the CBN committing to intervene in the IFEM to meet

NIGERIA

legitimate demands for foreign exchange. The Naira has been trading in the IFEM at
about N198 per U.S. dollar, so that the move implies an 18 percent devaluation in
the official exchange rate.


3.

The Medium Term Expenditure Framework, which sets the 2015 budget, passed the
second reading in the National Assembly and was sent to the Joint Committee on
Finance for deliberation whilst the National Assembly went on recess ahead of the
February 14 scheduled election. The authorities are continuing discussions and
anticipate submitting soon a revised set of budget assumptions to the National
Assembly.
Implications.



The closure of the rDAS window is in line with staff advice and removes a major
economic distortion. However, as the CBN remains the largest single supplier of
foreign exchange, it will be important for the CBN to intermediate this supply in a
transparent and efficient manner, while facilitating price discovery.



The impact of this change on growth, inflation, and the balance of payments is likely
to be modest as the bulk of transactions were already at the IFEM rate. Market
reaction to the change has been broadly positive and rates have stabilized; however,
liquidity in the market is reportedly thin.



The recent recovery in oil prices—the Brent futures average price for 2015 has
recovered from $53/barrel on January 20 to $61/barrel on February 20—together
with a possible revision to the 2015 budget, suggest that the fiscal position might
improve relative to what is projected in the Staff Report.



In view of the closure of the rDAS window, the description of the “Exchange Rate
Arrangement” contained in the Informational Annex should be amended to:
Exchange Rate Arrangement
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement. The Central
Bank of Nigeria (CBN) explicitly aims to maintain an exchange rate fundamentally
driven by market forces, but intervenes to reduce volatility and to counteract
speculative attacks on the national currency. In recent years it has maintained an
exchange rate band vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar (the band was increased from ±3 percent
to ±5 percent in November, 2014) and has allowed adjustment of the band’s
midpoint in response to market forces (the last adjustment in November 2014). On
February 18, 2015, the CBN announced the closure of its Dutch Auction System
(DAS) window and requested all foreign exchange transactions to be effected
through the interbank market. The de facto exchange rate arrangement remains
other managed arrangement. In spite of some stability of the Naira-U.S. dollar

exchange rate, the nominal effective exchange rate has fluctuated considerably in
recent years. Nigeria is a signatory to the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires
that the spot exchange rate between the naira and the U.S. dollar be maintained
within ±15 percent around the central rate. The foreign exchange market comprises

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Nigeria

On February 27, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Nigeria.
Nigeria has a large and diverse economy that has achieved a decade of strong growth, averaging
6.8 percent a year, and now accounts for 35 percent of Sub-Saharan Africa’s gross domestic
product (GDP). Inflation has remained in single digits for two years, and the banking sector,
which has a strong capital base, is expanding credit. The trade surplus has been declining since
the second quarter of 2013 on lower oil exports and continued strong growth of imports, and
gross international reserves have been falling. Meanwhile, the general government fiscal deficit
and public debt have been kept low. However, Nigeria still lags its peers in critical infrastructure
and has high rates of poverty and income inequality. While the economy is diverse, with services
accounting for over 50 percent of GDP in 2013, and oil only 13 percent, the oil sector remains a
critical source for revenue and foreign exchange. With limited fiscal and external buffers
($2 billion in the excess crude account and $34.25 billion in gross international reserves,
respectively at the end of 2014), the sharp decline of oil prices in the second half of 2014
underscores the challenging but compelling need to address remaining development challenges.
The authorities have responded to a sharp decline in oil prices. On February 18, 2015, the
Central Bank of Nigeria closed the Dutch Auction System (rDAS) window, unifying the rDAS
rate with interbank foreign exchange market rate. On February 25, 2015, the Senate approved the
third revision to the 2015 budget, tightening the fiscal envelope by lowering the budget
benchmark oil price to $52/barrel.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms
the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

In 2015, oil exports are projected to decline by 6 percent of GDP from the 2014 level, and oil
revenue by 2 percent. A sharp contraction of public investment and domestic demand is
projected to reduce growth to 4.75 percent in 2015 from 6.3 percent in 2014. Inflation is
projected to rise to 11.5 percent by the end of 2015 from 8 percent at end 2014, reflecting the
pass through from exchange rate depreciation. The outlook is subject to downside risks, both
external (changes in oil market developments and investor sentiment) and domestic (uncertainty
over the election outcome and the security situation).

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for progress in promoting Nigeria’s economic
diversification and for their macroeconomic response to collapsing export prices. Directors
noted, however, that vulnerabilities remain high in view of the uncertainties about oil price,
security, and the political situation, and concurred that additional policy adjustments and broader
structural reforms will be necessary in the period ahead to reconstitute buffers, mitigate risks,
and meet pressing development needs.
Directors agreed that tightening fiscal policy and allowing the exchange rate to depreciate while
using some of the reserve buffer were appropriate responses to the recent fall in oil prices.
Nonetheless, Directors stressed that achieving the authorities’ fiscal targets will require a careful
prioritization of public spending and a cautious implementation of capital projects. They also
highlighted the importance of improved budgeting at the level of state and local governments to
help better manage their fiscal adjustment.
Directors agreed that mobilizing additional non oil revenues is critical to open up fiscal space
and improve public service delivery over the medium term. They welcomed ongoing initiatives
to strengthen tax administration, and encouraged the authorities to also rein in exemptions, keep
tax rates under review, persevere with subsidy reform, and improve the management of oil
revenue. Furthermore, Directors saw merit in reviewing the current revenue sharing
arrangements to help address regional disparities over the longer term and ensure that social and
development needs are addressed.
Directors welcomed the recent unification of the foreign exchange rates, noting that greater
exchange rate flexibility could help cushion external shocks. As the largest single supplier of
foreign exchange, it will be important for the central bank to intermediate this supply in a

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used
in summing up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors noted that financial soundness indicators remain above prudential norms, but the
concentration of credit risks and foreign currency exposures call for continued close oversight.
They welcomed progress in strengthening supervision and regulation, including of cross border
activities, and encouraged additional initiatives to foster financial market development, including
of hedging instruments, and improve financial inclusion.
Directors emphasized that Nigeria’s longer term prospects rest on lowering oil dependency and
strengthening private sector’s participation in economic activity. Lasting and more inclusive
growth calls for improving the business environment, promoting youth and female employment,
and advancing human capital development.
Directors noted that Nigeria’s economic data are broadly adequate for surveillance. Nonetheless,
they encouraged the authorities to further improve statistics, in particular as regards the balance
of payments.

Statement by Ms. Kapwepwe, Executive Director for Nigeria
and Mr. Uwatt, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
February 27, 2015
In spite of the severe negative oil price shock since the second half of 2014, the Nigerian
economy has maintained its decade long strong performance amidst enormous but
manageable developmental challenges. This was made possible by the adoption of
contingency policy measures to deal with the oil shock and at the same time implementing
the reform agenda which is aimed at placing the economy on a more diversified, sustainable,
and inclusive growth trajectory. While the authorities recognize the negative effect of the oil
shock on the economy, they expect that the impact would be less than envisaged by staff on
account of measures put in place. They are equally aware of the various concerns raised by
staff in the report including revenue redistribution mechanism for dealing with regional
disparity and poverty reduction. They are focused on addressing these issues within the
provision of the law and subsisting political arrangements some of which were achieved after
complex compromises. Overall, the authorities are grateful to staff for the fruitful discussions
during the mission and the Executive Board for the support.
Macroeconomic developments and outlook
Economic performance in 2014 was good with real GDP growth estimated at about 6.23
percent compared to 5.49 percent in 2013 and 5.94 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Growth was
generally driven by the non-oil sector. Headline inflation moderated to 8.0 percent y-o-y in
December 2014 pretty much within the 6-9 percent Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) target
band on account of discreet monetary policy stance and improved domestic food production.
Fiscal management, particularly in the last quarter of the year, was challenging due to oil
revenue underperformance occasioned by lower international oil prices and domestic
production. This notwithstanding, fiscal deficit is projected to remain within the target one
percent of GDP and the overall public debt, particularly public external debt, is at low risk of
distress. In addition, the pressure on the external sector increased with the current account
deficit projected to worsen on account of the oil shock. The exchange rate was broadly stable
until the recent speculative attack and international reserves, though declining, were still
adequate to cover at least six months of imports.
Uncertainties surrounding oil price movements, global economic growth and domestic
political and security environments pose significant downside risks to the economy. With the

2
measures currently being implemented to contain these risks, the macroeconomic outlook is
expected to remain favorable.
Fiscal policy
The authorities' focus is on addressing the emerging fiscal risk, particularly oil revenue
shortfall with the overall objective of achieving fiscal and debt sustainability in the mediumterm. Accordingly, serious attention would continue to be given to non-oil revenue
mobilization, including tax reforms (VAT and CIT), broadening of the tax revenue base, and
improvement in tax administration. In this regard, significant actions to boost revenue have
already been outlined in the 2015 budget and further measures are expected to be taken as
warranted. Efforts are also underway to enhance transparency of fiscal operations of all
public institutions that collect revenues, including ensuring that excess funds are deposited
into the Government Consolidated Revenue Fund.
Public spending would continue to be oriented towards social and productive sectors,
including transportation and energy infrastructure. In doing this, steps would be taken to
consistently align expenditures to expected revenues and ensure that the near-term fiscal
deficit target is met. This would involve prioritization of projects and greater involvement of
private investors in the execution of those projects considered critical to growth. Moreover,
the authorities do not intend to close the financing gap under the National Infrastructure
Investment Plan through external borrowing.
The authorities have continued to improve public financial management through the use of
the right technologies such as biometrics and digitizing government payments. Discussions
are going on regarding how to extend this to subnational level. Oil subsidy reform remains a
key priority of the government. However, in view of the highly sensitive nature of the
exercise, the timing has to be appropriate to avoid social and political consequences as
witnessed in January 2012. The various options, timing and modalities for implementation of
the reform are under consideration by the various stakeholders.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
Monetary policy would continue to support the broader macroeconomic policy objectives of
government, including maintaining low and stable inflation, exchange rate stability, and
enhancing access to banking services for the under-banked. In the past years, a cautious
monetary policy stance helped keep inflation within single digit. This monetary policy stance
is expected to continue in the near-to-medium term with adjustments to contain any emerging
vulnerabilities.

3
On exchange rate, government’s intention is to allow market forces to drive its movement
with exchange rate flexibility remaining the first line of defense in the presence of external
shocks. Intervention in the foreign exchange market would be limited to smoothening
excessive volatility of the exchange rate and liquidity management in response to disorderly
market conditions. This has been demonstrated by the recent closure by the CBN of its Dutch
Auction System (retail and wholesale) foreign exchange window in order to avert the
emergence of a multiple exchange rate regime occasioned by the widening margin between
the rates at the interbank and retail Dutch Auction System window. This action marks a
significant move towards a unified foreign exchange market (the interbank foreign exchange
market) where there is basically only one exchange rate determined largely by market forces.
Going forward, the authorities will continue to monitor closely developments in the interbank
foreign exchange market and take intervention and prudential measures that would ensure the
smooth functioning of the market.
Financial sector policies
The financial system remains stable, adequately capitalized, profitable and liquid. It is also
resilient to significant shocks to credit, interest and exchange rates. This has been made
possible by the strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory framework for the banking
and non-bank financial institutions including their foreign subsidiaries. Moreover,
collaboration among the regulatory authorities of the financial system has been enhanced
through the Financial Supervision and Regulation Coordinating Committee. Going forward,
the authorities would continue to work towards ensuring financial sector resilient through
improvement of the corporate governance framework, recovery and resolution framework,
oversight of holding companies, as well as consolidated and cross-border supervision.
The implementation of the financial inclusion policy under the 2012 National Financial
Inclusion Strategy is progressing as planned. The aim is to reduce the percentage of Nigerian
adults that are excluded from financial services from 46.3 percent in 2010 to 20 percent in
2020. As at 2014, the exclusion rate has reduced to 39.5 percent. Some progress has also
been made in usage of financial services (payments, savings, credit, insurance, and pensions),
and access channels. Notwithstanding this progress, the authorities are mindful of the
regulatory/supervisory challenges which may emerge in the process. Accordingly, they are
working to strengthen internal capacity within the CBN and improve engagement with
stakeholders through the National Payment Systems Board.
Structural policies
The authorities’ are implementing bold and comprehensive structural reform measures to
raise potential growth, diversify the economy and improve competitiveness and the business

4
climate. The overall strategy is to create a private sector driven economy supported by
appropriate government policies and incentives. In this regard, priority attention has been
given to sectors considered as growth drivers and enhancers including power, roads,
agriculture, manufacturing, oil and gas, creative industries, housing, and information and
communication technology. There are also targeted special financing schemes for the private
sector including small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs).
The authorities are also intensifying job creation efforts through several initiatives targeted at
youths and women which combine training with financial assistance that will enable
beneficiaries set up their businesses. The authorities are equally working closely with the
World Bank to build social safety nets that would include conditional cash transfer for the
promotion of primary and secondary education and improvement of maternal and child care.
Conclusion
2014 was a particularly difficult year as revenue shortfall occasioned by the oil price shock
affected economic performance. The fiscal outlook for the medium-term is likely to be
equally challenging unless there is a significant rebound in the oil price. Whichever direction
the oil price goes, there is obviously no alternative to a resilient, diversified, and more
inclusive non-oil economy. It is in this regard that the authorities are focused on deepening
and widening the diversification drive through the implementation of the various reform
measures. These measures are expected to accelerate the pace of decline in poverty and
reduce income inequality and regional disparity in the medium-to-long term.
