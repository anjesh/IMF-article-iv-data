STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 12, 2013

KEY ISSUES
The Japanese authorities have embarked on an ambitious agenda to raise growth and
exit deflation. The new policy framework—“three-arrows” of Abenomics comprising
aggressive monetary easing, flexible fiscal policy, and structural reforms—provides a unique
opportunity to end decades-long deflation and sluggish growth, and reverse the rise of public
debt.
The new policies are buoying the near-term outlook. Unprecedented monetary easing
supported by fiscal stimulus is leading to a pickup in domestic demand with GDP growth
projected at 2 percent this year and inflation rising gradually.
However, all three arrows need to be launched for the policies to succeed. Uncertainty
about the ambition of fiscal and structural reforms is adding to underlying risks. The
government has recently outlined broad growth and fiscal strategies, but specific measures or
a more concrete timetable in some areas remain to be formulated. Incomplete progress on
fiscal and structural reforms could weigh on confidence and undermine the success of the new
policy framework.
With its new monetary policy framework, the BoJ has taken the lead to end deflation.
Careful communication and continued flexibility in implementing its policies is needed to
contain financial market volatility and ensure an effective transmission of its easing policies.
However, a credible medium-term fiscal plan should be adopted as quickly as possible
as fiscal risks have risen further. Raising the consumption tax rate to 10 percent, while
maintaining a uniform rate by 2015 is an essential first step, but the government also needs to
formulate a concrete set of growth-friendly revenue and expenditure measures for
implementation in the medium term to achieve a declining debt-to-GDP ratio.
In addition, the government’s structural reforms need to be concrete and
comprehensive. To generate growth synergies, measures should include deregulation in
agriculture and domestic services, lifting constraints to the provision of risk capital, reducing
Japan’s excessive labor market duality, reforming the tax system to stimulate investment, and
further relaxing immigration requirements to areas with labor shortages.
Comprehensive reforms are also needed to further strengthen financial sector stability.
They can reduce banks’ bond holdings and create lending opportunities at home and abroad.
However, new challenges could also arise, particularly for regional banks, if fiscal and growth
reforms disappoint.
If a full package of reforms is implemented, the current moderate exchange rate
undervaluation would be eliminated over time and the global economy would benefit.
Failure to follow through on fiscal and structural reforms could, however, lead to overreliance
on monetary policy with negative consequences for Japan and the global economy.

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
1.
In December, the new government announced an ambitious policy framework to end
decades-long deflation and raise growth. The “three-arrows” of Abenomics approach (aggressive
monetary easing, flexible fiscal policy, and structural reforms) calls for a coordinated policy effort by
the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the government to jumpstart the economy and create sustained growth
synergies through bold structural reforms.
2.

The announcement of the new policy regime was followed by a quick set of actions.



Fiscal stimulus. In February, the Diet approved 1.4 percent of GDP of new debt-financed
spending to be executed during 2013–14.



A new monetary policy framework. In April, the BoJ introduced the quantitative and qualitative
monetary easing (QQME) framework to achieve its 2 percent inflation target with a time horizon
of about two years. Under QQME, the BoJ aims to double the monetary base—its new
operational target—by 2014 to around 55 percent of GDP. Monetary easing was broadened to
include longer-dated government securities, and purchases of risk assets were expanded. The
BoJ also committed to continue with easing until 2 percent inflation is achieved in a stable
manner.



Outlines of fiscal and growth strategies. In June, the government reaffirmed its fiscal
consolidation goals of halving the primary deficit by FY2015—from the FY2010 level—and
achieving a primary surplus by FY2020, with measures to be developed in the coming months.
The announcement also included a broad outline of a comprehensive growth strategy, which
targets to raise investment, employment, and productivity, with details to be developed
beginning this summer.

3.
Upper House elections in July may increase the ruling coalition’s current political
momentum to push forward its policy agenda. Following a landslide victory in December, Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe’s approval ratings remain high. The Liberal Democratic Party, together with its
junior partner, New Komeito, has a two-thirds majority in the Lower House, but currently does not
have a majority in the Upper House.
4.
Against the background of structural and external headwinds, Japan now needs to
follow through with concrete growth and fiscal reforms. The task of raising growth is made more
difficult by a rapidly aging labor force and the need to start with fiscal consolidation to maintain
confidence in the sustainability of public finances. A still sluggish global recovery and volatile global
financial markets are further complicating the task. Hence, this year’s Article IV consultation focused
on the key elements of a comprehensive reform package to lift Japan out of a high-debt, lowgrowth, and mild-deflation environment that has generated substantial financial and fiscal
vulnerabilities and poses a risk to economic stability at home and via spillovers abroad.

A STIMULUS-DRIVEN BUT UNCERTAIN RECOVERY
A. Recent Developments
5.
Financial and exchange markets were buoyant in early 2013 and the immediate
aftermath of QQME. From September 2012 to mid-May 2013, the Nikkei rose by about 80 percent,
with large gains for export-oriented firms and financial institutions. The rise in the stock market
occurred in tandem with the strong depreciation of the yen (down 17 percent in real effective terms
between end-December 2012 and end-June 2013). Upon adoption of the BoJ’s new policy
framework in April, bond yields declined briefly to historic lows with the 10-year rate reaching
45 basis points.
6.
Growth accelerated sharply in early 2013 (Figure 1). First quarter GDP growth jumped to
4.1 percent (SAAR) after two quarters of stagnation. Wealth effects from rising equity values
stimulated consumption, particularly of luxury goods. A rebound in real export growth
(+3.8 percent, q/q) was helped by strong regional demand and a weaker yen. Private investment was
flat, as it tends to lag rather than lead exports and because of uncertainty about future growth and
corporate tax policies. These generally positive developments were confirmed in May through
a further rise in industrial production (2 percent m/m) and retail sales (1.5 percent m/m).
7.
Although there has been some reversal lately, inflation expectations have increased
and headline inflation is slowly rising (Figure 2). Inflation is still lagging at −0.3 percent (y/y) in
May, but prices have been rising for three months on a sequential basis. The latter is consistent with
the increase in long-term inflation expectations since end 2012, albeit even at their peak they were
still well below the BoJ’s inflation target. Indicators of inflation expectations derived from inflationlinked bonds (also known as break-even rates) have trended down since late May, possibly reflecting
a reassessment of future growth following the outline of the government’s growth strategy (though
the liquidity of those bonds is relatively thin). Overseas factors might also have played a role as
a similar decline is observed in the U.S. following the revised market expectation of an earlier exit
from quantitative easing.
8.
In recent months, financial markets have corrected and volatility has increased, driven
by domestic and overseas factors. In mid-April,

Second, questions emerged about the strength of Japan’s new growth strategy. Third, these moves
coincided with rising yields and volatility overseas amid a general repricing of risk in global markets.
More recently, JGB-yield volatility has declined, although it remains elevated as also indicated by
rates on swaptions and options on JGB futures.
9.
The depreciation of the yen has occurred without a notable pickup in net capital
outflows or improvement in the current account (Figure 3). The steady depreciation since
November 2012 reflected several factors, including the new monetary policy framework, the reversal
of safe haven effects, and a structural weakening of the trade balance from higher energy imports.
Since the beginning of 2013, residents have been net sellers of foreign bonds and equities, while
nonresidents have been selling Japanese bonds and notes, but buying equities instead. Indeed, large
changes in the yen often appear to coincide with changes in derivatives positions that are taken in
anticipation of real capital in- or outflows. The current account surplus has continued to decline as
a result of high energy imports, although exports have rebounded helped by recovering exports to
China since the trough in November 2012 and a weaker yen.

B. Outlook for Growth and External Stability
10.
Buoyed by stimulus, the near-term outlook has improved considerably (Table 1).
Business conditions have continued to improve as indicated by the second-quarter Tankan Survey
results released on July 1. Growth in 2013 is projected at 2 percent, mainly as a result of the new
fiscal stimulus and monetary easing feeding through to private consumption and with some lag to
investment. A strengthening of external demand—helped by depreciation—and frontloading of
consumption and residential investment ahead of the April 2014 consumption tax increase would
further support the recovery. In 2014, growth is expected to moderate to 1.2 percent as a continued
pickup in private domestic demand is offset by fiscal withdrawal from the consumption tax increase
and an unwinding of reconstruction spending (2¼ percent of GDP), as well as weaker global growth.
11.
The outlook for inflation depends critically on how inflation expectations adapt to the
new framework. Inflation is projected to gradually

increase in inflation expectations.
12.
The medium-term outlook is favorable, but unusually uncertain. With QQME, the BoJ
has fundamentally changed its monetary policy approach and there is little policy experience to draw
on in how to escape from a sustained deflation. Moreover, only broad outlines of structural and fiscal
reforms have been announced—as a result, the baseline is based on a partial launch of the three

arrows1—leaving uncertainty about long-term growth and fiscal risks on the table. An uncertain
energy outlook further complicates the assessment. Bearing this in mind, staff’s baseline estimates
project that inflation will reach 2 percent in the medium term while potential growth converges to
the pre-global financial crisis level of about 1 percent as a result of a pickup in the pace of capital
accumulation.
13.
Following the recent depreciation, the yen appears to be moderately undervalued,
although as long as a full package of reforms is implemented, this would not be seen as
problematic (Table 2 and Appendix I).


The current account is moderately stronger vis-à-vis its value implied by fundamentals and
desirable policies, but its future path is difficult to ascertain. Taking into account the delayed
impact of the large depreciation since last year and the effect of the higher energy imports on
the trade balance, the underlying current account appears moderately stronger than implied by
fundamentals and desirable policies with a midpoint estimate of ½ percent of GDP. However,
this point estimate has a wide range from 1 percent of GDP weaker to 2 percent of GDP stronger
as a result of the estimated bands around the underlying current account and the current
account norm. For the former, the range is 2.5-4.5 percent of GDP as a result of uncertainty
about the permanence of elevated energy imports and different trade elasticities. The range for
the latter, the current account norm, is 2.5-3.5 percent of GDP and a result of different estimates
how the new macroeconomic framework will affect fundamentals and desirable policies (e.g.
higher long-run growth and long-term fiscal adjustment). In sum, the wide ranges around the
point estimates reflect the difficulties in quantifying the implications of the ongoing policy
regime shift on the current account and its norm: a rise in inflation could weaken the trade
balance by appreciating the real exchange rate, fiscal consolidation would strengthen the current
account, but its effects would be smaller if growth picks up as a result of structural reforms.



The current exchange rate is estimated to be moderately undervalued with a midpoint
estimate of 5 percent, but with an unusually wide range of -20 percent undervaluation to
+10 percent overvaluation. The large bands are symmetric to the above calculated ESR bands
for the current account and also reflect the substantial uncertainty about external sector
developments given the major changes in the economic framework and also take account of the
high exchange rate volatility. Staff expects the real effective exchange rate to return to a level
consistent with fundamentals as long as monetary easing is accompanied by comprehensive
fiscal and structural reforms involving all three arrows of Abenomics, which would generate
higher inflation and growth.

C. Risks and Spillovers
14.
External risks are to the downside (Appendix II). These include a slowdown in emerging
markets, in particular in China, or a protracted period of slower growth in Europe. Spillovers from
1

Staff’s baseline expects that potential growth would rise over the medium-term to about 1 percent similar to the
pre-global –financial-crisis level as a result of a pickup in the pace of capital accumulation. This projection assumes no
further fiscal consolidation beyond 2015 and a modest additional increase in growth from rising investment in
anticipation of Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) membership. A more substantial increase in potential growth would
require concrete and broad-based reforms as outlined in this report.

lower exports could be amplified by weaker domestic demand due to depressed equity prices and
more feeble business and consumer confidence. The effects on the outlook from possible exit from
easy monetary policy in the U.S. are uncertain. Key spillover channels include potential effects on
the yen and nominal interest rates as well as capital outflows from emerging markets with
ramifications for Japan’s exports. A weaker or more uncertain global environment matters more at
this juncture as it would affect confidence and therefore the change in expectations that is needed
for the new policy framework to achieve its objectives.
15.
However, domestic risks dominate and have important spillover implications. On the
upside, deregulating domestic services and agriculture, strengthening labor markets, and enhancing
the availability of risk capital, could raise trend growth to 2 percent over a decade.2 This, together
with fiscal consolidation beyond 2015, would support a rise in future income and a reduction in
precautionary savings, boosting demand in the near term, and accelerate the attainment of the
inflation target (Box 1, complete Abenomics). With regard to spillovers, in this case, higher growth in
Japan and easier global financing conditions would over time more than offset the effect of
exchange rate appreciation in trading partners (Box 2). A reopening of remaining nuclear plants
would provide further upside to growth and the external position. Aside from larger than expected
fiscal multipliers that could slow growth in 2014–15, key downside risks include:


Absence of credible fiscal consolidation and growth plans (Box 1, incomplete Abenomics).
Without concrete measures, the new macroeconomic framework lacks credibility and may fail to
raise growth and inflation expectations. Monetary policy might become overburdened and the
rest of the world could be negatively affected through a weaker yen. Using the IMF’s Flexible
System of Global Models, an illustrative simulation suggests that a sustained 10 percent fall in
the yen real effective exchange rate by itself would affect growth in the rest of the world by
a very small negative amount (0.03 percent annually at its trough), with a few selected countries
(e.g., China, Germany, Korea) losing out by 0.1 or 0.2 percent (see 2013 Spillover Report).



Credible fiscal consolidation and growth plans, but Abenomics does not work. Despite all
arrows being fired, inertia in inflation expectations, rigid wages, or structural factors (such as the
deflationary effects of population aging) could imply that growth and inflation remain stuck,
overburdening monetary policy to support activity and prevent yields from rising. With greater
uncertainty about fiscal and financial stability, this may trigger capital outflows and exchange
rate depreciation, undermining not only Japan’s recovery, but also adversely affecting trading
partners especially in the region.



Tail risks. Given high debt, a self fulfilling sell-off of JGBs due to the lack of a convincing debtreduction strategy remains a possibility and markets could shift their perception of BoJ bond
purchases toward debt monetization. Yields could spike, undermining domestic and global
financial stability, increasing the risk of a reversal in emerging market capital flows, and putting
pressure on the BoJ to maintain an accommodative stance for longer, possibly at the cost of its
credibility and ability to efficiently manage inflation.

The IMF’s new G20MOD is used to illustrate the potential implications of a complete and incomplete policy
scenario relative to a pre-Abenomics baseline. Alongside the latest WEO baseline, we consider the following two
scenarios, which both include the adoption of a mediumReal GDP

1 to 2 percent over the next decade. In combination with
QQME and medium-term fiscal consolidation, the
complete package aligns inflation expectations quickly
with the new target. Structural reform and fiscal
consolidation are mutually reinforcing: the government’s
financing requirement falls, while private savings recover,
preventing the rise in the sovereign risk premium.

Staff’s baseline projections (July 2013 WEO Update,
only up to 2018) lie in between these illustrative
scenarios. Consistent with policies adopted so far, the
baseline incorporates the effects of aggressive monetary
easing as well as fiscal adjustment through 2015 (but no
further consolidation after that) and only modest gains
from structural reforms, specifically higher investment in
anticipation of TPP membership. As a result, inflation
gradually converges to the target as the output gap closes
over the medium term and inflation expectations rise as a
result of QQME. However, there are only modest gains in
reducing fiscal risks and raising potential growth, leaving
important tail risks on the table.

arrows of Abenomics and the risks of an incomplete
reform. The 2 percent inflation target, higher growth, and
lower fiscal risks will only be achieved in a speedy and sustained manner under a full package of reforms. If
inflation expectations are sluggish and the authorities resort to further fiscal stimulus, debt rises over the medium
term, increasing fiscal consolidation needs and possibly risking a spike in yields, which would threaten financial
stability. Ambitious structural reforms are also essential to offset underlying deflationary pressures from
population aging (see IMF 2013 Japan: Selected Issues Chapter 3).

Box 2. Spillovers of Japan’s New Macroeconomic Policies1
Spillover channels of a successful effort to revitalize Japan are likely to operate through higher
growth in Japan, the exchange rate, and financial inter-linkages. Illustrative simulations using the IMF’s
G20MOD suggest that if all three arrows of Abenomics are successfully deployed, spillovers to the global
economy are modest, but positive at about 0-0.1 percent of GDP in the short term to about 0.3 percent in
the long term. Short-term effects of yen depreciation on competitiveness in other countries is offset over
time by the positive effects from higher growth in Japan and lower interest rates in trading partners as a
result of greater capital inflows and lower sovereign risk in Japan. In addition, the reforms would also take an
important tail risk from a spike in JGB yields off the table, which would have large global repercussions. That
said, sharper yen depreciation by about 10 percent, relative to a gradual depreciation in the model’s
baseline, implies marginally slower growth (0.03 percent annually at its trough) in the rest of the world with
selected countries (e.g., China, Germany, Korea) losing out by 0.1 to 0.2 percent in the near term before
recovering in the long term. Also, an analysis in the 2013 Spillover Report, which imputes the effects of
QQME on global financial markets from an event study into the IMF’s G35 model, shows small short-lived
negative growth effects.

Supply-chain considerations also have important spillover implications as they influence the effects
of yen depreciation on trading partners, as well as on Japan. The effect of yen depreciation on price
competitiveness of neighboring countries is mitigated by the significant amount of imported intermediate
inputs that are embodied in their final exports. Moreover, significant portions of Japanese domestic final
demand and gross exports are value added imported from other Asian countries, which would therefore
benefit from higher growth in Japan.

The Authorities’ Views
16.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff on the near-term outlook. The government’s
near-term growth forecast is similar to staff’s. The BoJ Board Member’s median forecast implied
a faster rise in inflation expectations and closing of the output gap, but officials agreed that the exact
path of inflation is subject to uncertainty. They also noted that a growth strategy and fiscal reforms
would support the speedy attainment of the inflation target. As the main risks to the outlook, the
authorities noted continued uncertainty about the prospects for Europe and a deeper-than-expected
slowdown in China.
17.
The authorities emphasized that new policies are targeted towards meeting the
domestic objective of ending deflation and supporting growth, and agreed with staff that
spillovers from these policies would be positive. They saw the yen’s movement as determined by
the market reflecting various fundamentals, while stressing unusually high uncertainty associated
with the staff’s exchange rate assessment. The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment that overall
spillovers of successful Abenomics would be positive, as stronger growth in Japan should benefit the
rest of the world.

A FRESH START TO END DEFLATION
18.
With QQME, the BoJ has embarked on an unprecedented effort to raise inflation above
historical levels. After decades of mild deflation,

lower the term premium through purchases
of longer-dated government securities. Additional purchases of risk assets (commercial paper,
corporate bonds, exchange-traded funds, and Japan real estate investment trusts) would
contribute to higher business investment, durable goods consumption and residential
investment by reducing the funding cost of firms and households, improving firms' balance
sheets, and through the wealth effect.



Portfolio rebalancing. BoJ purchases exceed net issuance of government securities over the
next two years, particularly in the 5–10 year segment, which would lead to portfolio rebalancing
among investors and financial institutions including toward riskier assets and credit extension at
home or abroad.



Raising inflation expectations, including through stronger communication, would lower longterm real interest rates, thereby stimulating near-term activity.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

JAPAN



Exchange rate depreciation. Exchange rate depreciation, which is a product of these channels,
is a crucial mechanism for QQME to work as it would raise import prices as well as support
higher inflation by helping to close the output gap.

20.
Transmission is in its early stages, with some positive signs. Nominal yields across
maturities are broadly similar to end-2012 levels and volatility has risen, but this partly reflects
external factors. Private asset prices have increased substantially. On the other hand, banks have
mostly held higher liquidity from fewer JGB purchases as excess reserves at the BoJ and portfolio
rebalancing will likely remain gradual depending on further increases in credit demand. Inflation
expectations have gradually picked up, albeit still well below the inflation target and there has been
a partial reversal recently. Although bonuses have started to increase, basic wages have yet to rise,
which would be important to stimulate inflation expectations and support purchasing power once
inflation starts to rise.

Policy Issues and Staff’s Views
21.
The BoJ’s new monetary policy framework is a sweeping enhancement compared to
the previous Asset-Purchase Program. Although the transmission channels are the same, the
impact of QQME on inflation is expected to be larger as a result of:


A departure from gradualism with greater effects on interest rates and incentives for portfolio
rebalancing through a doubling of the monetary base via large-scale asset purchases and a shift
to longer-dated JGBs and private assets.



Strong communication and forward guidance, which facilitates a rise in inflation expectations,
through the setting of a clear time frame for achieving 2 percent inflation, extending the forecast
horizon by one year, and by announcing that QQME will continue for as long as it is necessary
for maintaining the inflation target in a stable manner.

The joint policy statement between the BoJ and the government is further improving transmission by
raising expectations of reform synergies, although the BoJ’s operational independence in meeting its
mandate must remain unaffected.
22.
The BoJ should recalibrate its easing policies in the event inflation does not pick up as
envisaged or JGB market volatility rises again. Depending on the factors preventing inflation from
rising, a scaling-up of asset purchases or adjusting its composition could be considered to maintain
effective transmission of QQME. Likewise, a return to high volatility in JGB markets would require
conducting asset purchases in a flexible manner and strong communication, including that the BoJ is
prepared to prevent disorderly movements in nominal JGB yields. In this regard, the actions taken by
the BoJ since May, including realigning the maturity and frequency of bond purchases and
enhancing communication with market participants, have been appropriate.
23.
Complementary growth and fiscal reforms are essential for raising inflation in
a durable manner. A robust rise in inflation hinges critically on a rise in inflation expectations, which
depends not only on monetary easing, but also on the credibility of medium-term fiscal and growth
reforms. Fiscal reforms are needed to provide assurances concerning fiscal and financial stability.
Structural reforms that create a more flexible and open economy are critical to support real incomes

and to overcome headwinds from inertia in inflation expectations, rigid wages, and the deflationary
effects of population aging. If these reforms are successfully implemented, staff estimates that
2 percent inflation could be achieved over the horizon targeted by the BoJ.
24.
The BoJ should begin planning early to address exit risks. While exit is still far off, when
the time comes near, guiding market expectations about the future of monetary policy puts
a premium on strong communication. Likewise, although at the moment unrealized capital losses
from asset purchases—estimated at 1–2 percent of GDP3—appear manageable, balance sheet risks
will rise substantially as QQME proceeds, which could complicate the exit from unconventional
policies. Although buying longer-dated assets is essential for the monetary transmission channel to
work, it also raises exit risks and distinguishes a future exit from the experience during 2005-06. In
this regard, indemnification against capital losses on bond holdings could be considered, but needs
to be weighed against the potential rise in fiscal risks from rising contingent liabilities.

The Authorities’ Views
25.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s policy recommendations and viewed
recent financial market developments as consistent with their new objectives. They emphasized
that bond market volatility had occurred in two phases. First, in the immediate aftermath of the
QQME announcement, government bond yields exhibited unusual volatility largely due to the
positive surprise on the size and composition of the program, which affected liquidity in certain JGB
market segments. The second phase in early May was triggered by external events and was also
partly due to financial institutions’ attachment of a greater credibility to the inflation target being
reached. Volatility was being addressed through stronger communication and more frequent market
interactions, which had been effective also because the bond market is dominated by domestic
investors. Officials also noted that policies should be given time to work as the QQME clearly
differentiates itself from the gradualism or incremental approach adopted in the past. The authorities
explained that it was too early to publicly discuss the exit strategy, but much could be learned from
their experience in 2005–06 as well as the possibly nearer term exit by the U.S. Federal Reserve, and it
would be important that long-term rates are well anchored at the time of exit.

ENSURING FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY

The fiscal policy stance in 2013 is expansionary due to new stimulus, but substantial

two-step increase in the consumption tax rate to
10 percent and the waning of stimulus and reconstruction spending. Nonetheless, the public debt
ratio is projected to continue to rise with net debt approaching 160 percent of GDP in the medium
term as a result of the still sizeable primary deficit.

Policy Issues and Staff’s Views
27.
Fiscal risks have risen in the past year as stimulus has delayed adjustment. Yields on
government debt remain near historic lows, hovering around 0.8–0.9 percent for 10-year bonds.
Underlying upward pressure on interest rates from deteriorating fiscal conditions is assessed to be
substantial, however, albeit masked by BoJ purchases and growing demand for liquid assets due to
aging (Box 3). Changes in risk perceptions can occur suddenly and even a modest increase of risk
premia by 100 basis points could undermine financial stability in particular in conjunction with other
risks.
28.
Raising the consumption tax rate is an essential first step to contain fiscal
vulnerabilities. The scheduled tax increases in April 2014 and October 2015 should proceed as
planned as they are critical to maintain confidence in the ability of the government to address the
fiscal problem. Introducing multiple rates should be avoided as it would severely dilute revenue
gains, complicate tax administration, and impose a costly administrative burden on small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Instead, targeted transfers could be considered to compensate
low-income households, facilitated over the medium term by the implementation of the recently
adopted unique identification numbers.
29.
To bring public debt firmly on a downward path, an ambitious and concrete
consolidation plan beyond 2015 is urgently needed. Achieving the authorities’ fiscal goals
published in June would possibly only slow the pace of general government debt accumulation over
time. Instead, to contain fiscal risks, staff sees a need to target a declining debt-to-GDP ratio, which
requires structural fiscal consolidation of 11 percent of GDP over the next decade. The increases of
the consumption tax rate to 10 percent by 2015, together with expiring stimulus and reconstruction

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAPAN

spending and measures to contain growth in spending would account for about half of this
adjustment. Concrete measures for the remaining structural fiscal adjustment of 5.5 percent of GDP,
to take effect after 2015, therefore need to be urgently spelled out. While higher-than-expected
nominal growth from a complete macroeconomic reform package could generate some fiscal
dividends, these should be saved to serve as a buffer against potential shocks to the fiscal position
and higher-than-expected social spending especially on health care (Box 4 and Appendix III).
Box 3. Low Sovereign Yields Despite High Public Debt: Are Fiscal Concerns Overblown?1
Upward pressures on long-term JGB yields from high public debt have been offset by other factors,
but these could change over time. The assessment is based on an econometric panel analysis of long-term
sovereign yields in 12 advanced countries covering the

GDP ratio would increase long-term yields by 2–
4 basis points, although this effect has declined after the global financial crisis in light of global uncertainty
and the related flight to safe assets. A sustained current account surplus also tends to lower long-term rates,
but the result is not statistically and economically significant.
Purchases by the BoJ over the next few years are likely to suppress a rise in long-term rates, but
underlying pressure on yields is likely to rise. Long-term rates would, without fiscal adjustment beyond
2015, be expected to rise by 4 percentage points to near 5½ percent between 2012 and 2030 (blue squares
in the chart), of which deterioration in fiscal conditions contributes some 3½ percentage points (about
3 percentage points from the projected rise of the net public debt ratio from 134 percent in 2012 to near
210 percent of GDP by 2030 and ½ percentage point from large fiscal deficits). Rising inflation and shrinking
external surpluses would add another 2 and ½ percentage point respectively to nominal yields, although the
net increase would be much smaller because of population aging (-1¼ percentage points), BoJ purchases (¾ percentage points), and other factors (chart).
In a positive reform scenario, the rise in yields could be contained to a sustainable level. Under an
upside scenario with a full policy package (Box 1), higher growth and inflation would lead to an increase of
nominal yields, but beneficial effects from lower public debt ratios would contain the increase such that
long-term nominal rates would be stable at about 4 percent amid a declining debt-to-GDP ratio.

Box 4. A Further Fiscal Risk—Health Spending and Financing in Japan1
Japan’s health system is generally regarded as cost effective, but spending pressures are nonetheless
evident. The Japanese system has very favorable health outcomes (e.g., longevity), despite the fact that
overall spending-to-GDP ratio is around the average of OECD. However, public and private spending on
healthcare and long-term care (HC/LTC) more than doubled during the last two decades, reaching
9.4 percent of GDP in 2010. While about half of the past increase originates from population aging, the rest
can be attributed to excess-cost-growth (ECG) defined as spending per person in excess of per capita GDP
growth after controlling for the effect of demographic change. Extrapolating past trends, HC/LTC spending
would increase by as much as 5 percentage points of GDP during 2010–30, with equal parts coming from
further population aging and annual ECG of 1 percent.
Japan could face serious challenges in financing HC/LTC spending. The government’s contribution on
HC/LTC reached nearly 3¾ percent of GDP in 2010,
accounting for 39 percent of total health care
financing. Given the current financing structure, with

contributions would reach 6½ percent of GDP by

2030 (text chart). On the other hand, various reforms,
including raising the effective copayment rates by

health care resources and strengthening reliance on
generics, could save 1.8 percent of GDP, thereby
partly offsetting the expected rise in spending.

Given the already high fiscal adjustment needs and rapid aging, deep-seated reforms may be needed
to contain rising expenditures. Further increases in copayment rates and cuts in and a review of
government-controlled prices of medical services could be considered to address the funding gap. Although
projections of long-term spending trends are uncertain, even a moderate rise in health system funding
needs poses a downside risk to the fiscal sustainability given the already difficult fiscal situation.

30.
Such a medium-term plan should be as growth friendly as possible. Given the
magnitude of the needed adjustment, broadly equal efforts on both the revenue and spending side
are needed. The fiscal reform should also encompass measures that stimulate incentives to work and
invest, and address equity concerns. Key elements could include (see text table on page 18 for
details):


16

Gradually increasing the consumption tax to a uniform rate of at least 15 percent, as it is a stable
source of revenue in an aging society, one of the least distortionary taxes, and easy to
administer. It would also be fairer than other taxes in addressing inequities between young and
old generations.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAPAN



Broadening the personal income tax base to raise revenue and improve work incentives,
including by reducing exemptions for pension income and eliminating the tax deduction for
dependent spouses.



Lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to improve incentives to invest, and
reducing the payroll tax to stimulate labor effort. Such a general rate reduction would build
upon the recently introduced tax incentives for R&D and investment.



Containing rising health care costs, for example by increasing copayment rates, making more
efficient use of hospital resources, and relying more on generics.



Reducing pension spending, including by raising the eligibility age over time to 67, collecting
contributions from dependent spouses,4 and clawing back benefits from wealthy retirees. These
savings could fund the reduction in payroll taxes and targeted transfers to low-income
households.



Strengthening the fiscal framework by adopting medium-term rules to curb expenditure in the
context of multi-year budget planning, and limiting the conditions under which supplementary
budgets can be used so that hard-won savings cannot easily be spent.

31.
With such a plan in place, some fiscal space would be created to smooth the fiscal
adjustment in 2014–15, should growth fall substantially below the baseline. Given elevated
fiscal risks, monetary policy should be the first line of defense against significant downside risks. In
such a case, acceleration or a change in the composition of asset purchases possibly toward more
private assets could be considered, as well as a powerful communication strategy to underscore the
BoJ’s commitment to achieving its inflation target. Regardless of cyclical conditions, the successive
increases in the consumption tax rate should proceed as planned. However, if activity slows
substantially, growth-friendly fiscal measures could be considered depending on the degree of
commitment to a concrete fiscal consolidation plan that puts debt on a downward path.

This could also reduce disincentives for second earners to work as currently dependent spouses of employees are
exempted from paying premiums if their annual earnings are below 1.3 million yen.

The Authorities’ Views
32.
The authorities noted that fiscal stimulus was necessary to revive the economy despite
further adding to public debt and said that they would advance fiscal consolidation while
promoting economic growth. They expected that the stimulus passed in February would
contribute to sufficiently favorable economic conditions to proceed with the first stage of the
consumption tax increase. In general, they pointed out that higher growth was essential to address
fiscal problems and within this context emphasized the importance of structural reforms, but would
also continue flexible fiscal policy that takes into account economic conditions, especially if growth
were to disappoint.
33.
The authorities recognized the need for further fiscal consolidation beyond 2015. They
stressed their commitment to fiscal consolidation and would formulate a concrete mid-term fiscal
plan in the summer. They took note of staff’s proposal on concrete fiscal consolidation measures
beyond 2015, including further hike of the consumption tax rate, although they considered it
premature to endorse any possible measures at this time.
34.
The authorities aimed to create a positive cycle between economic revitalization and
fiscal consolidation. They also noted that it is important to prepare a medium-term fiscal plan
setting out as detailed fiscal consolidation measures as possible. The authorities also indicated that
their debt management strategy would continue to aim for lengthening the maturity of government
debt, while remaining cognizant of interest rate risk in the financial system.

REVIVING GROWTH THROUGH STRUCTURAL
REFORMS
35.
Ambitious structural reforms are essential for the overall success of the new policies.
A more flexible economy is needed to raise productivity and wages and to reduce fiscal risks.
Expectations of higher incomes down the road would support economic activity and the exit from
deflation already in the near term. As noted during last year’s consultation (Appendix IV), important
synergies exist between aggressive monetary easing, medium-term fiscal consolidation, and
structural reforms and each arrow being successfully launched is a necessary condition for the
others to succeed (Figure 5 and Table 4).
36.
The government’s new growth strategy includes several ambitious goals, but specific
measures or a more concrete timetable in some areas remain to be formulated. The strategy
targets average annual real growth of 2 percent over the next 10 years, as well as doubling inward
FDIs and agricultural exports by 2020. It reiterates the government’s intent to partake in the TransPacific Partnership (TPP) and to raise the employment of women, promote labor mobility across
industries including by expanding the role of the private sector in providing job-matching services,
and to institute special economic zones to experiment with deregulation. It also pledges to bring
annual private investment back to its pre-Lehman shock level (70 trillion yen, or 14 percent of GDP)
including through tax incentives. The government is also formulating a plan for reinforcing
corporate governance and has indicated that it will liberalize the energy market by separating
generation and transmission activities.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Policy Issues and Staff’s Views
37.
The next round of announcements should include more concrete and decisive steps to
create broader growth synergies. The government's participation in the TPP negotiations and its
intention to eliminate waiting lists on kindergartens and day-cares, which would support the
employment of women, are important steps. Going forward, the strategy should avoid a sectorspecific (“picking winners”) approach and over-reliance on tax incentives/subsidies that
characterized past plans that ultimately proved to be unsuccessful. Some measures could be
adopted quickly, for example in the area of raising the employment of women, which would give
and important signal about the government’s commitment to reforms. In general, key measures
should include:


Deregulating agriculture and domestic services sectors to raise productivity and competition,
and to encourage inward foreign investment.



Enhancing the dynamism of the SME sector, including by phasing out costly government
support measures (e.g., full value credit guarantees) and increasing risk capital for start-ups.
Other measures include improving the timeliness of data in the SME credit registry, encouraging
more asset-based lending, and reducing the reliance on personal guarantees.5



Implementing steps to reduce labor market
duality and increase productivity, including
clarifying the legal framework for limited regular
(“gentei seishain”) contracts. To ensure that
greater flexibility is rewarded through new
employment opportunities, complementary
measures to strengthen job matching and assist
workers during periods of temporary
unemployment should be considered (Box 5).

Based on estimates presented in IMF (2012), Japan: Selected Issues Chapter 2, an increase in the female labor force
participation rate to the G-7 average and a rise in old age labor force participation could raise the growth potential
by 0.25 percent. Immigration equivalent to a rise of Japan’s labor force by 1 percent distributed over a decade could
yield another 0.1-0.2 percent higher growth per year. Financial sector reforms that raise risk capital and induce
a restructuring of the SME sectors could lift long-term growth by about 0.2 percentage points. Other structural
reforms, which are likely to have a substantial impact on long-term growth, but are difficult to quantify, are: nontrade effects of TPP participation on reforming domestic markets via greater market access; productivity gains from
reducing labor market duality, and efficiency gains from deregulation in agriculture and domestic services.

Box 5. The Path to Higher Growth: Does Revamping Japan’s Dual Labor Market Matter?1
The share of non-regular workers, which was
below 20 percent before the bursting of the
bubble in the early 1990s, has now reached
35 percent (text chart). Compared to regular
workers, non-regular workers have much lower level
of job security, are paid lower wages and receive
significantly less social insurance coverage. About
70 percent of non-regular workers are women. Low
value-added service sectors are highly reliant on
non-regular work. Japan’s share of temporary
workers—a proxy of labor market duality available
for international comparisons—is above the OECD
average.

The macroeconomic costs of excessive labor market duality are likely to be substantial. Japan’s large
labor market duality has likely resulted in reduced productivity and growth, by lowering firms’ incentives to
train non-regular workers, and through reduced workers’ effort due to low job satisfaction.2 Staff estimates
that the ceteris paribus effect of reforms that would reduce the difference in employment protection
between regular and temporary workers could bring the share of non-regular workers in Japan below
30 percent. Reducing labor duality could have substantial macroeconomic benefits—for example, Dolado,
Ortigueira, and Stucchi (2011)3 find that 20 percent of the productivity slowdown in Spanish manufacturing
between 1992 and 2005 is due to reliance on temporary work.
Reducing the difference in employment protection between regular and non-regular workers would
significantly reduce labor market duality in Japan. Steps to reduce labor market duality and increase
flexibility could include clarifying the legal framework for limited regular (“gentei seishain”) contracts, which
would increase their usage. To ensure that greater flexibility is also rewarded through new employment
opportunities, complementary measures to strengthen job matching and support systems should be
considered.

The Authorities’ Views
38.
The authorities agreed with the need to implement growth-enhancing structural
reforms (the third arrow of Abenomics). They were committed to create new trade rules through
TPP participation and lay the foundation for larger trade agreements. They further stressed that the
growth strategy, which was presented on June 14, is a first step and that a window of opportunity
was opening for Japan to implement growth-enhancing reforms. They were confident that the new
reforms would succeed in raising female labor participation, promoting private investment,
increasing productivity in agriculture, and reallocating workers to fast growing sectors.

ENHANCING FINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY
39.
Major banks have benefited from buoyant capital markets and an improved outlook
(Figure 6 and Table 5). The 2012 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update found that the
financial system was generally sound (Figure 7 and Table 6). Since last year, capital positions of
major financial institutions have improved due to strong equity performance, rising income from
securities trading, and capital gains on JGBs and foreign asset holdings, while credit costs in banks
remain limited. Profits for internationally active banks have also risen due to relatively high net
interest margins on overseas loans, which rose by 20 percent (y/y). Further expansion abroad would
be another channel through, which the new policy framework could generate positive spillovers to
the region (Box 6).
40.
Nonetheless, overall low profitability and high interest rate risks remain a concern.
Financial institutions, particularly regional and shinkin banks, face elevated risks from narrow netdomestic-interest margins (around 1 percent), large holdings of JGBs and equities, and potentially
rising credit risks from household mortgages as well as SMEs in light of the welcome expiration of
the SME Financing Facilitation Act in March. At the current juncture, uncertainty about interest rate
movements may put further pressure on bank profitability, especially for those that rely on interest
income from long-duration JGBs, and on the asset allocation of major life insurers.

Policy Issues and Staff’s Views
41.
A complete package of reforms could further strengthen financial system soundness.
Declining JGB holdings by banks as a result of QQME could reduce exposures to interest rate risks.
Rising stock prices are giving banks and insurers an opportunity to divest their equity holdings to
reduce exposure to market risk. By solidifying financial stability, these factors would enhance the
role of the financial sector in promoting growth by extending more risk-based capital, provided that
banks strengthen their credit-assessment capabilities.

Box 6. Will Japanese Financial Institutions Continue to Expand Abroad
Under the New Policies?1
Cross-border activity of Japanese financial institutions has risen over the past few years, particularly
to the Asian region. Since the global crisis in 2008 overseas claims by Japanese banks have grown annually
on average by about 8 percent and by 19 percent in the Asia Pacific region. Major Japanese banks have
attained an important global and regional presence, particularly in areas of syndicated lending and project
finance. This trend could be affected under the government’s new policy framework. There are concerns that
an improved domestic outlook and a weaker yen could lead to a more inward focus to satisfy rising credit
demand.
Based on a cross-country panel analysis, global
and regional factors play a more important

Foreign Consolidated Claims of Japanese Banks 1/

role than domestic push factors in banks’
overseas activities. Low global uncertainty
(measured by the VIX index) and a high growth
differential between destination and domestic
growth prospects are important drivers for banks’
rising foreign claims. For instance, a 1 percentage
point increase in the real growth differential could
increase the foreign claims by about 0.3-

1.6 percentage point. Applying the estimates to
Japanese banks suggests that about 40 percent of the rise in claims to Asia is due to a decline of global
uncertainty, while regional factors contribute another 20–25 percent. Among home factors, domestic push
factors through a substitution between domestic and foreign credit contributed only a small share to the
overseas expansion of about 5 percentage points. The remainder is accounted for by strong financial
fundamentals of domestic banks. Stronger domestic growth in Japan as a result of the BoJ’s asset purchases
could mitigate the pace of growth in overseas lending, but is unlikely to reverse a long-standing trend
because empirical estimates suggest that global and regional factors play a more prominent role.
A sustained overseas expansion by Japanese banks would benefit mainly countries in the Asian
region. The relative resilience of Japanese banks during the global financial crisis has allowed them to take
on further foreign exposures and ease financing conditions that might have tightened otherwise from the
deleveraging of European banks. Given long-term growth prospects, a continued expansion to Asia is likely
and would provide stability during the scale back of European banks and periods of market volatility.

42.
However, the new framework also presents challenges, particularly if the
government’s reforms remain incomplete. Specifically, risks to stability in regional banks could
rise if credit demand in Japan’s regions would continue to be sluggish. As a result, regional banks
may increasingly rely on interest income from long-duration JGBs, creating further exposure to
interest rate risk. If the policy framework lacks credible fiscal and growth reforms, such risks could
intensify further. The new framework will likely encourage further overseas expansion, which could
expose banks to currency-funding and, in particular, maturity-mismatch risks as many banks still rely
on short-term dollar funding to finance foreign loans, with the foreign-currency denominated loans
to deposit ratio at around 130 percent on average.
43.
Recent progress on regulatory reform will help to contain risks to financial stability.
The authorities have made important progress with the implementation of FSAP Update
recommendations (Appendix V). Basel III implementation has commenced in March, which will
strengthen capital standards of internationally active banks in a phased manner. Improvements have
also been introduced regarding the stress testing methodology to incorporate a more thematic risk
assessment for the banking system. Furthermore, the authorities have submitted legislation to the
Diet on bringing large exposure limits for banks in line with international best practices and
establishing an orderly resolution regime for financial institutions. As part of international efforts,
the cross-border risk monitoring arrangements with foreign supervisors have deepened.
44.
Going forward, it will be important to strengthen capital standards beyond current
plans and mitigate foreign-exchange funding risks. At the moment, regional and shinkin banks
are having modest unrealized gains on securities holdings. However, once interest rates start to rise,
these gains may turn into losses. In this regard, excluding unrealized losses from capital-adequacy
ratios may reduce incentives for domestically oriented banks to raise new capital and, particularly for
regional and shinkin banks; it would discourage addressing interest rate risk. Banks with overseas
activities should continue to mitigate foreign-funding risks by raising deposits overseas and by
issuing long-term foreign-denominated debt. For insurers, the solvency assessment should be based
on an economic valuation, such as by taking into account the full time horizon of insurance
contracts to better reflect the underlying risks on liabilities. Finally, Japan Post Bank’s expansion
plans into lending and other businesses would carry important risks given its limited credit-risk
assessment expertise in these areas and potential repercussions for other financial institutions.

The Authorities’ Views
45.
The authorities welcomed the assessment of implementation of FSAP
recommendations and considered supervision to be broadly appropriate at the current
juncture.


24

On the treatment of unrealized gains and losses on security holdings for domestically oriented
banks, the authorities stated that their intention is to mitigate procyclicality of capital levels as
gains and losses vary over the cycle. In addition, transparency is ensured since unrealized gains
and losses are within the scope of accounting disclosure. In this context, they did not foresee
that problems in risk management would materialize. They noted that they pay due attention to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAPAN

risks from security holdings and try to capture such risks at an early stage by means of close
monitoring.


As for foreign-exchange funding risks, they recognized the need of continued close monitoring
and emphasized that banks should continue to secure foreign-exchange funding in the markets,
whereas the existing central banks swap arrangement provide a backstop on liquidity as a last
resort in case of unexpectedly large external shocks. The authorities also noted that they
designate liquidity risk associated with foreign currencies as one of the risk areas that require
due attention in the supervisory policy for major banks against the background of the ongoing
rise in their overseas exposure.



On the solvency assessment for insurers based on an economic valuation, they intend to
deliberate such an assessment, taking into account ongoing international discussions, such as
those at the International Association of Insurance Supervisors.



As for Japan Post Bank’s expansion plans, they intend to proceed on an assessment with due
consideration of required elements such as ensuring fair competition, following legal processes.

STAFF APPRAISAL
46.
The authorities’ new policies are buoying the near-term outlook. Unprecedented
monetary easing supported by fiscal stimulus is supporting growth, which is projected to reach
2 percent in 2013. Inflation expectations have risen, albeit to levels still well below the 2 percent
inflation target. Risks to the outlook are to the downside and related to a slowdown in Europe and
emerging economies and incomplete domestic reforms.
47.
All three arrows need to be launched for the policies to succeed and benefit the global
economy. The absence of credible fiscal and structural reforms could weigh on confidence and
undermine the success of the started reforms. This would not only be detrimental to Japan, but also
for the rest of the world, especially emerging Asia, as monetary policy would become overburdened
and further depreciation would adversely affect trading partners. As Japan’s debt would remain
unsustainable, a global tail risk of a spike in yields and volatile capital flows would remain on the
table
48.
With its new monetary policy framework, the BoJ has made an important contribution
to end deflation. Careful communication and continued flexibility in implementing its policies is
needed to contain financial market volatility and ensure an effective transmission of its easing
policies. However, complementary growth and fiscal reforms are essential for raising inflation in
a durable manner.
49.
A credible medium-term fiscal plan should be adopted as quickly as possible as fiscal
risks have risen further. Reducing public debt requires a fiscal adjustment of 11 percent of GDP
over a decade. Raising the consumption tax rate to 10 percent by 2015, while maintaining a uniform
rate, is an essential first step. Beyond 2015, a concrete set of growth-friendly revenue and
expenditure measures is needed to bring down debt. There is little room for further fiscal stimulus,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

JAPAN

and new support measures should only be considered if growth declines substantially and a credible
medium-term fiscal strategy is in place.
50.
In addition, the government’s structural reforms need to be concrete and
comprehensive. The government’s participation in the TPP negotiations and its plans to raise the
employment of women are welcome, but only first steps. To generate growth synergies, concrete
measures should be adopted quickly and include deregulation in agriculture and domestic services,
providing more risk capital to corporates, reducing Japan’s excessive labor market duality, tax
reform to stimulate incentives to invest, and further relaxing immigration requirements to areas with
labor shortages.
51.
A successful launch of all three arrows and enhancement of the regulatory framework
would further strengthen financial sector stability. The main financial stability benefit of
a successful implementation of Abenomics would be a reduction in banks’ holdings of JGBs and new
lending opportunities at home. However, new challenges could also arise, particularly for regional
banks if fiscal and growth reforms disappoint. Despite recent progress on regulatory reform, capital
standards, especially for regional banks should be strengthened and foreign-funding risks of major
banks carefully monitored. Japan Post Bank’s expansion plans into lending and other businesses
would carry important risks.
52.
The current exchange rate appears moderately undervalued compared with mediumterm fundamentals and desirable policies. However, there is very large uncertainty about the
assessment given the major changes in the economic framework. The external position is expected
to return to a level consistent with fundamentals as long as monetary easing pursues domestic goals
and is accompanied by comprehensive fiscal and structural reforms.
53.
A complete package of reforms will likely create positive spillovers, but near-term
effects could be more mixed. Higher growth in Japan, easier global financing conditions from
fiscal reforms, as well as supply-chain effects would more than offset the effects from exchange rate
appreciation in trading partners. Failure to follow through on fiscal and structural reforms could,
however, lead to overreliance on monetary policy with negative consequences for Japan and the
global economy.
54.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12 month cycle.

Appendix I. Assessment of Japan’s External Sector
Staff’s external sector evaluation concludes that the external position is moderately stronger than
implied by fundamentals (and the exchange rate moderately undervalued). This assessment is based
on the following considerations.
External balance assessment (EBA). This year’s EBA results were calculated using the current
account (CA) and average real effective exchange rate (REER) based on the average for 2012. The
EBA results for Japan indicate that the CA is moderately weaker by 2¼ percent of GDP, and the REER
moderately stronger by about 8 percent, than the levels implied by fundamentals and desirable
policies.
Recent developments. Between the reference period for the 2012 EBA and June 2013, the REER
depreciated 18-20 percent, reflecting several factors, including the new monetary framework, the
reversal of safe haven effects and a structural weakening of the trade balance from higher energy
imports. As of mid-2013, however, the CA has negligibly responded to this depreciation.
Extrapolation of the EBA results to mid-2013. Reflecting the significant external sector
developments since end 2012, staff’s assessment of the external position is based on extrapolation
of the EBA results to mid-2013. This extrapolation, which draws on a wide range of inputs including
staff’s judgment to adjust the CA and REER gaps, is subject to an unusual degree of uncertainty. This
assessment takes into account the following factors:


The new macro policy framework: staff assesses that implementing credible fiscal and structural
reforms will shift the economy to a higher-growth, higher-inflation equilibrium, consistent with
real effective appreciation and a lower equilibrium current account (norm). A lower CA norm
may also result from a potentially different set of desirable policies consistent with higher
equilibrium growth, e.g., a flatter medium-term fiscal adjustment path. Reflecting these
considerations, staff’s assessment is that the CA norm lies in a fairly wide range around 2.5
percent of GDP.



The lagged impact of depreciation and higher energy costs: the EBA results estimated the
cyclically-adjusted CA in 2012 of 1¼ percent of GDP, to be about 2¼ percent of GDP weaker
than the EBA CA norm, but these estimates do not reflect the lagged impact of depreciation or
a temporary weakening of the trade balance from higher energy imports. Taking into account
the impact of the large depreciation of the yen using a range of the relevant trade elasticities,
and adjusting the current account for the impact of temporary energy shortages on the trade
balance, staff estimates the underlying CA in mid-2013 lie in a range around 3 percent of GDP
with a large up- and downside margin.



Bands around the CA gap: staff derives the CA gap using the extrapolated CA norm and the
cyclically adjusted CA. Reflecting the ranges in each of these underlying terms, staff’s assessment
is that the CA gap lies in a range of -1 to +2 percent of GDP, with a midpoint estimate of 0.5
percent.



CGER methodology. Estimates using the CGER methodology, based on a reference period of
February-March 2013 indicate an undervaluation of 23 percent using the ERER approach, while

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JAPAN

both the MB (current account) and external sustainability approach suggest CA gaps of about 0.5 percent.
Overall external sector report (ESR) assessment. Taking into account the EBA results, a major shift
in the policy framework, recent external sector developments and uncertainty about the exact size of
the underlying CA, staff estimates that the current account gap ranges from 1 percent of GDP
weaker to 2 percent of GDP stronger than implied by fundamentals and desirable policies.
Furthermore, adjusting the EBA REER results for the sharp depreciation since 2012 staff assesses that
the REER is moderately undervalued with a mid-point of -5 percent, but an unusually wide range of
-20 percent undervaluation to 10 percent overvaluation reflecting significant uncertainty and market
volatility.

and a credible medium-term fiscal
and growth strategy could lead to a
virtuous cycle of high growth and
positive inflation.

Impact and Policy Response
High
Increased inflation expectations would help lowering expected real
interest rates and thereby stimulate activity, as well as leading to
positive inflation. It would improve debt dynamics, minimizing the
negative effect of consolidation on growth.
Policy response: The BoJ should prepare a credible exit strategy and
the government should save any fiscal overperformance.

Medium

Medium/High

Despite a package of bold reforms,
inflation and activity may not pick up
substantially because of structural
factors such as population aging or
inertia in inflation expectation and
the wage-setting process.

Growth in 2013–14 would be substantially below the baseline
projections. The burden of closing the output gap and moving
inflation expectations could fall back toward fiscal policy, further
increasing fiscal sustainability risks.
Policy response: The BoJ’s QQME could be recalibrated, including the
pace and composition of asset purchases. If the authorities commit
to a sufficiently ambitious and credible fiscal consolidation plan by
passing concrete measures, even if they take effect over the medium
term, the 2014–15 fiscal withdrawal could be made more gradual,
but the consumption tax increase should proceed as planned.
High
It would lead to a loss of confidence and have severe financial
market repercussions, undermining the recovery of domestic
demand. The 2012 FSAP Update indicates that even a modest
increase in the risk premium by 100bps could undermine financial
stability and worsen debt dynamics.
Policy response: The BoJ needs to increase the size and accelerate the
pace of bond purchases to assure investors and the authorities
should front-load fiscal adjustment and commit to ambitious
structural reforms to contain risks. The government should confirm
the two-step consumption tax increases.
Medium
Exports would decline owing to weak demand from emerging
economies and domestic demand would fall due to depressed
equity prices and weaker business and consumer confidence, making
escaping deflation more difficult. G-RAM simulations show that a fall
in private investment in the BRICS by 10 percent in 2013 would lower
Japanese GDP by more than 1 percent in near term relative to the
WEO baseline.
Policy response: Bold implementation of structural reforms is
important to boost domestic demand. Automatic stabilizers are
small and should be complemented with targeted, but limited fiscal
support measures, but it would not be advisable to delay
implementation of the increase in the consumption tax rate. The
pace of BoJ asset purchases could be accelerated.
Low/Medium
Exports would decline owing to weak global demand and safehaven effects, and the fiscal balance would deteriorate due to an
increased sovereign risk premium. G-RAM simulations show that a
fall in investment in the euro area by 3 and 5 percent in 2013 and
2014, respectively, would not only deteriorate export performance,
but also lower domestic demand through financial linkages, leading
to contraction of real GDP by about 1 percentage point in the
medium term relative to the WEO baseline.
Policy response: Same as for a “deeper than expected slowdown in
Ems.”

Medium
Disappointing growth reforms and
lack of concrete fiscal measures to
bring down public debt could trigger
a significant rise in the risk premium.
The BoJ would increasingly have to
replace domestic investors in
financing public debt, which could
lead to greater volatility in bond
markets and a rise in the risk
premium.
Medium
Disappointing activity in emerging
markets would bring about a
reassessment that the cycle is more
mature and that trend growth will be
lower than previously thought. This
could be triggered by financial
stresses or setbacks in fiscal and labor
market reform efforts that could
affect confidence, FDI inflows, and
private investment.

High
The effects of public and private
sector deleveraging on the real
economy may be larger than
currently expected, potentially
spurring debt-deflation dynamics.
Financial market fragmentation would
become entrenched, unemployment
remains high, and investment remains
subdued, reducing potential output.
Core economies weaken due to trade
links and confidence effects, reducing
medium-term growth in the euro
area to around ¾ percent.

Appendix III. Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis
This appendix presents three scenarios and their sensitivity analyses: (i) no adjustment scenario;
(ii) baseline scenario (staff’s estimate of the authorities’ current plan); and (iii) fiscal adjustment
scenario (see Table 1 on page 18 for specifics). Staff recommends a structural adjustment of at least
11 percent of GDP to put the debt ratio on a declining path.
Baseline macroeconomic assumptions. Both real GDP growth and GDP deflator rates beyond 2018,
the last year in the WEO projection, are assumed to be similar to the ones in 2018, 1 and
1.2 respectively. As a result, nominal GDP growth is around 2.2 percent per annum beyond 2018.1
The nominal interest rate-growth differential is assumed to converge to 1 percent (about the precrisis average since 2000) over the long run. Consequently, the effective nominal interest rate is
assumed to rise to 3.2 percent (compared to about 1 percent currently) over the long run.
No adjustment scenario. Without the planned consumption tax increases, net debt (defined here as
general government net debt, including the social
Japan: Net Public Debt 1/
security fund) is projected to rise to about

scenario does not assume an increase in the risk

Baseline scenario. Staff estimates that the authorities’ current plan (Table 1, page 18, left column),
including the two-stage consumption tax rate increases from 5 to 8 percent in 2014 and then to
10 percent in 2015, together with the above-mentioned expenditure adjustment, would improve the
structural primary balance by 5½ percent of GDP over the next decade. This factors in staff’s
assumption that around a quarter of the revenue gain from the consumption tax hike will be spent
on social security as government’s plan, and that the single rate structure of the consumption tax will
be kept.2 Even with this adjustment, however, the net debt-to-GDP ratio would steadily climb to
around 210 percent of GDP (300 percent of GDP on a gross debt basis) by 2030.
Fiscal adjustment scenario. Achieving debt sustainability will require that Japan puts its debt-toGDP ratio on a clear downward path. Staff estimates that this requires an 11 percent of GDP

It is assumed that additional fiscal consolidation on top of the baseline scenario has no impact on growth (zero
multiplier) as a credible fiscal plan enhances confidence and consolidation measures are designed to reduce
distortions. Thus, key macroeconomic assumptions are the same under the three scenarios.

Measures to address the regressivity of the consumption tax rate hike are likely to be implemented, but not

improvement of the structural primary balance over the next decade (Table 1, page 18, right
column).3 In addition to the baseline scenario, this comprises another 5 percentage points increase in
the consumption tax rate (2.5 percent of GDP) and expenditure reforms that result in savings of
3 percent of GDP (e.g., containing social security and non-social security spending).4 Under this
scenario, the net debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to peak at around 155 percent in 2016 and decline
to 135 percent of GDP (225 percent of GDP on a gross debt basis) by 2030.
Sensitivity Analysis
A complete package of reforms would provide an upside scenario. Ambitious structural reforms
together with staff’s policy adjustment scenario could lead to faster attainment of the inflation target
and higher potential growth (Box 1). This would reduce the debt ratio by an additional 5 percentage
points of GDP by 2030 as higher nominal GDP growth reduces the debt ratio, thanks to a higher
denominator (nominal GDP) until the effective nominal interest rate catches up.
Overall, debt dynamics are subject to downside risks however, for the following reasons:


A higher interest rate growth differential (baseline: 1 percent in the long run) would lead to
a faster pace of debt accumulation (Table III.1). A 1 percent rise in the differential undoes the
declining in the debt trajectory under the fiscal adjustment scenario, while a 4 percent differential
yields an explosive path for the debt ratio.



Historical shocks: stochastic simulations considering shocks to growth, inflation, and interest
rates, based on historical patterns, further illustrates the sensitivity of the debt dynamics to
macroeconomics factors. Even with an 11 percent of GDP improvement in the structural primary
balance, the debt ratio is explosive with a 25 percent probability (Figure III.1, left). To achieve
a declining debt trajectory with a 90 percent probability, an additional adjustment of 5 percent of
GDP is needed (Figure III.1, right).



Contingent liabilities: the debt position looks worse once contingent liabilities are taken into
account. Including government guaranteed bonds and borrowing would add around
10 percentage points of GDP to the general government debt. Adding contingent liabilities
associated with Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO)5 and regional banks6 would have
a modest impact on debt (3 percentage points in total at maximum). In addition, there are a few
special accounts of the central government that are not included in the general government. The

3

Beyond 2020, the social security balance (defined as social security premiums minus benefits) is likely to worsen (for
example, see Box 4 on rising health care expenditures). Thus, offsetting measures would be needed to maintain the
11 percentage point improvement from 2021 onwards.

4

More specifically, the fiscal adjustment scenario assumes additional revenue increases of 0.5, 1, and 1 percent of GDP
in 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. It also includes an additional spending reduction of 0.6 percent of GDP per year
between 2016 and 2020.
5

TEPCO is liable for compensation for residents who lived in the neighborhood of the nuclear plants damaged by the
March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Capital injection and reaching the limit of government guaranteed bond
issuance would amount to 9 trillion yen (around 2 percent of GDP) in liabilities.

6

The 2012 FSAP estimated that capital shortfall in regional banks could be ¾ percent of GDP based on a number of
shocks involving a 100 basis point increase in bond yields.

Appendix IV. Main Recommendations of the 2012 Article IV Consultation
Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions

Fiscal Policy:
Passage of a consumption tax rate increase to demonstrate a
commitment to fiscal reform and sustain investor confidence.

The Diet passed legislation of a two-step increase of the
consumption tax rate from 5 to 8 percent in April 2014 and to
10 percent in October 2015. A final decision on implementation
of the first step is scheduled for this fall.

Further commitment to fiscal reform to bring down public debt
over the medium term. The adjustment should be designed to
minimize the negative growth impact and address equity
concerns, including:

In June 2013, the government reaffirmed its fiscal adjustment
objectives of halving the primary deficits by FY2015 and
achieving a primary surplus by FY2020.



Increasing the consumption tax to a uniform rate of at
least 15 percent, closer to OECD averages.



Cutting the corporate tax rate further beyond the
planned reduction to improve investment incentives.



Broadening the personal income tax base, including by
reducing the exemption for pension income and
eliminating tax deduction for dependent spouses.



Reducing social security spending by raising the
pension retirement age to above 65 years, collecting
contributions from dependent spouses, and clawing
back wealthy retirees benefits.



Introducing a taxpayer identification system to allow for
a more effective targeting of social transfers.

The Diet passed a supplementary budget in February 2013 as
part of the policy package to stimulate growth (about
1½ percent of GDP).
The Diet revised the corporate tax act to temporarily give tax
credits for investment, research and development, and
employment in March 2013. It also approved increasing tax
burden on inheritance.
The Diet passed the bill to introduce the social security and tax
number system in May 2013.

Monetary Policy:
Forceful monetary easing to exit deflation beyond current plans,
including by extending the maturity of JGB purchases beyond
3 years and scaling up the purchases of risky assets such as
corporate bonds, commercial paper, ETFs, and securitized SME
loans.
Enhancing the BoJ’s communication to increase the effectiveness
of monetary policy.

The BoJ introduced the QQME in April 2013 to achieve 2 percent
inflation with a time horizon of about two years. It shifted to a
monetary base target and plans to double it in two years
primarily by purchases of government bonds while lengthening
the maturity of bond purchases. The BoJ also strengthened its
policy commitment.

Financial Sector Policy:
The Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) made several
key recommendations on risk monitoring, prudential framework,
crisis resolution, and implementation of the global regulatory
reform (see Annex V).

The authorities have made important progress on several
regulatory areas in line with the FSAP Update recommendations
(see Annex V).

Growth Strategy



Increasing female and elderly labor participation
through improving access to childcare, and raising the
retirement age to above 65 years, and introducing a
uniform regular employment contract that gradually
increases employment protection. Broaden the current
immigration “points-based” system to meet labor
shortages in childcare and long-term elderly care.



Raising productivity through increased FDI inflows and
encouraging investment by easing regulations and
joining the TPP Agreement.



Improving financial intermediation by scaling down
government backed guarantees for SME loans,
phasing out the temporary SME Financing Facilitation
Act, reducing the government’s role in channeling
credit, and encouraging the use of asset-based
lending to increase risk capital provision.

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The government announced structural reforms throughout 2012
and 2013, including through:




participation in the TPP negotiations;



adoption of a broad outline of a growth strategy
targeting real growth of 2 percent over the next
decade, and doubling of inward FDI and agricultural
exports. Measures to be developed aim at raising the
employment of women, greater labor mobility across
sectors, deregulation through special economic zones,
and measures to raise investment.



SME restructuring. The SME Financing Facilitation Act
expired as scheduled.

increased availability of child daycare centers,
including by providing public financial support to
small-scale childcare services, and allowing more
private corporations to run childcare facilities.

Appendix V. FSAP Follow Up: Recent Reforms and Pending Issues
The 2012 Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) Update made several recommendations to
further strengthen the financial system. It recommended enhancing the monitoring of systemic risks,
including from financial institutions’ exposure to Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) and equities. It
also recommended the authorities to strengthen their prudential framework, including by raising
capital requirements for domestically active banks, tightening banks’ large exposure lending limits,
strengthening the solvency assessment for insurers, and improving the resolution framework for
nonbank financial institutions. The authorities agreed with most FSSA recommendations and noted
they would continue to monitor financial stability risks closely.
Since then, important progress has been made in several areas. These include:


Developing the framework for regular thematic risk assessments and bottom-up stress
tests. The BoJ has refined the top-down stress test methodology for the banking system. In line
with the Annual Supervisory Policy, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) has requested some of
the major banking groups to conduct bottom-up stress tests based on common scenarios. The
FSA has conducted a horizontal review of the results as well as the models used by the banks for
stress testing.



Implementing Basel III for internationally active banks starting in March 2013, which will
strengthen capital standards in a phased manner. Basel III will have a gradual negative impact on
Tier 1 capital ratios of major banks over the medium term (by up to 3 percentage points,
according to FSAP estimates). Nevertheless, banks are likely to meet the new capital
requirements reflecting their high initial capital buffers, and the gradual phase-in of Basel III
rules that provides time to build capital through retained earnings. Two large broker-dealers are
also implementing Basel III rules.



Developing new capital adequacy rules for domestically active banks, which can strengthen
soundness of regional and shinkin banks. FSA’s new rules, which will start from March 2014, will
raise the quality of capital by setting "core-capital," which consists of high loss-absorbency
instruments, as regulatory capital while keeping the minimum ratio of 4 percent. However, under
the new rule, the temporary measure introduced in 2008 that allows domestic banks to exclude
unrealized losses on securities holdings from capital would become permanent. This treatment
needs close monitoring of market risk of securities holdings, including in relation to their
significant government bond holdings.



Strengthening large exposure limits for banks. The FSA has submitted a bill to the Diet that
would cap the volume of bank lending to a company and its subsidiaries at 25 percent of a
lender’s capital, in line with international best practices, down from the current 40 percent.
Although the impact of this measure is expected to be manageable for most banks, the bill
includes a transitional measure that tolerates a temporary breach under the FSA approval, in
case this would require a sharp cut in lending to specific companies.



Strengthening resolution plans for all systemically relevant banks and nonbank financial
institutions. The FSA submitted a bill to the Diet to establish an orderly resolution regime for
financial institutions, in order to address risks that may spread across financial markets. The FSA
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

JAPAN

is formulating recovery and resolution plans for globally systemically important financial
institutions and other systemically important nonbanks, in line with the schedule agreed at the
Financial Stability Board (FSB).


Reducing excessive credit support on SMEs. As the SME Financing Facilitation Act ended in
March 2013 as scheduled, FSA continues to encourage financial institutions to make efforts to
ensure provisions of funds to SMEs. The usage of credit guarantees has been gradually reduced
from the peak of 36 trillion yen in FY2009 to 32 trillion yen in FY2012. Policy initiatives to further
reduce the reliance of SMEs on credit supports remain necessary.



Deepening cross-border risk monitoring arrangements with foreign supervisory
authorities. The FSA and BoJ have signed the Multilateral Framework for sharing the
information of globally systemically important banks collected thorough the FSB Data Gaps
initiative in early 2013, following discussion at the FSB. As the new macroeconomic policy will
likely encourage further overseas expansion by internationally active banks, cross-border risk
monitoring arrangements, such as the Data Gaps initiative can help monitoring of risks from
activities abroad, including foreign exchange funding risks.



Staff recommended further efforts to build on these achievements. In particular, staff
recommended strengthening capital standards of domestically active banks beyond current
plans, including by reassessing the treatment of unrealized losses in capital, continued close
monitoring of rising foreign-exchange funding risks from overseas activities of internationally
active banks, passage of legislation on tightening large exposure limits and establishing an
orderly resolution regime for financial institutions, and phasing out the full credit guarantees to
SMEs to restore credit discipline. Staff also supported the authorities’ consideration to introduce
economic value-based solvency regimes to enhance the required solvency margins for insurers.

Japan maintains a free floating exchange rate regime. Since the 2012 Article IV consultation, Japan
has not had foreign exchange intervention. The ministry of finance publishes foreign exchange
intervention information on its website. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions, with the exceptions of restrictions
imposed solely for the preservation of national or international security that have been notified to
the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144–(52/51).

Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Framework:
Japan underwent an assessment of its AML/CFT framework against the AML/CFT standard by the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Asia/Pacific Group (APG) in 2008. Significant deficiencies
were identified, notably with respect to customer due diligence (CDD) requirements, transparency of
legal entities, the criminalization of terrorist financing and the freezing of terrorist assets. Since then,
Japan has taken important steps to remedy some of the shortcomings identified. According to
Japan’s May 2013 follow-up report to the FATF (page 3), further action is nevertheless required,
notably with a view to strengthening CDD rules and enabling appropriate freezing of terrorist assets.
In addition, further improvements seem necessary to increase the transparency (and thus limit the
misuse) of legal entities. No dates have been set for Japan’s next mutual evaluation.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation Discussions with Japan
On July 31, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation discussions with Japan.1
The new government announced in December 2012 a new policy framework to end decades-long
deflation and raise growth. The new policy regime calls for a coordinated policy effort by the
Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the government to jumpstart the economy and create sustained growth
synergies through bold structural reforms. The announcement was followed by a quick set of
actions.
On the back of this new policy framework, growth accelerated sharply in early 2013. First
quarter GDP growth rose to 4.1 percent (seasonally adjusted annual rate) after two quarters of
stagnation. Rising equity values stimulated consumption and exports rebounded supported by
strong regional demand and a weaker yen. Inflation expectations have started to increase and
actual inflation recorded positive growth in June.
Financial and exchange markets were buoyant in early 2013 and the immediate aftermath of
Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQME). From September 2012 to mid-May 2013
the Nikkei stock index rose by about 80 percent, but temporarily dropped sharply by around
15 percent. As of end June, the yen has depreciated by about 20 percent in real effective terms
since mid-2012. Ten-year bond yields have remained unchanged around 80-90 basis points since
the beginning of the year, although they briefly declined to historic lows of about 45 basis points
after the announcement of QQME.
The near-term outlook has improved considerably, buoyed by stimulus. The Japanese economy
is expected to grow by about 2 percent, mainly as a result of the new fiscal stimulus and
monetary easing feeding through to private consumption and with some lag to investment. A
strengthening of external demand, helped by depreciation, and frontloading of consumption
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found here:

ahead of the April 2014 consumption tax increase further supports the recovery. In 2014, growth
is expected to moderate to 1.2 percent as a continued pick-up in private domestic demand is
offset by fiscal withdrawal from the consumption tax increase—from 5 to 8 percent—and an
unwinding of reconstruction spending. Over the medium term, growth is expected to converge to
1 percent as a recovery in investment is offset by a slowdown in labor supply due to population
aging.
Capital positions of major financial institutions have improved due to strong equity performance,
rising income from securities trading, and capital gains on Japanese Government Bonds and
foreign asset holdings, while credit costs in banks remain limited. Profits for internationally
active banks have also risen due to relatively high net interest margins on overseas loans, which
rose by 20 percent (year-on-year). Implementation of Basel III requirement has commenced in
March 2013.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Japan’s near-term economic prospects have improved with the
adoption of vigorous macroeconomic policies combining fiscal stimulus with unprecedented
monetary easing. Directors agreed, however, that the growth outlook is subject to significant
risks, primarily stemming from incomplete domestic reforms and a weaker external environment,
and that sustained implementation of the authorities’ reform program is the best way to minimize
these risks.
Directors welcomed the new monetary policy framework, which should make an important
contribution to end deflation. They noted that careful communication and flexibility in execution
are essential to contain market volatility and ensure effective policy transmission. At the same
time, some Directors encouraged the authorities to prepare plans for an eventual exit from
quantitative and qualitative monetary easing, even if that exit likely remains far off into the
future.
Directors concurred that a credible medium-term fiscal plan should be adopted promptly to
contain fiscal risks and reduce policy uncertainty. They noted that bringing down public debt as a
share of GDP will require a significant adjustment over the next decade. In this regard, Directors
generally supported the authorities’ plans to double the consumption tax rate by 2015, although a
few Directors expressed concern over the possible adverse impact on growth. Directors also
underscored that additional revenue and expenditure measures will be needed beyond 2015.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate is moderately undervalued at
present, but stressed the large margin of uncertainty surrounding this assessment in the wake of
the recent changes in the macroeconomic policy framework.
Directors noted that the financial system is generally sound, but low profitability and exposure to
interest rate risk remain a concern. They agreed that the successful implementation of a
comprehensive structural reform package would contribute to enhancing financial sector

3

stability. Directors welcomed recent progress on regulatory reform, but called for a strengthening
of capital standards for regional banks, and for careful monitoring of foreign-funding by major
banks.
Directors stressed that the new monetary framework should be supported by wide-ranging
structural reforms, which can play a key role in the authorities’ efforts to eradicate deflationary
expectations and achieve self-sustaining growth. They called for steadfast implementation of a
comprehensive agenda focused on reducing excessive labor market duality, deregulating
agriculture and services, revitalizing small and medium enterprises, eliminating constraints on
the provision of risk capital to firms, creating fiscal incentives to work and invest, and further
relaxing immigration requirements. Directors welcomed the government’s steps to boost the
employment of women, and also, generally, its intention to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
