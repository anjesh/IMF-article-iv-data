IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Côte d’Ivoire
On May 25, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2016 Article IV consultation1 with Côte d’Ivoire.
Côte d’Ivoire’s economic performance over the past 4 years has been impressive.
Nevertheless, challenges remain. Political normalization, together with supportive fiscal
policy and structural reforms to improve the business climate enabled a strong pickup in
economic activity. Growth has been accompanied by a modest decline in poverty, but other
human development indicators have been slow to improve.
Economic activity remained buoyant in 2015. Real GDP grew by an estimated 8.6 percent
driven by strong investment and private consumption. Inflation remained subdued, reflecting
ample domestic food production and imported consumer products. The 2015 fiscal deficit
was below the 3.7 percent target at 3 percent, owing to stronger revenues and an under
execution of externally-financed capital spending. Credit continued to grow at a rapid pace,
while banking sector soundness indicators weakened.
The medium-term outlook is favorable. However, the outlook is subject to downside risks.
Economic activity is projected to remain strong at 8.5 percent in 2016, and 7.4 percent per
year on average in 2017–20. The overall fiscal deficit is projected to widen to close to
4 percent of GDP from 3 percent of GDP in 2015, on the back of higher public investment
and security outlays, as well as interest payments. The external current account deficit is
likely to deteriorate to about 3 percent of GDP on average from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2015,
driven by strong domestic demand, in particular investment, in support of structural

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found

transformation. Key risks to the outlook include tighter and more volatile global financial
conditions, protracted global sluggishness, a further deterioration in the financial situation of
the national refinery company, further terrorist attacks in the region, as well as
macro-financial risks stemming from potential contingent liabilities in the public sector and
vulnerabilities in the financial sector.
The authorities’ 2016–20 National Development Plan (NDP) aims at achieving strong and
inclusive growth. To support the structural transformation envisaged under the NDP, the
private sector would play a large role, benefitting from strong public infrastructure
investment and further structural reforms to improve the business climate. Success will
depend on the pace at which structural bottlenecks are addressed and productivity-enhancing
reforms are carried out.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the impressive economic performance
over the last four years, underpinned by growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, productivity
enhancing reforms, and a favorable global and socio-political environment. However,
Directors noted that challenges remain and poverty is still relatively high despite some
progress made. They emphasized the need for continued commitment to sound
macroeconomic policies and ambitious structural reforms to safeguard the favorable
economic performance and cement the path for sustainable and inclusive growth. Against
this background, Directors welcomed the authorities’ 2016–2020 National Development
Plan, which aims at halving poverty and fostering structural transformation.
Directors stressed that building fiscal buffers is necessary to preserve fiscal sustainability.
They called for a reduction in the overall fiscal deficit consistent with the WAEMU
convergence criteria, which would provide the needed space to cope with fiscal risks while
addressing infrastructure investment needs. To this end, Directors stressed the importance of
higher revenue mobilization, including by reducing tax exemptions, broadening the tax base,
improving tax administration, and restraining expenditure growth. They also recommended a
more measured scaling up of public investment in line with implementation capacity.
Directors underscored the need for continued efforts to strengthen public financial
management to better control and manage contingent liabilities, including those stemming
from public private partnerships. They encouraged further progress toward reducing the
recourse to exceptional spending procedures and implementing a single treasury account.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors emphasized the importance of prudent debt policy and management. They
highlighted that the pace of new government borrowing, particularly non-concessional
borrowing, should take into account the risks associated with the realization of contingent
liabilities, and the need to avoid an additional concentration of maturities in the mid-2020’s.
Directors encouraged continued efforts to diversify and broaden the financing base.
Directors saw need for further action to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector and
foster financial inclusion. Given the rapid increase in credit and associated decline in bank
solvency, they called for a buildup of bank capital buffers. They advised a rapid resolution of
the troubled public banks. Directors encouraged the authorities to modernize the regulatory
framework in order to take advantage of opportunities to foster financial inclusion through
new information and communication technologies.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to intensify structural reforms. They agreed
that priority should be given to enhancing productivity by addressing gaps in infrastructure
and human capital, and improving the business climate. Directors also called for further
efforts to improve the production and dissemination of quality economic data, and supported
technical assistance by the Fund and other development partners. Directors noted that
continued engagement with the Fund would help support Côte d’Ivoire’s ambitious
development agenda and address challenges ahead.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 10, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Economic performance has been impressive over the past 4 years, but challenges remain.
Political normalization, together with supportive fiscal policy and structural reforms to improve the
business climate enabled a strong pickup in economic activity. Growth has been accompanied by a
modest decline in poverty, but other human development indicators have been slow to improve.
The authorities recently adopted a 2016–20 National Development Plan (NDP) that aims to
achieve sustained, strong and inclusive growth. Under the NDP, the private sector would play a
major role, supported by a continued expansion in public infrastructure and further structural reforms
to improve the business climate. Successful NDP implementation will depend on the pace at which
structural bottlenecks are tackled and productivity-enhancing reforms are carried out, as well as on
financing conditions and how domestic and external risks are addressed.
The medium-term outlook is positive, but a number of external and domestic downside risks
could hamper implementation of the NDP. The macro-financial risks stemming from potential
contingent liabilities in the public sector and vulnerabilities in the financial sector, together with
headwinds from increased global risks, could adversely affect Côte d’Ivoire’s economic outlook.

1

Discussions focused on policies to achieve the NDP objectives and reduce the adverse impact
of potential headwinds and risks: (i) supply-side reforms to support structural transformation by
further improving productivity; (ii) supportive medium-term policies that allows for building buffers
to provide scope for counter-cyclical policy and to meet potential costs of contingent liabilities;
(iii) actions to enhance the stability of the financial sector and promote financial inclusion; and
(iv) strengthening public finance management to better control and manage fiscal contingent
liabilities. Key policy elements for building policy buffers include: mobilizing higher domestic
revenues, targeting a slower pace of public investment scaling up in line with absorption capacity,
managing debt prudently, and replenishing bank capital.
Efforts to improve economic data should continue. In line with the growing role of the private
sector and foreign investment and financing, there is a need to upgrade the production and
publication of quality economic data.

Growth has been accompanied by a modest decline in poverty, but other human
development indicators have been slow to improve. The poverty rate fell to about 46 percent in
2015 from over 51 percent in 2011. Efforts were made during 2012–15 to make growth more
inclusive, including by raising the farm price for coffee and cocoa and other agriculture products
and improving basic infrastructure in rural areas. However, there remain significant disparities across
the country in education attainment, employment and income (Annex I). The 2015 Human
Development Report ranked Côte d’Ivoire at 172 out of 188 countries, with an overall Human
Development Index below the average for sub-Saharan Africa.

The authorities broadly implemented the main advice of the 2013 Article
IV Consultation. The policy recommendations aimed at building the foundations for strong growth
and focused on ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability, strengthening the financial sector,
bolstering external stability and improving the business climate, as well as enhancing governance.
Overall, significant inroads were made on all these fronts, but progress in public bank restructuring
and financial sector development reform has been slow (Annex II).
4.
Following last October’s peaceful presidential elections, political uncertainties have
abated, paving the way for continued economic progress. President Ouattara was re-elected in
October 2015 to a second mandate. The government has recently adopted a new 2016–20 National
Development Plan (NDP) aimed at halving poverty and fostering structural transformation (that is,
moving to higher domestic value-added products through the local transformation of a larger share
of agricultural products). The authorities have expressed an interest in a new Fund arrangement to
support the NDP objectives.
5.
Overall, Côte d’Ivoire’s macroeconomic performance has benefitted from the previous
two Fund-supported programs. An assessment of the last two PRGF/ECF arrangements shows that
they were instrumental at reducing macroeconomic imbalances, normalizing relations with external
creditors, as well as putting Côte d’Ivoire’s economy back on a solid growth path (Annex III).2 This
assessment also offers a few lessons for the design of a future Fund program engagement, including
the need to enlarge the scope of fiscal monitoring to public entities, take into account
macro-criticality and capacity in setting conditionality, and improve the quality of economic data.

2

The drawn-out political crisis and armed conflict after the disputed 2010 presidential elections reversed some of the
reforms and some of the macroeconomic progress that had been achieved.

B. Recent Developments
6.
Economic activity has remained buoyant. Real GDP growth is estimated at 8.6 percent,
driven by strong investment in the electricity, transport, commerce and housing sectors and solid
private consumption.3 Reflecting ample domestic food production and imported consumer
products, inflation remained subdued at 1.2 percent. The external current account deficit
widened slightly in 2015 as higher investment-related imports more than offset improved terms
of trade and exports (Figure 1).

The fiscal deficit has been contained. Total revenue collection exceeded expectations
in 2015, thanks to strong fuel and cocoa tax revenues, as well as higher one-off receipts from the
sales of telecommunications licenses, which compensated for shortfalls in direct taxes. Spending
fell short of the objective, reflecting the under-execution of externally-financed capital spending,
even though poverty-related spending was larger than budgeted. As a result, the overall fiscal
deficit was limited to 3 percent of GDP in 2015 (2.3 percent of GDP in 2014) compared to a
target of 3.7 percent of GDP, and the basic primary deficit was slightly below its target (Figure 2).
8.
Public sector debt has increased. Total central government debt rose to 49 percent of
GDP at end-2015 from 46½ percent of GDP at end-2014, largely because of a rise in external
debt of 2.3 percent of GDP. Public enterprise debt also rose in 2015 to about 3.7 percent of GDP
from 3 percent of GDP at end-2014, primarily because of a rise in CFAF-denominated debt.4
Non-CFAF denominated debt was broadly stable in terms of GDP, amounting to 1.4 percent of
GDP. Public enterprise debt5 amounted to 1 percent of GDP at end-2015, a slight fall from a year
earlier. Almost all other debt is owed to domestic banks. Arrears on public enterprise debt
(including on loans on-lent by the government) were lower at end-2015 than a year earlier.

3

In the absence of final data from the National Institute of Statistics, the authorities and staff rely on a range of
activity indicators to arrive at preliminary estimates of output expansion. For 2015, the authorities estimate real
GDP growth at 10.3 percent. The main difference between the authorities and staff’s estimate relates to imports.
Staff’s estimate of higher imports is calibrated on domestic demand, in particular investment, the main driver of
growth in Côte d’Ivoire.
4

The public enterprise database includes enterprises in which the government holds a majority stake and a
number of public agencies and funds.
5

Includes outstanding loans (virtually all non-CFAF denominated loans) on-lent from the central government,
which are recorded under central government debt.

9.
Credit has continued to grow at a rapid pace. Credit to the economy increased by
29.7 percent in 2015. Since December 2010, credit to the economy has more than doubled,
outpacing GDP growth, while inflation remained low. The rapid rise in credit was facilitated by
favorable global conditions, an improved domestic business environment, and accommodative
monetary policy, as well as the lowering of the prudential transformation ratio and excess
liquidity.6
10.
Credit is concentrated in the corporate sector. Credit growth was broad-based across
economic sectors, but concentrated on private and public corporations, in particular large small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the services and manufacturing sectors. Credit to public
companies is estimated to represent about 15 percent of new credit in 2015, including
borrowing by cash-strapped public energy companies (SIR and Petroci). However, the level of
household/consumer credit is still low and mortgage lending remains low owing to the absence
of long-term funding.

11.
Banking sector soundness indicators have deteriorated. The average bank capital
adequacy ratio fell to 8.3 percent at end-2015, only slightly above the WAEMU norm of
8 percent, as credit grew without a compensating increase in capital buffers. At present, three
banks (out of 26) representing four percent of the system’s assets, do not observe the minimum
capital adequacy ratio (CAR).7 Capital buffers in the other banks are generally thin.8
At 10.6 percent in 2015, banks’ non-performing loans (NPLs) in relation to their loan portfolio
remain high despite the rapid credit growth over the last three years. Credit exposure risk is
concentrated among large corporate borrowers (public enterprises, large private companies in
the agro-business, telecom and commerce sectors), which account for about a third of banks’
assets and three times their capital.
6

The transformational ratio (ratio of long-term assets to long-term liabilities), which is set by the BCEAO, was
lowered to 50 percent in 2015 from 75 percent. Strong growth in medium-term loans followed this reduction.
7

One public bank in particular has significant negative equity.

8

In July 2015, the minimum capital requirement was doubled to CFAF 10 billion, which banks have to respect by
June 2017; 10 banks (12 percent of banks’ assets) have yet to meet the new requirement, including 6 that did not
meet it previously.

MEDIUM-TERM ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
The recently launched NDP targets an average real GDP growth of almost 9 percent per
year over 2016–20. Under the NDP, growth is anticipated to benefit from strong investment
especially in transport and power generation, financed in large part through public private
partnerships (PPPs), and a strong private sector response. Inflation would remain below the WAEMU
norm of 3 percent, while the fiscal deficit would increase to about 4 percent of GDP before declining
toward the regional norm of 3 percent of GDP. The current external account deficit would widen to
3.6 percent of GDP on average, because of the increase in domestic demand, and foreign direct
investment and external borrowing would largely finance it.
13.
While sharing the authorities’ views about the generally strong growth prospects, staff
considered the NDP scenario to be overly optimistic given the prevailing structural bottlenecks.
9
Despite increased investment in infrastructure over the past four years, significant gaps still exist. In
addition, while staff’s analysis of Côte d’Ivoire’s external competitiveness shows that there is no
significant sign of real exchange rate misalignment, weaknesses in structural competitiveness remain
despite recent progress (Annex IV). Notwithstanding the improvements in Côte d’Ivoire’s global
competitiveness ranking among sub-Saharan African frontier markets and its ranking on the World
Bank’s Doing Business Indicators, it lags on indicators such as ease of paying taxes and obtaining
credit. International trade is hampered by the high cost or delays caused by international
transportation and burdensome import procedures. Also, human capital indicators are weaker than
comparator countries, and local employers have noted a lack of adequate skilled labor. Staff argued
that these bottlenecks would take time to tackle.

14.
The authorities are upbeat about the prospects of achieving the NDP’s high growth
scenario. They observed that the efforts already made to improve the business environment
augured well for the implementation of the NDP and considered that the infrastructure gaps
could be closed speedily. They stressed that the knowhow acquired during the implementation of
the 2012–15 NDP, including on large projects, and programs already launched (such as universal
access to schooling, health care and electricity) as well as programs envisaged for professional
training should help to rapidly ease bottlenecks. They highlighted their plans to double domestic
energy generation capacity over the next few years (to 4000 megawatts), which they viewed as
critical for domestic electricity penetration and economic expansion, as well as electricity exports
for regional development. They noted that Côte d’Ivoire is increasingly being seen as a good
prospect for investors in sub-Saharan Africa. Against the background of satisfactory program
implementation over the past four years, as well as improvements in macroeconomic aggregates
and investor perception of Côte d’Ivoire, the authorities were convinced that they would be able
to raise the envisaged financing for their NDP.
15.
The staff’s baseline scenario takes into account policies in place and those
announced and are likely to be implemented. The baseline also incorporates the impact of the
above-noted structural bottlenecks and implementation capacity:


Real GDP would grow by about 7.6 percent per year on average during 2016–20 on the
back of continued infrastructure efforts especially in the transport10 and energy sectors,
higher investment in the agro-business industry (cocoa, cashew processing and rice) and
housing, and strong private consumption.



Inflation would remain around 2 percent assuming normal rainfall and favorable global
food and fuel prices.



The overall fiscal deficit is expected to increase to 3.8 percent of GDP on average over
2016–20 from 3 percent in 2015, as the projected revenue increase (0.6 percentage points
of GDP over five years reflecting improved efficiency in revenue administration) will be
insufficient to offset higher spending (1.2 percentage points of GDP over 2016-20) arising
from public investment and security outlays, as well as higher interest payments. Despite
the deterioration in the overall fiscal deficit, central government public debt would
decline to about 45 percent of GDP in 2020 (from 49 percent of GDP in 2015), reflecting
strong projected GDP growth.



The external current account deficit is likely to widen to about 2.9 percent of GDP on
average, driven by strong domestic demand. An expected rise in FDI inflows would help
finance this deficit.

10

Three major projects are set to be completed or begin during 2016-20: the extension of the port of Abidjan,
the Abidjan Metrorail, and the renovation of Abidjan-Ouagadougou railway.

16.
This baseline is however subject to considerable downside risks (Annex V). Financial sector
vulnerabilities could trigger a shock to the economy or reinforce the impact on the real sector of nonfinancial shocks, potentially generating self-reinforcing adverse spillover effects on the economy in the
absence of countervailing policy action:


On the external front, tighter and more volatile global financial conditions could hinder the
financing of both the public and private investments by raising funding costs. The domestic
capital market could have difficulty filling the gap due to its narrowness and weakness of banks’
equity capital. Sluggishness in the global economic environment, in particular in emerging
markets, presents a downside risk for export demand and prices, as well as on the supply of
funds and FDI.



On the domestic side, near-term fiscal risks stem from (i) two financially troubled public
entities—the savings bank (CNCE), slated for restructuring, and the national oil refinery
(SIR—see below)11; and (ii) the need to settle extra-budgetary spending from the previous
decade.12 Over the medium term, the fiscal account could be exposed to realization of
contingent liabilities from the projected large recourse to PPPs in the government’s investment
strategy and the weak profitability of state-owned enterprises. Also, a downturn in the credit
cycle could raise NPLs and limit banks’ ability to provide credit given the banking system’s
overall low capital buffers. In addition, the threat of renewed terrorist attacks in the region
could adversely affect FDI and growth.13

17.
The possible macroeconomic implications of the materialization of these risks are
assessed in an alternative scenario (Figure 3). Under this scenario, growth would be about
1 percentage point of GDP lower on average per year over 2016–20 than in the baseline mainly as a
result of a weaker private sector investment. The overall fiscal deficit would average 5½ percent of GDP
compared to 3.8 percent of GDP in the baseline on the back of lower revenue, increased interest
payments, public entity restructuring outlays and the settlement of past extra-budgetary liabilities.14
Total central government debt would peak at about 50 percent of GDP, or 3 percentage points of GDP
higher than under the baseline. By contrast, under the alternative scenario, the external current account
balance would improve slightly reflecting lower investment and growth, averaging 2.4 percent of GDP
compared to 2.9 in the baseline.
11

The audit of SIR, which is facing severe financial difficulties, is being finalized. The CNCE is under provisional
administration. The national oil company, Petroci, is being restructured to refocus on its core activities and improve its
liquidity situation.
12

The authorities have completed the audits of (i) pre-2011 extra-budgetary liabilities; and (ii) pre-2012 public
procurement contracts still recorded as “open” in the procurement database. They are in the phase of scrutinizing the
claims, and noted that they would most likely apply a significant haircut, given that these claims correspond to spending
made through irregular procedures.
13

Côte d’Ivoire suffered a terrorist attack in March 2016 at a beach resort outside Abidjan with several casualties.

14

The amount of contingent liabilities that will be realized and paid is uncertain in terms of amounts and timing. Staff
assumes that an amount equivalent to about 2 percent of GDP would be needed to (i) settle past extra-budgetary
liabilities (claims equivalent to about 1 percent of GDP have been validated by the audit on pre-2011 extra-budgetary
liabilities, and public procurement contracts for about 1 percent of GDP could be subject to payments); (ii) to restructure
CNCE (based on the Bank-Fund TA assessment, and after taking account of the amount already set aside in the 2016
budget, it is assumed that an additional public resources would be needed to put this public bank on a sound footing);
and (iii) contribute to the restructuring of SIR (the cumulative losses over 2012–15 amount to
CFAF 182.1 billion or about 0.9 percent of GDP). The payment is assumed to be made during 2016–19.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions centered on policies needed to (i) engender sustainable and inclusive growth; (ii) ensure fiscal
policy is on a sustainable path; and (iii) enhance banking sector stability and financial inclusion.

A. Structural Transformation and Growth
18.
Staff considered the strategy underlying the NDP to be broadly appropriate. The emphasis
is on improving the infrastructure and the business climate, as well as on increasing investment on
human capital, with the aim of allowing rapid development of the private sector. In addition, financial
sector reforms, including the public banking sector would improve financial inclusion and access to
credit. However, staff argued that the envisaged large increase in public investment was not consistent
with implementation capacity, risked displacing the very private sector activity it was seeking to promote,
and, as importantly, faced a difficult financing environment.
19.
The recent strong growth pickup has
been driven primarily by capital
accumulation and productivity gains. Staff
estimates that more than half of GDP growth
during 2012–15 is explained by the growthaccounting residual, which likely reflects a catchup in pent-up demand and pick-up in capacity
utilization, and productivity improvements; the
latter thanks to the government’s efforts to
narrow the infrastructure gap, improve
agriculture productivity15 and strengthen the
business climate. Sustaining high growth,
especially with a tapering of catch-up effects,
would require further supply-side structural
reforms to continue improving productivity.16

20.
The authorities shared the staff’s views on the importance of productivity-enhancing
reforms, but were more upbeat than staff on their implementation capacity and ability to mobilize
financing. They highlighted ongoing reforms to enhance productivity and make growth more inclusive,
including raising agriculture productivity and moving up the value added chain under the National
Agricultural Investment Program (PNIA), expanding access to education under the universal schooling
program, improving professional training, expanding health care access, and closing the infrastructure
gap. They also pointed out the priority given in the NDP to land reform is important for enhancing
agricultural productivity and financial inclusion. As noted above, the authorities believe that infrastructure
bottlenecks are rapidly being tackled, and public investment implementation capacity and their ability to
raise financing are adequate.

15

In particular, the yield per hectare of rice, cocoa, cashew and cassava has increased in the past few years.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

B. Preserving Fiscal Sustainability
21.
With the economy expanding at a rapid clip and non-trivial liabilities still to be addressed,
staff advocated a medium-term fiscal strategy focused on building buffers. In particular, staff
argued that gradually reducing the overall fiscal deficit to 3 percent by 2019 would still provide ample
room to address infrastructure investment needs while leaving adequate space to address fiscal risks that
materialize. Also importantly, such a deficit trajectory is needed for consistency with the government’s
commitment to the WAEMU convergence criteria and to help safeguard the BCEAO’s reserve coverage at
healthy levels.17 Relative to the baseline, such a deficit path could be achieved mainly through higher
revenue mobilization (an additional 1 percentage point of GDP by 2020 by rationalizing tax exemptions,18
broadening the tax base, and further efforts to improve tax administration), and somewhat lower
spending growth. This would also be more consistent with the government’s current implementation
capacity for infrastructure investment, the regional financial market’s capacity to provide financing
without undue pressure on borrowing costs as well as helping avoid crowding out of the private sector.
22.
The authorities argued in favor of a higher fiscal deficit. While cognizant of the fiscal risks,
they estimated that their envisaged larger fiscal deficit would still preserve fiscal space to cope with these
risks and support growth, while preserving long-term fiscal sustainability (given high growth). They
acknowledged the need to enhance revenue mobilization, and requested additional Fund technical
assistance (TA). While open to undertaking a diagnostics of tax exemption system, they expressed
concerns regarding the impact of cutting exemptions on Côte d’Ivoire’s investment attractiveness. The
authorities were confident that they would have financing access both on the global and regional
markets, given improvements in Côte d’Ivoire’s bond ratings.
23.
Implementation of a prudent debt management strategy is essential for the conduct of
countercyclical fiscal policy and preserving debt sustainability. The most recent debt sustainability
analysis (DSA) indicates that Côte d’Ivoire continues to be classified in the “moderate risk of debt
distress” category. Staff considers that the pace of the government’s new borrowing, particularly
non-concessional external debt, should take into account the risks of increased vulnerability identified in
the most recent DSA,19 including those from public enterprise contingent liabilities. In particular, new
borrowing should aim to (i) avoid adding to the bunching of maturities in the mid-2020s from existing
sovereign bonds and several large-scale project loans, and (ii) minimize rollover and foreign exchange
risks, especially from bullet sovereign bonds. Given the risk of tighter and more volatile financial
conditions and more constraints on official bilateral financing, staff advised the authorities to deepen and
diversify the domestic and regional creditor base. The authorities re-affirmed their commitment to
maintaining debt sustainability and agreed on the need to manage debt service bunching, rollover and
foreign exchange risks. They also pointed to their ongoing efforts to deepen and diversify the creditor
base, citing the successful launch of the Sukuk bond in 2015—which attracted foreign investors from
outside the regional market—and their intention to issue another such bond in 2016.
24.
Staff also encouraged the authorities to strengthen domestic debt management. The
conversion of non-marketable securitized debt into tradable government securities—by improving cash
flows, yield and liquidity—would contribute to the development of the domestic bond market and to
17

VAT exemptions were initially introduced to bypass long delays in VAT refunds. Reflecting the successful new
reimbursement procedures implemented in 2015, VAT credits are reimbursed in a timely manner.

financial stability. Implementation of the treasury single account and an active management of public
liquidity would permit a reduction of excess liquidity and development of the interbank market. The
reduction in unfunded liabilities through the restructuring of the state-owned enterprises, including
banks, and the strengthening of their management, would contribute significantly to improving the
quality of the banking assets, and thus to increasing the funding of private investment. In response to
these recommendations, the authorities highlighted ongoing actions to implement the treasury single
account and restructure public banks and the national oil company.
25.
Strengthening public financial management is critical to preserving fiscal sustainability. To
this end, priority should be given to reforms to improve fiscal transparency and strengthen contingent
liability management. Staff advised the authorities to:


Improve fiscal reporting by strengthening the integration of the budget and treasury IT systems;



Further limit recourse to exceptional expenditure procedures;



Enhance, in the context of the newly-developed centralized database for public enterprises, the
monitoring of the broader public sector by attaching a comprehensive financial analysis of these
enterprises to the budget documentation;



Complete the reorganization of the Debt Directorate into front, middle, and back offices, and
strengthen the role of the National Debt Policy Committee (noting that sound debt management
is even more essential at the time when global financing conditions are tighter and more volatile
and financing needs larger); and



Strenghten public investment management institutions and set up a framework for the
comprehensive conduct of fiscal risk analysis of PPP projects.

involvement through public-private partnerships (PPPs). The latest portfolio now includes 114 projects
for a total amount of approximately CFAF 14,000 billion (about 75 percent of 2015 GDP), mostly in the
transportation (e.g., the metro-rail of Abidjan), energy, animal and fishing, and tourism sectors.
For countries like Côte d’Ivoire with infrastructure gaps and facing financing constraints, PPPs offer
opportunities that allow risk sharing between the public and the private sector. On the other hand, PPPs
also present risks. PPP contracts can include explicit guarantees; for example, agreements for the
government to bear some downside risks associated with the projects that usually take the form of state
guarantees to incentivize private sector participation. PPP contracts can also contain implicit guarantees;
for example, in case of failure of the private contractor and the government has to pursue the project
due to its “public goods” nature. The resulting fiscal cost can be significant if risks materialize. A recent
example relates to an implicit guarantee that was triggered on the third bridge due to insufficient traffic
relative to contract assumptions (CFAF 12 billion in 2015; 0.07 percent of GDP).
Progress has been made on the transparency front: the website (www.ppp.gouv.ci) of the PPP national
committee provides relevant information. Medium-term priorities relate to strengthening existing legal
and institutional frameworks to (i) plan, review, approve, and monitor PPP projects; and (ii) assess and
monitor fiscal risks associated with PPP projects either individually (e.g., if contract assumptions are not
met) or all together (e.g., in event of an overall economic shock).

26.
The authorities concurred with staff on the need to enhance public finance management.
They emphasized progress made on the development of a centralized database for public enterprises,
adoption of a medium-term debt management strategy, and significant reduction of exceptional
spending procedures. Acknowledging the need for further efforts in these areas, the authorities
indicated that the integration of the budget and accounting IT systems is a key priority of their reform
agenda, as well as strengthening cash management and requested technical assistance on PPP fiscal risk
assessments.

C. Enhancing Banking Sector Stability and Financial Inclusion20
27.
The credit and GDP cycles have moved in
tandem. Data from 1976 to 2015 show a strong
relation between the GDP and credit cycles with a
lag of three to four years, indicating that credit
growth tends to follow and amplify the economic
cycle. A shock-induced downturn in economic
growth in Côte d’Ivoire would lower bank’s risk
appetite, leading to credit contraction and possible
increase in NPLs, thus exacerbating the economic
downturn.

28.

Banks in Côte d’Ivoire are exposed to two sources of vulnerabilities:



First, corporations have become increasingly leveraged vis-à-vis the local banks. A tightening in
credit conditions in case of a weaker economic outlook would lower corporate profits,
contributing to increased NPLs, which would, in turn, constrain credit and growth. The currently
thin capital buffers would be insufficient to sustain the continuation of credit growth at the
current pace.



Second, banks in Côte d’Ivoire have
increased their exposure to sovereigns
in the region. In 2015, these banks
(mainly smaller regional ones) doubled
their holdings of other WAEMU
governments’ securities21 to 38 percent
of their securities portfolio, reflecting
less issuance by Côte d’Ivoire in the
regional market as a result of greater
recourse to external financing. In
addition, the yield on Ivoirien
government securities was slightly
lower than that of other sovereigns in
the region.

29.
The financial sector could amplify external and fiscal shocks, particularly through the
corporate sector. Deteriorating external conditions (such as terms-of-trade shocks, loss in access to
international capital market, and tightening of regional monetary conditions) would lower bank funding
and private sector financing. In addition, reduced official access to international financial markets,
shortfalls in budget revenues, and unexpected fiscal expenditures would lead to either (i) increased
government reliance on domestic financing, which could crowd out private sector credit or (ii) reduced
capital spending, which would lower private credit demand. The contraction in credit, including to the
corporate sector, would exacerbate the downturn in economic activity triggered by external and fiscal
shocks.
30.
In response to the above risks, banks should build appropriate capital buffers in order to
mitigate any adverse impact of a reversal of the credit cycle. Staff welcomes the BCEAO’s decision to
increase banks’ minimum capital requirements and recommends that the authorities support the
enforcement of supervisory decisions. Banks that are not able to meet the minimum capital requirement
will need to be merged or liquidated, which will require intervention by the public authorities. The
authorities concurred with the need to reinforce capital buffers in the banking system and reiterated their
commitment to support the regional banking supervision commission by enforcing the commission’s
decisions. In addition, the Fund WAEMU surveillance calls for an acceleration of the transposition of Basel
II and III norms into the regulatory framework, which would provide the supervisory authority scope to
require countercyclical capital buffers. Also, to minimize exposure to sovereign risks, the Fund’s WAEMU
surveillance calls for fiscal consolidation and a gradual reduction by the BCEAO of its refinancing
operations.
31.
Timely restructuring of public banks would be important to strengthen banking sector
solvency and minimize budgetary costs. The lack of faster progress on public bank restructuring was
21

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

one of the weak points of the last two Fund-supported programs. Staff noted that the precarious
financial condition of one public bank, coupled with lack of success of past attempts at improving its
management, would justify its resolution—in line with the recommendation of the joint World Bank/IMF
mission. The authorities noted that, consistent with their financial sector strategy to reduce the public
stake in the banking system, they had sold the public minority share in two public banks, liquidated one
public bank, and had slated two other public banks for privatization. However, they had decided to
maintain the two remaining public banks in their portfolio to support public policies in specific sectors.
Stressing the importance of the ailing public saving bank for financial inclusion, the authorities had
decided to restructure it with public resources. Staff noted that the assumptions underlying the
restructuring of the bank—with respect to NPL recovery and return to profitability—appeared optimistic.
Against this backdrop, staff urged the authorities to undertake a realistic assessment of the budgetary
cost of the bank’s recapitalization, as well as modernization costs.22 With regard to the second public
bank that the authorities intend to keep operating, staff recommended that they repay early the stock of
non-marketable sovereign debt held by this bank based on the issuance in the market of marketable
debt.
32.
Financial inclusion is weak, as shown by several indicators, and this is impeding growth
potential and contributing to gender and geographical inequality:23


Access to credit by SMEs and the agricultural sector is limited. For instance, the agricultural sector
accounts for less than 6 percent of total loans. The bulk of credit goes to commerce and services,
with an overall allocation that does not correspond to the structure of the economy and hinders
broadening the sources of growth and diversification.



The proportion of adults with an account in a financial institution is lower in Côte d’Ivoire than in
frontier markets, and this indicator depicts strong gender and regional disparities.



The largest microfinance institution is insolvent. This challenging financial situation impairs access
to financial services by the poor segment of the population and thus hinders growth
inclusiveness. At the same time, the sector has some modern and sound micro-financial
institutions that are providing financial services to lower-income consumers.

33.
Côte d’Ivoire will benefit from an improvement in financial inclusion.24 There is scope to
expand financial services’ availability through different channels, including mobile networks and retail
agents. The challenge will be to continue modernizing the regulatory framework to achieve this while
strengthening the resources for supervision and consumer protection. Improving the transparency of
fees and conditions of digital financial services could improve consumer understanding and awareness,
facilitate the use of a wider range of financial services, and lower costs. Measures that the authorities
believe would improve financial inclusion and access to finance include: the restructuring of the CNCE
along with the improvement of its management; and the entry into operation of the credit bureau. It
would also be important to restructure the micro-finance institutions.

22

The total cost of restructuring this bank is estimated at 0.5 percent of GDP. The authorities plan to inject budget
resources equivalent to 0.2 percent of GDP, and assume that the recovery of bad loans and sale of assets would be
sufficient to cover the remaining cost. Under this option, the authorities recognize that bank would need government
subsidies through 2017, when it is assumed to become fully profitable.

The government’s strategy to improve financial inclusion is being supported by the World Bank.

OTHER ISSUES
34.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but shortcomings remain.
The authorities provide the required statistical indicators to the Fund generally on a timely basis.
While there are still weaknesses in national accounts statistics, the authorities are strengthening the
National Institute of Statistics (NIS) with technical assistance from the Fund to improve data quality.
Staff has adopted the final 2013 national accounts information provided by the NIS. Staff commends
the authorities for the preparation of quarterly national accounts. It recommends a timely finalization
of the 2014 national accounts, preparation of those for end-2015 quarterly, as well as the publication
of quarterly national accounts data and monthly and quarterly fiscal data. In the external sector,
efforts are necessary to improve the coverage of services, transfers, and stocks and flows of the
private non-bank sector; the IMF’s Statistics Department plans to start later this year a three-year
regional project to help countries improve their capacity to produce and disseminate related data.
35.
The authorities appreciated the technical assistance (TA) provided by the Fund
(Annex VI). Over the past four years, TA aimed at improving the national accounts statistics, enhancing
public finance management, increasing domestic fiscal revenues, bolstering debt management, and
guiding public bank restructuring. Overall, TA recommendations were implemented satisfactorily by
the authorities. Looking ahead, in line with the authorities’ priorities, TA will focus on the national
accounts, tax and customs administration, and public finance management, adoption of the e-GDDS,
and harmonization of government fiscal operations with regional norms.
36.
The 2013 assessment of the WAEMU regional central bank, BCEAO, found a continuing
strong control environment. All recommendations from the assessment have been implemented.
These include strengthening the external audit arrangements by appointment of an international firm
with ISA experience for the audits of FY15–17, reinforcing the capacity of the audit committee with
external expertise to oversee the audit and financial reporting processes, and adoption of IFRS
starting with the financial year 2015.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Côte d’Ivoire’s economy has achieved an impressive turnaround after a decade-long
period of stagnation and more efforts are needed to bolster the achievements. Over the last
4 years, economic activity expanded by 9 percent a year on average translating, into an increase in
real per capita income of more than 20 percent. The pursuit of a growth-friendly fiscal consolidation
and productivity-enhancing reforms, together with favorable global environment and socio-political
climate, were instrumental in achieving this strong performance. However, poverty rate, albeit
receding, remains relatively high. Notwithstanding the significant achievements over the past 4 years,
more efforts are needed to strengthen policy resilience and cement the path for sustainable and
inclusive growth.
38.
Medium-term prospects are favorable assuming the implementation of policies and
structural reforms that support private sector development. Staff welcomes priority given to
improvements in physical and human capital, as well as the business climate. It also praises the
emphasis placed on raising the productivity in the agricultural sector, including through the resolution
of the longstanding land issues. However, it is concerned that the ambitious public investment plan as
well as other developments in the public sector may crowd out the private sector.
39.
The challenge for medium-term fiscal policy is to build buffers to face potential
headwinds to the implementation of the NDP. Staff calls on the authorities to reduce the fiscal
deficit to 3 percent by 2019 in order to preserve space for countercyclical policy in the event of
adverse shocks to the economy from protracted slower growth in emerging markets, to contain a
rapid buildup of debt in case of the realization of contingent liabilities, and to avoid abrupt spending
cuts in the face of tighter global financial conditions. Such a deficit trajectory—which would still
provide ample room to address infrastructure investment needs—is necessary for consistency with the
government’s commitment to the WAEMU convergence criteria and to help safeguard the BCEAO’s
reserve coverage at healthy levels. To achieve this objective, it recommends a combination of a more
measured increase in spending and further revenue mobilization through streamlining tax
exemptions.
40.
Efforts to strengthen PFM should continue. The focus of the PFM reform should be on
improving the management of contingent liabilities, given the projected increased recourse to PPPs
and the buildup of risks within public entities. Staff underlined the importance of putting in place a
framework for assessing implicit and explicit PPP-related fiscal risks. Progress in reducing the recourse
to exceptional spending procedures and implementing the treasury single account should also
continue. Staff encourages the authorities to improve fiscal reporting by integrating the budget and
treasury IT systems.
41.
Staff encourages the authorities to pursue a prudent debt policy and strengthen debt
management. Staff recommends that the pace of the government’s new borrowing take into account
of the risks associated with the realization of contingent liabilities. It underlines the need to avoid an
additional bunching of the maturities from new borrowing in the mid-2020s, and a sharp increase in
the short term of debt service. Staff welcomes the efforts to diversify and broaden the financing base,
including through Sukuk-type bonds and the ongoing reforms to develop the secondary market.
Given the prospects of tighter global financial conditions, it encourages the authorities to take
forceful actions to deepen and unify the regional market. Staff urges the authorities to complete the
long-delayed reorganization of the debt department into front-, middle-, and back-offices, and
strengthen the National Debt Policy Committee.

42.
Public sector financing pressures on the banking sector could hamper private sector
development. The projected rapid scaling up of public investment in the NDP, together with the high
level of the public sector’s liabilities vis-à-vis the banking sector, could crowd out the private sector. In
this respect, staff recommends a less ambitious scaling up of public investment, aligned with
implementation capacity, to reduce the government funding pressures on the banking sector. It also
encourages the authorities to clear past off-budget liabilities and restructure loss-making public
entities to strengthen the capacity of the financial sector to support private sector development.
43.
Strengthening the resilience of the banking sector and fostering financial inclusion are
essential for strong and inclusive growth. Given Ivoirien banks’ increased exposure to local
corporations as well as to sovereigns in the region, coupled with the rapid increase in credit and
associated decline in banks’ solvency, staff calls for a buildup of bank capital buffers. To minimize
exposure to sovereign risks, the Fund’s WAEMU surveillance calls for fiscal consolidation and a
gradual reduction by the BCEAO of its refinancing operations. Staff reiterates the importance of acting
forcefully to resolve the troubled public banks and fully reflect the fiscal cost in the budget. It calls on
the authorities to enforce the Banking Commission’s decisions, including concerning the minimum
capital requirement. Staff underlines that promoting financial inclusion is necessary for inclusive
growth. In this respect, it presses the authorities to modernize the regulatory framework to fully take
advantage of the opportunities offered by the development of new information and communications
technologies. It also urges them to step up efforts to restructure ailing micro-financial institutions.
44.
There is a need to upgrade the production and dissemination of quality economic data
to better inform decision makers, market players and the public. Staff welcomes the additional
resources in the 2016 budget for the production of timely and reliable national accounts, but calls for
further efforts. It encourages the authorities to leverage the capacity building assistance being
provided by the IMF and other development partners to improve economic statistics. That said, data
provision is broadly adequate for standard surveillance.

Annex I. Dimensions of Poverty1
1.
The 2015 poverty survey shows that the poverty rate has declined somewhat to
46.3 percent in 2015 (from 48.9 percent in 2008). However, s shown in Figure 1, poverty has
been on an upward trend since the first recorded poverty survey in 1985. The poverty rate was at
an all-time high in 2008, a period marked by civil conflict which destroyed production capacity
and led to displaced civilians.
2.
The decline in rural poverty to 56.8 percent in 2015 (from 62.5 percent in 2008)
contributed significantly to the recent overall fall in poverty. Poverty in urban areas, on the
other hand, increased sharply to 35.9 percent in 2015 (from 29.5 percent in 2008). Still, poverty
remains mostly a rural phenomenon. From a geographical perspective, poverty is most prevalent
in the north, while the southern city of Abidjan has the lowest poverty rate.
3.
People living below the poverty line tend to be unemployed and are from large
households, the agricultural sector, and weak educational background. A probit analysis
shows that poverty is more widespread in households that are headed by females, own
under-developed lots, and live outside Abidjan. Poverty is also found to be more common
among the young: 51.4 percent of Ivoirians younger than 25 years are classified as poor, while
poverty rates in other age groups vary from 35 to 39 percent. There is a small gender gap in
overall poverty (see Figure 2), though this gap is large when it comes to employment: only
38.6 percent of women are employed, as opposed to 61.4 percent of men. Women outnumber
men in commerce where 59.5 percent of all employees are female.
4.
With about 92 percent of all jobs, the informal sector accounts for the bulk of
employment in Côte d’Ivoire. The formal sector hosts only about 8 percent of all jobs. Poverty
is most widespread in the informal sector, where the poverty rate is 37.3 percent (compared to
15.6 percent in the formal sector). Unemployment is mostly an urban phenomenon: the overall
unemployment rate currently stands at 6.9 percent, but is as low as 3 percent in rural areas. The
youth are overrepresented among the unemployed, with an unemployment rate of 9.6 percent
among the 14–35 year-old age group (compared to 3.2 percent for those over 36 years old).
5.
The report also describes the outcomes of a detailed interview with a sample of
people regarding their perception of poverty. About 51 percent of respondents indicated that
they did not perceive that poverty reduction was a priority. However, they were optimistic about
the future, with 78 percent of them believing that new administration will lower poverty. Some
88 percent of those interviewed believed that corruption was a major source of poverty.

This annex summarizes the 2015 poverty survey (Enquête sur le niveau de vie des ménages en Côte d’Ivoire).
From January to March 2015, the Ivorian Statistical Institute surveyed 12,900 Ivorian households about their
living standard, with a particular interest in poverty. The report defines poverty along relative (as opposed to
absolute) lines. Back in 1985, the relative poverty line was set at a consumption level of CFA 75,000
per year – such that about 10 percent of the population was classified as “poor”. Adjusting this level for inflation,
the 2015 poverty line is set at CFA 269,075 per year. Previous poverty surveys were conducted in 1985, 1993,
1995, 1998, 2002, and 2008.

Annex III. Lessons from Recent Program Engagement1
INTRODUCTION
1.

Over the last decade, two arrangements supported the Ivoirien authorities’

medium-term priorities of restoring macroeconomic stability, achieving high-sustained
growth and reducing poverty. The first arrangement (2009–11) was approved and implemented in
a context marked by a tense socio-political situation, a divided country confronted with security
issues and the preparation of the long-awaited presidential elections, as well as economic
stagnation. The drawn-out political crisis and armed conflict after the disputed 2010 presidential
elections derailed the program, leading the new authorities to request its cancellation. The second
arrangement (2011–15) started in the aftermath of the post-electoral crisis against a background of
socio-political normalization, a crisis-induced recession (-5.7 percent) and a widespread poverty
(over 50 percent of the population).
2.

This annex provides a review of progress during the 2009–11 and 2011–15 Fund-

supported programs. This document reflects the staff’s perspective, but it also includes
stakeholders’ views collected during a seminar held in Abidjan in the context of the 2016 Article IV
Consultation. This assessment is timely as the Fund and the authorities are gearing up for a new
program. Lessons drawn from these episodes would inform this future Fund engagement.

A. Program Objectives
While both programs were similar in their overarching objective- restoring macroeconomic stability,
achieving high and sustained growth, and reducing poverty-, the macroeconomic targets were adapted
to reflect socio-political context. More specifically:
The 2009–11 PRGF/ECF-supported program
3.

The macroeconomic objectives were to raise growth to 4.2 percent on average over

2009–11, reduce inflation to 3 percent and keep the overall budget deficit at around 2 percent of
GDP, which is consistent with debt sustainability after HIPC and MDRI debt relief. To achieve this:

1

This note incorporates comments from Salifou Issoufou.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35

CÔTE D’IVOIRE



Fiscal policy aimed to expand the tax base, strengthen revenue administration, shift
expenditure in favor of investment and pro-poor spending while strengthening public
financial management and implementing civil service reform;



Structural reforms focused on improving transparency and efficiency in the energy and
cocoa/coffee sectors and reducing vulnerabilities in the financial sector.
The 2011–15 ECF-Supported Program

4.

The macroeconomic targets were to: (i) achieve real GDP growth of 8-9 percent in 2012

after the crisis-induced recession, and 6 percent over the medium-term; (ii) bring back inflation
below 3 percent after the crisis-related spike; and (iii) move the basic primary balance from a deficit
to a surplus over the medium term, and reduce the overall fiscal deficit to around 3 percent of GDP.
To this end:


The fiscal policy strategy was to create fiscal space for an increase in pro-poor and public
investment outlays, while establishing fiscal and debt sustainability.



Structural reforms were focused on moving forward reforms that had stalled over the
previous program, and improving the business climate.

B. Program Performance
The 2009–11 PRGF/ECF-supported program
5.

Overall, in spite of the difficult socio-political environment, program implementation was

satisfactory before the drawn-out political crisis and armed conflict after the 2010 disputed
presidential elections that reversed some of the reforms and some of the macroeconomic progress
that had been achieved.
6.

While improving compared to the preceding years, the macroeconomic performance

was below the program expectations:


Real GDP growth averaged 3.1 percent per year against an objective of 4 percent, but higher
than the years before (0.4 percent on average during 2000-08), resulting in broadly stable
income per capita. This disappointing growth performance was due to a lower than
expected public investment, electricity outages and a tense political environment.



Fiscal performance fell short of the program targets, mainly reflecting overruns on subsidies
to cover the deficits of the electricity sector and the pension funds, as well as higher wage
bill.

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CÔTE D’IVOIRE



The program was successful at re-establishing orderly relations with external creditors, which
paved the way for the reaching of the HIPC Decision point.

7.

Implementation of structural reforms was slow. While some steps have been taken to

improve transparency in the hydrocarbon sector, contain exceptional spending procedures and
reduce domestic arrears, progress in key structural reforms such as cocoa/coffee sector, civil service,
pension funds, tax exemption rationalization, electricity sector and public banks has fallen behind
schedule, reflecting a complicated socio-political situation.
The 2011–15 ECF-supported program
8.
Overall, program implementation was strong, supported by a strengthening of confidence
with the normalization of the socio-political situation, sound macroeconomic policies and favorable
global environment.
9.

Macroeconomic performance broadly exceeded program expectations:



Economic activity recovered quickly from the political crisis-related recession in 2011, and
grew on average by 9 percent per year over 2012-15, against an objective of about
6 percent. This strong growth translated into a more than 20 percent rise in real per capita
income. Inflation was brought down to 1.2 percent from its 2011 spike of 4.9 percent. Under
the 2011–15 arrangement, despite strong macroeconomic performance, poverty and
inequality remained high (46.3 percent of the population lived in poverty in 2015, and there
are regional and gender inequalities within the country).



The overall fiscal deficit lowered to 3 percent from 5.4 percent in 2011, while opening up
space for pro-poor and investment spending. However, the basic primary balance remained
in deficit while the program had targeted a surplus. In addition, revenue performance was
slightly below expectations.



Côte d’Ivoire reached the HIPC Completion point in June 2012, and received substantial debt
relief under the HIPC and MDRI initiatives and the regularization of all remaining arrears with
external creditors. In 2014 and 2015, Côte d’Ivoire was able to issue sovereign bonds on the
international Eurobond market at lower yields than other SSA frontier economies.

10.

Progress on structural reforms was uneven. The cocoa sector reform has been

successfully completed, leading to higher incomes for farmers. Considerable steps have been taken
to improve the business climate, translating into improvements to Côte d’Ivoire’s rankings on
various international indices, including the World Bank’s Doing Business index. Reforms in PFM area
has advanced, although challenges remain particularly in the use of exceptional spending

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

procedures. Significant progress has been made to shore up the financial position of the electricity
sector. Some key structural reforms have fallen behind schedule, in particular in the areas of financial
sector and public enterprises. Further progress is needed in the governance area.
11.

Lessons from the 2009 and 2011 programs

Five key lessons can be drawn from the two programs:


There is a need to enlarge the scope of fiscal monitoring to public entities. The
definition of government was too narrow to capture all the developments in the public
sector. Indeed, while the central government’s position has improved, contingent liabilities
risks were building up outside the budget perimeter.



The number of structural benchmarks was somewhat excessive. For instance, the
2011–15 program includes about 100 structural benchmarks. Structural benchmarks should
focus on macro-critical areas, and be mindful of political economy.



The discrepancies between the authorities and the staff on growth estimates and
projections complicate the calibration of program objectives. Looking ahead, improving
the production of high-frequency and high-quality economic statistics should be a top
priority in the reform agenda.



The setting of the implementation timetable should better take into account capacity
constraints and regional institutional arrangement. Delays in the implementation of
financial sector and debt management reforms could be partly explained by a lack of
in-house expertise in these areas as well as the fact that a part of the financial sector policy

The stakeholders broadly concur with staff’s assessment of the last two Fund-

supported programs. In particular, they highlighted the signaling effect of engagement with the
Fund. They underlined the need to better take into account inclusiveness and governance
considerations in the design and monitoring of a Fund-supported program. They called for
continued program engagement with the Fund to safeguard macroeconomic stability and promote
structural reform for a sustainable and inclusive growth.

Annex IV. External Stability Assessment
1.

Côte d’Ivoire’s external current account moved into deficit in 2012 for the first time in

years, but since then the deficit has remained moderate. Since 2012, the external current account
deficit has averaged 1.4 percent of GDP, with the impact of higher import volume due to a solid
domestic demand growth being compensated by improvements in the terms of trade.

2.

Over the medium term, the external current account deficit is expected to widen

driven by a continued strong domestic demand. Staff projects that the current account deficit
would deteriorate gradually to 3.5 percent of GDP by 2020. Imports would increase by 12.9 percent
over 2016–20, while exports growth would average 11.9 percent thanks to a rebound of crude oil
production and policies to support sustained growth in cocoa and other export goods. External
borrowing and FDI would finance the current account deficit.
3.

Côte d’Ivoire’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has depreciated by about 3 percent

since 2013. The recent depreciation of the euro (to which the CFAF is pegged) against major
currencies, has been the leading force behind this depreciation. However, this depreciation has not
erased the cumulative REER appreciation, which peaked in 2009 during the global recession, since
the CFAF devaluation in 1994.

4.

The real exchange rate is assessed based on the IMF’s External Balance Assessment

(EBA-lite) methodology, using the current account and the REER approaches.


The current account approach suggests that the real exchange rate is undervalued by
5.7 percent in 2015. A model-based analysis indicates a norm of -5.1 percent for the
cyclically-adjusted current account deficit.1 Assuming an elasticity of the current account
balance with respect to the real exchange rate of -0.60 (Tokarick, 2010), the exchange rate
adjustment necessary to eliminate the gap between the norm and the actual current account
is estimated at -5.7 percent (Figure 4 and Table 1).

1

The current account norm is made of the “policy gap” (the gap between a country’s actual policies and its optimal
policies) and ‘fitted current account’ (a product of the level of economic fundamentals to the coefficients of a
regression panel). The regression panel, estimated on a sample of 49 developed and emerging market economies
over the period 1986–2010, includes a set of ‘traditional fundamentals, ‘financial factors’, ‘cyclical/temporary factors’
and policy-related regressors, most of these variables being computed as a country’s deviation from the ‘world’
counterpart (see IMF WP/13/272).

The REER approach indicates that the real exchange rate is undervalued by 6 percent in 2015. Similar



to the current approach, the REER model is based on a reduced form equation of the REER.2 The
‘fitted’ real effective exchange rate is then computed as a product of the level of economic
fundamentals and the coefficients of a panel regression.3 There is an exchange rate misalignment if
the real effective exchange rate level cannot be explained by the level of fundamentals using the
coefficients of the regression detailed above.
Overall, although the estimates show a slight undervaluation, staff is of the view that the real



exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals given margins of error.4
5.

Côte d’Ivoire has made progress on improving the business environment and governance

over the past 4 years, though more work remains in order to convergence towards the best
performers (see figures below):
Côte d’Ivoire has continued to improve its rankings in the World Bank’s survey-based “Doing



Business Index” moving from the 177th position in the 2014 Report (covering 189 countries) to 142th
position in the 2016 report. The 2014 and 2015 reports also ranked Côte d’Ivoire among the
10 best reformers. Notwithstanding the improvements in Côte d’Ivoire’s ranking on the World
Bank’s Doing Business Index, it lags on indicators such as ease of paying taxes and obtaining credit.

2

The explanatory variables of this model can be grouped into ‘policy variables’ and ‘non-policy fundamentals’. The ‘policy
variables’ are: FX intervention, interest rate, private credit, and capital controls. The ‘non-policy fundamentals’ are
productivity, financial home bias, terms of trade, trade openness, NFA, output gap, aid and remittances.
3

The equation is estimated on a sample of 141 economies (advanced, emerging markets and low-income countries) over the
period 1995–2013.
4

This assessment is in line with the WAEMU regional assessment.



Côte d’Ivoire has gained 40 positions in the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) since the 2012–13
report. It has also advanced nine positions between 2013 and 2014 in the World Economic Forum’s
Enabling Trade index. Nonetheless, International trade is hampered by the high cost or delays
caused by international transportation and burdensome import procedures.



Côte d’Ivoire scores 48.3 (out of 100) in overall governance according to the Mo Ibrahim Index of
African Governance (IIAG), below the African average (50.1) and the regional average for West
Africa (52.4).5 Although Côte d’Ivoire is within the lower half of the IIAG rankings, it has exhibited
the continent’s largest overall governance improvement over the past four years. Côte d’Ivoire is
one of the ten biggest improvers in every category.

5

Higher scores are interpreted as a sign of better governance.

Recommended Policy Response
Continue to implement the
automatic fuel pricing formula
designed to transmit international
oil prices fluctuations while
ensuring a minimum level of fuel
tax revenues.
Relax moderately the fiscal
position to mitigate the impact
on poor (well targeted spending).
Pay close attention to the
second-round effects on inflation.

Restructure these public
companies to put them on solid
financial and technical footing;
identify alternative suppliers to
ensure energy security; and
strengthen the resilience of the
banking sector.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely
to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the
risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability
between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the
source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive
risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex VI. Technical Assistance Priorities
The areas of technical assistance (TA) below broadly reflect the Ivoirien authorities’ views on capacity
development needs.
1.
On fiscal issues, the goal is to further strengthen tax and customs administration particularly on
reducing the information sector, further reorganize control and audit department and strengthen IT
system. On tax policies, authorities request focuses on diagnosis such as identifying tax loopholes and
tax expenditures. In the PFM area, TA would target the following key areas: (i) completing the integration
between budget and treasury operations with a view to enhancing transparency and timeliness of fiscal
reporting; (ii) strengthening the quality and efficiency of public investment institutions; (iii) strengthening
fiscal risk management, particularly those stemming from PPPs; and (iv) preparing a transition to
program budgeting.
2.
On bank restructuring, TA would assist the authorities with public banks’ restructuring
strategies, following up with the TA previously delivered.
3.
On debt management, the main goals are to complete and make effective the reorganization of
the debt department into a back-middle-front office structure; strengthen the formulation,
implementation, and governance of the government’s policy on external debt through the CNDP
(National Committee on Public Debt); strengthen treasury cash flow management through improved
forecasting and the introduction of the short-term treasury bonds. Priorities for the year ahead under
these three relate to (1) training of staff in their responsibilities under the reorganization as well as in
debt analysis and policy (DSAs and MTDSs); (2) preparing a manual of procedures (”manuel des
procedures”) for the CNDP and its supporting structures (technical committee and secretariat); and
(3) improving treasury cash flow management, which includes finalizing the single Treasury account,
preparing provisional cash flow on a rolling 3-month basis, and introducing short-term (less than one
year) treasury bonds to stabilize the Treasury balance with the BCEAO.
4.
On statistics, the overall objective is to continue strengthening the national accounts
preparation following the July 2015 mission that identified the main weaknesses. TA priorities include:


Strengthening the compilation and dissemination of annual national accounts statistics through
the finalization of the 2014 national accounts and rebasing of the annual national accounts
(implementing the 2008 SNA).



Preparation of quarterly national accounts, with support from AFRITAC West.



Supporting adoption of the e-GDDS (which will make Côte d’Ivoire one of the ten countries in
sub-Saharan Africa to implement this Fund initiative).



Compiling and disseminating government finance statistics in line with WAEMU requirements
(based on the 2001 GFSM Manual).

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the completion
point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the decision point.
Hence these two amounts can not be added.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim period.

Implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI): Not Applicable
Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
As of February 4, 2015, the Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief Trust has been transformed to the
Catastrophe Containment and Relief (CCR) Trust.
Decision Point—point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country qualifies
for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be committed.
Interim Assistance—amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at
the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion Point—point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as
defined in footnote 4 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of
pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
Safeguards Assessments—the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is a common central
bank of the countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAMU). The latest

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

assessment of the BCEAO was completed on December 13, 2013. The assessment found that the
bank continued to have a strong control environment and has, with the implementation of the 2010
Institutional Reform of the WAMU, enhanced its governance framework. Specifically, an audit
committee was established to oversee the audit and financial reporting processes, transparency has
increased with more timely publication of the audited financial statements, and the BCEAO is
committed to IFRS implementation by end-2014. The assessment also identified some limitations in
the external audit process and recommended that steps be taken to ensure the adequacy of the
mechanism through selection of a second experienced audit firm to conduct joint audits. All
recommendations from the assessment have been implemented.
.
Exchange Arrangements:
Côte d’Ivoire is a member of the WAEMU; the exchange system, common to all members of the
union, is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions (as is the
exchange system of Côte d’Ivoire). The common currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at the
rate of €1 = CFAF 655.957.
Article IV Consultation:
Côte d’Ivoire is on the 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The Executive Board concluded the last
Article IV consultation with Côte d’Ivoire in December 2013.

AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (AFDB) GROUP
OPERATIONS AND STRATEGY IN CÔTE D’IVOIRE
Bank Group Portfolio:
Since it started operations in Côte d'Ivoire in 1971, the AfDB has so far approved 73 operations for
the country, of which 41 have been fully completed, 14 cancelled, 9 ongoing (3 newly approved). All
approved operations amount to a net commitment of UA 1,478 million (CFA F 1,215 billion). AfDB
Group-financed operations have been mainly loan-based and channeled, by order of importance, to
the multi-sector (24%), the social sector (20,68%), the rural development and agriculture sector
(20,40%), transport (17,32%), energy and telecommunications (13,67%), water/sanitation (3,8%) and
finance (0,2%). The operations were financed mainly with resources from the ADB window (more
than 70%). The bulk of these funds (92, 36%) were directed towards the public sector. It should be
noted that funding for the private sector concerns electricity, telecommunications, transport and
industry.
In the wake of the April 2011 post-electoral crisis, the Bank prepared a 2011–12 Country Brief
defining a strategy for rapid re-engagement under African Development Fund (ADF-12) aimed
to: (i) strengthen and rehabilitate infrastructure, and restore basic social services; and (ii) improve
governance and build capacity. Two months after the end of the post-electoral crisis, the Bank
adopted the Emergency Programme to Restore Basic Social and Administrative Services (PURSSAB),
which usefully complemented the existing operations, especially the Post-Crisis Multi-Sector
Institutional Support Project (PAIMSC). These two projects were implemented in close coordination
with the United Nations System and helped to cover the country’s urgent needs, particularly the
rehabilitation of health and educational establishments, rural development administrative structures
and child protection centres. These projects also contributed to the training and/or retraining of
employees of the different services of the rehabilitated and equipped structures.
Furthermore, the Bank’s operations have greatly contributed to social cohesion and reconciliation in
the former CNW zones through the financing of income-generating activities for community
agricultural groups using an information and communication technology-based marketing system.
The operations have also given an important role to women, including those who were victims of
violence during the periods of crisis. The Bank has also financed several major projects in the
transport and energy sectors through the private sector window. Specifically, these concern the
construction of the third bridge (the Henri Konan Bédié Bridge), the extension of the Azito Power
Plant and CIPREL.
The table below gives an overview of Bank’s active portfolio status in Côte d’Ivoire.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 2016)

I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, even though there are some shortcomings. There
are weaknesses in the areas of national accounts and balance of payments and public finance statistics, as well
as in the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data. Generally, the authorities provide the required statistical
indicators to the Fund on a timely basis. In February 2013, Côte d’Ivoire ratified the African Statistics Chart,
adopted by the African Union in February 2009 in Addis Ababa to have reliable data for its internal
governance, and also for positioning the country in the regional and international trade. The new law
organizing national statistics was approved in July 2013.
National Accounts: Comprehensive national accounts data for 1996 onwards was compiled in line with the
1993 System of National Accounts methodologies, using 1996 as the base year. STA conducted a diagnostic
mission on in July 2015 to identify strengths and weaknesses in the area of NA statistics and made a series of
recommendations which the authorities have started implementing, especially with regard to the human and
financial resources of the National Institute of Statistics (NIS). The NIS has put in place a strategy for
implementing the 2008 SNA that will integrate the change to a new base year, address current weaknesses in
the national accounts and implement other recommendations of July 2015 mission. Final annual accounts for
2013 and provisional accounts for 2014 are available. Quarterly national accounts are being compiled with the
Fund support through AFRITAC WEST, and will be disseminated shortly.
Price Statistics: A harmonized consumer price index (CPI) has been adopted by all WAEMU members. The
current base year (2008) was adopted in 2010. A new CPI (base 2014) covering the whole country will soon be
available.
Labor market statistics: No such statistics are published regularly.
Government Finance Statistics: The authorities provide annual data on the budgetary central government for
publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. While no monthly or quarterly fiscal data are
provided for publication, they are made available to the IMF African Department, although metadata is lacking.
The authorities have committed to addressing weaknesses in coverage of general government units and public
enterprises and are making efforts to improve the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data. In addition, the
authorities are seeking the assistance of AFRITAC WEST to improve the compilation of government finance
statistics and to implement the 2009 WAEMU TOFE directive based on GFSM 2001. The report on financial
operations executed by the government over the crisis period (January–April 2011) is still not available.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Côte d’Ivoire does not report monetary data using Standardized Report
Forms (SRFs), but rather according to the old methodology. Monetary data for Côte d’Ivoire are prepared by
the national agency of the BCEAO, which reports them to STA on a monthly basis with a timeliness of about
two months after the reference period. Some shortcomings of the monetary statistics are common to all eight
member countries of the WAEMU, while others relate to systemic issues in Côte d’Ivoire’s bank and nonbank
financing of the operations of the central government and the rest of the public sector.
Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs): Côte d’Ivoire does not report FSIs to the IMF.

CÔTE D’IVOIRE

Côte d’Ivoire: Statistical Issues (continued)
External Sector Statistics: The national agency of the BCEAO in Abidjan is responsible for compiling and
disseminating annual balance of payments statistics and the international investment position. BOP and IIP
data are reported to STA in BPM6 format. BCEAO headquarters delineates the methodology and calculates
international reserves managed for WAEMU countries. With respect to merchandise trade, the customs
computer system allows for satisfactory monitoring of trade data, but the coverage of services and transfers,
has shortcomings. Concerning the financial accounts, foreign assets of the private nonbanking sector are not
adequately covered, while reporting of private capital flows, especially foreign direct investment in Côte
d’Ivoire, is weak. There is also not sufficient information on private debt stocks and debt service flows. The
IMF’s Statistics Department will embark on a three-year project funded by the Japan Administered Account
(JSA) starting in May 2016 with French speaking countries in West and Central Africa to improve their capacity
in producing and disseminating better quality external sector statistics; this project targets 17 countries and
will benefit WAEMU member states.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Côte d’Ivoire has participated in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) since May 2000, and
has posted the metadata on the Data Standards
Bulletin Board. The authorities have committed to
implementing the e-GDDS to improve data
dissemination.

No data ROSC is available.

Côte d’Ivoire regularly reports data to STA for redissemination in IMF statistical publications.

Statement by Ngueto Tiraina Yambaye, Executive Director for Côte d’Ivoire
and Mr. Regis O. N’Sonde, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
May 25, 2016
On behalf of our Ivorian authorities, we thank the Board, Management and staff for the
continued support to their policy and reform efforts to preserve macroeconomic stability and
put Côte d’Ivoire’s economy on a steady path to an emerging market status by 2020. Our
authorities are appreciative of the constructive dialogue they maintain with the institution,
including through the latest exchange of views in the context of Mr. Furusawa’s visit to
Abidjan and staff’s mission under Article IV consultation, which took place in late February
to early March of this year.
Our authorities share the bulk of staff’s policy and reform recommendations although they
remain more optimistic regarding the country’s prospects and its ability to reach the
emerging market status as set forth in their Plan National de Développement 2016–20
(National Development Plan, NDP). They feel confident that they can achieve this important
milestone by accelerating economic transformation, building on their very strong
macroeconomic achievements of the past few years and putting emphasis on boosting
productivity to sustain growth and increase per capita income, and on laying the foundations
for more inclusive growth.
The success of the Consultative Group meeting held by the government of Côte d’Ivoire in
Paris on May 17–18, 2016 and the level of financing pledged therein both by donors and
private investors to support Côte d’Ivoire’s NDP is a testimony that the authorities are on the
right track. Recognizing the authorities’ strong record and reform commitment, multilateral
and bilateral development partners and private investors have committed a total of
$34 billion—$15bn and $19bn respectively—over the next five years. As the authorities
continue to attract additional private investments, it is critical for Côte d’Ivoire’s
development that donors deliver on their pledges.
The Ivorian authorities thank staff for the quality dialogue and very useful advice, which they
highly value, as demonstrated by their close implementation of past recommendations under
the 2013 Article IV consultation and the last ECF-supported program (2012–15). They very
much welcome the current set of staff reports including the Selected Issues paper which
provides helpful analyses on key issues.
I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
Since the 2013 Article IV consultation, the Ivorian Government has implemented significant
macroeconomic reforms consistent with Fund recommendations, to lay the foundations for
the country’s economic and social agenda. The authorities have created fiscal space to allow

2
greater infrastructures and poverty-reducing spending; they have significantly reduced nonbidding procurements; and they have adopted and are implementing a medium-term debt
management strategy. Recourse to exceptional procedures for spending has been trimmed
thanks to regulatory and institutional reforms aimed at simplifying and accelerating the
treatment of expenditure commitments. In addition, reforms have been put in place to
improve the business climate, making Côte d’Ivoire one of the top ten reformers worldwide
over the past three years. All these efforts will be further reinforced.
Against this backdrop and supportive fiscal policy, economic activity remains buoyant. Real
GDP growth is estimated at 8.6 percent in 2015 owing to strong investment in key sectors
such as electricity, transport, commerce and housing. Private consumption also contributes
significantly to growth. Strong domestic food production helped contain inflation at
1.2 percent while higher investment-related imports have widened somewhat the external
current account deficit.
On the fiscal front, the authorities’ revenue collection efforts have yielded results beyond
expectations due not only to greater one-off-receipts from telecommunication licenses but
also strong cocoa and fuel tax revenues. This performance contributed in large part to
containing the overall fiscal deficit at 3 percent of GDP (against a 3.7-percent target) and the
basic primary deficit at 0.4 percent of GDP. While total central government debt rose to
49 percent at end-2015 (from 46.5 percent at end-2014), external borrowing was aimed at
financing public investments and non-CFA denominated debt was broadly stable at an
already low level (1.4 percent of GDP). Sound public debt management was pursued, notably
with lower arrears on public enterprises’ debt. The authorities are committed to pursue their
efforts in monitoring public debt management in line with their national strategy, and in
particular the database on public enterprises’ debt.
Regarding the financial sector, credit growth has been broad-based across economic sectors
but our authorities share staff’s concern on the concentration of credit on large SMEs in the
services and manufacturing sectors and on the persistently low household and mortgage
lending. In addition, they concur that banks’ capital buffers should be enhanced and credit
exposure risk stemming from concentration of credit on large corporate borrowers (public
enterprises and large private companies) reduced. The authorities intend to address the
financial sector vulnerabilities in coordination with the WAEMU banking commission.
II. OVERARCHING GOAL: ECONOMIC EMERGENCE BY 2020
Côte d’Ivoire is a fast-growing frontier market economy, with a per capita real GDP of
PPP-adjusted 2011 US$ 3,108. In addition, the country is enjoying increasing trade and
financial integration into the world economy. Going forward, the Ivorian authorities intend to
build on their policy and reform achievements, on the country’s growth momentum, and on
the encouraging progress in poverty reduction to meet their overarching objective of making

3
Côte d’Ivoire an emerging market economy. In this vein, they have developed a
medium-term development strategy embodied in the country’s NDP.
The 2016–20 NDP is made of four strategic pillars: (i) enhancing the quality of institutions
and governance; (ii) stepping-up the development of human capital and promoting social
well-being; (iii) speeding up structural transformation and industrialization; and
(iv) strengthening the infrastructure base while preserving the environment. The total cost of
investments planned in this framework is estimated at around $60 billion over the period, of
which 62 percent should be financed by the private sector.
The NDP targets an average real GDP growth of around 9 percent per year over 2016–20,
with a larger private sector contribution and the pursuit of strong public investments in
physical capital—especially in transport and power generation—as well as human capital. In
particular, they stress the importance of their plan to double domestic energy generation
capacity to 4,000 megawatts over the next few years, which is indispensable for sustained
economic expansion. The NDP strategy is fully attentive of the positive impact of
productivity gains, capital accumulation and stable sociopolitical environment, in line with
the strong growth registered during 2012–15. They intend to increase these factors through
strong infrastructure investments, support to the agricultural sector, and financial inclusion.
The authorities are fully cognizant that attaining economic emergence calls for the structural
transformation of the economy and departure from commodity exports.
Structural Transformation
Our Ivorian authorities appreciate very much the Selected Issues paper, notably the chapter
on “Fostering Sustainable Economic Growth”. They are cognizant of the existing structural
bottlenecks to more durable strong growth. It is in this context that they plan to put great
emphasis on investing in human capital to further improve the quality of the labor force, and
to upgrade the country’s export mix through local manufacturing transformation, notably in
the agricultural sector while alleviating cross-border restrictions. They also stress the
importance of their agenda to lower income inequality, including through enhanced financial
inclusion, continued investments in the labor-intensive agricultural sectors while stepping up
efforts to raise productivity therein to free productive resources for other economic sectors
with great potential, notably manufacturing and services.
Structural transformation in Côte d’Ivoire will lean on increasingly strong political and
economic institutions as mirrored in the country’s remarkable progress in all areas of
governance in the past few years. This is reflected notably in the World Bank’s “Doing
Business Index” (in which Côte d’Ivoire ranks among the 10 best reformers in 2014 and
2015); the Global Competitiveness Index (40 positions gained by Côte d’Ivoire since 2012);
the Economic Forum’s enabling Trade Index (9-position gain between 2013 and 2014); and

4
the Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance (in which the country has shown the largest
improvements in overall governance on the continent over the last four years).
The authorities will continue to make progress in consolidating peace as well as in the area of
economic governance, notably the ease of paying taxes and obtaining credit, the costs and
duration of contract dispute resolution, the cost of international transportation and import
procedures, and perception of corruption. They consider maintaining macroeconomic
stability as a prerequisite to preserve for their structural transformation agenda.
The relatively short time span (2012–15) in which the Ivorian authorities have moved the
country on a path of strong growth and structural reforms is a testimony of their capacity to
achieve their transformational agenda in the set horizon (2020). The NDP scenario, while
ambitious, remains realistic and consistent with the authorities’ track record and the
country’s renewed economic dynamism. As the main economic engine of the WAEMU,
Côte d’Ivoire expects to benefit from positive spillovers and spillbacks within the region.
III. MEDIUM TERM POLICY AND REFORM AGENDA
The authorities agree with staff’s description of the favorable medium-term outlook for the
Ivorian economy albeit different views on the impact of critical investments and reform
implementation on the strength of future growth. The major risks, including tail risks, are
principally related to exogenous shocks, notably adverse weather conditions and sharp
deceleration of growth in advanced and emerging market economies. The authorities are
pursuing efforts to strengthen the business climate, with the view to diversify investor base
and export markets. They stand ready to adopt countercyclical fiscal policy as needed,
including through mitigating the impact on the most vulnerable populations. In so doing, they
acknowledge the need to build buffers in the public and financial sectors.
In implementing their medium-term policy and reform agenda, our Ivorian authorities
continue to put a high premium on preserving macroeconomic stability while tackling the
structural bottlenecks to sustained, strong and inclusive growth and steadfast poverty
reduction. They acknowledge in particular the challenges identified in the staff reports,
notably in the areas of fiscal policy, public finance management, stability of the banking
sector, financial inclusion, and capacity constraints.
Maintaining Fiscal Sustainability
The authorities are cognizant of the fiscal risks stemming from implicit liabilities, and
requested technical assistance on PPP fiscal risk assessments. However, they strongly believe
that their envisaged larger fiscal deficit would still preserve fiscal space to cope with risks
while preserving fiscal sustainability in light of the growth-orientation of the investments to
be pursued. They will continue to enhance domestic revenue mobilization, with Fund’s

5
technical assistance as requested. The country’s favorable credit ratings will help it access
adequate financing in regional as well as global capital markets.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to further enhance public finance management
(PFM), including further reduction of exceptional spending procedures, integrating the
budget and accounting IT systems, and strengthening cash management.
They also endeavor to preserve debt sustainability, including through managing debt service
bunching, rollover and foreign exchange risks. Diversification of the creditor bases is also
part of the authorities’ debt management strategy. The authorities also pursue efforts to
implement the treasury single account, restructure public banks (see below), and reform the
national oil company, with the view to contain fiscal liabilities and domestic debt.
Banking Sector Stability and Financial Inclusion
The authorities note with concern the challenges posed by rapid credit growth, the strong
relation between the GDP and credit cycles, as well as small banks’ exposure to corporations
and banks’ exposure to WAEMU sovereigns. They fully agree with staff recommendation to
reinforce banks’ capital buffers, and will support the banking commission by enforcing its
decisions. They will also implement Fund’s WAEMU surveillance recommendations towards
Basel II and III transposition into the regulatory framework.
Regarding banking institutions under stress, the authorities have already liquidated one
public bank, sold the public minority share in two public banks, and programmed the
privatization of two other public banks, all with the view to strengthen the sector solvency
and minimize budgetary costs. However, efforts will be pursued to maintain and restructure
public banks that have a critical importance in sustaining specific sectors, including the
troubled saving bank to foster financial inclusion.
The strong link between financial inclusion and economic development on the one hand, and
financial inclusion and reduction in inequalities on the other hand, argues in favor of
Côte d’Ivoire’s focus on this agenda through its financial sector development strategy
(FSDS), which has the support of the World Bank. The authorities welcome staff
recommendations towards improving access to financing, advancing digital financial services
while modernizing the regulatory framework. In this vein, they plan to restructure the CNCE,
operationalize the credit bureau, and restructure micro-finance institutions in order to
improve access of lower-income consumers to financial services. The authorities’ efforts to
bolster financial inclusion will also be complemented by the regional initiative led by the
central bank BCEAO in this regard.

6
Alleviating Capacity Constraints
The Ivorian authorities highly appreciate Fund’s technical assistance (TA), which has been
instrumental in achieving recent policy and reform accomplishments. They will continue to
closely implement the TA recommendations. They look forward to the assistance on national
accounts, tax and customs administration, PFM and on the adoption of the e-GDDS.
IV. CONCLUSION
Côte d’Ivoire is at a crossroads of its development. A frontier economy, it aims at reaching
the next milestone of emerging market status over the next five years. The country has
considerable potential and capacities, including from the authorities who exhibit a strong
track record of policy and reform implementation and demonstrated commitment to
transforming the economy. They continue to count on the support of the Fund to help them
implement their ambitious but realistic development strategy. In particular, Fund support
under a program arrangement over the period ahead will be helpful in a challenging global
environment.
