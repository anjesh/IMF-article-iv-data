FRANCE
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2006 Consultation with France
Approved by Michael Deppler and Matthew Fisher

Executive Summary
France’s economic short-run outlook is positive, and long-run prospects have improved.
The economy is benefiting from the cyclical recovery in Europe and improved demographics.
Structural reforms have rendered labor and product markets more flexible and contributed to
fiscal consolidation. GDP growth is likely to average somewhat more than 2¼ percent per year
during 2006–07, the unemployment rate is expected to continue a steady decline, and the
budget deficit should come in at about 2¾ percent of GDP in 2006 and fall slightly further
in 2007.
There was agreement that structural reforms will need to span several areas to exploit
synergies and balance the interests of different stakeholders. At the same time,
prioritization within these areas is equally important to secure fast progress. In line with the
authorities’ emphasis on raising public awareness of the benefits of structural reforms, the
upcoming 2007 elections provide an opportunity to place the country’s economic priorities at the
center of an informed public debate.
Fiscal adjustment remains high on the government’s agenda. The objective of balancing
the budget by 2010 through expenditure restraint is appropriate. The ongoing strengthening of
fiscal governance will help in achieving this goal, provided it is underpinned by bold and specific
political choices. The government’s intention to curb social security and local authorities’
spending growth is key. Tax reforms have increased the incentives to work and invest, but
a further reduction in the tax burden is desirable and dependent on additional spending cuts.
Reforms in financial, labor, and product markets are necessary to boost job creation,
prepare the economy for aging, and allow it to benefit fully from global activity. While the
financial system is highly stable and supervisors are responding to evolving risks, the staff sees
scope to improve its efficiency by phasing out administered schemes and accelerating financial
integration in Europe. In the labor market, there is increasing recognition of the need to reduce
the judicial uncertainty surrounding permanent labor contracts; in contrast, the chances of
consensus on a widening of the differentials among the median wage, the minimum wage, and
out-of-work benefits remain remote. In product markets, deregulation of the services sector and
an acceleration of the ongoing disengagement of the state from commercial activities would
boost growth and consumer welfare.

I. BACKGROUND1
1.
Against the backdrop of a cyclical upswing, the economic policy debate is
focusing on how to foster the structural reforms necessary to reduce unemployment,
address population aging, and allow the economy to benefit fully from dynamic global
activity. In a departure from an approach that observers have characterized as “reform by
stealth,” the government has in recent years placed increasing emphasis on educating the
public about economic choices. This approach has met with success in the area of public
finance where the need for curbing spending, debt, and deficits is generally well understood
and where pension and health care reforms are advancing. The main challenge now is to
convince the public of the benefits of a much more flexible labor market and of further
reforms in services and product markets. The 2007 elections provide an opportunity to
advance the public debate on these issues.
2.
After stagnating in the first half of 2005, economic activity regained considerable
momentum, but it remains behind the ongoing global expansion. Driven by domestic
demand and a rekindling of exports, GDP growth picked up to a remarkable 4¾ percent
(annualized) in the second quarter of 2006 (Figure 1 and Table 1). This uptick was shared
across the euro area as demand in Germany and Italy strengthened, joining robust domestic
demand in other euro area countries. It permitted French exports to rebound strongly
following three years of weakness compared to buoyant global demand. From a longer-term
perspective, though, France’s relative performance has lagged, prompting it to fall in the per
capita GDP ranking (adjusted for purchasing power) from 12th to 16th position during the past
five years.
3.
All components of domestic demand contributed to the upswing. Household
consumption and investment in housing have remained solid, helped by falling
unemployment, real increases in the minimum wage (SMIC), and low interest rates
(Figure 2). Still, health reform-induced increases in social security contributions and higher
income taxes curbed disposable income growth, prompting households to dip into their
savings (Table 2). Fixed capital formation strengthened with the revived cyclical upturn
(Figure 3). Profit margins have declined since 2003 as moderation in wage growth was
insufficient to offset the impact of higher input prices, while generous dividend payouts and
higher tax obligations reduced company savings. Low interest rates encouraged external
financing, resulting in a declining self-financing ratio and rising debt, thus ending a four-year
period of balance-sheet adjustment (Text Figure).

with the rebound in partner demand (Text
Figure), and the foreign balance contributed positively to growth in the first half of 2006.
The prior weakness of manufactured goods exports seems to reflect structural issues (Box 1).
France’s cyclical position has not been far ahead of that of its main trading partners, its real
effective exchange rate has changed little, and the exchange rate is estimated to be broadly in
line with fundamentals. Geographical and sectoral compositions of trade have only limited
explanatory power. The authorities and the staff agreed that structural rigidities in product
and labor markets—in the staff’s view including high minimum wages—were important
explanatory factors as they reduced the economy’s ability to rapidly adjust to developments
in trade partners and take advantage of robust global growth.
5.
The pace of job creation, while picking up, has been hampered by sustained real
minimum wage increases, and participation remains low. Strong activity in the
nontradable sector supported labor demand, while the secular decline in manufacturing
employment was exacerbated by rising wage costs. Labor market reforms (such as the new
contract for small enterprises (CNE) and reinforced job search requirements and employment

6

Box 1. France: External Performance––Demand, Competitiveness,
and Structural Factors
Developments in exchange rates, relative unit labor costs, and demand are insufficient to explain
the recent decline in the current account and France’s export market share. Indeed, residuals from
econometrically-estimated equations indicate a substantial drag on exports since 2001, not attributable
to the standard global demand and price/cost factors (Figures A and B).1 However, the buoyant trade of
the first half of 2006 is not reflected in this analysis, though it seems mostly related to the upswing in
the euro area. Geographically, trade with Germany and China contributed most to the deterioration in
the manufacturing trade account. At the sectoral level, exports of automobiles and intermediate goods
slumped, but investment and consumer goods exports held up well. Strong import growth was partly due
to more dynamic investment than in other European countries (Figures C and D). Finally, oil price
increases caused a considerable rise in the import bill.
Standard equilibrium exchange rate analysis indicates that the current real effective exchange rate
is largely in line with fundamentals. Multilateral analysis conducted by the IMF’s Research
Department suggests that the real exchange rate does not significantly deviate from equilibrium based on
saving-investment balances (less than 5 percent) and is essentially in equilibrium using the methodology
calculating purchasing power parities. These findings are subject to considerable uncertainty, however.
In this context, it is important to note that changes in export margins have cushioned the effects of
exchange rate fluctuations. Cost competitiveness of French producers worsened in 2005 and
early 2006, though it remains in line with its long-term average (Figure E). Price competitiveness was
maintained as producers lowered export prices in euro (Figure F). This behavior is indicative of the
limited pricing power of exporters in increasingly competitive markets. Moreover, despite such pricingto-market, the external position deteriorated during the period.
Hence, the relative underperformance of exports in past years points to structural factors that
leave French firms behind the global expansion. A more flexible economy should be able to reorient
its geographical orientation and product mix toward fast-growing economies and sectors. Indeed, the
staff finds evidence that labor market rigidities hamper such adjustment. A sectoral study of total factor
productivity (TFP) growth in manufacturing finds that, while France does not lag significantly behind the
United States in terms of level, its TFP growth is hampered by the high ratio of minimum to median
wages.2 In this observation, the staff’s analysis is joined by a KPMG study that finds that the high cost of
low-skilled workers constituted France’s main disadvantage in reference to other G-7 countries. The
staff’s study further shows that more spending on R&D and more trade with technologically advanced
countries tends to positively influence TFP growth.

(Text Figure).2 Hence, while the overall
unemployment rate has been declining,
its structural component has fallen much less (Figure 4). With pension reforms allowing
people to retire on the basis of career length rather than age, many have taken the opportunity
to retire early, while the effect of introducing an actuarially fairer system is expected to play
in the opposite direction only over time.3
6.
Energy prices have kept headline inflation up through the middle of 2006, while
underlying inflation has been well-behaved. Core and headline inflation declined to
slightly below the euro area average as the effect of a previous tobacco excise tax hike
evaporated in mid-2005. Factors other than oil prices, in particular strong international
competition in manufactured goods and the liberalization of distribution margins, had on
balance a dampening impact on inflation. Rents edged up, as they are legally tied to the
construction price index,4 which was pulled by a strong housing market. Services provided
by unskilled labor imparted slight cost-push pressures, reflecting higher minimum wages.
Economy-wide unit labor costs have risen somewhat, in part because of a cyclical decline in
productivity growth (Figure 5).

2

A counterfactual simulation suggests that employment growth would have been 1¼ percent higher during the
past five years, had minimum wages not increased. The real increase of the SMIC during this period amounted
to 15.2 percent.

3

A normal pension vests after a career of 40 years, a duration that is being increased gradually to 41 years
by 2012. Earlier retirement is possible at an actuarially fair discount. However, working longer yields a lessthan actuarially fair bonus. The parameters of the pension system are subject to 5-year reviews, with the next
due in 2008.

4

Since January 2006, rents have been tied to a basket of prices comprising construction costs (with a 20 percent
weight), consumer price inflation (60 percent), and maintenance costs (20 percent).

9
7.
Despite fiscal tightening, overall, policies have been supportive of growth
(Figure 6). Monetary conditions remain accommodative as increases in real interest rates
were partly offset by the depreciation of the real effective exchange rate, at least until very
recently. The structural fiscal deficit decreased by about ¾ of 1 percentage point of GDP
in 2005 and is likely to continue to fall, but by somewhat less than ½ of 1 percentage point
in 2006 (Table 3). This fiscal tightening had only limited impact on growth as private
domestic demand continued to outpace GDP.
8.
By regional comparison, the economy has been performing well, but several
structural weaknesses stand out, and progress in tackling them has been mixed (Box 2).
GDP per capita is high, and growth per capita has been exceeding the euro area average,
though the difference seems to be evaporating. Globally, France’s relative position has
deteriorated substantially, particularly as it failed to keep up with the United States. Pension
reforms have limited the increase in age-related spending (excluding long-term care) to
2.9 percent of GDP between 2004 and 2050, compared to an EU average of 4 percent
(according to the EC Aging Working Group), but its level (12.8 percent of GDP in 2004) will
remain above the EU average (10.6 percent of GDP), and public debt has risen (to some
67 percent of GDP). Labor markets have become more flexible, though employment
protection has increased, and taxes, unemployment benefits, and minimum wages are high.
Consequently, employment rates have improved much less than elsewhere.
II. OUTLOOK
9.
Near-term growth is expected to remain solid, somewhat stronger than
anticipated at the time of the mission. The staff projects GDP growth to remain broadbased and settle at an annual pace of about 2.5 percent during the second half of 2006,
yielding average growth of 2.4 percent for the year. In 2007, higher oil prices and interest
rates and lower trade partner growth will reduce growth slightly to about 2.3 percent. In
particular, the staff does not expect households to further reduce their savings rate from
current levels and sees residential construction growth slowing. The unemployment rate
should decline, reflecting healthy growth, increased subsidized job creation, and the impact
of pension and labor market reforms. In line with surveys, business investment is likely to
keep expanding firmly while export growth should ease somewhat from its recent buoyant
pace. While expressing some concerns about the impact on the outlook of fiscal reforms and
adjustment planned in Germany, the authorities expect that the economic impact on France
was likely to be small.
10.
Risks to this baseline are broadly balanced and related to external shocks and
the impact of ongoing structural reforms (Text Figure). Staff analysis suggests that France
has become more sensitive to the global economy and reacts more through changes in
employment and productivity than through wage flexibility, strengthening the case for more

structural reforms.5 The authorities and the staff concurred that recent structural reforms had
likely increased potential growth (see ¶13), but the timing of their effect on actual growth
was hard to pin down. The elections, scheduled for the second quarter of 2007, constitute
some source of uncertainty about the future course of economic policies.

The fan chart includes the following risks to the baseline projections of growth (2.4 percent in
2006 and 2.3 percent in 2007): a 15 percent euro appreciation, a 20 percent increase in oil
prices, a 1 percent higher trading partners growth, a 1 percent lower household saving ratio, an
avian flu pandemic and a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances. They are weighted by the
staff's subjective probability assessment of their occurrence.

11.
After five years of strong increases, house prices show signs of cooling, which
represents a small risk to the economy (Figure 7). Construction activity is expected to slow
in line with the market for existing houses. The authorities and the staff agreed that there was
no evidence of any significant impact of housing wealth on consumption.6 The real estate
boom was accompanied by strong credit expansion to households, though the authorities saw
only limited risks to financial sector stability, as house prices have been largely in line with
fundamentals, household indebtedness has remained low by international comparison, and
equity withdrawal has hitherto been absent (see ¶28).

12.
The authorities favored a coordinated effort to ensure an orderly resolution of
global imbalances, which remained a risk to sustained growth in Europe. They agreed
that the main role for Europe would be to proceed with structural reforms to raise growth. At
the same time, they cautioned against policies that would import the imbalances into the euro
area, for example by creating an excessive current account deficit for the area. They also
underscored the need to strengthen economic policy governance and policy coordination at
the EU level.
13.
Headline inflation is expected to average about 2 percent for the next few years.
This projection implies a slowing from 2.2 percent in July 2006 as the pace of oil price
increases eases. Conversely, underlying inflation—at 1.3 percent in July 2006—is expected
to edge up gradually, as the effect of the reforms that led to a decline in distribution prices
in 2005 wanes and the room to offset minimum wage increases by further cuts in social
security contributions is being exhausted. Upside risks pertain to health care costs,
discretionary minimum wage increases, and oil prices, while additional structural reforms
could have a dampening effect.
14.
Current demographic trends and ongoing structural reforms suggest that
potential growth could be higher than previously estimated. Recently-observed fertility
rates and immigration suggest that the labor force, previously expected to begin to fall
in 2007, will continue to grow into the next decade. At the same time, higher-than-expected
female mortality signals a slower rise in the dependency rate, slightly easing the increase in
aging costs from previous projections. The authorities estimate that the pipeline effects of
structural reforms could add 0.1–0.2 percent to potential growth over the medium term and
see some evidence that the secular decline in total factor productivity growth has ended.
Together with the effects of the recent uptick in investment, this suggests that annual
potential growth could temporarily rise to 2¼–2½ percent, before—in the absence of further
reforms—settling at somewhat less than 2 percent per year in the long run. On the basis of
this information, the staff has revised its annual potential growth projections up from
1.9 percent to 2.2 percent for the next five years.
III. POLICY ISSUES
15.
Achieving fiscal sustainability, full employment, and higher trend growth
remain priority objectives for economic policy.7 Reflecting greater public consensus, fiscal
adjustment has been progressing faster than expected, and institutional mechanisms have
been put in place to secure further progress. Nonetheless, the ongoing cyclical upswing and
the upcoming 2007 elections will test both this consensus and these mechanisms. At the same
time, the electoral debate provides an opportunity to seek the public’s endorsement of
7

The staff’s analytical work has had a long-standing focus on these issues (see Selected Issues Annex for an
overview since 2000).

13
broader and faster structural reforms, particularly in the labor market, much needed to
prepare the economy for aging and allow it to benefit from globalization (Box 3). Hence,
while no major new reforms will be tabled, the authorities plan to continue implementing
ongoing reforms during the preelection period aimed at reducing the budget deficit and
creating jobs, especially for the young. More broadly, they intend to foster debate and
consensus on the causes and remedies of high unemployment.
A. Fostering Reform
16.
The authorities underscored the importance of economic pedagogy and building
consensus to promote structural reform. They pointed to the success of this approach in
a number of areas, based on studies and stakeholder committees. For example, efforts at
fiscal consolidation had benefited from a number of reports, most recently the Pébéreau
report on the worrisome level of public debt. In parallel, an annual national conference on
public finances involving all levels of government and a new council on public finances
(Cofipu), with among its mandates the promotion of expenditure restraint, had been
established. As a result, the need for a reduction in public debt and deficits was now widely
recognized. Hence, attention is being focused on the pace of consolidation and the
distribution of the effort among levels of government. A key issue was now to further build
credibility by continuing to meet the spending and deficit targets as had happened for the
first time in 2005.
17.
Given the public’s high sensitivities, reforms would need to be approached very
cautiously in the labor market. The authorities saw the social unrest in reaction to the
proposed new labor contract for the young (CPE) and its subsequent withdrawal as an
indirect confirmation of the need to follow a gradual, consensual approach. Indeed, while the
measure was intended to rapidly improve job prospects for urban unemployed youth,
stakeholders had not been consulted sufficiently, and prior consensus had not been achieved.
Partly in response, a new council on employment (COE) had been created to establish a
common diagnosis of the causes of unemployment among social partners and foster public
debate on its remedies.
18.
The authorities stressed the need to sustain income growth at a time of
structural reform. They noted that they had accordingly balanced fiscal adjustment and
pension and health care reforms with increases in the minimum wage and benefits (including
the earned income tax credit), greater opportunities for workers to participate in profits,
better prospects and financial incentives for working longer, improved access to credit, tax
cuts, and measures to prevent income loss for health care providers.
19.
The staff recognized the benefits of the authorities’ approach, while suggesting
some adjustments to ensure faster progress. Reforms seem to have met with success when

Box 3. France: Implementation of Fund Recommendations
The authorities have concurred broadly with the direction of the Fund’s economic
policy advice, but implementation has been more gradual and subject to more tradeoffs in order to preserve social cohesion, generous welfare arrangements, and a narrow
income distribution.
Fiscal policy: Budgetary execution over the past three years has been in line with
long-standing Fund advice to consolidate by at least 0.5 percent of GDP annually until
structural balance or surplus is achieved. The pension reform has appreciably
diminished the projected cost of aging, health care reform is progressing, and civil
service reform is picking up but remains more modest than advocated by the Fund.
Revenue windfalls are now being fully saved, and fiscal governance has been
strengthened considerably.
Labor and product markets: Additional flexibility was introduced in labor markets,
especially reversing some of the restrictions related to the reduction of the workweek
to 35 hours. The new employment contract (CNE) represents an important step in
reforming labor market institutions, but entitlements (other than pensions), judicial
uncertainty surrounding labor contracts, and high minimum wages remain to be
tackled. In product markets, divestiture and deregulation are ongoing, albeit at
a slower-than-advised pace, and there is scope for further liberalization of trade in
services.
Financial sector: The financial sector has been subject to strong supervision. The
authorities continue to be reluctant to phase out widespread administrative deposit and
loan schemes, though some of them have become more market-oriented.
Trade policy: The Fund has called on France to help advance trade liberalization,
partly through an early implementation of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform.
The authorities indicated their commitment to a successful conclusion of the Doha
round and noted that accelerating CAP reform, planned for 2007, would have disrupted
farmers’ preparations.

they were accompanied by highly visible quantitative objectives, e.g., the expenditure norms
for the central government and health care. This approach could usefully be extended to
other areas of public finance and to structural reforms as well, for instance by focusing on
employment rates for labor market reforms, and product market regulation indicators for
reforms in product markets. At the same time, efforts of various councils, useful in advancing
a comprehensive understanding by stakeholders, would need to be well coordinated to
exploit synergies, particularly in dealing with distinct entrenched interests. While trade-offs
are inevitable, significant dilution of the long-term gains should be avoided. It will also be

15
important to apply the pedagogic approach consistently. For example, “economic patriotism”
may sound attractive to some, but it has a protectionist guise that runs counter to France’s
best interests.
B. Achieving Fiscal Sustainability and Efficient Taxes
20.
Rising costs of aging and high deficits constitute the main threats to fiscal
sustainability. While pension reforms and the improved outlook for potential growth have
significantly reduced the expected increase in the cost of aging, current policies would still
lead to unstable debt dynamics (Box 4). There was agreement that further growth-enhancing
structural reforms and fiscal adjustment would be needed and that more of the former would
facilitate the latter. Health care costs, while better contained than in the past, will continue to
pressure the budget, rendering additional measures inevitable. The general government
deficit is still too high to stabilize public debt. The decline in the debt ratio in the course
of 2006 is due to asset sales and tighter cash and debt management.
21.
Over the past three years, fiscal consolidation has progressed significantly, while
fiscal governance and spending restraint have been strengthened. Between 2003
and 2006, the structural deficit has been reduced by more than 1½ percent of GDP (Text
Table). The authorities highlighted that France had been the first of the large euro area
countries under the excessive deficit procedure to have brought the deficit to less than
3 percent of GDP in 2005 (albeit with the help of a one-off transfer from the electricity sector
against its future pension liabilities); real central government spending had been constant for
four consecutive years; health care spending had been on target in 2005 for the first time in
recent history; and the pace of reduction in the number of civil servants, while modest (only
one out of every seven retiring civil servants is not being replaced), was being stepped up.
Further, all revenue windfalls are being used to reduce the deficit, a feature embedded in
the 2006 budget law, and expenditure margins are being set aside ex ante. The
implementation of the new organic budget law is fostering a results-oriented culture in the
civil service. Finally, independent budget oversight by the Cour des Comptes had been
strengthened, including via more ex ante analysis, though it was felt that it should better
focus on the general government.
22.
Nevertheless, continued growth of social security and local government spending
has prevented the expenditure-to-GDP ratio from declining and required fiscal
adjustment to rely on increased revenues. Public spending has been stuck at over
53 percent of GDP, with local and health care spending growing at about 4 percent per year
during the past five years. Fiscal adjustment thus stemmed from higher revenues: two thirds

16

Box 4. France: Fiscal Sustainability
In March 2006, the pension council (Conseil d’Orientation des Retraites, COR)
revised estimates of the needs of the pension system by 2050. The COR’s projection,
which did not incorporate the most recent revision to the demographic profile, pointed to
an increase in budgetary costs of 3.1 percentage points of GDP after taking into account
the impact of the 2003 pension reform (estimated to have lowered these costs by
1.2 percentage points of GDP). While providing detailed sensitivity analysis to changes
in economic and demographic assumptions, as well as changes to policy parameters, the
report highlights the need for further reform to guarantee the sustainability of the
system.
The staff analysis concurs with this
assessment.1 Despite the recent revisions
to demographic projections pointing to
more favorable population aging dynamics
than in the COR baseline and the positive
effect of the recent health care reforms,
aging costs remain the key threat to fiscal
sustainability. Under the staff’s baseline
scenario, they are expected to add
4.5 percentage points of GDP to fiscal
spending by 2050 (2.7 percent for pension
and 1.8 percent for health) leading to
unsustainable debt dynamics.

Addressing the long-term costs of aging requires further fiscal consolidation
through a combination of fiscal adjustment and growth-enhancing measures.
Upfront fiscal adjustment alone, consistent with the authorities’ goal of reaching fiscal
balance by 2010, would bring the debt-to-GDP ratio down to about 30 percent by 2030
but would not suffice to stabilize it. However, a reform scenario in line with a (delayed)
Lisbon agenda (expected to boost potential growth by at least ¼ percent after 2012)
together with an upfront structural fiscal adjustment of 0.3 percent of GDP per year
through 2011 would achieve sustainability at a public debt-to-GDP ratio of about
20 percent of GDP by 2050.

The current policy scenario reflects fiscal policies as described in Table 1 through 2011. Demographic
assumptions are consistent with INSEE’s recent population projections with a fertility rate of 1.9, life
expectancy of men and women of 83.8 years and 89 years, respectively, and net migration of 100,000 per
year, which compares favorably to previous assumptions of lower fertility (1.8), higher life expectancy
(+1.2 years) and lower migration (50,000).

was due to underlying dynamics of the tax base and the fact that the tax elasticity with
respect to GDP is slightly higher than one, which more than offset personal income tax cuts.
The remainder resulted from increases in health care contributions, partly offset by declining
social security contributions elsewhere in the context of policies designed to support labor
demand.
23.
In response, plans for fiscal consolidation are being underpinned by ambitious
objectives for expenditure restraint, but specific policy choices remain to be made. The
authorities aim to balance the budget by 2010. From 2007 onward, real spending at the
central government level is set to decline by 1 percent per year, growth of social security
spending will not exceed 1 percent in real terms, and local authorities are expected to
gradually move toward keeping real spending constant. For 2007, there is a commitment on

18
the central government’s objective, but little or no structural adjustment. In addition, how
spending objectives will be achieved for the other components of government, and
beyond 2007, remains to be spelled out.8 Hence, the staff projects the structural balance to
remain in a deficit of about 1¾ percent of GDP.
24.
Tax reforms have been geared at promoting employment and investment, but
tax expenditure initiatives are proliferating (Box 5). The increase in the earned income tax
credit, the introduction of a ceiling on tax payments as a share of current revenue (bouclier
fiscal), and the reduction in marginal income tax rates in 2007 will boost labor supply across
the skills range. A cap on a local tax on capital and the extension of exemptions for new
investments until they are on stream will help investment. However, in response to tight
spending limits, policy proposals are becoming increasingly focused on granting tax
exemptions and tax credits. The authorities acknowledged the need to stem this tide, which
could be done by prohibiting such measures from being introduced outside annual budget
laws.
25.
Current proposals to reform the financing of social security would have little
economic impact. Mindful of the high cost of labor, further cuts in employers’ social
security contributions are being considered, to be financed by an increase in taxes on
consumption or capital. At the technical level, the staff and the authorities agreed that, in
France’s institutional context, there are virtually no benefits from such a shift.9 Shifting to
consumption taxes would allow a slight reduction in marginal tax rates, but because social
benefits and the minimum wage are indexed to inflation and unions may demand
compensation for the loss of purchasing power, there are no other gains. Shifting to capital
may have short-term benefits but at the cost of less investment and less output in the long
run. Rather than shifting the tax burden, the staff argued for financing the reform through
additional expenditure cuts.
C. Combining Financial Sector Stability and Efficiency
26.
The financial sector appears sound and well placed to manage some potential
vulnerabilities. The sector is highly capitalized and profitable, though a substantial part of
the recent rise in profits is likely to be transitory, as it is linked to reintegration of past
provisions, low ongoing provisioning, and rapid credit growth (Tables 4–6 and Figure 8).
Following a period of rapid expansion of mortgage credit, lending is becoming more
balanced as credit to the corporate sector has picked up, while the real estate market shows

Box 5. France: Recent Tax Reforms
One of the objectives of French fiscal policy in the past years has been to reduce the
tax burden on labor, which is comparatively high. Employers’ social security
contributions constitute about 55 percent of the overall implicit tax rate on labor (ITR),
whereas employees’ contributions and personal income taxes account for 17 and 28 percent
of the ITR, respectively. The reforms will have a budgetary cost of about ½ of 1 percent of
GDP in 2007.

The government has recently enacted new measures to reduce taxes on labor income and
make work pay:
•

A personal income tax reform was introduced with the 2006 budget law and will
take effect in 2007. The number of brackets was reduced from seven to five; headline
tax rates were lowered, e.g., the top tax rate was cut from 48.09 to 40 percent; and
a 20 percent existing exemption was eliminated and integrated into the new
progressive structure. The reform aims at enhancing simplicity and equity, lowering
the tax burden, and reducing high-skilled workers’ incentives to move abroad.

•

A tax ceiling was introduced, limiting total direct taxes to a maximum of
60 percent of income (bouclier fiscal). The taxes taken into account to compute such
a ceiling include the personal income tax, certain real estate taxes on the primary
residence, and the Impôt de Solidarité sur la Fortune (ISF), a tax on net wealth.

•

The Prime pour l’Emploi (PPE), an income tax credit for people in low-paid jobs,
was increased by 50 percent over two years for full-time workers, and almost doubled
for part-time workers. The lag of credit disbursements was also shortened to increase
work incentives.

The 2006 budget law also introduced a further reform of the taxe professionnelle,
a local tax on capital. Its tax base originally comprised the wage bill and the rental value
of the fixed capital stock, but to reduce the burden on labor, the wage bill was removed
from the tax base. An exemption on new investment was introduced in 2004 to mitigate the
tax impact on capital costs. The 2006 budget law made such exemption permanent and
established a ceiling so that the tax cannot exceed 3.5 percent of the firm value added.

20
some signs of cooling. The insurance sector is benefiting from the good stock market
performance, rising interest rates, and the reduced incidence of natural disasters.
27.
The financial system has achieved a high degree of stability, and supervisors are
closely monitoring all risks. While under new accounting standards solvency ratios of
French banks are lower (by about 60 basis points), solvency remains satisfactory. Heightened
competition has prompted banks to relax loan standards somewhat and exploit less liquid
market opportunities, while nonperforming loans and provisioning are currently at
historically low levels and thus prone to a rise. In addition, exposure to emerging markets has
increased. Nonetheless, stress tests indicate that banks could withstand a sharp increase in
risk spreads and other shocks without much difficulty.10 Supervisors are focusing on
exposure to hedge funds, which has remained limited, at no more than 3.5 percent of balance
sheet totals. With respect to rising exposure to credit derivatives, they were reassured by
banks’ conducting specific stress tests to evaluate their value at risk.
28.
The establishment of a new bank and the introduction of new mortgage market
instruments are modifying the landscape of the financial sector. The emergence of the
postal bank, which separates financial activities from the post office, is further leveling the
playing field in the financial sector, though the new bank remains state-owned. To facilitate
households’ ability to manage wealth, real estate-backed credit lines and reverse mortgages
have been introduced. Staff analysis indeed suggests that consumption in France is
excessively sensitive to current income, which may be due to constrained access to financial
markets.11 However, the new instruments are unlikely to constitute a significant
breakthrough. Their uptake will depend on further reductions in legal requirements for
collateralized lending. The real estate-backed credit line requires repayments before new
credit can be obtained and is capped at the initial nominal loan amount, even if there are
substantial capital gains in the meantime. The authorities motivated their cautious approach
with the concern to avoid financial or macroeconomic instability.
29.
The staff saw scope to enhance the financial sector’s contribution to growth. It
acknowledged the fierce competition for new customers, leading to mortgage products being
offered at unprofitably low interest rates, but observed that switching costs for existing
customers were very high and that elevated profits coincided with relatively high operating
costs. The staff noted that pervasive administered deposit and savings schemes limited the
scope for competition on the banks’ liability side. The authorities saw little adverse impact
from these schemes and had no plans to phase them out. They felt that the banking sector

Shocks to the yield curve (shift up by 200 basis points, short rates up 200 plus long rates up 100 basis points),
foreign demand (down 20 percent), house prices (40 percent decline in two years) would each reduce solvency
(Basel II definition) by less than 1 percentage point.

21
was highly competitive and noted their efforts to increase competition further at the retail
level by requiring more transparent display of costs of services to customers. In addition, the
launch of an Institute for the Financial Education of the Public was designed to help advance
financial literacy.
30.
The authorities supported further integration of financial markets in Europe,
acknowledging the staff’s call to accelerate this process. The staff, referring to studies
suggesting an appreciable growth dividend from complete integration of Europe’s financial
markets, urged the authorities to swiftly establish standardized financial products and
documentation and underwriting practices. It pointed to the potential for cost savings from
integrating payments, clearing and settlement systems and harmonizing regulatory and
supervisory practices for institutions who are increasingly operating across borders.
D. Boosting Growth and Job Creation
31.
In recent years, structural reforms have transformed the economy more than is
commonly perceived, but much remains to be done. The breakup of public utilities, the
pension and health care reforms, and the introduction of a new labor market contract are
some pertinent examples of progress. The authorities noted that, on the basis of the OECD’s
product market regulation indicators, recent reforms are likely to boost annual growth by
0.1-0.2 percent over the medium term. They agreed that much more remained to be done,
particularly regarding employment rules, social security, and the services sector. They
concurred that there was a case for simultaneous product and labor market reforms and for
a better coordination of the timing of reforms in the EU. While they saw limited scope for
new initiatives ahead of the 2007 election, they would persevere with the implementation of
already adopted reforms.
32.
There is broad agreement on what is ailing the labor market. Laying off
employees on permanent contracts is very costly. Direct financial costs are not exorbitant,
but firms must follow cumbersome and lengthy legal procedures and bear the burden of proof
to justify dismissals, with judges ultimately deciding on their validity and cost. For example,
layoffs for economic reasons can be justified on the basis of the desire to “preserve” but not
to “improve” profitability or competitiveness, requiring courts to make business judgments
for which they are not equipped. Consequently, to respond to economic developments,
employers count on a substantial share of fixed-term and temporary workers, which can be
dismissed at known costs. As a result, a dual labor market has emerged with a large segment
of precarious jobs, explaining the coexistence of strong employment protection and the
pervasive feeling of job insecurity. In addition, high minimum wages have been pricing lowskilled workers out of jobs, while generous benefits have been reducing job search
incentives. The employment rate of older workers remains very low, owing to special early
retirement regimes and rigid tenure-related pay scales.
33.
Efforts are under way to change labor market institutions. The authorities
emphasized that considerable progress had been made, with tax and pension reforms and the

22
loosening of the restrictions of the 35-hour workweek promoting labor supply, the
streamlining of employment services and tightening of job search requirements increasing
the chances of successful job matches, and the new labor contract for small enterprises
(CNE) facilitating hiring (Box 6). Its extension to all young workers, aged 26 or less (CPE),
had to be abandoned, however, in the face of social unrest. Eager to show results in terms of
job creation, subsidized employment programs are being ramped up again after their decline
in 2004–05. Together with earlier programs to reduce the cost of labor, the total budgetary
burden of labor market policies is estimated to amount to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2006.
34.
The authorities agreed on the need to reinvigorate labor market reform.
Essential will be the reduction of employment protection of permanent contracts, in
particular the uncertainty surrounding the cost of terminating such contracts. Work had
started on a streamlining of the labor code to diminish the latter. Moreover, the public debate
on this issue appears to be advancing sufficiently to be able to move after the 2007 elections.
However, while it was recognized that social benefits and minimum wages were too high
compared to the median wage, the chances of achieving consensus on reform in this area
seemed remote.12 The staff suggested that the minimum wage should henceforth be tied to
the core index of inflation only. It also argued for a complete phasing-out of special early
retirement regimes and of the exemption from job search for older workers, and for a further
increase in the actuarial fairness of the regular pension system. The authorities responded
that they would implement a package of measures to promote activity for older workers.
35.
Additional progress in product and services market reform will boost potential
output and consumer welfare. As observed with the reform of the distribution sector and
the action of the competition authority in the case of collusion in the telecommunications
sector, consumers stand to benefit greatly from increased competition. To further enhance
these benefits, the staff called for replacing administrative approval of retail outlet locations
by zoning requirements as recommended by the OECD. It also supported other key OECD
recommendations, such as the liberalization of shop opening hours and sales periods and
shortening and simplification of administrative procedures, especially for startups. The swift
adoption of the EU services directive would also have benefits.

12

The minimum wage is indexed to the mean of headline inflation and average wages of the previous year.

23

Box 6. France: Recent Labor Market Reforms
In recent years, the authorities have implemented a series of initiatives to improve
labor market performance. The strategy has focused on introducing gradual changes to
existing labor market institutions and improving the efficiency of government-supported
programs to increase labor demand while raising incentives to work. Beyond the 2003
pension reform, which should raise participation of older workers, key measures included:
•

The relaxation of the 35-hour workweek legislation: The increase in the overtime
quota, the end of restrictions on the use of time savings accounts, the reduction in
the cost of overtime, and the added flexibility to negotiate work arrangements at the
firm level have significantly eased work time constraints, especially for small firms,
helping to boost working hours.

•

The 2004 reform of collective bargaining: The reform increased the employers’
ability to negotiate with unions and other labor organizations at the firm level, in
particular with regard to hours worked, thus contributing to increasing flexibility of
the 35-hour workweek. The legislation also introduced a majority principle for
collective agreements to improve workers’ representation in collective agreements.

•

The streamlining of employment services and government-aided job programs
with the implementation of the Plan de cohésion sociale (PCS): The PCS has
sought to improve the efficiency of employment services by reducing job-search
costs and strengthening compliance of job search requirements (including the
obligation of active job search and training and the possibility of reducing
unemployment benefits). By refocusing and simplifying government-aided job
programs, the PCS has also helped raising labor demand, especially for the young
and long-term unemployed, albeit adding to budgetary costs.

•

The introduction of a new employment contract for small enterprises (CNE) in
August 2005: The CNE is a contract with a trial period of up to two years for firms
with 20 employees or less. Employment termination under the CNE is not subject to
costly legal and administrative procedures, severance pay is based on job duration,
and no hiring restrictions are imposed. The CNE has been well received since its
inception. Through June 2006, job intentions using the CNE accounted to close to
10 percent of total employment intentions by small firms. However, reflecting strong
substitution effects, the overall impact of the CNE on net job creation has been
rather modest, reaching close to 40,000 in its first six months and estimated to rise to
70,000 over the medium term.1

•

Other measures accompanying the introduction of the CNE: The reduction of
social contributions for small firms increasing employment, a tax credit for the
young employed in sectors with recruitment difficulties, and the scaling-up of
government-aided programs seek to increase labor demand.

Box 6. France: Recent Labor Market Reforms (concluded)
•

The overhaul of the earned-income tax credit (PPE) in September 2005: Tax
credits were sharply raised, and the lag in the tax credit disbursements was
significantly shortened, thus improving work incentives.

•

Recent proposals to lift the employment rate of older workers: Proposed measures
that seek to eliminate the tax for firing workers aged 50 or older (contribution
Delalande) raise the margins for accumulating pension credits, increase the pension
rate (surcôte) for those who continue to work, and improve the terms for gradual
retirement should boost incentives for older workers to remain in the labor force.
A new temporary employment contract for workers aged 55 or older could, in
principle, facilitate their employment but is likely to have a modest impact given its
limited scope.

Many of these reforms have continued to add to the already large budgetary costs of
labor market policies in France. In 2006, public resources spent on labor market policies
will reach 2.4 percent of GDP (Table). About half of this amount is devoted to across-theboard exemptions of employers’ social security contributions (SSC), which grew
considerably following the sharp upward adjustment of the minimum wage (SMIC) during
the 2003–05 period. These exemptions presently apply to all workers with wages between
1 and 1.6 times the SMIC as well as specific sectors, such as the catering sector and services
to households. About 0.7 percent of GDP is spent on subsidized jobs, aids to enterprise
creation, and promotion of life-long and vocational training. The earned-income tax credit
(PPE) will amount to 0.2 percent of GDP, while other tax expenditures (after excluding the
SSC cuts) could reach 0.2 percent. For households, budgetary support would range from the
personal income tax (PIT) credit for hiring an employee for personal services to partial PIT
exemption for apprentices. Firms would also benefit from the corporate income tax credits
for life-long training, management of apprentices, or activities in special urban areas.

The authorities acknowledged that the state’s presence in commercial activities
was still too pervasive, noting that it was steadily diminishing. The state had been
withdrawing from participation in commercial activities, most prominently in the
privatization of highways, the partial flotation of the electricity and gas utilities, and the
impending divestiture of the Paris airports operator. The authorities observed that the
planned merger of the gas utility with a domestic firm, which many perceived as an attempt
to prevent takeover by a foreign firm, was a mere acceleration of existing business plans,
which would reduce the state’s stake in the utility. The staff noted the ambiguity of policies
in this area pointing to a new law, covering 11 so-called sensitive sectors, specifically
adopted to limit the possibility of hostile takeovers.
37.
Efforts to boost R&D spending are being reinvigorated. Mindful of the
importance of research and development for growth and participation in globalization, the
authorities have started to provide R&D and infrastructure support to selected research
clusters and have created a new agency for innovation. While supporting the objectives of
this policy, the staff agreed with the OECD position calling for limiting bureaucracy and
budgetary costs. Moreover, as it is mostly the private sector that lags in terms of R&D
spending by international comparison, it will be important to focus on public-private
partnerships and increased incentives for individual researchers.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
The economic outlook is broadly positive thanks in part to policies of
consolidation and reform, but significant structural weaknesses persist, requiring
further growth-enhancing reforms. Greater flexibility in labor and product markets have
increased economic efficiency, while pension and health care reforms—alongside ongoing
fiscal consolidation—have brightened prospects for fiscal sustainability. Even so, France’s
relative position in the global economy has deteriorated appreciably, the level of projected
age-related spending remains comparatively high, as do taxes, unemployment benefits, and
minimum wages—compressing employment rates. Further reforms are needed to durably
reduce unemployment, prepare for an aging population, and allow the economy to fully
benefit from globalization. Reforms have been adopted successfully when they were well
explained to the public and consensus was built among stakeholders. Thus, the authorities’
emphasis on raising public awareness of the need and benefits of structural reforms,
including via councils of main stakeholders, is highly welcome.
39.
These reforms will need to cover several areas to exploit synergies and balance
the interests of various stakeholders. There are three main priorities: First, fiscal
adjustment through expenditure reduction should remain high on the agenda. Second, two
labor market reforms are key, namely, a marked reduction in the judicial uncertainty
surrounding permanent labor contracts, and a widening of the differentials among the median
wage, the minimum wage, and out-of-work benefits. Third, in product markets, deregulation
of the services sector and full disengagement of the state from commercial activities are

26
crucial. In line with the authorities’ welcome emphasis on raising public awareness of the
needs and benefits of structural reforms, the electoral calendar provides an opportunity to
place these economic priorities at the centre of an informed public debate. Implementation
should start immediately following the 2007 elections.
40.
Economic prospects are favorable. In the near term, growth is expected to continue
in the range between 2 and 2½ percent per year, and unemployment is likely to decline
appreciably. Risks are broadly balanced and relate mainly to external developments, given
the heightened sensitivity of the economy to global developments. In this context, it is
encouraging that exports have picked up following a few years of lackluster performance.
Together with the fact that the exchange rate appears broadly in line with fundamentals, this
has alleviated concerns about competitiveness, but the slow response to the global expansion
still points to the presence of supply rigidities and the need for flexibility-enhancing
structural reforms. Such reforms would also be consistent with addressing the risk of
a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances. For the medium term, prospects are for
potential growth to remain higher than previously expected because of improved
demographics and the effects of structural reforms.
41.
Fiscal consolidation needs to build on the significant progress achieved during
the past three years. Underlying adjustment has been noteworthy, averaging slightly more
than ½ of 1 percentage point of GDP per year and permitting the general government deficit
to settle below 3 percent of GDP. Maintaining central government spending constant in real
terms for four consecutive years and bringing health care spending on track after years of
overruns have enhanced the credibility of fiscal policy. Still, recent consolidation has relied
mainly on increases in revenues. Against this background, the aim to balance the budget
by 2010 is appropriate, as is the focus on expenditure restraint. Nonetheless, stronger
adjustment in 2007 would be desirable to attain a more evenly-paced consolidation path.
Moreover, it will be essential to quickly make the specific policy choices necessary to keep
spending within the proposed norms, especially for social security and local governments.
A further strengthening of the capacity of national fiscal institutions to contribute to the
public debate on fiscal policy will be helpful.
42.
Tax reforms have improved the economy’s growth potential, but further
reductions in the tax burden are desirable and should be funded by additional
expenditure cuts. The focus of tax reform on making work pay and fostering investment is
highly welcome. However, the increasing recourse to tax expenditure needs to be stemmed to
prevent the erosion of the benefits of improved spending discipline. While the concern to
fund social security not just from taxes on labor is legitimate, the current proposals to shift
taxation to other tax bases will have negligible economic effects.
43.
The financial sector’s profitability and capitalization put it in a good position to
manage increasing risks, to which supervisors should remain highly attentive. These
risks pertain to the likely transitory character of current low provisioning, the possible

27
relaxation of loan standards in the face of sharp competition for market share, rising
exposure abroad, and the search for profits in less liquid market segments. Encouragingly,
stress tests conducted by banks and supervisors indicate considerable resilience to large
shocks.
44.
By improving its efficiency further, the financial sector could contribute
appreciably to lifting the economy’s growth potential. Phasing out administrative savings
schemes should increase competition for resources, foster financial innovation, and help the
development of risk capital markets. The current initiative to reform the mortgage market
should be expanded to permit more flexible use of prudently-valued housing collateral. The
postal bank should be allowed to develop into a full-fledged bank and be privatized.
Complete integration of Europe’s financial markets will be a boon for growth. To expedite
this process, France and other member countries should swiftly harmonize financial products,
regulation, and legislation and integrate financial market infrastructure.
45.
Structural reforms in labor and product markets remain essential to boost longterm growth and secure fiscal sustainability. Following recent reforms, the labor market
has become more flexible, raising supply, but the high level of the minimum wage and its
ongoing significant increases continue to curb labor demand, lead to excessive wage
compression, and require budgetary resources to keep labor costs manageable. Future labor
market reforms need to break this vicious circle by focusing on reforms that do not burden
the budget. Priority should be given to drastically reducing the legal uncertainty surrounding
permanent labor contracts and increasing the wedge between the minimum wage and the
median wage and between out-of-work benefits and the minimum wage. This would allow
people who progress in their career to see the benefit of their efforts and reward the return to
work. Simultaneously strengthening product and services market reform would lend support
for labor market reforms as it is likely to increase purchasing power. Deregulating the
services sector, reducing the administrative burden on enterprises, and accelerating the
withdrawal of the state from commercial activities will appreciably boost output and
consumer welfare. Regarding international trade, France should contribute actively within
the EU to help revive multilateral trade negotiations.
46.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

Fiscal Transparency—Update

IMF Country Report
No. 04/345, 11/03/04

Summary: The report found that France has achieved a high level of fiscal transparency and
has introduced a number of improvements in coverage and presentation of fiscal information.
Notable areas of progress include the development in the final accounts publication to
include more complete information on government assets and liabilities as well as disclosure
of contingent liabilities. Accounting standards have been changed to reflect accruals
principles in a number of areas, and these standards are clearly explained. The staff
suggested that further steps could be taken to identify and report quasi-fiscal activities in the
budget presentation, provide a more consolidated picture of fiscal activity outside the
appropriation process, and improve the reconciliation of stated policies with outcomes at the
general government level.
These issues have been addressed in the Loi organique aux lois de finance (LOLF), which
has become fully effective on January 1, 2006. In addition to the annual appropriations, the
government has to commit to a multi-annual framework, details of which are provided in the
economic, social, and financial report attached to the Budget Act. The budget is organized
along missions and provides details on the level of appropriations for each mission and
performance indicators by which the expected results of the mission will be assessed ex post.
The State Audit Office has been given the new assignment of certifying the public accounts,
and implementation of accruals-basis accounting has been confirmed. Parliamentary
oversight powers have been strengthened.

Summary: The 2000 ROSC noticed that transparency of financial policies is accorded
a high priority by all financial agencies assessed, and they are in observance of the good
practices of the Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial
Policies. The major agencies disclose their objectives, their legal and institutional
frameworks, and have open processes of policymaking and regulation. The principles of
transparency are observed by dissemination of relevant information to the public and in the
agencies’ arrangements for internal conduct, integrity, and accountability. However, the staff
noted that the framework for supervision and regulation applicable to mutual insurance firms
is not as well defined and suggested to improve its transparency. The transparency of
monetary policy was not assessed by the Fund team as the Banque de France is a member of
the European System of Central Banks and no longer conducts independent monetary policy.
Subsequently, the framework for supervision and regulation applicable to a specific group of
mutual insurance firms was modified in a number of steps. In August 2003, legislation
created a single supervisory body, the Commission de Contrôle des Assurances, Mutuelles et
Institutions de Prévoyance (CCAMIP) by merging the regular insurance supervisor (CCA)
and mutualities’ supervisor (CCMIP). Coordination with the banking sector supervisors was
strengthened and the powers of the supervisory authorities extended.

Summary: The report found that France is in observance of the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS). In particular, the mandate of INSEE and the Banque de
France for the production of the six macroeconomic datasets is clearly defined, with the
reporting burden and the confidentiality provisions given special consideration notably

46
through the CNIS. Professionalism is central to the statistical operations of the two
institutions, internationally and/or European accepted methodologies are generally followed,
the degree of accuracy and reliability of the six datasets is remarkable, statistics are relevant
and provided on a timely basis, and they are accessible to the public.
The report made a number of suggestions for further improvements: the responsibility of
INSEE as the producer of government finance statistics should be clarified; data sharing
between the Banque de France and the rest of the French statistical system improved;
classification and valuation methods in balance-of-payments statistics reviewed; consistency
between the current account of the balance of payments and the goods and services account
in the national accounts improved; the timing of revisions in the quarterly and annual
national accounts aligned; and identification of data production units of INSEE facilitated.
France continues to implement several of the 2003 ROSC Data Module recommendations,
including by promoting a broader understanding of statistical data revisions, making greater
use of firm-level data to improve the measurement of changes in stocks, and intensifying
work on portfolio investment income with the objective of starting to record those
transactions on an accrual basis.

Summary: The report concluded that France’s financial sector is strong and well supervised.
No weaknesses that could cause systemic risks were identified. The strength of the system is
supported by the financial soundness indicators and the strong conformity to the supervisory
and regulatory standards approved by the Basel Committee, IAIS, IOSCO, FATF, and CPSS.
The degree of observance of the transparency code is high in all relevant areas. The French
banking sector has been modernized and restructured over the past two decades and is well
capitalized. Systemic vulnerabilities in the important insurance sector are well contained.
Securities markets are large and sophisticated.
Notwithstanding the strengths of the French financial sector, a number of issues emerged
from the FSAP, including (i) concentration in banking may have reached a point where
further consolidation could intensify concerns over the scope for collusion and long-term

47
stability where many banks could be considered “too big to fail;” (ii) banks’ large and
growing portfolios of fixed-rate residential housing loans could represent a longer-term risk
in the event of large increases in funding costs and/or a significant fall in real estate prices;
(iii) some administered savings schemes and other policy measures give rise to costs and
impede financial market innovation. These schemes are not well targeted to achieve intended
social goals and are not well aligned with current priorities, such as strengthening the
pension system; (iv) the banking system’s rapid accumulation of capital strengthens banks’
resilience. This accumulation is harder to control for mutual banks, given their legal
restrictions on remuneration of their members. And, for all banks, it could encourage
expansion through expensive takeovers and risky new ventures; (v) the supervisory system of
the financial sector is composed of specialized segments. Coordination mechanisms need to
be further adapted. Additional steps should be considered in the future as cross-sectoral
financial groups become more prevalent; (vi) the consolidation of the French stock and
futures markets with others in Europe has increased the importance of effective cooperation
across national jurisdictions. Moreover, the authorities face the challenge of adjusting to and
effectively implementing the significant regulatory overhaul that took place in late 2003; and
(vii) the infrastructure for the clearing and settlement of payments and securities is generally
sound and modern. However, there is some room for improvement in the clearing and
settlement of retail payments and securities, where the multilateral netting systems lack fully
adequate safeguards to ensure timely settlement in case of default.

48

APPENDIX II: FRANCE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
France’s economic database is comprehensive and of high quality, and data provision to the
Fund is adequate for surveillance. The authorities regularly publish a full range of economic
and financial data, and calendar dates of main statistical releases are also provided. The
transmission of data in electronic form from INSEE (Institut national de la statistique et des
études économiques) and the profusion of data from various institutions (Banque de France,
INSEE, ministry of finance, ministry of labor and solidarity) have helped to build an
infrastructure, in which all data can be easily accessed through the Economic Data Sharing
System. As a subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), France posts
its metadata on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) on the Internet.
A data ROSC mission conducted an assessment of the statistical system in March 2003, and
the report was published in October 2003. A factual update to the main report was published
in November 2004.
Since the beginning of 1999, France’s monetary and banking statistics methodology has
changed to reflect the standards of the European Economic and Monetary Union. The
European Central Bank framework, which is used by the authorities for reporting monetary
data to STA, provides comparable details as the Standardized Report Forms developed by
STA. Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions and monetary
aggregates are prepared on a monthly basis and are timely. France’s monetary data have been
included in the September 1, 2006 issue of the quarterly IFS Supplement No 17 on monetary
and financial statistics.
France adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95)
in 1999. Data for GDP and its expenditure components are available from 1978 onwards.
Both annual and quarterly accounts provide reliable information, although estimates from the
two accounts differ slightly before the quarterly accounts are revised to be aligned to the
annual ones. In 2005, national accounts data were rebased to 2000 prices. While current and
constant 2000 prices are available, institutional sector data are only available from 1993
onwards and employment data from 1990 onwards. INSEE will publish in the near future the
complete set of national accounts with base 2000, and starting in 1978.
Data issues include the need to provide monthly or quarterly developments not only for the
finances of the central government, but also for social security and local governments. These
data should be presented in a comprehensive fashion and on a national accounts basis to
facilitate monitoring of public finances. The national accounts website has recently been
enhanced: it includes expenditure tables and government revenues by subsector (central

49

government, miscellaneous central government agencies, local governments, and social
security administration).
With regard to balance-of-payments statistics, the data ROSC mission recommended
initiating efforts to achieve greater coherence between the external current account and the
rest of the world account in national accounts. Work with promising early results has been
undertaken on the transportation account.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
FRANCE
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with the Policy Development and Review Department)
Approved by Michael Deppler and Matthew Fisher
October 19, 2006

This supplement to the staff report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation with France provides
an update on recent developments, in particular the authorities’ 2007 budget proposal and
their medium-term fiscal plans presented with the budget. The new information does not alter
the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Summary
Growth is likely to reach 2.5 percent in 2006, slightly higher than anticipated in the staff
report because of historical data revisions, but growth rates going forward remain
unchanged, consistent with newly released short-term economic indicators. Headline
inflation fell to 1.5 percent in September, helped by declining oil prices. The staff’s growth
projections are somewhat higher than those of the authorities, leading it to project general
government deficits of 2.6 percent of GDP and 2.4 percent of GDP in 2006 and 2007,
respectively, compared to official targets of 2.7 percent and 2.5 percent of GDP. Tight
spending control and slightly above-trend nontax revenues are expected to accommodate
previously announced tax cuts of about 0.3 percent of GDP. In the staff’s estimates, the
structural deficit is set to remain broadly constant in 2007, while the authorities see
a continuing structural improvement. The 2007 budget raises spending on ODA to
0.5 percent of GNI. On structural issues, privatization is continuing, but the removal of
administered schemes in the financial sector is being resisted.
Output and inflation
1.
The authorities project growth in a range of 2–2½ percent in 2006 and 2007, on
the basis of robust consumer spending. The staff projections are at the top end of this range
in 2006 and at 2.3 percent for 2007, above the Consensus forecast (Table 1). Recent data

2
releases are consistent with growth settling at about 2½ percent in the second half of 2006.
Consumer confidence is up, and spending on manufactured goods was exceptionally strong
in August. Industrial production weakened during the summer, but business sentiment held
up well, and the outlook for production has been improving. Labor shortages have emerged
in a briskly expanding construction sector. Higher oil prices and buoyant imports led to
a further widening of the current account deficit in July, despite strong export growth.
Employment has been edging up, but the unemployment rate rose marginally to 9 percent in
August, following a 1 percentage point decline over the past 12 months. Headline inflation
has moderated while the slight upward trend in underlying inflation was reversed in August–
September 2006, with a decline to 1.0 percent.
2006 Budget
2.
Owing to stronger growth, the reduction in the 2006 general government deficit
is larger than expected, and underlying adjustment is still expected to amount to
0.5 percent of GDP. The authorities project the deficit to fall from 2.9 percent of GDP
in 2005 to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2006, below the initial target of 2.9 percent of GDP. The
structural adjustment results from the replacement of one-off revenues (transfer of the energy
utilities’ pension funds) with durable expenditure restraint. In social security, tight control of
health care spending appears to be more than offsetting higher-than-budgeted pension
payments. Fiscal incentives favoring energy conservation have been strengthened, with
marginal budgetary implications. As noted in the staff report, tax expenditure approved
outside the budget law appears to be weighing on the budget and is estimated to have reduced
revenues by 0.1 percent of GDP in 2006.
2007 Budget
3.
The draft 2007 budget aims to reduce the deficit from 2.7 percent to 2.5 percent
of GDP while lowering the tax burden. With growth assumed to be 2¼ percent, this is to be
accomplished as follows:
•

On the expenditure side, general government spending is set to grow by 1.4 percent
in real terms, for a 0.4 percent decline in the expenditure-to-GDP ratio. Central
government expenditure is planned to fall by 1 percent in volume terms after three
consecutive years of zero real growth. The number of civil servants will decline by
15,000 (in full-time equivalents), a step-up from the record to date, but still implying
a replacement rate of four out of five retiring employees. Nominal social security
spending growth is projected to stabilize at about 3¼ percent, anchored by a health
care spending norm of 2.5 percent. To achieve this, new measures will be introduced
to foster the use of generic drugs and reduce fraud. However, pension payments will
rise as an increasing number of baby boomers are retiring. Local government
expenditures are expected to continue growing above nominal GDP, reflecting strong
investment and a rising wage bill.

3
•

Revenues from taxes and social security contributions are projected to fall by
0.3 percentage point to 43.7 percent of GDP. Two thirds of this decline stem from
a preannounced income tax reform, which reduces the number of brackets and the
highest marginal rates. In addition, the earned income tax credit (prime pour l’emploi)
is being raised further, and firms will benefit from the capping of the taxe
professionnelle at 3.5 percent of value added, the exemption of new investment from
this tax, and the elimination of social security contributions for minimum wage
workers in small firms. The budget again stipulates that all revenue windfalls be
applied to deficit reduction. Nontax revenues are maintained at slightly above-trend
levels.

4.
In the authorities’ estimates, the 2007 budget implies a structural adjustment of
0.4 percent of GDP. However, this adjustment reflects the assumption that potential growth
is significantly higher than actual projected growth of 2¼ percent of GDP in 2007 and
particular assumptions about the behavior of structural revenues. On the basis of the staff’s
already upward-revised estimates of potential growth (see staff report ¶14) and unit elasticity
of revenues with respect to GDP, there would be virtually no underlying adjustment in 2007.
Medium-term fiscal outlook
5.
Over the medium term (2008–10), the authorities intend to pursue underlying
adjustment through expenditure restraint, while leaving the tax system unchanged. In
their “low-case” medium-term scenario, growth is set to continue at 2¼ percent per year, and
real general government spending growth would decline further to average 0.6 percent
during 2008–10 (Text Table). Central government spending would decelerate to become
constant in value by 2010, and social security, health care, and local spending growth would
be limited, respectively, to 1.1 percent, 2.2 percent, and 2 percent per year in real terms. This
scenario would result in a cumulative structural adjustment of 2.2 percentage points of GDP
by 2010. As measures to achieve these objectives have not been specified, the staff projects
that on current policies, real general government spending would average 1.8 percent per
year beyond 2007, limiting the improvement of the structural balance to 0.3 percent of GDP
by 2010. The authorities also present a high-case medium-term scenario with higher actual
and potential annual economic growth of 3 percent due to structural reforms. Excluding tax
cuts and taking into account lower spending on unemployment benefits, this scenario would
improve the fiscal situation by almost 1 percent of GDP.

Parliament approved an energy law paving the way for divestiture of Gaz de France
(GDF), while the authorities sharply criticized EU attempts to challenge the distribution
monopoly of an administered savings scheme (Livret A).

Staff Assessment
7.
While the 2007 budget envisages continued spending restraint, it is partly used
to fund tax cuts, with an inopportune pause in underlying adjustment. Economic
projections underlying the 2007 budget are cautious, and the planned reduction in central
government expenditure by 1 percent in real terms represents a welcome breakthrough,
building on the successful real containment of recent years. However, on the basis of the
staff’s more conservative estimates of potential growth and structural revenue behavior, there
is virtually no structural adjustment in 2007. The tax reform improves incentives and
economic efficiency. To be effective, the budget provision to allocate revenue windfalls to
deficit reduction will need to be complemented by a rule prohibiting tax expenditure from
being implemented outside the budget law.
8.
For the medium term, the considerable reduction in spending as a share of GDP
envisaged by the authorities will require the adoption of durable expenditure measures.
On current policies, the staff projects the structural balance to remain in a deficit of about
1½ percent of GDP over the medium term. Implementing the authorities’ planned spending
path for the central government, balancing social security budgets and curbing local spending
growth would eliminate this deficit. Even so, as illustrated in the staff report, fiscal
sustainability will only be achieved with further growth-enhancing structural reforms.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
France
On October 25, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV Consultation with France.1
Background
After stagnating in the first half of 2005, economic activity rebounded strongly,
supported by robust domestic demand. The uptick in neighboring countries’ GDP growth
buttressed exports, following three years of weakness despite buoyant global demand.
From a longer-term perspective, France’s relative performance has, however, lagged
the ongoing global expansion, as indicated by the decline in its ranking in terms of per
capita GDP from 12th to 16th position during the past five years.
All components of domestic demand contributed to the upswing. Falling unemployment,
real increases in minimum wages, and low interest rates supported consumption and
investment in housing. Fixed capital formation strengthened with the revived cyclical
upturn. The external sector detracted from growth over the past five years, and together
with adverse terms-of-trade effects, led to a shift in the current account into deficit.
Structural factors, including labor market rigidities, limit the economy’s ability to rapidly
adjust to developments in trade partners and take advantage of robust global growth.
The staff projects GDP growth to remain broad-based, averaging 2.5 percent in 2006
and 2.3 percent in 2007, reflecting the slowdown in global growth. Headline inflation is
trending down in line with falling energy prices, and staff projects it to decline to

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

1.8 percent in 2007 from an average of 2 percent in 2006. In line with improved
demographic trends and reflecting the impact of ongoing structural reforms, the staff has
raised its potential growth outlook to 2.2 percent for the next five years, after which it will
be dampened as a result of population aging.
The 2007 draft budget targets a reduction in the general government deficit to
2.5 percent of GDP from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2006 and 2.9 percent of GDP in 2005.
Following a structural improvement of about 0.8 percentage point of GDP in 2005,
the staff estimates the structural balance to improve by 0.5 percentage point of GDP
in 2006. Structural adjustment is achieved through expenditure restraint at the central
government level and in health care. The net tax burden remains roughly constant
in 2006, but is expected to decline by 0.3 percent of GDP in 2007, largely due to tax
relief favoring work income, investment, and a variety of smaller tax cuts in other areas.
In the financial sector, housing credit expanded strongly, bank profitability increased,
and nonperforming loans declined. Supervisors urged banks to strengthen loan
standards and watch exposure to hedge funds and credit derivatives. New mortgage
market instruments have been established.
On structural reforms, the authorities are emphasizing the need to raise public
awareness of the benefits of structural reforms. Labor supply is being promoted by the
increase in earned income tax credit and the reduction in marginal income tax rates,
while labor demand is benefiting from targeted reductions in social security contributions
and the introduction of a new labor contract for small enterprises (Contrat nouvelle
embauche, CNE). A reorganization of employment services is designed to improve labor
market matching. Following the withdrawal of a proposed new labor contract for the
young (Contrat première embauche, CPE) in light of social protests, a council on
employment (Conseil d’orientation pour l’emploi, COE) was created to establish
a common diagnosis of the causes of unemployment and foster public debate on its
remedies. In product markets, divestiture from commercial activities has continued,
including in the energy sector.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the French authorities for their skillful macroeconomic
management in recent years and welcomed the significant progress in fiscal
consolidation and structural reform. Noting that France has changed more than is
commonly perceived, Directors supported the authorities’ emphasis on building
consensus, which has been instrumental in promoting reform. However, much remains
to be done. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue with a steadfast pursuit of
their consensus-building approach to advance the key reforms needed to increase
potential growth, durably reduce unemployment, prepare for an aging population, and
allow the economy to benefit fully from globalization. Equally, Directors urged the
authorities to maintain the steady pace of fiscal consolidation until the general
government budget is balanced.

3

Directors saw the near-term economic outlook as positive, with growth becoming more
vigorous and broad based, while improved demographics and structural reforms have
brightened the medium-term outlook. Falling unemployment, rising wages, and tax cuts
have supported private consumption, and inflation has remained low, while favorable
financing conditions and high capacity utilization are bolstering investment. Although
exports have strengthened noticeably since mid-2005 following a few years of lackluster
performance, the current account deficit has continued to widen. The real effective
exchange rate appears to be fairly valued, and Directors did not see an immediate
competitiveness problem. However, they noted the lack, until recently, of a more
dynamic response of exports to the global expansion. This underscores the importance
of flexibility-enhancing structural reforms, which will also be helpful in addressing the risk
of a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances.
Directors supported the authorities’ emphasis on informing, educating, and consensusbuilding to foster public support for economic reforms. They observed that this approach
has worked well in the area of public finances, with broad consensus on the need to
curb deficits and debt, and that this consensus now needs to be extended to labor and
product market reforms. Directors encouraged the authorities to exploit synergies and
balance various interests by advocating reforms covering several areas, and giving
consideration to their proper sequencing. Directors saw three issues as standing at the
top of the agenda: further fiscal adjustment through expenditure restraint; further labor
market reform by reducing the judicial uncertainty surrounding permanent contracts and
widening the differentials between out-of-work benefits, the minimum wage, and the
median wage; and further product market reform through deregulation of the services
sector and progressive disengagement of the state from commercial activities.
Directors urged the authorities to continue to make significant progress with fiscal
consolidation by maintaining the pace of adjustment of recent years. They welcomed the
prospect that the 2006 deficit outcome appears set to come in below the budget target,
bolstering the credibility of fiscal policy. For 2007, Directors welcomed the intention to
reduce central government expenditures by 1 percent in real terms and to sustain the
decline in health-spending growth, but observed that pension and local government
spending remains buoyant. Directors were of the view that stronger adjustment in 2007
would be desirable to maintain an evenly-paced path toward balance.
Directors supported the authorities’ objective of balancing the budget by 2010, as a
crucial component of the strategy to deal with population aging. As the recent fiscal
consolidation has mainly relied on increases in revenues, Directors strongly welcomed
the focus on ambitious medium-term expenditure restraint, while emphasizing the need
to make the specific policy choices required to achieve this objective. In particular,
Directors stressed the importance of reducing spending growth for social security and
local governments.

4

Directors welcomed the contribution of recent tax reforms to improving incentives and
economic efficiency, thanks to their focus on making work pay and on fostering
investment. Directors saw merit in further reductions in the tax burden, which should be
funded by an additional decline in spending and a broadening of the tax base.
Directors welcomed the full implementation of the new objective-oriented budgeting
framework for the central government that has helped strengthen fiscal governance.
In this context, they felt that the provision to allocate revenue windfalls to deficit
reduction adopted in the last two budgets should become a standard feature. To avoid
circumvention of this provision and safeguard the benefits of tight spending control,
Directors underscored the need to formally prevent recourse to tax expenditure outside
the framework of the budget law. Directors welcomed the reliance on consensusbuilding institutions to promote fiscal discipline and contribute to the public debate on
fiscal policy, and looked forward to further development of this approach.
Directors observed that the financial system is highly profitable, well capitalized, and in
a good position to manage increasing risks. They nevertheless urged supervisors to
remain highly attentive to the risks of relaxation of loan standards and rising exposures
abroad and to less liquid market segments. Directors saw scope for increasing the
financial sector’s contribution to economic growth. To achieve this objective,
administered saving schemes should be phased out, competition and the development
of risk capital markets promoted, and the complete integration of Europe’s financial
markets advanced.
Directors noted that the labor market has become more flexible following recent reforms,
while observing that increases in the minimum wage continue to curb labor demand and
intensify wage compression. In this context, Directors underscored the need to break
the vicious circle between minimum wage increases and the use of budgetary resources
to reduce labor costs. Instead, they felt that the focus should be squarely placed on
reforms to raise labor market flexibility. Hence, Directors urged the authorities to
increase the wedge between the minimum wage and the median wage and between
out-of-work benefits and the minimum wage to reward the return to work and career
progression. An important step to boost job creation will be to reduce the legal
uncertainty surrounding permanent labor contracts.
Directors welcomed the steps toward divestiture of network industries and the reduction
in the administrative burden on enterprises. They noted that these reforms would boost
output and consumer welfare and that their further pursuit would lend support to labor
market reforms. Directors encouraged the authorities to make determined efforts on
economic deregulation, divestiture from commercial activities, and further opening up of
the services markets to competition.

5

Directors urged France to contribute actively within the EU to help revive and bring to
a successful conclusion the Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations.
They welcomed France’s commitment to supporting developing countries and the
planned increase in its official development assistance.
