IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Republic of Kazakhstan

On July 31, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Kazakhstan and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a
meeting.2
Against the backdrop of external shocks, economic growth and inflation have decelerated, financial
conditions have tightened, and external imbalances are emerging. Real GDP growth slowed to an
annualized 2 percent during the first quarter of 2015, down from around 4 percent in 2014 and
6 percent in 2013. In addition to weaker external demand, slower growth was driven by the impact of
lower income and profitability (resulting from lower oil prices) and confidence effects (reflecting
regional developments) on private consumption and domestic investment. The external position has
deteriorated largely due to the fall in oil prices, with the current account balance turning negative in
the second half of 2014, although there has been some improvement in the current account during the
first quarter of 2015. At the same time, Kazakhstan’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has
appreciated over the past year, mainly reflecting the depreciation of the ruble and sharp appreciation
of the U.S. dollar, against which the tenge is managed. In the face of slowing demand and a more
stable exchange rate, headline inflation fell from 7.4 percent year-on-year at end-2014 to 3.9 percent
year-on-year at end-June, 2015. In mid-July, following the decline in sovereign spreads and reduced

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

currency pressures, the authorities successfully issued a $4 billion sovereign bond and widened the
exchange rate band from 170–188 to 170–198 tenge/dollar.
Real GDP growth is projected to decelerate to 2 percent in 2015. Weaker demand from Russia and
China, lower oil prices, confidence effects, and continuing delays in the Kashagan oil field are the
main factors behind the projected slowdown. Next year, growth is projected to pick up to
3.25 percent, driven by gradual recovery in oil prices and external demand. Still, the medium-term
growth outlook is less favorable than projected last year, given the impact of lower oil prices and
continued slow growth in Russia on non-oil potential growth in Kazakhstan.
The fiscal stimulus aimed at supporting growth has led to deterioration in the fiscal accounts, with
the overall fiscal surplus falling from 5 percent of GDP in 2013 to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2014.
Monetary conditions have tightened, which, together with lower economic activity, have slowed
lending activity sharply. At the same time, the NBK has made progress in improving its monetary
policy framework and operations, while administrative and prudential measures have succeeded in
lowering the level of non-performing loans (NPLs). In line with the 2014 FSAP recommendations,
the authorities have started to undertake bottom-up stress tests for banks. The NBK has also initiated
discussions with bank supervisors in other jurisdictions to strengthen cross-border supervision. The
authorities have embarked on an ambitious structural reform program, bolstered by extensive
engagement with the Multilateral Development Banks. In June 2015, Kazakhstan completed
negotiations to become a formal member of the WTO.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2015 Article IV consultation with Kazakhstan, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Amid slower economic growth, tighter financial conditions, and emerging imbalances, policies
should balance ensuring sustainability while alleviating the impact of shocks in the near term. In
recent years the authorities have successfully harnessed oil resources to bolster economic growth and
build buffers. However, economic growth has now decelerated largely as a result of likely longlasting external shocks and is expected to remain subdued this year and next year. Moreover, the
outlook for growth is subject to predominantly downside external risks. In view of weaker growth,
the large and likely long-lasting nature of the shocks, and the accumulated buffers, the policy

3

response in the short term should be geared toward supporting the economic recovery. Over the
medium term, there is a need to further strengthen macroeconomic policy frameworks, to bolster
resilience to shocks and promote durable growth.
To ensure fiscal sustainability, the stimulus must be accompanied by credible medium-term fiscal
consolidation and more transparent fiscal policy framework. The stimulus is justified on
countercyclical grounds and is appropriately frontloaded and tailored to support growth. However, to
ensure a sustainable path for the non-oil deficit, the stimulus must be accompanied by credible
medium-term consolidation measures, especially on the revenue side. In particular, there is scope to
strengthen the enforcement of tax collection, reduce tax exemptions, including in the Special
Economic Zones, and make income tax rates more progressive. Moreover, enhancing the fiscal
policy framework is critical to ensuring transparency and medium-term sustainability. Key priorities
include expanding the budget coverage to all fiscal activity, in line with GFSM 2001, and integrating
fiscal policy into a broader macroeconomic policy framework.
Greater exchange rate flexibility in tandem with the introduction of new monetary policy instruments
is needed to enhance the policy architecture and address imbalances. The authorities have taken
confidence-building measures to overhaul the monetary policy framework in support of their
medium-term goal of adopting inflation targeting, and have widened the exchange rate band.
However, with the aim of more effectively managing liquidity and signaling the stance of policy, the
authorities should speed up the planned introduction of a new policy interest rate, supported by open
market operations. Moreover, strengthening the policy architecture requires further exchange rate
flexibility, which will support a more independent interest rate policy and help reduce imbalances.
To avoid undermining financial stability, and anchor expectations about policy intentions and
operations, the authorities should communicate their plans openly and consistently.
In view of rising vulnerabilities, further actions are needed to bolster financial sector resilience.
Efforts underway to reduce the level of NPLs are paying off. However, more needs to be done to
bring down the level of NPLs to sustainable levels, while ensuring that the achievement of the 10
percent prudential ceiling by end-2015 does not compromise proper loan classification and
provisioning. In this regard, while the recent plans to refocus the NPL resolution framework at the
merged KKB-BTA entity is appropriate, weaknesses in the bank should be addressed and an asset
quality review be undertaken within a broad strategy to ensure long-term viability. Strengthening
financial sector resilience also requires introducing higher risk weights or exposure caps on corporate
lending, limiting FX lending to unhedged borrowers, and tightening net open position limits to
mitigate credit risk. Further steps in implementing the FSAP recommendations include adopting risk-

4

based assessment tools and supervision and finalizing legislative amendments in insurance, pensions,
and the securities market.
The structural reform agenda is appropriately ambitious, but effective implementation is essential to
achieving sustainable and inclusive growth. Priority areas include strengthening human capital,
building institutions, bolstering the rule of law, enhancing financial intermediation, and improving
the business climate. Close collaboration with MDBs in these areas should facilitate greater
efficiency in the procurement and implementation process. Moreover, diversification away from the
oil sector and the reduction of the state footprint in the economy are necessary conditions to ensuring
successful implementation of the broader private-sector-led growth strategy.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: Over the past two decades, Kazakhstan has successfully harnessed its oil resources
to bolster economic growth, increase buffers, and reduce poverty. However, in the face of
recent large and likely long-lasting external shocks―lower oil prices, Russia slowdown, and
corollary exchange rate (ER) movements (ruble depreciation, dollar appreciation)—growth has
decelerated rapidly, financial conditions have tightened, and pressures on the balance of
payments and exchange rate have built up. The shocks have also increased financial sector
vulnerabilities, where nonperforming loans (NPLs), while declining significantly, remain high,
and rising balance sheet risks and tight exchange rate management, have put further drag on
banks’ lending and economic activity. Nevertheless, more recently, and in response to
reduced currency pressures and reduced spreads, the authorities successfully tapped the
international capital markets and widened the ER band.
Focus of consultation and key recommendations: The consultation focused on calibrating
the policy response to address Kazakhstan’s near-term challenges and long-term goals of
becoming a dynamic emerging market economy. Principally, there is need to (i) identify
credible medium-term fiscal consolidation measures to ensure sustainability; (ii) introduce
greater exchange rate flexibility to help the economy absorb current and future external
shocks; (iii) bolster financial sector resilience to limit adverse spillovers back to the real sector;
and (iv) implement structural reforms to ensure durable growth and shared prosperity.
Previous consultation: During the 2014 Article IV Consultation, Directors stressed the
importance of restoring confidence in the post-devaluation environment and further
strengthening the policy frameworks to bolster the economy’s resilience to shocks.
Specifically, Directors (i) urged appropriate supervisory actions to enforce the NPL ceilings
effectively, while ensuring adequate provisions; (ii) highlighted the need to speed up the
introduction of a new policy interest rate instrument; (iii) stressed the need to enhance fiscal
coverage and integration into a consistent macro-fiscal framework; and (iv) noted the priority
of strengthening human capital and institutions, and lowering the role of the state in the
economy. Since then, the authorities’ resolute efforts on lowering NPLs have begun to pay
off, and important early steps have been taken to enhance monetary policy operations, ER
flexibility, and communication. Progress in bolstering the fiscal policy framework, however,
has been slow. The authorities have also embarked on an ambitious structural reform
program and recently completed negotiations to join the WTO within 2015.

CONTEXT
1.
Like other countries in the region, Kazakhstan was hit in 2014 by large external shocks
that are expected to be mostly long lasting. Against the backdrop of these shocks, economic
growth has decelerated sharply, financial conditions have tightened, and external imbalances are
emerging. While both oil prices and the Russian ruble are off their respective lows reached at end2014, improvements in sentiment are tempered by the realization that low oil prices and
uncertainties surrounding the Russian economy are likely to persist.
2.
The authorities’ large stimulus package has helped blunt the initial impact of the
shocks, but recovery will likely be gradual. The stimulus package (“Nulrly Zhulu”), which went into
effect in 2014 and which involves public investment programs supported by multilateral
development banks (MDBs), is partially offsetting the impact of the shocks. The stimulus is enhanced
by a structural reform program aimed at improving the business climate and public sector efficiency.
However, the extent of the shocks, the appreciation of the tenge in real effective terms, and a weak
lending environment could reduce the prospects for quick economic recovery. At the same time,
Kazakhstan’s upcoming accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) could provide a boost to
investor confidence.
3.
President Nazarbayev won early elections overwhelmingly, and has suggested
devolving power to the parliament and the regions. The elections took place on April 26, 2015
(previously scheduled in 2016). The President won reelection with 98 percent of the vote, and has
signaled his interest in strengthening the role of parliament in decision making, including speeding
up the process of transferring new powers to parliament and, through it, to the prime minister. The
“100 steps” reform program announced by the President shortly after his reelection includes a
strong emphasis on decentralization and strengthening the rule of law.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Economic growth has decelerated significantly, but remains positive, as a result of the
external shocks. GDP growth slowed to an annualized 2 percent during the first quarter of 2015,
down from around 4 percent in 2014 and 6 percent in 2013. In addition to weaker external demand,
slower growth was driven by the impact of lower income and profitability (resulting from lower oil
prices) and confidence effects (reflecting regional developments) on private consumption and
domestic investment. Private consumption expanded by 0.5 percent in 2014 (vs. 11.8 percent in
2013), while investment contracted by 3.4 percent (vs. 9 percent growth in 2013). The stimulus
package has helped absorb some of the impact on consumption and investment. In the face of
slowing demand and limited exchange rate movements, headline inflation fell sharply, from
7.4 percent year-on-year at end-2014 to 3.9 percent at end-June, 2015―well below the authorities’
objective range of 6–8 percent. The recorded unemployment rate remained at 5 percent in 2014.
5.
The fiscal stimulus aimed at supporting growth has increased financing needs. The
overall fiscal surplus fell from 5 percent of GDP in 2013 to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2014. Among other
4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

factors, the decline reflects a 1.8 percent of GDP increase in expenditures and net lending (partly
due to the stimulus) and a 0.5 percent of GDP fall in oil revenues. The non-oil fiscal deficit increased
from 6.8 percent of GDP in 2013 to 9.6 percent of GDP in 2014, while the stock of government debt
increased from 12.9 percent of GDP to 14.5 percent of GDP over the same period. On July 14, 2015,
with aim of financing a growing fiscal deficit and in response to reduced spreads in recent months,
the authorities issued $4 billion in 10-year and 30-year global bonds. The issuance was well received
and oversubscribed, with spreads of 285 bps and 335 bps, respectively, over U.S. treasuries.

Monetary conditions have been tight for most of the past year, which have reduced
pressures on the exchange rate recently, but, together with lower economic activity, slowed
lending sharply. During the second half of 2014, due to rapid depreciation of the ruble, heightened
speculation of tenge devaluation, and increased dollarization of bank deposits, domestic money
market interest rates rose significantly. Since early 2015, with the use of overnight currency swap
and repo instruments, the National Bank (NBK) has managed to stabilize money market rates below
10 percent and dampen pressure on the tenge. As a result, and following the successful global bond
issuance, the NBK widened its exchange rate band from 170–188 to 170–198 tenge/dollar, on July
15, 2015. Meanwhile, while Kazakhstan’s sovereign bond spreads have declined somewhat, domestic
lending rates remain elevated and overall private sector credit has grinded to a halt, contracting by
3.5 percent year-on-year as of May 2015 (vs. annualized growth of 6 percent in 2014 and 13 percent
in 2013). Credit conditions are expected to remain anemic in the short term (Box 1 and Annex I).
7.
The external position has weakened largely due to the fall in oil prices. Kazakhstan’s
real effective exchange rate has appreciated over the past year, mainly reflecting the depreciation of
the ruble and sharp appreciation of the U.S. dollar, against which the tenge is managed. The current
account balance turned negative in the second half of 2014, although there has been some
improvement in the first quarter of 2015, in part reflecting the recent appreciation in the ruble and
the rebound in oil prices. Based on a range of approaches used by staff, the tenge could be
considered modestly overvalued by 4–14 percent (Annex II).1 Based on the IMF’s Assessing Reserve
Adequacy (ARA) methodology, NBK’s gross reserves (which exclude the national oil fund) remain
below the suggested adequacy range of 100–150 percent of the ARA composite metric. At the same
time, the oil fund, with an accumulated value of around $75 billion (35 percent of GDP), provides a
significant buffer for the economy as a whole.
8.
Administrative and prudential measures have succeeded in lowering NPLs
significantly, but vulnerabilities in some segments of the financial sector have increased (Box
2 and Annex III). Recent preliminary estimate indicate that NPLs have fallen from 34 percent of
total loans a year ago to 10 percent in July 2015 (preliminary data) following the revocation of BTA’s
banking license—after the bank absorbed all the bad assets of the merged KKB-BTA entity—and the
removal of tax, accounting, and other legal obstacles to write-offs and transfers to special purpose
vehicles (SPVs). NPL write-offs lowered the system-wide capital to risk-weighted assets (CAR)
marginally, from 18 percent at end-2013 to 17 percent at end-2014, still well above the regulatory
1

These estimates, derived from the External Balance Assessment (EBA) methodology and CGER calculations, are
broadly in line with market indicators, e.g., non-deliverable forward (NDF) rates suggest (as of end-June) depreciation
expectations of around 10–15 percent over the next 6–12 months.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

minimum of 12 percent. Nevertheless, some vulnerabilities have increased. In particular, deposit
dollarization and declining lending activity are impacting banks’ profitability and increasing currency
and maturity mismatches. Banks are particularly vulnerable to indirect foreign currency risk, due to
the prevalence of lending to unhedged borrowers. Moreover, despite limits on credit concentration,
lending mostly takes place in a few non-oil sectors that are currently under stress.
9.
Progress has been made in implementing FSAP recommendations (Annex IV). The NBK
has started to undertake bottom-up stress tests for banks. The authorities have also revised
legislation to exclude the requirement for depositor and creditor approval in P&A and bridge bank
resolution. They are initiating discussions with bank supervisors in other jurisdictions to strengthen
cross-border supervision. The authorities have also made legislative amendments to implement
recommendations in the insurance sector and on pensions, and drafted a law to address regulatory
shortcomings in the securities market. Progress, however, has been limited in adopting risk-based
assessment tools and extending supervision beyond compliance with prudential norms.
10.
The authorities have embarked on an ambitious structural reform program, bolstered
by extensive MDB engagement. Public investment under the Nurly Zhulu program aims to
address infrastructure bottlenecks and generate jobs. Moreover, following the recent Presidential
election, the authorities have launched a wide ranging reform program (“100 steps”) aimed at
improving the efficiency of public administration and the rule of law, diversifying the economy, and
addressing governance challenges. MDBs’ increased engagement strengthens the structural reform
component of the authorities’ crisis response, with projects targeting the labor market, civil service
and public expenditure reforms, business climate improvements, and support to small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In June, 2015, Kazakhstan completed negotiations to become a
formal member of the WTO.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
The growth outlook has weakened, with predominantly downside external risks
(Annex V). Staff projects real GDP growth to decelerate to 2 percent this year despite the fiscal
stimulus. Weaker demand from Russia and China, lower oil prices, confidence effects, and continuing
delays in the Kashagan oil field are the main factors behind the projected slowdown. Next year,
growth is projected to pick up to 3.25 percent driven by a gradual recovery in oil prices and output,
and improved external demand. Still, the medium-term growth outlook is less favorable than
projected last year, in light of lower projected medium-term oil prices and continued slow growth in
Russia. Staff now estimates potential growth at around 4.75 percent (vs. previous estimates of
5.5-6 percent). Against this backdrop, staff has also cut its headline inflation forecasts to 5.2 percent
this year and 6 percent over the medium term (from 6 percent and 7 percent, respectively). The
current account is expected to gradually improve in the coming years, due to a projected increase in
oil exports once Kashagan comes on line, but remain in small deficit over the medium term.
Downside risks to the growth outlook are mainly external and related to oil prices and regional
uncertainty, although the recent improvements in the outlook for oil prices and the Russian
economy lessen the tail risks. The authorities’ real GDP growth projection for 2015 is 1.5 percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

For the medium term, the authorities broadly shared staff’s outlook, but viewed the risks as more
balanced, including because of the recent stability in oil prices and the Russian ruble.
12.
Under an adverse scenario, with further decline in oil prices, anemic growth and larger
imbalances could persist over the medium term. In a downside scenario, where oil prices are
assumed to decline by 25 percent (permanently)2 relative to staff’s baseline projections, growth rates
are expected to remain below potential in the medium term. While the deviation from baseline
growth is not large, the adverse cumulative impact on the current account, FX reserves, fiscal
balance, and public debt is more severe.

Given its limited depth and scope, the domestic credit market has had a modest impact on economic
activity. Analysis of quarterly credit data since 2004 reveals some correlation between credit growth and
non-oil economic activity and no clear causality. The correlation is stronger in the run up to 2007/2008 crisis
as the real estate bubble inflated. Given the limited scope of the credit market the main causality chain may
run from oil prices through the economy to credit growth. (Annex I).
Recent developments
Credit growth slowed significantly over 2014 and so far in 2015. Overall bank credit to the private
sector in May 2015 was lower by 3.5 percent in nominal terms relative to a year ago with a shift from foreign
to national currency loans and from corporate to individual borrowers.
The slowdown in credit is exacerbated by high interest rates, tight domestic liquidity, dollarization,
and, to a lesser extent, prudential policies on unsecured consumer lending. Weighted average interest
rates on tenge loans to corporations jumped from 10 percent at the end of 2013 to 18 percent during

Box 1. Credit Intermediation and Economic Growth in Kazakhstan (Concluded)
2015Q1. Broad money (M2) shrank by 8 percent in 2014 and a further 2 percent in 2015 mainly due to
dollarization of deposits. Dollarization is increasing currency risks (Box 3), further deterring lending. Tight
domestic liquidity, high interest rates and dollarization are byproducts of a tightly managed exchange rate
in the context of high devaluation expectations. Prudential measures enacted in 2013 to limit the growth of
unsecured consumer credit also contributed to the slowdown.
The NPL overhang at 24 percent continues to restrict the banks’ ability to extend credit. Trade and
services account for the highest share of NPLs (25 percent). The share of NPLs to total credit outstanding
remains highest in construction, at almost 40 percent.

Staff expects credit to contract by

grow moderately, by 3.7 percent, in
2016. The forecast is broadly consistent
with economic developments, taking into
consideration the limiting factors described

above. The IMF Macro-financial Forecast Consistency Template (Annex I) indicates that projected credit
growth is broadly consistent with growth in other relevant variables.
Credit activity is likely to remain concentrated in trade and consumer lending. The prospect of a
slowdown in real income growth could threaten these sectors and by extension private consumption.
Despite the weak link between credit and growth, anemic credit could trigger second round effects
on economic activity and asset prices, further weakening banks’ balance sheets. Credit is essential for
private sector led growth and diversification. The government’s program aimed at extending
tenge 500 billion of subsidized loans to SME’s of which Tenge 250 billion have been disbursed so far seeks
to mitigate the impact of tight credit on the economy. MDBs, including the ADB, are carrying out similar
programs. It is too early to measure the impact of these programs. To reverse the fall in credit and
strengthen the link between credit and growth it is necessary to address the key obstacle to growth: tight
liquidity, high levels of NPL and lack of access to finance.

Box 2. Lower Oil Prices and Financial Sector Vulnerabilities
As an oil exporting economy, lower oil prices have a negative impact on Kazakhstan’s financial sector and on
economic activity more generally. This box describes the solvency stress test that was performed on
Kazakhstan’s banks to assess the impact on bank solvency of two shocks: lower oil prices and exchange rate
depreciation. Stress tests on bank balance sheets as of end 2014 (latest available) reveal that the banking
system is in a weak position to withstand shocks, particularly severe shocks. In the baseline, before any shocks
are applied, three banks have capital adequacy ratios (CAR) below the regulatory minimum of 12 percent. The
downside scenario would have the same 3 banks below the regulatory minimum. The severe scenario,
however, would bring 17 banks (89 percent of banking system assets) below the regulatory minimum, and
recapitalization needs would amount to 3 percent of GDP. The results are subject to the usual uncertainties
associated with this type of tests.
The assumptions underlying the stress test are:
i)

In the baseline scenario, estimates of oil prices reflect the WEO baseline, and real GDP growth and the
exchange rate are based on staff’s macroeconomic projections. The projections assume further
weakening in oil prices from the current $62.8pb to $58.9pb. Real GDP growth moderates from
4.3 percent in 2014, to 2 percent in 2015 and rises to 4.4 percent by 2019. The exchange rate
depreciates from 179.2 (tenge/dollar) in 2014 to 185.8 in 2015 and to 188 by 2019 (i.e., within the
current tenge/dollar exchange rate band).

ii)

In the downside scenario, a 0.5 historical standard deviation on the oil price is assumed. Under this
scenario, oil prices fall to $43.2pb in 2015 and $48.6bp in 2016. Real GDP grows by 1.2 percent in
2015 and by 2.7 percent in 2016. The exchange rate is subjected to a 1.5 standard deviation shock,
which implies a depreciation to 198 in 2015 and to 200.5 in 2016. The larger standard deviation shock
on the exchange rate compared to oil prices mimics the large currency swings during periods of stress.

iii) In the severe scenario, a 1.2 standard deviation from the baseline is assumed. Oil prices fall to $21.3pb in
2015 and $26.7pb in 2017. Real GDP grows by 0.1 percent in 2015 and by 2 percent in 2016. The
exchange rate is subjected to a 3.5 standard deviation shock, which puts it at 15.5 percent depreciation
from the current level in 2015. It depreciates to 215 in 2015 and to 217 in 2016.
The historical relationship between macroeconomic variables and NPLs is analyzed using a vector
autoregression (VAR) model. The variables included in the VAR model are: the ratio of NPLs to total loans
(NPL), the percent change in the oil price, Kazakhstan’s real GDP growth, partner countries’ real GDP growth,
and the tenge/dollar exchange rate. Unit root and lag length tests were performed and adjustments made
accordingly. The model was estimated on quarterly data from 2000 to 2014. The relationship shows that
NPLs respond to shocks in macroeconomic variables. NPLs are most sensitive to changes in domestic
activity, followed by the exchange rate and oil prices A percentage point increase in real GDP growth results
in a 0.318 percentage point decline in NPLs; a percentage point increase in the oil price results in a
0.006 percentage point decline in NPLs; a percentage point increase (depreciation) in the exchange rate
results in a 0.047 percentage point increase in NPLs. Single equation estimation shows similar but slightly
larger coefficients on the exchange rate and oil prices.
The tests simulated balance sheets and profit/loss accounts for the individual banks given the NPL
forecasts upon applying the effects of the shocks. In the simulation, liabilities are held constant. Given
that historical balance sheet data are not available to staff, interest margins on current loans and liabilities,

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

Box 2. Lower Oil Prices and Financial Sector Vulnerabilities (Concluded)
as well as net non-interest income are based on 2014 data. Given that estimates of collateral are unreliable,
new NPLs are assumed to be provisioned for at 100 percent. This further dents profits. When net income is
positive, the test assumes that 80 percent of profits are retained and the rest is paid out as dividends. A
bank accumulates capital buffers when its capital ratio declined in the previous year. Capital covers the loss
when net income is negative.
The results reveal that a number of banks are unable to withstand higher NPLs due the shocks
described above. No adjustments were made on capital to take into account of the phase-out of capital
instruments ineligible under Basel III as was done in the FSAP. Even without this adjustment, banks are still
highly susceptible, especially in the face of severe shocks. The results are presented in the table below. The
downside scenario brings system CAR down to 16 percent while the severe scenario brings it down to
6 percent, well below the regulatory minimum. Banks have low levels of profitability, thus, a low buffer
against shocks. An exchange rate only shock of a 15.5 percent depreciation from the current level results in
10 banks being below regulatory CAR, while a 25 percent depreciation results in 17 banks below regulatory
CAR. A reverse stress test reveals that an increase in NPLs by 16 percent brings the system wide CAR to the
regulatory minimum of 12 percent (assuming a 70 percent level of provisioning). At this level, 6 banks would

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
Policy discussions centered on the near-term policy response needed to revive the
economy and the progress in strengthening policy frameworks. Regarding the short run, staff’s
assessment is that (i) the fiscal stimulus is justified on countercyclical grounds, provided credible
medium-term consolidation measures are identified; (ii) the tight monetary policy stance, which
helped reduce pressure on the exchange rate, may need to be loosened in view of rapidly falling
inflationary pressures; (iii) further steps are needed to lower NPLs and bolster financial sector

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

resilience; and (iv) more rapid implementation of structural reforms is needed. As for the longer run,
staff highlighted the imperative of further bolstering the macroeconomic policy architecture to help
the economy absorb current and future shocks and to ensure durable growth and shared prosperity.
The authorities agreed with the staff on the proposed short-term policy response and broadly
shared the view on the need to enhance macroeconomic policy frameworks.

A. Fiscal Policy
14.
The fiscal stimulus is tailored to support growth. The 3–5 year Economic Support
Package introduced last year includes $12 billion (5.8 percent of GDP) spending from the National
Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK) and $7 billion (2.9 percent of GDP) in loans contracted
from Multinational Development Banks (MDBs) (see table). The package is aimed at modernizing
critical infrastructure, promoting SME lending via quasi-fiscal development institutions, and
recapitalizing the PLF. While the large stimulus come at the expense of higher current account
deficit and lower reserves in the oil fund, staff supported the package, given its’ growth-enhancing,
countercyclical, structural, and frontloaded nature. It also urged the authorities to ensure
transparency and high quality spending and welcomed the involvement of MDBs in monitoring and
selecting the investment projects.
15.
The authorities agreed with staff that medium-term fiscal consolidation should be an
essential component for the success of the fiscal stimulus. Given the size of the stimulus, a
credible medium-term plan, especially on the revenue side, is needed to ensure fiscal sustainability.
Assuming unchanged policies, total revenues are expected to decline from 23.8 percent of GDP in
2014 to 19.7 percent of GDP

to decline only gradually to
8.7 percent of GDP in 2020, or around 3 percentage points of GDP higher than staff’s estimated
sustainable level of 5.5 percent of GDP. To close the projected gap, the authorities have suggested
improvements in tax administration and unspecified large cuts in expenditures (equivalent to
5 percentage points of GDP over three years) that are not based on concrete measures. Staff
suggested that to maintain a reasonable and credible path for expenditures, and in view of relatively
low tax revenue as a share of GDP, the authorities should aim at raising the revenue base through
implementing measures such as (i) strengthening the enforcement of tax collection; (ii) reducing tax
exemptions; including in the Special Economic Zones; and (iii) making income tax rates more
progressive.
16.
To support fiscal transparency and ensure medium-term sustainability, staff
emphasized the urgent need to further strengthen fiscal accounting and the fiscal policy
framework. While important steps have been taken in improving fiscal coverage, more work is

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

needed to bolster the quality of fiscal accounting (Annex VI). Concerns remain regarding the
treatment of the oil fund transactions, some revenue and expenditure items, and the definition of
the fiscal anchor. Staff underscored the need for bringing fiscal accounts into compliance with the
GFS 2001 manual, particularly in the context of the fiscal consolidation strategy. The authorities
agreed to consider staff’s recommendations and if necessary request TA in this area.
17.
Public debt is expected to rise in the medium term, with increased international
borrowing, but overall levels would remain relatively low. To help finance the fiscal deficit, the
government has requested a $2 billion Development Policy Loan from the World Bank and $1 billion
Countercyclical Support Facility from the Asian Development Bank. In addition to borrowing from
MDBs and domestic debt issuance, the authorities noted their plans to tap international capital
markets again this year when external market conditions allowed. The first such issuance took place
on July 14. The global issuance also aims at helping build a yield curve in the absence of a wellfunctioning domestic debt market. According to staff’s calculations and assuming unchanged
policies, the general government’s external debt is expected to rise from 3.8 percent of GDP at end2014 to 6.4 percent of GDP by 2020. At the same time, total government debt is projected to
increase from 14.5 percent in 2014 to 30.7 percent in 2020 (Annex VII).

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
18.
Tight monetary policy has helped lower inflation, but the authorities concurred with
staff that weak output and credit growth require caution about allowing market interest rates
to remain too high for long periods. In view of rapidly declining inflationary pressures, subdued
output growth, and weak lending conditions, the authorities are carefully evaluating the tradeoffs
between the need for a tightening bias to contain the pressure on the currency and the goal of
reviving lending and economic activity and stabilizing inflation around its objective range. Staff also
urged efforts to avoiding periodic heightened volatility in money market interest rates.
19.
The authorities have taken important steps to overhaul the monetary policy
framework in support of inflation targeting. These steps include strengthening communication,
preparing the grounds for the imminent introduction of new policy interest rate instruments, and
enhancing governance. In particular, the recently published monetary policy guidelines for 2015 and
2020 stress the planned introduction of a new policy interest rate, supported by open market
operations, during the early phase of the transition to inflation targeting, which the authorities see
adopting within 3–5 years. The NBK has also recognized the need to strengthen its governance
structure, including by setting up a monetary policy committee (MPC) and achieving greater central
bank independence in policy decision making. Moreover, the NBK plans to establish a money
market committee responsible for the implementation of monetary policy, including the daily
assessment of banking sector liquidity conditions and interbank market developments. Staff noted
that modernizing the monetary policy framework will also help the recently announced plans to
develop Astana as an international financial center.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

20.
Staff has stressed the need to gradually introduce greater exchange rate flexibility in
tandem with improving monetary policy instruments, while avoiding a step-devaluation. Staff
emphasized that greater exchange rate flexibility would (i) support a more independent interest rate
policy; and (ii) help reduce imbalances. Staff supported the NBK’s opposition to another outright
step-devaluation, given that previous episodes resulted in increased dollarization, re-fixing the
exchange rate, and further expectation of devaluation. A large devaluation would also put
immediate stress on private-sector balance sheets of unhedged FX borrowers (Box 3). In contrast, a
gradual adjustment would give banks more time to address balance-sheet vulnerabilities, while
correcting the exchange rate misalignment over time. In view of this, staff considered that greater
flexibility could initially be introduced by gradually widening the exchange rate band, with the aim
of removing it altogether when conditions allow.
21.
The authorities agreed that greater flexibility would support the reform efforts
underway and alleviate imbalances. In light of this, and given reduced pressures on the tenge in
recent months, on July 15 the NBK widened its exchange rate band from 170-188 to
170-198 tenge/dollar. To ensure stability, the authorities also agreed to communicate their plans
consistently and credibly and continue to strengthen monetary policy instruments.

C. Financial Policies
22.
Staff and the authorities broadly concurred on the need to bolster financial sector
resilience. Staff noted the progress made in halting the surge in uncollateralized consumer loans
seen in recent years. However, three banks have capital below the regulatory minimum and banks’
balance sheets appear to be highly sensitive to shocks. Supervision should be strengthened and
corrective actions be taken for the undercapitalized banks to bring their capital above the regulatory
minimum. Furthermore, staff urged the authorities to shore up system strength by developing plans
to bring capital up to shock resilient levels and improve governance and risk management to help
reduce risks. There was agreement that exchange rate risk remains a concern for the banking
system, especially given corporate sector exposure. Further, credit concentration remains high. Staff
recommended introducing higher risk weights or exposure caps on corporate lending; reducing (or
prohibiting) FX lending to unhedged borrowers; and tightening net open position (NOP) limits to
mitigate exchange rate risk (Box 3 and Annex VIII). The authorities are considering raising risk
weights on loans denominated in foreign currency to help reduce banks’ exposure to indirect
foreign currency risk. However, they consider the current limit on the NOP to be sufficient in
minimizing on-balance sheet currency mismatches and do not see the need to limit or prohibit
lending to unhedged borrowers as this, in their view, will curtail lending. Staff shared the concern
about the need to avoid undermining an already weak lending environment but stressed the
consequences of excessive lending to unhedged borrowers. Staff also urged the authorities to
enhance the quality of data on corporate and household balance sheets to allow for a more
informed assessment of balance-sheet vulnerabilities. The authorities agreed to further assess
vulnerabilities and argued that they are monitoring bank soundness.

23.
There was agreement that further reduction of NPLs, especially of the newly merged
KKB-BTA entity, is a necessary condition to improving banking sector soundness. Staff
welcomed the efforts underway to reduce the level of system NPLs, including the efforts to achieve
the 10 percent ceiling by end-2015. But it expressed concern that NPL provisioning may be
overstated because it relies on underlying loan collateral that is overstated—mainly real estate that
has not yet recovered from the 2009 bubble bust—and is not regularly revalued. Staff also
welcomed the refocus of NPL resolution at the merged KKB-BTA entity, which accounts for
70 percent of the universe of NPLs and about 25 percent of banking system assets. In this regard,
staff advised that the authorities develop a broad strategy to address the factors that resulted in
weaknesses in these banks, including conducting an asset quality review (AQR) of the merged bank.
The strategy should address the restructuring of the bank to ensure long-term viability and how any
capital needs identified by the AQR will be addressed. Regulatory and supervisory standards should
also be improved, and consideration should be given to sequencing of reforms with the AQR, and
the specific standards against which the banks will be assessed.
24.
Staff welcomed progress made in implementing FSAP recommendations. It urged for
further progress in adopting risk-based assessment tools and supervision, which remains oriented
toward compliance. The NBK prefers to maintain the current supervisory approach for the time
being. The authorities plan to continue making progress toward finalizing legislative amendments in
insurance, pensions, and the securities market.
Box 3. Macroprudential Policies in Kazakhstan
Reducing exchange rate risk: Exchange rate risk remains one of the largest risks for the banking sector. FX
risks are especially elevated in the corporate sector—the largest borrowers from the banking system—where
leverage and the net open FX position to equity are very high. This sector has also experienced a significant
slowdown in activity and is associated with already high NPLs to the banking system. To help limit risks
emanating from high exposure to the corporate sector, the NBK should consider introducing risk weights or
exposure caps for corporate exposures. This will help the banking system withstand corporate credit losses
by building capital buffers (see IMF Staff Guidance on Macroprudential Policy). Risk weights can help build
buffers by affecting the supply of credit indirectly while FX exposure caps curtail the supply of credit directly.
Reducing FX lending to borrowers whose earnings are not in FX should also be considered. This can be
done through higher risk weights on such exposures. Tighter net open position limits are recommended to
help reduce exchange rate risk.
Reducing credit risk: Even with concentration limits, credit concentration remains a significant risk to
financial stability. Though concentrated large exposures have fallen from levels during the global financial
crisis, at 208 percent of capital, they remain large. In 2014, the construction sector received the largest share
of new corporate sector credit (24 percent) while it also had the largest share of new NPLs (41 percent,
rising from 15 percent the previous year). The NBK should restrict bank exposures to single counterparties
or groups of connected counterparties.
Proper implementation and enforcement of macroprudential tools is critical. Inconsistent
implementation of macroprudential measures, as has been in the past, could add to regulatory uncertainty
and result in ineffective incentive structures and a loss in confidence in the domestic financial system.

D. Structural Reforms
25.
The authorities recognized that the recent shocks to the economy reinforce the
urgency of implementing structural reforms, to ensure durable long-term growth and shared
prosperity. Diversification away from the extractive industry and the reduction of the state footprint
in the economy are necessary to sustain improvements in public welfare and to help create jobs for
the growing population. Addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, strengthening human capital,
building institutions, bolstering the rule of law, enhancing financial intermediation, and improving
business climate have been identified by both the authorities and development partners as key
areas where further improvements are essential to achieve broad and inclusive growth. The
authorities’ approach of working with MDB’s to implement public spending and structural reforms
should ensure greater efficiency and focus on priority areas. Staff also noted that additional efforts
were needed to reverse the slowdown in key social indicators and protect the most vulnerable from
the impact of the economic slowdown. Despite the authorities’ declared commitment to ring fence
social spending, budget cuts aimed at creating space for capital spending are adversely affecting
key social programs (Annex IX).
26.
The public investment and reform program offers an opportunity to balance the shortterm need for countercyclical state intervention and the long term goal of private sector-led
growth. Staff stressed that public investment should focus on areas beyond the reach of the private
sector without expanding the state’s footprint in the economy. Moreover, staff noted that reforms
aimed at improving the business climate should include easing liquidity constraints and improving
access to finance. The authorities’ focus on large scale infrastructure projects and the SME
subsidized loan program helps in this regard.

STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
Amid slower economic growth, tighter financial conditions, and emerging imbalances,
policies should balance ensuring sustainability while alleviating the impact of shocks in the
near term. In recent years the authorities have successfully harnessed oil resources to bolster
economic growth and build buffers. However, economic growth has now decelerated largely as a
result of likely long-lasting external shocks and is expected to remain subdued this year and next
year. Moreover, the outlook for growth is subject to predominantly downside external risks. In view
of weaker growth, the large and likely long-lasting nature of the shocks, and the accumulated
buffers, the policy response in the short term should be geared toward supporting the economic
recovery. Over the medium term, there is a need to further strengthen macroeconomic policy
frameworks, to bolster resilience to shocks and promote durable growth.
28.
To ensure fiscal sustainability, the stimulus must be accompanied by credible mediumterm fiscal consolidation and more transparent fiscal policy framework. The stimulus is justified
on countercyclical grounds and is appropriately frontloaded and tailored to support growth.
However, to ensure a sustainable path for the non-oil deficit, the stimulus must be accompanied by
16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

credible medium-term consolidation measures, especially on the revenue side. In particular, there is
scope to strengthen the enforcement of tax collection, reduce tax exemptions, including in the
Special Economic Zones, and make income tax rates more progressive. Moreover, enhancing the
fiscal policy framework is critical to ensuring transparency and medium-term sustainability. Key
priorities include expanding the budget coverage to all fiscal activity, in line with GFSM 2001, and
integrating fiscal policy into a broader macroeconomic policy framework.
29.
Greater exchange rate flexibility in tandem with the introduction of new monetary
policy instruments is needed to enhance the policy architecture and address imbalances. The
authorities have taken confidence-building measures to overhaul the monetary policy framework in
support of their medium-term goal of adopting inflation targeting, and have widened the exchange
rate band. However, with the aim of more effectively managing liquidity and signaling the stance of
policy, the authorities should speed up the planned introduction of a new policy interest rate,
supported by open market operations. Moreover, strengthening the policy architecture requires
further exchange rate flexibility, which will support a more independent interest rate policy and help
reduce imbalances. To avoid undermining financial stability, and anchor expectations about policy
intentions and operations, the authorities should communicate their plans openly and consistently.
30.
In view of rising vulnerabilities, further actions are needed to bolster financial sector
resilience. Efforts underway to reduce the level of NPLs are paying off. However, more needs to be
done to bring down the level of NPLs to sustainable levels, while ensuring that the achievement of
the 10 percent prudential ceiling by end-2015 does not compromise proper loan classification and
provisioning. In this regard, while the recent plans to refocus the NPL resolution framework at the
merged KKB-BTA entity is appropriate, weaknesses in the bank should be addressed and an asset
quality review be undertaken within a broad strategy to ensure long-term viability. Strengthening
financial sector resilience also requires introducing higher risk weights or exposure caps on
corporate lending, limiting FX lending to unhedged borrowers, and tightening net open position
limits to mitigate credit risk. Further steps in implementing the FSAP recommendations include
adopting risk-based assessment tools and supervision and finalizing legislative amendments in
insurance, pensions, and the securities market.
31.
The structural reform agenda is appropriately ambitious, but effective implementation
is essential to achieving sustainable and inclusive growth. Priority areas include strengthening
human capital, building institutions, bolstering the rule of law, enhancing financial intermediation,
and improving the business climate. Close collaboration with MDBs in these areas should facilitate
greater efficiency in the procurement and implementation process. Moreover, diversification away
from the oil sector and the reduction of the state footprint in the economy are necessary conditions
to ensuring successful implementation of the broader private-sector-led growth strategy.
32.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Annex I. Credit Intermediation and Economic Growth in
Kazakhstan
1.
Examination of quarterly credit and GDP data for the past ten years shows comovement of credit and non-oil GDP growth. Within that dynamic, nominal credit growth
outstripped nonoil GDP growth up to the global financial crisis and lagged behind ever since. As a
result, financial deepening turned into disintermediation from 2007.

2.
However, a causal link from credit to non-oil GDP is difficult to discern. Unrestricted
VAR of log credit and log non-oil GDP (quarterly data) with a 4 period lag reveals no causality in
either direction. The addition of key exogenous, variables such as the oil price and a dummy for the
financial crisis does not improve the outcome. The results are consistent with available information.
The credit boom in the run up to the financial crisis was driven by wholesale funds from abroad
feeding a real estate bubble. Dynamics in the credit market since 2008 have been dominated by the
legacy of the crisis especially the NPL overhang.
3.
Credit is found to have a marginal impact on non-oil GDP growth. To examine the
relationship between credit and growth we fitted a regression with the following specification:
LNGDP_XO=C+αLCREIDT_N+βNGDPXO(-4)+γDUM+u

The weak link between credit and growth can be explained by the shallowness and
compartmentalization of the credit sector. The chart below depicts the various segments of the

Annex II. Assessment of Kazakhstan’s External Position1
Kazakhstan’s external position has weakened over the past year. This assessment is based on
(i) growing estimated exchange rate misalignment; (ii) widening current account deficit; and
(iii) worsening reserves-adequacy position.
1.
Staff assesses the real exchange rate as modestly overvalued. The real effective
exchange rate has appreciated over the past year, mainly reflecting the depreciation of the ruble
and sharp appreciation of the U.S. dollar, against which the tenge is tightly managed. Based on
staff’s estimates and projections, the misalignment is judged to be in the range of 4–14 percent
depending on what approach is used. The estimates are naturally subject to methodological
uncertainties and data limitations. Based on the Fund’s External Balance Assessment (EBA-lite)
methodology, the tenge’s real effective exchange rate is viewed as overvalued by around 14 percent
(Table 1). The EBA-lite analysis reflects values for the cyclically adjusted fiscal balance, consistent
with medium-term sustainability, and other policy values (e.g., private credit/GDP and the capital
control index) that are consistent with established international benchmarks. Based on CGER
calculations, the tenge is assessed as overvalued in the range of 4–14 percent (Table 2). The
authorities, in contrast, do not view the exchange rate as significantly overvalued, in light of last
year’s devaluation and the recent rebound in oil prices and Russian ruble appreciation. Moreover,
they point out that, given the high volatility of the ruble and the predominantly speculative nature
of local money markets, any estimated misalignment should be considered with a great deal of
caution. The authorities expect the misalignment to disappear by end-2015.

The current account position is expected to worsen in the near term. The current
account deficit during the first quarter of 2015 was 0.5 percent of GDP―smaller than previously
expected. Still, given the external backdrop (lower oil prices, slowing external demand, strong
tenge), staff projects a current account deficit of around 3½ percent of GDP for the full year and
3 percent of GDP next year. Moreover, following sustained current account surpluses in earlier years,
the current account position is only expected to gradually improve and remain in small deficit over
the medium term. Similarly, Kazakhstan’s international investment position is expected to decline
over the coming years.

NBK’s reserves have been under pressure, while the oil fund remains large. Based on
the IMF ARA methodology, central bank gross reserves (i.e., excluding the national oil fund) remain
below the suggested adequacy range of 100–150 percent, and are also below those in emerging
markets and CCA peers (Panel Figure). Moreover, while headline gross reserves figures have been
stable in recent months (around $29 billion), reserves include increased FX swaps and banks’
correspondent accounts with the NBK (the latter reflects the sharp increase in the dollarization of
bank deposits). At the same time, the oil fund, with an accumulated value of around $75 billion
(35 percent of GDP), provides a significant buffer for the economy as a whole.

The Assessing Reserve Adequacy (ARA) Metric captures the adequacy of central bank reserves in terms of GDP and
balance of payments developments, including imports, portfolio and other investment liabilities, and short-term
external debt (at remaining maturity). Since Kazakhstan falls into the group of resource dependent countries with oil
exports exceeding 50 percent of GDP, this suggests the need for higher buffers to reflect the added volatility in oil
prices. Recalculating the ARA metric with oil prices one standard-deviation lower than currently projected results in a
wider shortfall from the adequacy threshold.

Annex III. Kazakhstan: Stress Testing the Banking System1
As an oil exporting economy, lower oil prices have a negative impact on Kazakhstan’s financial sector
and on economic activity more generally. This annex describes the solvency stress test that was
performed on Kazakhstan banks to assess the impact on bank solvency of two shocks: lower oil prices
and exchange rate depreciation. Real GDP growth responds to oil prices given elasticity from staff’s
macroeconomic framework. Stress tests on bank balance sheets as of end 2014 (latest available) reveal
that the banking system is in a weak position to withstand shocks. In the baseline, before any shocks
are applied, three banks have capital adequacy ratios (CAR) below the regulatory minimum of
12 percent. The downside scenario has 3 banks below the regulatory minimum. In the severe scenario,
17 banks (89 percent of banking system assets) do not meet regulatory minimum standards and
recapitalization needs amount to 3 percent of GDP. The 2014 FSAP also found the banking system
unable to withstand shocks (tail risks) based on stress tests on balance sheets as of end 2013. However,
system resilience to shocks has decreased further with weaker of bank balance sheets in an
environment of low domestic activity and profitability, and the legacy of high nonperforming loans
(NPLs) that continue to hamper credit.

A. Insights from the 2014 FSAP Stress Tests
1.

The tests showed that banks are in a weak position to withstand shocks:



The initial baseline was adjusted to take account of the 2014 exchange rate devaluation and the
phase-out of capital instruments ineligible under Basel III. This adjustment resulted in 7 banks
(accounting for nearly half of the system’s assets) failing to meet regulatory minimum with a
capital shortfall equivalent to 2½ percent of GDP.



In the Stress scenarios, two additional banks failed to meet capital requirements, bringing the
total to 9 banks accounting for slightly more than half of the banking system’s assets. Under the
more severe scenario, the capital deficiency reaches 5 percent of GDP. An oil price shock with
prices at $40 per barrel (pb), assessed in combination with the risk of lower-than-anticipated
growth potential in emerging markets—especially in Russia and China resulted in a decline in
real GDP of 9 percentage points over two years, corresponding to a one-standard deviation
move in two-year cumulative growth, or the highest decline registered since the break-up of the
Soviet Union. Nine banks failed to meet the regulatory minima.



The stress tests revealed the main risks to be foreign exchange (FX) and concentration risks.
The exchange rate was found to be a key driver of indirect credit risk for both the corporate and
the household/SME sectors, and oil prices are also important determinants of corporate credit
quality. Direct FX risk, however, appeared low due to the cap on open positions. Concentration
risk, measured by the impact of a default of the largest 3 exposures of each bank, was found to
be high as capital ratios fell by around 7 percentage points from their baseline level. 11 banks

(about a third of the banking system’s total assets) would breach current regulatory minimum
requirements if their 3 largest exposures defaulted. Sovereign and other market risks were found
to be low.


Despite weaknesses in some banks, Kazakh banks on aggregate were found sufficiently liquid.

B. The Outcome in 2014
The FSAP stress test’s oil price assumption was partially realized in 2014 but other
assumptions did not quite materialize. As a result only three, rather than seven, banks breached
the regulatory minimum capital:

The oil price shock during the FSAP was assessed in combination with weaker economic activity
to a recession and a large depreciation of the exchange rate. In actuality, economic activity was
stronger and exchange rate depreciation less. Further, the oil price decline took place in the
second half of 2014 and the impact feeding through other macroeconomic variables had not
materialized fully as of end-2014.

1996

While oil prices declined and reached below $40pb briefly in the second half of 2014, the
average oil price for the year was high at
Petroleum Oil Spot Price, 1995-2014
$96.2pb, compared with the FSAP
(U.S. Dollars)
assumption of $40pb for the year. This was 120

the past 20 years. Thus, the overall impact

on macroeconomic variables and NPLs was

moderate compared to that assessed by
the stress tests. At end-2014, 3 banks

below $40pb on 10 of the last 20 years, and even below $20pb in 1995 and 1998.



3.
Banks balance sheets, however, still weakened in 2014. Capital adequacy declined as
profitability weakened but also given that banks began writing off NPLs that were not well
provisioned for. Bank profitability declined and banks’ level of provisioning for NPLs also dropped
(from 83 to 80 percent of NPLs). Provisioning estimates include collateral. In Kazakhstan, collateral is
mostly real estate—a sector that experienced a bubble burst in 2009 and is yet to recover. Banks do
no regularly revalue collateral and estimates are still largely based on high prices. This results in an
overestimation of provisioning and, thus, the strenght of bank balance sheets. As a consequence of
the adverse developments over the last year, the impact of the FSAP stress scenario would now be
even higher than in 2014.

4.
The distribution of CARs among banks is quite wide. In the baseline—before shocks are
applied—three banks are below the 12 percent CAR minimum while several banks are close to it.
There are also a number of banks with CAR far above the minimum. In addition to being close to the
minimum CAR, a number of banks also have low levels of profitability. Banks would normally use
profits as the first line of defense before dipping into capital. When profits are low, shocks have a
larger impact on capital. The environment of a large level of non-performing loans in the banking
system (23 percent in May, down from 34 percent a year ago) and weak economic activity
(economic growth at 2 percent in the first quarter of 2015, down from 4 percent in 2014 and
6 percent in 2013) has reduced bank profitability. NPLs declined further in July to 13 percent with
the revocation of BTA bank’s banking license. One bank has a negative return on assets (ROA)—a
measure how well bank management is employing the bank’s assets to make a profit. About
19 banks are below the 1.5 percent level of ROA that banks generally strive to achieve.

C. The Updated Solvency Stress Test
The solvency stress test assesses the impact of lower oil price, an exchange rate
depreciation, and weak economic activity on bank solvency. The assessment of solvency risk is
top-down (as was the case in the FSAP) given that bottom-up bank level stress tests are not
available. The baseline scenario is based on the latest World Economic Outlook assumptions and
projections as well as desk estimations and projections of macroeconomic variables (real GDP and
exchange rate for Kazakhstan). The historical relationship between macroeconomic variables and
NPLs is analyzed using a vector autoregression (VAR) model. Single equation estimation is also
undertaken to assess robustness. Three scenarios are considered: baseline, downside, and severe;
over 2015 to 19 and they are presented below:
5.



Baseline scenario: In the baseline scenario, estimates of oil are the WEO baseline and real GDP
growth and the exchange rate are based on staff’s macroeconomic projections. The projections
assume further weakening in oil prices from the current $62.8pb to $58.9pb. Real GDP growth
moderates from 4.3 percent in 2014, to 2 percent in 2015 and rises to 4.4 percent by 2019.
The exchange rate depreciates from 179.2.4 in 2014 to 185.8 in 2015 and to 188 by 2019.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN



Downside Scenario: In the downside scenario, a 0.5 historical standard deviation on the oil price
is assumed in. Oil prices fall to $43.2pb in 2015 and $48.6bp in 2016. Real GDP grows by
1.2 percent in 2015 and improves to 2.7 percent in 2016. The exchange rate is subjected to a
1.5 standard deviation shock, which puts it at 6.6 percent depreciation from the current level. It
depreciates to 198 in 2015 and to 200.5 in 2016. The larger standard deviation shock on the
exchange rate compared to oil prices mimics the large currency swings during periods of stress.



Severe Scenario: In the severe scenario, a 1.2 standard deviation from the baseline is assumed.
Oil prices fall to $21.3pb in 2015 and $26.7pb in 2017 and go back to the baseline in 2017. Real
GDP grows by 0.1 percent in 2015 and rises to 2 percent in 2016. The exchange rate is subjected
to a 3.5 standard deviation shock, which puts it at 15.5 percent depreciation from the current
level in 2015. It depreciates to 215 in 2015 and worsening to 217 in 2016.

The Macroeconomic Model
A VAR model is used to assess the response of NPLs to macroeconomic variables,
which is used in turn to assess the impact of changes in NPLs (in response to macroeconomic
variables) on bank solvency. The variables included in the model are: the ratio of NPLs to total
loans (NPL), the percent change in the oil price

Upon eyeballing the data, there is a clear pattern of NPLs responding to exchange rate
depreciation. Whenever there was a large depreciation of the exchange rate, NPLs increased. This
happened clearly in 2009 and following the devaluation in early 2014.

NPLs are highly sensitive to changes in oil prices and a drop in output albeit with a
delayed impact. An increase in oil prices results in a decline in NPLs in 4-5 quarters. Furthermore,
the domestic real GDP impact on NPLs is persistent as the maximum impact happens about 11 to
12 quarters after the initial shock (Table 1). Economic activity in partner countries appears to
account for a significant share of movements in NPLs, followed by domestic economic activity and
the exchange rate. Translated into coefficients (elasticity), a percentage point increase in domestic
real GDP growth results in a 0.318 percentage point decline in NPLs; a percentage point increase in
the oil price results in a 0.006 percentage point decline in NPLs; a percentage point increase
(depreciation) in the exchange rate results in a 0.047 percentage point increase in NPLs. Oil prices
have a much larger effect on the exchange rate and on real GDP growth compared to the impact
directly on NPLs, as further revealed through variance decompositions, also presented below. The
results also show high dependence of the domestic economy on activity in partner economies.

Similar results to the VAR appear in single equation estimation. The results show a higher impact

of domestic economic activity on NPLs compared to the other macroeconomic variables.

current loans and liabilities, as well as net non-interest income, are given each banks performance in
2014. Given that estimates of collateral are unreliable, new NPLs are assumed to be provisioned at
100 percent. This further dents profits. When net income is positive, the test assumes that
80 percent of profits are retained and the rest is paid out as dividends. A bank accumulates capital
buffers when its capital ratio declined in the previous year. Capital covers the loss when net income
is negative. NPLs are deducted from total loans and interest income is earned on standard loans that
exclude NPLs.

The Solvency Stress Test Results
The results reveal that a number of banks are unable to withstand higher NPLs due the
shocks described above. It should be noted that the shocks are applied directly on bank balance
sheets. No adjustments have been made on capital to take into account the phase-out of capital
instruments ineligible under Basel III as was done in the FSAP neither to correct for provisioning.
Even without this adjustment and with very mild shocks, banks are still highly susceptible to shocks.
In the downside scenario, one bank goes further below the regulatory minimum CAR. System CAR
goes down to 16 percent (from 17.3 percent in the baseline) while the severe scenario brings it
down to 6 percent, below the regulatory minimum. In the severe scenario, as much at 17 banks have
CAR below the regulatory minimum. Recapitalization needs amount up to 3 percent of GDP. NPLs
decline over the projection period reflecting their response to assumptions on macroeconomic
variables, which improve over the horizon, and together with favorable assumption on reinvested
earnings, capital improves. NPLs by sector reveal that the construction and the trade sectors account
for a larger share of NPLs in the system while agriculture as well as trade and communication sectors
account for very small shares.

Several other simulations were done to assess the robustness of the results—a finding
that the banking sector is highly susceptible to shocks. The first assessed only the impact of the
exchange rate. The relationship between NPLs and the exchange rate was determined using a single
estimation equation. The response of NPLs to the exchange rate is slightly high than in a multiple
variable estimation given that the other variables are not present to account for all the movements
in NPLs. The results are shown below and reveal that even with a very mild exchange rate shock
(15 percent depreciation from the current level of the exchange rate), 10 banks have CAR below the
regulatory minimum. This is a mild shock considering that much larger exchange rate adjustments
that occurred in the past, including 20 percent in 2014 and a 25 percent one in 2009. A much larger
exchange rate adjustment of 70 percent occurred in 1999. A 25 percent exchange rate depreciation
results in 17 banks going below minimum CAR and recapitalization needs are estimated at
3.2 percent of GDP. Bank’s net open foreign exchange positions (NOP) are small; however, there is

extensive lending to unhedged borrowers (borrowers with income in tenge). Data on bank by bank
NOP was not made available to the team. The relationship between NPLs and the exchange rate
likely reflects also the indirect impact that the exchange rate has on NPLs.

A reverse stress test also reveals banking system vulnerability. The test reveals that an
increase in NPLs by 16 percent brings the system wide CAR to the regulatory minimum of
12 percent (assuming a 70 percent level of provisioning). At this level, 6 banks would be below the
regulatory minimum.

NT

Limited progress. Bank supervision remains largely
compliance based. They still rely on the CAMELOS system
(as per the guidance number 600 of December 31, 2014
and number 29 from February 26, 2014). However, the NBK
reports that it has developed draft Guidelines to off-site
supervision of the banking sector that include the
principles of risk-based supervision. They have been
receiving technical assistance from an international donor
to strengthen supervision with the aim of eventually
conducting inspections with a risk-based approach.
In the process of being implemented. The authorities have
been working to formulate a technique of determining
collateral value and provisioning for second-tier banks and
organizations engaged in certain types of banking
operations.
In progress. In 2014 and 2015 the NBK took part in drafting
Memorandums of Understanding with the following
foreign financial regulators: the Reserve Bank of India, the
Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Central
Bank of the Republic of San Marino, the Central Bank of the
Russian Federation, the Polish Financial Supervision
Commission, and the Central Bank of Bahrain. In 2015, the
NBK plans to hold a joint meeting with representatives of
the board of the Central Bank of Russia to discuss
consolidated (cross-border) oversight of the banking
subsidiaries of Kazakhstan banks, banks participating in
banking conglomerates located in the Russian Federation,
and the banking subsidiaries of Russian banks in the
Republic of Kazakhstan. The NBK plans to conduct a
banking college with the regulator board of the Russian
Federation.

Annex V. Kazakhstan: Risk Assessment Matrix
Nature/Source of
Main Threats

Likelihood

Expected Impact on the Economy if Risk Is Realized

Persistently low oil
prices

Medium

Growth would further decelerate over the medium term due to
reduced oil revenues, lower investments in the oil sector, and lower
investor confidence in the Kazakh economy in general. An
expansionary fiscal policy response may be adequate to tackle a
temporary oil-price shock to address the growth slowdown; but in case
of a permanent shock fiscal policy adjustment over the medium term is
critical to maintain sustainability.

Sharp growth
slowdown in China in
2015–16

Low

Kazakhstan would be adversely affected primarily through lower FDI
from China and declining exports to China, both of which have risen
in absolute and relative terms in recent years. Similar to the above, if
the sharp slowdown in China is seen as temporary, the expansionary
fiscal policy response may be appropriate, subject to measures taken to
ensure medium-term sustainability.

Russia-Ukraine
conflict re-intensifies

Medium

Further intensification of the conflict may lead to further sanctions
against Russia. As a result, Kazakhstan would be negatively affected
through lower export demand and investment flows from Russia.
Moreover, political uncertainly may increase, putting further
downward pressure on the tenge. Similar to the above, if the conflict
intensification is seen as temporary, the expansionary fiscal policy
response may be appropriate, subject to measures taken to ensure
medium-term sustainability.

High

Impact expected to be limited given the small scale external
borrowing by Kazakhstan’s government and corporates. That said,
the yield spreads on existing Kazakhstan’s sovereign and quasisovereign bonds are expected to rise in line with other emerging

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment
of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views
on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually
exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

market yields. Consideration should be given to speeding up the
enhancements of the monetary policy framework and operations,
including allowing greater exchange rate flexibility to absorb the
shocks. Coupled with enhanced communication strategy, these will
help boost confidence in central-bank policy making.

Persistent dollar
strength

High

The severity of the impact of persistent dollar strength depends on
the degree to which the tenge continues to be tightly managed
against the dollar. Under the prevailing tight exchange rate
arrangement, the tenge could continue to come under pressure,
especially if dollar strength is combined with sustained lower growth
and oil prices. Consideration should be given to speeding up the
enhancements of the monetary policy framework and operations,
including allowing greater exchange rate flexibility to absorb the
shocks. Coupled with enhanced communication strategy, these will
help boost confidence in central-bank policy making.

Annex VI. Comparison in the Authorities and Staff’s Fiscal
Accounting Frameworks1
1.
The authorities and staff use different methodologies to track fiscal accounts. In the
authorities’ approach: (i) most national oil fund accounts, including most oil export revenues are
kept off-budget; (ii) oil export revenues are only recognized when funds are transferred from the
national fund to the budget; (iii) tax on oil exports is treated as non-oil revenues; (iv) capital gains on
national oil fund assets, including the effects of devaluation are treated as revenues; (v) direct
lending (on-lending) from the national oil fund to quasi-sovereign entities is not recognized as
expenditure; and (vi) only a fraction of quasi-sovereign entity’s foreign loans, which is directly
guaranteed by the government, are recognized as contingent liabilities.
2.
Staff, on the other hand, follows the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM)
2001 framework with revenues and expenditures consolidated into single general
government budget. In particular: (i) oil revenues, including oil export duty, are recorded on a cash
basis; (ii) interest income of the national oil fund is recognized as revenues but not capital gains or
valuation differences; (iii) lending to SOEs is treated as expenditure; (iv) net transfers from the
national oil fund are recorded below the line; and (v) debts of SOEs, where there is expectation that
the state may become liable for repayment in case of default, are treated as contingent liabilities.
3.

The different methodologies result in diverging estimates and forecasts. This is

illustrated below for the 2014 fiscal figures and the projected medium-term path for the non-oil
fiscal deficits. In particular, the authorities’ approach underestimates oil revenues, and consequently
the non-oil deficit, by half relative to GFSM.

Annex VIII. Macroprudential Policies in Kazakhstan1
Background

1.
The NBK has introduced several prudential and macroprudential tools, mostly
following the 2009 financial crisis. The tools aim to address some of the risks already facing the
banking sector and some tools will be implemented over the coming years. The existing
macroprudential and prudential tools are presented below:
To reduce exchange rate risk and dollarization:


Differentiated reserve requirement ratios (RR): Minimum RRs on the share of bank liabilities
associated with cash in vault and correspondent accounts with the NBK were introduced in
May 2006. There were amendments in November 2012 to differentiate minimum RRs between
domestic and foreign liabilities and further in 2015 to refine the structure. The 2012
amendments aimed at limiting the inflow of short-term speculative capital; diversifying the
portfolio of banks; developing the market of long-term bank instruments; and reducing pressure
on the foreign exchange market. The RR ratios are currently (i) 2 percent on tenge short-term
domestic liabilities; (ii) 4 percent on tenge short-term foreign liabilities; (iii) 0 percent on tenge
long-term domestic liabilities; (iv) 2 percent on tenge long-term foreign liabilities; (v) 2 percent
on FX short-term domestic liabilities; (vi) 6 percent on FX short-term foreign liabilities;
(vii) 0 percent on FX long-term domestic liabilities; and (viii) 2 percent on FX long-term foreign
liabilities.



Limits on the net open FX positions (NOFP) or currency mismatches: Limits on the net open
FX position were introduced in 2002, as follows: (i) 12.5 percent for currencies of countries with
the S&P rating of at least "A" (or equivalent); (ii) 12.5 percent for euro; (iii) 5 percent for
currencies of countries with the S&P rating below "A" (or equivalent); and (iv) a 25 percent net
foreign currency position limit. There is also a 30 percent limit on open FX off-balance sheet
positions, effective from July 2014. The measure is aimed at preventing speculative pressure in
the spot and FX swap market and to control foreign exchange risk off-balance sheet on a net
basis.

To reduce credit risk:
Measures in non-collateralized consumer lending: Effective from April 1, 2014, the NBK
introduced: (i) a 50 percent cap on debt-to-income ratio; (ii) an increase in the retail lending risk
weight for capital adequacy to 100 percent (from 75 percent); and (iii) a 30 percent limit for
growth in consumer loans for each bank. The measures were aimed at minimizing risks
associated with rapid growth in consumer lending.



To contain concentration risk:

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN



Credit concentration limits: The NBK has the following limits on exposure to a single borrower:
i) 10 percent of a bank’s capital for related counterparties except for subsidiaries acquiring
bank’s doubtful and loss claims in order to manage them. The aggregate amount of risk for
borrowers related to bank insiders should not exceed an amount of bank’s capital; ii) 25 percent
of a bank’s capital for other counterparties (10 percent for unsecured lending, unsecured
contingent liabilities related to borrower or to third parties). Banks are also required to submit
on a monthly basis reports to the NBK on maximum exposure to a single counterparty and
group of connected counterparties.

To reduce liquidity risk:


Liquidity Requirements: Introduced in 2005, amended in 2009 and in 2012. Maximum value of
liabilities of non-residents to equity (authorities’ к9 ratio) was relaxed from 2 to 3, starting in July
2009. The current liquidity ratio (average monthly highly liquid assets of a bank to average
monthly demand liabilities; k4) was introduced to differentiate between tenge and foreign
currency liquidity, with the regulatory value set at 0.3. In 2012, liquidity ratios were tightened,
from July, 2012—at least 0.08, and from July, 2013—at least 0.09, adding contingent liabilities to
the calculation of capital adequacy ratio (k1-1).

To strengthen solvency:


Dynamic Provisioning (DP): DP was introduced in January 2013 to smooth provisioning costs
over the business cycle by gradually building a countercyclical loan-loss reserve in good times
and then using it to cover losses as they arise in bad times. The DP has been suspended since
January 2014, while retaining its volume in the structure of capital as accumulated at end-2013.



General Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCB): The CCB is planned to be introduced from 2016.



Capital Surcharges on SIFIs: Capital surcharges are planned to be introduce from 2016.

Assessment
2.
The assessment of effectiveness of the macroprudential tools needs to be put in the
historical context. Prior to the 2009 financial crisis there was significant foreign wholesale
borrowing by banks (at 44 percent of GDP between 2005 and 2007). This borrowing helped finance
a boom in credit to the non-tradable sector (mainly construction). The tightening in external
financial conditions forced aggressive deleveraging; resulting in a bust in asset prices (particularly
real estate). The 20 percent devaluation in 2009 added to FX pressures, spreading to unhedged FX
borrowers. Since then, measures have been taken to significantly limit foreign wholesale borrowing
and unhedged FX borrowing has also declined. Banks had large net open FX positions at the time of
the crisis and they have declined significantly as supervision began to enforce the existing NOFP
limits. However, the NOP has widened again in 2014—though not to the extent of 2009—and
liabilities this time are mostly funded from deposits rather than foreign wholesale borrowing.

3.
Recommendations to improve the macroprudential toolkit are aimed at addressing the
major risks on financial stability. These are mainly on reducing exchange rate and credit risks. The
planned implementation of the CCB and the phasing in of Basel III capital requirements should help
enhance resilience of the banking sector.
Exchange rate risk:


The risk: Exchange rate risk, however, remains the largest risk for the banking sector. Fears of
devaluation are still looming and are contributing to a rise in FX liabilities relative to FX loans as
the net open FX position of banks is negative. Essentially, liabilities upon which interest must be
paid exceed interest earning assets. FX risks are especially elevated in the corporate sector—the
largest borrowers from the banking system—where leverage and the net open FX position to
equity are extremely high.



The recommendation: To help limit risks emanating from high exposure to the corporate sector,
the NBK should consider introducing risk weights or exposure caps for corporate exposures.
This will help the banking system withstand corporate credit losses by building capital buffers
(see IMF Staff Guidance on Macroprudential Policy). Risk weights can help build buffers by
affecting the supply of credit indirectly while FX exposure caps curtail the supply of credit
directly. Reducing FX lending to borrowers whose earnings are not in FX should also be
considered. This can be done through higher risk weights on such exposures. Tighter net open
position limits are also recommended to contain exchange rate risk.

Credit risk:


The risk: Even though there are concentration limits, credit concentration remains a risk to
financial stability. Though concentrated large exposures have fallen from levels during the global
financial crisis, at 208 percent of capital, they remain large. The FSAP found that if three largest
bank exposures were to default, about 11 banks would breach the regulatory minimum capital
requirement. In 2014, the construction sector received the largest share of new corporate sector
credit (24 percent) while it also had the largest share of new NPLs (41 percent, rising from 15
percent the previous year). On the other form of credit risk, macroprudential measures
introduced by the NBK to contain consumer credit were effective in reducing such lending.



The recommendation: The NBK should ensure compliance with exposure limits to restrict bank
exposures to single counterparties or groups of connected counterparties.

4.
Proper implementation and enforcement of macroprudential tools is critical. The FSAP
warned that inconsistent implementation of macroprudential measures, as has been in the past
(including forbearance for some banks resulting in ineffective incentive structures), could add to
regulatory uncertainty and result in ineffective incentive structures and a loss in confidence in the
domestic financial system.

Annex IX. Kazakhstan: Inclusive Growth1
Kazakhstan’s economic growth has been broadly inclusive, but further efforts are needed to reduce
growing income gaps. Efforts to reduce income inequality by promoting faster employment growth
have been relatively weak, in part because the enclave nature of extractive industries leaves wide
welfare gaps among regions and along the urban-rural divide. The twin priorities of economic
diversification and private sector development require addressing key structural weaknesses, namely
human capital and institutions—areas where Kazakhstan lags behind emerging market peers. Staff
carried out an analysis on inclusive growth, focusing on income inequality and employment, under the
2014 Article IV consultations.2 Important challenges highlighted by the analysis are resource
dependence, public sector dominance, and governance.
Income Inequality

1.
Based on available data, poverty has declined considerably over the past decade, from
47 percent in 2001 to 3 percent in 2013, with urban and rural poverty falling, respectively,
from 36 percent to 1.3 percent and from 59 percent to 5 percent. Urban-rural disparity,
however, remains relatively high: the rural poverty gap—defined as rural poverty rate minus the
national poverty rate—is wider than in some poorer neighboring countries. Regional disparities are
also high with poverty ranging from 1.7 percent in Astana to over 10 percent in south Kazakhstan.
High poverty rates are observed in both non-oil and oil-rich regions, reflecting the enclave nature of
the oil industry, which is capital intensive and thus does not create significant economic spillover
effects.
Employment
2.
Thanks to robust economic growth, the unemployment rate in Kazakhstan has
declined rapidly, from over 10 percent in the early 2000s to around 5 percent today. High
female labor force participation (67 percent) is another positive feature of the labor market in
Kazakhstan. Yet, given the high level of self-employment, which reflects in many ways informal parttime employment, the low recorded level of unemployment needs to be treated with caution.
Moreover, job creation has not been commensurate with economic growth (especially since the
global financial crisis), particularly in the manufacturing sector where it is anemic, despite the
accelerated industrialization program. Employment in the agricultural sector has continuously fallen,
because of the unproductive farm structure, which reflects limited access to commercial credit and
lack of long-term investment. The low degree of job creation also reflects a capital intensive
economy dominated by the oil and public sectors. In 2012, in part as an attempt to address some of
these gaps, the authorities introduced new labor market policies such as (i) supporting job search
assistance and intermediation services; (ii) development of entrepreneurship in rural areas through

micro-credits; (iii) free training and retraining, including support for relocation; and (iv) provision of
employment through infrastructure and communal service programs.
Business climate and governance

3.
Kazakhstan scores relatively low on several business environment and governance
indicators. For example, while it has seen some improvement in the World Bank’s Doing Business
indicators, the diagnostic of firm-level business constraints reveals important weaknesses in labor
skills, taxation, and corruption. Governance issues are mostly rooted in weak transparency prevalent
in off-budget operations, including through large quasi-fiscal institutions. The large role of the state
in the economy—for example, the size of the state investment holding company Samruk Kazyna (SK)
has grown over time, reaching roughly 50 percent of GDP (in assets)—represents an additional
barrier to enhanced private-sector led business environment. The government is launching a
number of programs in cooperation with MDB to strengthen governance indicators, including
through greater transparency of quasi fiscal institutions.
Fiscal policy

4.
The scale of government spending on critical social sectors (including health,
education and social protection) has been broadly adequate in Kazakhstan compared to
countries with similar income per capita. In addition, the government has attempted to protect
critical spending (as a share of GDP) during times of fiscal adjustment. However, the 2015 budget
cuts have affected some important social programs including the reduction of the budget for Health
and Social Services ministry by 15 percent. Quality of social spending, as measured by outcomes, on
the other hand, needs improvement. The World Bank has identified some areas of concern,
especially related to education. In particular, Kazakhstan’s students’ performance on PISA (Program
for international Student Assessment) has been below their peers’ in comparator countries. Finally,
there are significant disparities in educational enrollment across residence and income status within
the country. Staff will deepen the analysis of these issues in the context of its future diagnostic of
inclusive growth in Kazakhstan.

Exchange Rate Arrangements:
The currency of Kazakhstan is the tenge, which was introduced in November 1993. The official
exchange rate is determined on the basis of foreign exchange auctions that are held daily. Auctions
are held for U.S. dollars, euros, and Russian rubles, and official rates are quoted for over 30 other
currencies on the basis of cross-rates. From late 1999 to October 2007, the exchange rate regime
was a managed float with no preannounced path. From October 2007 the tenge was maintained
within a narrow range against the U.S. dollar. In February 2009, the tenge was devalued by
18 percent against the U.S. dollar, and a trading band of T150/USD +/- 3 percent was established. In
February 2010, the trading band was widened and set at an asymmetric T150/USD +10/-15 percent.
In February 2011, the trading band was officially abolished, and the de jure exchange rate
arrangement was changed from a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands to a managed
float. Between September 2013 and February 2014, the tenge was managed within an unofficial
2 percent band against a basket of currencies comprised of the U.S. dollar (70 percent), the euro
(20 percent), and the Russian ruble (10 percent). Since February 2014 (following an 18 percent
devaluation against the U.S. dollar), the tenge has stabilized within a trading band of
T185/USD +/- 3 tenge/USD. In September 2014, the band was asymmetrically widened to
T170-188/USD. The de facto exchange rate has been reclassified from a crawl-like to a stabilized
arrangement, effective February 11, 2014. The NBK may conduct foreign exchange operations both
on the regulated Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE) and in the interbank foreign exchange markets.
The NBK intervenes on its own behalf directly with market participants based on their quotes and
does not publish information on its interventions. The exchange system is free from restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation:
Kazakhstan is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle, in accordance with the Decision on
Article IV Consultation Cycles (Decision No. 14747–(10/96) (9/28/2010). The last consultation was
concluded on July 21, 2014 (see IMF Country Report No. 14/242).
FSAP Participation and ROSCS:
Kazakhstan participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2000. The staff report
on the Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) was issued on November 27, 2000
(FO/DIS/00/142). The FSSA included the following ROSC modules: Basel Core Principles for Effective
Banking Supervision, Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems, Code of Good
Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies, IOSCO Objectives and Principles of
Securities Regulation, and IAIS Insurance Core Principles. FSAP Updates were conducted in
February 2004, March 2008, and February 2014. The fiscal transparency module was completed in
October 2002 and the final report published in April 2003. A data module mission took place in
April/May 2002, and its final report was published in March 2003. An update of the data ROSC was
undertaken in 2006 and the report was published in February 2008 (IMF Country Report No. 08/56,
Annex V).

AML/CFT Assessment:
Kazakhstan’s anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)
framework was assessed against the AML/CFT standard, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
40+9 Recommendations. The evaluation was conducted by the Eurasian Group on money
laundering and financing of terrorism (EAG), the FATF-style regional body of which Kazakhstan is a
member, and the final mutual evaluation report was adopted in June 2011. The report indicates that
the main sources of criminal proceeds in Kazakhstan are crimes related to fraud and abuse of public
office. The evaluators found that Kazakhstan had a relatively comprehensive AML/CFT framework in
place, but that significant deficiencies nevertheless remained, notably with respect to customer due
diligence measures and the reporting of suspicious transactions. Kazakhstan is tentatively scheduled
to undergo its next AML/CFT assessment by the EAG in April 2017.
Technical Assistance:
Kazakhstan has received technical assistance and training by the Fund in virtually every area of
economic policy, including through over 90 technical assistance missions provided during
1993-2014 by FAD, LEG, MCM, STA, and the IMF Institute. In addition to short-term missions, the
Fund has provided resident advisors to the National Bank of Kazakhstan, to the Agency of Statistics
of the Republic of Kazakhstan, to the ministry of finance, and a peripatetic expert to the Financial
Supervision Agency. Other international agencies and governments, including the World Bank,
EU TACIS, EBRD, UNDP, ADB, and OECD, also are providing a wide variety of technical assistance.
The following list summarizes the technical assistance provided by the Fund to Kazakhstan since
2003.
Monetary and Capital Markets Department
Technical assistance has enabled steady progress in a number of areas related to monetary and
exchange affairs, including banking legislation, central bank accounting, payments system reform,

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of June 20, 2015)
Kazakhstan became a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
and the International Development Association (IDA) in July 1992 and a member of the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) in September 1993. In 2010 Kazakhstan became an IDA donor under the
IDA16 replenishment. Kazakhstan is the largest client of the IFC in Central Asia.
IBRD in Kazakhstan
The Bank’s lending operations in Kazakhstan are aligned with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
for FY12–17, endorsed by the Board in May 2012. As of June 2015, the IBRD loan program
comprised seventeen projects with a total commitment of US$3.9 billion, of which US$2.1 billion has
been disbursed. While 90 percent of the commitments are concentrated in the on-going SouthWest roads project and the East-West roads project, the portfolio remains diverse with two-thirds of
the projects focused on institutional building. The other fifteen projects are: SME Competitiveness,
technology commercialization, fostering productive innovations, customs development, tax
administration reform, health sector technology transfer and institutional reform, technical and
vocational education modernization, Youth Corp, skills and jobs, statistical capacity building,
Ust-Kamenogorsk environmental remediation, forest protection and reforestation, energy efficiency,
second irrigation and drainage, and justice sector institutional strengthening.
The Bank also provides extensive advisory and analytical services (AAA) to the Government through
the Joint Economic Research Program (JERP). The JERP is instrumental in providing policy analysis,
strategic planning expertise, and good practice options to assist the Government with the reform
agenda in the field of economic and social development and the institutional capacity of the
Government to conduct economic and sectoral work. The JERP for FY15 amounted to over
US$10.5 million and comprised 35 largely interrelated and programmatic activities focusing on the
Government’s strategic priorities in financial sector development, strengthening of the private
sector, fostering of science and innovations, development of skills for the labor market, attraction of
investments into economy and development of PPP, sustainable environmental development,
implementation of institutional reforms in public administration, and regional cooperation.

IFC in Kazakhstan
In the context of the CPS for FY12–17, IFC’s role is to contribute to the government's development
plans by supporting the private sector to advance economic diversification and growth agenda,
particularly in the non-extractive sectors and frontier regions. In the short term IFC is focusing on
strengthening the financial sector, both in the context of the post-crisis recovery and as a
prerequisite to pursue the diversification agenda, and infrastructure development, including through
public private partnerships (PPPs). In the medium term more efforts will be dedicated to the
establishment of best practices in international banking, improvement of the corporate governance
and the regulatory environment, SMEs development, increasing investments in value-added
manufacturing, agribusiness and services, and supporting the energy efficiency.
IFC’s investment program has been expanding in the context of the crisis response. It grew tenfold
between FY05 and FY08 (to US$110 million) and nearly doubled again in FY09. In FY10, IFC invested
a record US$336 million in five projects in the financial and agribusiness sectors, with vast majority
provided to commercial banks. Post-crisis IFC’s investment level has moderated and averaged at
about US$100 million per year in FY11–13. As of June 2015, Kazakhstan remains IFC's largest client
in Central Asia with total committed portfolio of US$246 million, of which US$245 million is
outstanding. The investment portfolio is mostly concentrated in the financial sector, infrastructure,
general manufacturing and consumer services, although IFC has begun making investments in the
agribusiness sector as well.

RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
(As of June 16, 2015)
Kazakhstan is one of the largest countries of operations of the EBRD, with about US$ 7 billion
invested over the last 21 years, and is demonstrating strong reform momentum. In June 2014, EBRD
signed the Enhance Partnership Framework Arrangement with the Government of Kazakhstan for
re-energizing reforms. This has enabled EBRD to deliver increased transition impact through policy
dialogue and a higher level of investment within EBRD’s country strategy.
In Kazakhstan, EBRD has the following priorities:
Diversification and support for the non-resource sector. The EBRD is already the largest investor
in the non-oil and gas sector of the economy. We will continue to support the development of other
sectors by financing projects that enhance productivity in the corporate sector, improve the business
environment, promote modernization of the agribusiness sector along the entire value chain and
facilitate growth of the SME sector. The EBRD will also work to further develop the banking and nonbanking financial sectors.
Balancing the role of the state and the market. The EBRD will seek to assist the Kazakh authorities
in balancing the roles of the state and the market by supporting growth of private sector
enterprises. The EBRD will also support policies aimed at commercializing public enterprises and
making them more efficient, as well as upgrading infrastructure ensuring appropriate sharing of
risks between the private and public sectors.
Promoting low-carbon growth and energy efficiency. The Government’s recently announced
Green Economy Strategy is a top national priority and the EBRD will assist in implementing key
aspects of the strategy through projects in energy, renewables, agriculture, water, waste
management, transport, and other sectors.
The EBRD is already working to address these issues. Thanks to the EBRD’s support, nearly
60 percent of Almaty’s urban transport is now environmentally friendly. We are working with clients
in agribusiness sector such as RG Brands; supporting private sector’s involvement in infrastructure,
such as Olzha and Eastcomtrans, the rail car providers; helping to contribute to the energy efficiency
of the power sector by financing clients like CAEPCO; and working on renewable energy both in
terms of policy dialogue and project financing. The EBRD’s Small Business Support program has
provided consulting support to over a thousand two hundred private enterprises, and with donor
funds from the Kazakh government is now present in 7 regions of Kazakhstan––expanding to 9 by
the end of 2015. The EBRD is working on expanding its program of SME financing through local
partner banks.

As well as being a country where the EBRD works, Kazakhstan is also an EBRD donor. In 2013 the
Kazakh government signed a €6 million agreement for Technical Cooperation funding, principally
supporting policy dialogue objectives in Kazakhstan with a primary focus on transport,
telecommunications, and energy efficiency. The fund has a co-financing arrangement with the EBRD
Shareholder Special Fund. In 2015 EBRD received Euro 41 Million for technical advisory and support
of the Small Business Program under the Enhanced Partnership Framework.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of June 16, 2015)
Kazakhstan became a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1994. In the early years of
transition from a centrally planned to a more market-driven economy, ADB focused on efforts to
sustain a higher growth rate, promote environmental friendly development, support the private
sector, and encourage regional integration.
As of June 2015, cumulative public sector loan commitments to Kazakhstan amounted to about
US$3.1 billion, of which about US$2.2 billion has been disbursed. Commitments cover 26 public
sector loan operations in agriculture and natural resources, education, finance, transport and
communications, water supply and sanitation, irrigation, and small- and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs). These loans were complemented with 80 technical assistance (TA) projects amounting to
about US$33.1 million. Kazakhstan is eligible for the ordinary capital resources (OCR) only.
Kazakhstan became a donor to the Asian Development Fund, ADB’s concessional financing resource,
with a US$5.49 million contribution in 2012.

Both, the PFA and ADB’s current country partnership strategy (CPS) for 2012–16, aim to support
economic diversification, sustainable development and inclusive growth. ADB’s focus is in the
transport, finance, urban, and energy sectors. As knowledge solutions are central to the CPS, the
government and ADB established a joint Knowledge and Experience Exchange Program (KEEP) in 2013.
The KEEP commits the parties to a cost-sharing arrangement with a total financing of US$2.5 million for
2013–17.
In the transport sector, ADB has been supporting Kazakhstan in realizing its transit potential and
integration into the global transport network via two multitranche financing facilities (MFFs) totaling
US$1.5 billion to improve road networks in two regions of Kazakhstan (Zhambyl and Mangystau),
along the CAREC Transport Corridors 1 and 2. This is complemented by 2 stand-alone loans in the
total amount of $220 million. Five projects are under implementation with some sections completed
and in use. Once fully completed, the projects will contribute to increased external trade and
economic development.
In 2010, ADB approved a US$500 million MFF for the SME Investment Program to enhance efficiency
and competitiveness of the financial sector and SMEs. Tranche 1 in the amount of US$150 million
was provided to the DAMU Entrepreneurship Development Fund for onlending to three
participating financial institutions (PFIs), and was fully disbursed in April 2013. A subsequent tranche
2 amounting to US$122 million was approved in December 2013, and tranche 3 amounting to
US$130 million was approved in December 2014 with an additional financing of US$98 million
currently being processed. Currency and interest rate risks are mitigated through local currencydenominated, fixed-rate loans.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

In the energy sector, ADB is focusing on energy efficiency, and providing technical assistance on
modernization of district heating networks and on institutional capacity development.
In addition to the KEEP, knowledge partnerships were established through two major studies (one
on Kazakhstan’s industrial policy, and the other on knowledge-based economy) to promote a
constructive dialogue among high-level policy makers and share lessons and best practices of other
developing member countries and advanced economies, with the aim of exploring appropriate
future policy options and to improve planning strategies. At the sector level, advisory support is
being provided for financing urban infrastructure in secondary cities.
Private sector operations of ADB in Kazakhstan began in 2006, with private sector financing to six
entities in the financial and agribusiness sectors amounting to US$455.2 million approved to-date.
Near-term ADB private sector financing prospects are in private infrastructure and energy sectors.
Kazakhstan was one of the four founding partners of the CAREC Program in 1997 (together with the
People’s Republic of China, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan). Since then, six other countries
have joined the partnership, and CAREC-related investments in the partner countries have totaled
US$24.2 billion, over the period 2001–14. Four of the six CAREC road and rail corridors traverse
Kazakhstan, and developing these Central Asian corridors is a priority for achieving CAREC’s goal of
land bridges connecting Europe and Asia. In October 2013, Kazakhstan hosted the twelfth CAREC
Ministerial Conference in Astana which brought together the ministers of the 10 member countries
to discuss the progress of CAREC.
In May 2014, Kazakhstan hosted the ADB Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors. About
3,000 participants attended the event and discussed connectivity, innovation, and the need to keep
up with the demands of a changing Asia and Pacific.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of July 7, 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The most
affected areas are balance of payments and national accounts.
National accounts: The Committee on Statistics (CS) has made considerable progress in improving
the statistical infrastructure and updating the business register with full coverage of legal entities and
individual entrepreneurs. Annual estimates of oil and gas sector are compiled and disseminated—but
only in Russian, following international standards. However, the contribution of the oil sector to the
GDP is understated since taxes on oil and gas products have not been included. Addressing also other
tax-related issues identified by the last STA TA mission would increase the absolute value of GDP. The
CS also compiles quarterly GDP, but on a cumulative basis—instead of discrete basis and using
“comparable prices” instead of fixed base or previous year prices.
Price Statistics: The quality of consumer price statistics is affected by occasional use of administrative
price controls. Typically, for each good or service administrative controls are imposed on the
variety that is included in the CPI basket. Since producers/importers are not compensated by the
government for any losses due to the price controls, they may switch to non-controlled varieties
and/or compensate by increasing the prices of non-controlled varieties.
Government finance statistics: Progress has been made in the classification of the fiscal accounts
consistent with the Fund’s Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). Over the last two
years the authorities have expanded coverage of data reported for the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook to include both the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan and State Social Insurance
Fund, and consequently are now able to report annual data for to the whole of the consolidated
general government, including a financial balance sheet. However, statistics on the enlarged
government (including public enterprises) is not available.
Monetary statistics: The National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) reports the Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs) 1SR for the central bank and 2SR for other depository corporations (ODCs) on a monthly basis
for publication in IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS) with a lag of about one month. The last
mission on monetary and financial statistics, which took place in April 2015 assisted the NBK to
develop a framework for compiling SRF 4SR for other financial corporations (OFCs). The NBK agreed
to report quarterly SRF 4SR for publication in IFS by end-December 2015. While good progress has
been made on data compilation and dissemination, more efforts are required to address the
remaining inconsistencies in the reporting of inter-bank positions, which are due to the lack of
information on the counterpart sector of certain transactions.
Financial sector surveillance: Kazakhstan participates in the IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment
Survey (CDIS), and Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS). The country reports 34 financial

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

soundness indicators (FSIs) for posting on the IMF’s FSI website on a quarterly basis—all 12 core FSIs
and 11 of the 13 encouraged FSIs for deposit takers, and 11 encouraged FSIs for other sectors and
markets (two FSIs for OFCs, four FSIs for nonfinancial corporations, two FSIs for households, and three
FSIs for real estate markets).
Balance of payments: The authorities have transitioned to the compilation of balance of payments in
concordance with the sixth edition of Balance of Payments Statistics Manual (BPM6) starting 2013.
The NBK is reporting quarterly BOP and IIP data, Reserves Template, and participates in the
World Bank’s Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS). Deficiencies remain in direct investment
statistics as local branch offices of foreign companies operating in the construction sector are
considered nonresident entities. This leads to discrepancies with national accounts statistics where
this activity is treated as domestic production. In external debt statistics, there are discrepancies
between data compiled by different governmental agencies owing to methodological differences,
including coverage of external debt of publicly-owned corporations. Statistical treatment of trade
within the customs union is not accurate, which has contributed to large and increasing errors and
omissions. The authorities are cooperating with relevant agencies in the customs union partner
countries to resolve these problems.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Kazakhstan subscribes to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since March
2003.
