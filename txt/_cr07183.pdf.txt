Executive Summary

Background: Slovenia’s sound macroeconomic policies were crowned with success in
January when Slovenia entered the euro area. Nonetheless, challenges remain. Strong
growth driven by domestic demand brought output to capacity limits in 2006, and
inflation stabilized. Looking forward, credit growth and wage and fiscal pressures are
risks to non-inflationary growth, while the slow pace of structural reform is a challenge
for future competitiveness.
Staff views: The staff saw risks of overheating and, to ensure a balanced expansion,
advocated a neutral fiscal stance in 2007–08 and continued prudent wage policies.
Upfront expenditure reforms would also smooth the adjustment towards structural
balance in 2011, improve fiscal flexibility, and help accommodate spending pressures
from infrastructure and pensions. Closer monitoring of rising credit risks, privatization
and improved corporate governance of banks, along with capital market development
would help contain and diversify risks and boost growth. Using the good times to
reduce financial vulnerabilities and advance structural reforms would also benefit
growth and competitiveness.
The authorities’ views: The authorities broadly shared the staff’s assessment and
agreed on the need to enhance efficiency of budgetary spending. However, the Ministry
of Finance ruled out majority foreign ownership of large banks given EU’s home-host
supervisory rules that make the cost of bank failures the responsibility of the host
country, while the home country is responsible for supervision. It was also not
convinced of the need to tighten fiscal policy as it saw little risk of overheating, and
wage pressures contained. Progress with further structural reforms, including on
pensions, would be politically difficult.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
After 15 years of transition, Slovenia became the first new EU member to adopt
the euro in January 2007. Favorable initial conditions and sound macroeconomic policies
over the past decade have allowed Slovenia to sustain robust growth with small external
imbalances and public debt while gradually lowering inflation and interest rates to euro area
levels. PPP-based per capita income reached about 80 percent of EU-average in 2006, putting
Slovenia on par with Greece and above Portugal.
2.
Growth spillovers from the region intensified
in 2004–06. Since EU entry in 2004, trade integration
has deepened and exports have been buoyed by euro
area recovery. Declining real interest rates and risk
premia have sustained strong credit growth, boosting
domestic demand. These factors led growth to near
record levels in 2006.

Fiscal flexibility is constrained by one of the most rigid
public spending structures in Europe, limiting the scope of countercyclical policies, while
rapid aging is exacerbating longer run fiscal pressures. Efficiency of the largely statecontrolled financial sector is low, hampering financial intermediation and longer-term
growth. To address these issues, the 2007 Article IV consultation focused on challenges in
the financial sector and fiscal reforms, complementing last year’s in-depth assessments of the
structure of public spending, long-run fiscal sustainability and structural challenges in
product and labor markets. 1
II. BACKGROUND
4.
Growth accelerated in 2006, led by investment demand (Table 1, Figures 1 and
2). Growth rose from 4 percent in 2005 to 5¼ percent in 2006, the highest level in this
decade as a recovery in investment, driven by robust credit growth and infrastructure
spending, took over from exports as the main engine of activity. Private consumption

remained stable, reflecting moderate wage increases. The strong economy boosted job
creation mainly in services, and unemployment continued to decline. These trends, along
with strong labor demand as indicated by employment rates and the continued rise in
capacity utilization to record levels, suggest that the economy has reached capacity limits.
The strong economy has boosted job creation
and lowered unemployment.

Investment-led domestic demand took over from net exports
as main driver of growth in 2006.

The fiscal deficit continued to narrow in 2006, aided by the rapid growth
(Table 2). In keeping with its tradition of fiscal prudence, Slovenia further lowered the
general government deficit to about ¾ percent of GDP in 2006 from about 1 percent in 2005.

Monetary conditions in 2006 were broadly
neutral as policy rates converged in the run up to
euro adoption (Figure 3). In the face of continued
strong capital inflows, the Bank of Slovenia (BoS)
lowered its key policy rate (60-day bills) to 3¼ percent
in the first half of the year, after keeping them constant
at 4 percent since ERM2 entry in 2004. With the
increases in the European Central Bank (ECB) rate, the
interest rate differential was closed by year-end. As the

5
tolar-euro rate and average inflation remained stable, real interest rates declined slightly.
7.
Besides balanced macroeconomic policies, incomes policies helped to contain
inflation (Figures 4 and 5). Prudent wage policies, elimination of import duties, and
increased competition following EU accession drove core inflation in 2005 below one
percent. By mid-2006, it had reverted to the EU-15 average, picking up further towards endyear owing to capacity constraints and rapid credit growth. In this context, collective wage
agreements that continued to set wage increases below productivity growth were key to price
stability by containing second-round effects of energy price increases and demand pressures.
Average headline inflation remained stable at 2½ percent, aided by receding oil prices.
8.
The current account deficit widened slightly, mainly reflecting increased factor
payments (Table 3, Figure 6). Strong demand in Europe helped sustain robust export
growth at 10 percent in 2006 driven by chemicals and automotive industries. Imports
accelerated to over 10 percent, owing to demand for investment goods. This, together with
the higher, partly one-off, outflows of dividends to foreign investors, resulted in a widening
of the current account deficit from 2 percent of GDP in 2005 to an estimated 2.6 percent in
2006.

Cross-border investment positions continued to expand in 2006, raising
vulnerability to external conditions. With declining domestic interest rates, households
turned to foreign-oriented mutual funds, while banks and enterprises increased their holdings
in high-return countries, especially in Southeastern Europe. To finance these investments and

Household credit, at 15 percent of GDP, is
still low compared to countries with similar incomes (Figure 10), but rising rapidly owing to
the greater demand for housing. In contrast, credit to enterprises is near euro area levels.
Given low FDI and absence of a developed equity market, enterprises have relied primarily
on debt financing, which has led to relatively high leverage ratios compared to the region.
Box 1. Sectoral Balance Sheet Analysis
The corporate sector in Slovenia has important net total and non-equity financial liabilities, which
coupled with the high debt-to-assets-ratio point to rising leverage of enterprises. The liabilities are
mainly to domestic banks, increasing the banks’ exposure to credit risks. Banks’ rising net foreign
liabilities, in turn, are increasing their vulnerability to changes in foreign market conditions.

The financial sector remains sound
to deal with these risks, but vulnerabilities
are building up (Tables 4-5). Banks’
financial soundness indicators remain
adequate. However, declining interest margins
and loss of foreign exchange revenue are
putting pressure on profitability, which is
already regionally low. High levels of indirect
ownership linkages could amplify
transmission of shocks in the economy.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
13.
Against this background, the discussions focused on the main current policy
challenges for Slovenia—maintaining the strong commitment to policy discipline and
advancing structural reforms—to ensure continued success in the euro zone. The main
themes were policy requirements for a balanced expansion, and using the favorable times to
contain vulnerabilities and increase economic flexibility and productivity. In line with past
consultations, there was broad agreement on the direction of policies.

Slovenia: Effectiveness of Fund Surveillance
Past Policy Advice
• Faster fiscal consolidation in
good times to reduce
overheating risks and deal with
longer-term fiscal pressures

Policy Outcomes
Fiscal Policy
• The fiscal deficits in 2004-06 overperformed the budget and the impulse
was broadly neutral, in line with Fund recommendations.
• The medium-term target of structural balance has been shifted out to
accommodate higher capital spending.

• Increase budget flexibility by
reforms in non-discretionary
outlays

• Social benefits, except for pensions, have been reindexed to inflation.
• Political support for reducing mandatory expenditures further is limited.

• Improve expenditure efficiency
with performance budgeting

• The MOF has made initial progress towards performance budgeting, but
broader government commitment is needed.

• Undertake up-front substantive
pension reform to increase
effective retirement age, reduce
the generous benefits and
develop private pensions

• Pension benefits were re-indexed to wages, but transitional provisions still
apply limiting its negative impact in the near term.
• Discussions are ongoing to improve retirement incentives towards more
active aging. The authorities regard more systemic reforms to be politically
infeasible.
Monetary Policy and Financial Sector

• Disinflation process anchored
on interest rate policies and
stronger reliance on incomes
policies

• A gradual approach to disinflation based on a declining currency
depreciation was undertaken.
• A social agreement to set wage increases to lag productivity growth was
implemented. Public sector wage bill is set to grow in line with inflation.

• Reinforce risk assessments
with stress tests and
cooperation with foreign
supervisors

• Stress testing and cooperation with foreign supervisors have been
strengthened.

• Increase efficiency by further
bank privatization

• State control of the largest bank will be maintained until the home-host
supervisory relationship in the EU is clarified. The second largest bank
will be privatized.
Labor and Product Markets
• Unemployment benefits have been tied to active labor market policies.
• A centralized database on social benefits due in 2009 is expected to
reduce system abuse.
• Increased work incentives for high income earners by elimination of
payroll tax.
• Discussions are ongoing to facilitate use of temporary workers.
• There is limited support for relaxing the strict employment protection in
place.

• Encourage work incentives by
better targeting of social
benefits

• Increase labor market flexibility
by reducing high costs of hiring
and firing
• Improve the business climate
by a one-stop-shop and
continue to privatize state
companies

• Work on e-government has progressed significantly and “one stop shop”
for company registration will be implemented in late 2007.
• Household electricity prices will be liberalized.
• The state-owned telecom company has been listed on the stock
exchange.

The authorities and staff expect the
near-term economic outlook to remain
favorable (Table 6). Growth in 2007 is projected
to slow down, but remain robust at 4½ percent,
assuming prudent fiscal and wage policies. With
household consumption rising in line with higher
disposable incomes, domestic demand is expected
to continue driving growth. While the investment
boom should decelerate owing to the reduced tax
breaks and higher interest rates, business
confidence surveys, manufacturing orders, and
infrastructure investment plans suggest still strong
trends. While the euro area slowdown will affect
exports, a concurrent decline in imports will limit
the impact on net exports and the current account
is expected to be broadly unchanged at
2½ percent of GDP. Despite the pressures on
capacity, there are no signs of overheating as yet,
with private consumption flat and inflation
expectations stable. Headline inflation is
projected to remain at 2.6 percent, assuming
prudent macroeconomic policies and moderate
increases in administrative prices, and core
inflation will gradually rise on account of
services. This assessment is broadly in line with
BoS and consensus forecasts.

Views differed mainly on overheating risks to this outlook. Staff and BoS noted
that the tightening labor market, strong credit growth and climbing asset prices could raise
demand pressures. With growing constraints on resources as suggested by record high
capacity utilization rates and estimates of a positive output gap since 2006 (using both HPfilter and production function methodologies), overheating risks are on the rise. However, the
Ministry of Finance considered overheating risks as contained, as it viewed the economy as
growing at a higher potential rate following euro adoption, which is not captured by these
empirical estimates based on short historical series. There was agreement that external risks
can arise from higher world oil prices, and a potential disorderly unwinding of global
imbalances that would lead to euro appreciation and lower growth.
16.
The authorities concurred that near-term external and financial vulnerabilities
are contained. The risks to financial stability in Slovenia are currently low. Although the
rising reliance on cross-border capital flows exposes Slovenia to changes in investor

10
sentiment, market confidence remains high as indicated by declining spreads and solid credit
ratings (Figure 11). Debt sustainability analysis also shows that, despite rising gross debt, the
risks are contained by a large share of long-term liabilities. Net debt remains at a low
5 percent of GDP (Appendix I).
17.
There was agreement that the main risk to medium-term growth and faster
convergence arises from a failure to maintain competitiveness. Both sides noted the
experience with sluggish growth of some of the current EMU members since they adopted
the euro. In the absence of flexible fiscal and labor policies, a credit-induced boom mostly in
the nontradable sector resulted in real appreciation and loss of competitiveness (Box 2).
Reducing structural rigidities in the budget, and in the financial and labor markets was thus
crucial for demand management and growth. The authorities agreed that increases in real
wages to catch up to productivity, as currently discussed between social partners, would need
to be implemented over a longer term horizon to safeguard competitiveness.

11

Box 2. Slovenia–Lessons from Portugal and Ireland from Euro Adoption
As in Slovenia, euro adoption in Ireland and Portugal was preceded by strong growth, aided by
capital inflows. In Ireland, large FDI inflows raised productivity. Low taxes encouraged labor supply
and investment, while wage growth below productivity and skilled labor offered high returns in exportoriented activities. Upon euro adoption, Ireland continued to grow. In Portugal, credit boosted
consumption and housing while productivity growth slowed sharply as a cumbersome business
environment and excessive wage growth discouraged investment in manufacturing. A pro-cyclical fiscal
policy added to demand pressures, and led to a real appreciation. A boom-bust cycle ensued as a drop in
consumption and a loss of competitiveness stalled growth. Adjustment has been slow given limited fiscal
space, downward rigid wages and low productivity.
To avoid the low-growth trap, Slovenia should accelerate structural reforms and improve
economic flexibility. It is entering the euro zone with strong growth sustained by a foreign financed
investment boom. Although productivity growth has picked-up in recent years, low FDI and slow
technological upgrading of production are a risk for its future sustainability. Therefore, it is important to
improve allocation of investments to high productivity projects by reforms that encourage economic
flexibility.

B. Fiscal Policy
18.
Echoing the different assessments of the risks of overheating, views differed on
the need for a tighter-than-planned fiscal stance in 2007–08. The government’s fiscal
plans target an increase in the general government deficit from ¾ percent in 2006 to
1.3 percent and 1.7 percent of GDP in 2007-08 (including the railway company but without
the budgeted VAT increase, which the government plans to forego).3 This implies a
procyclical impulse—measured as a change in the primary structural balance—of about
1 percent of GDP over 2007-08. While acknowledging that potential growth estimates in a
transition economy are highly uncertain, staff viewed growth as being above potential in light
of the tightening resource constraints and recommended, at a minimum, a neutral fiscal
stance—to be achieved through reforms in areas such as the inefficient current transfers and
the wage bill. The Ministry of Finance argued that the current plans are appropriate given
uncertainties about the cyclical position of the economy. Moreover, it saw limited scope for
further expenditure rationalization in the near term.
Near-term fiscal stance is projected to be expansionary.

19.
In the medium term, the government targets a sharp decline in deficits, with a
lower tax burden to be accompanied by reductions in spending. The current plans
envisage a deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP in 2009, and a structural balance by 2011. An
ambitious tax reform is underway to reduce the high personal and corporate income taxes and
gradually eliminate the payroll tax. To accommodate the decline in revenues without
increases in indirect taxes, the authorities plan to contain wages and cut employment, and
implement stricter eligibility for, and reindexation of, social benefits. Spending will also be
reoriented towards growth-related priorities, such as R&D, active labor market policies, and

restructuring of the railway company. However, many of the required reductions in spending
are delayed to 2009 and beyond, and the measures are not yet fully identified.
20.
Staff noted that a more frontloaded consolidation with up-front expenditure
reforms would reduce risks to these targets and enhance flexibility to absorb potential
shocks. Projections for a number of budget categories appear optimistic: the expected rise in
corporate income tax collections is highly uncertain given the windfall gains in 2006 (about
½-1 percent of GDP), and the tight wage bill and capital spending budgets, particularly in an
election year, need to be backed up with more concrete measures. The planned introduction
of regional governments and modernization of the railway (about 30 percent of GDP over the
next decade) also add to spending pressures. To deal with these challenges and improve
fiscal flexibility, staff urged more up-front expenditure reforms in rigid spending. Staff’s
cross-country analysis shows room for efficiency gains in areas such as health care,
education, and social transfers.4

21.
While the authorities agreed on the desirability of expenditure reforms, they
were less concerned about risks to the fiscal targets. The authorities consider near-term
fiscal risks as contained with revenues stronger than planned and spending under control.
They also noted that recent measures to streamline social benefits and unify the registries in
2009 would reduce mandatory expenditure over the longer run, and that the fiscal burden
from railways would be eliminated by seeking public-private-partnerships. Staff welcomed
these measures, but noted that substantial fiscal risks are likely to remain given difficulties in
transferring all financial risks in a railway to the private sector. Nevertheless, the authorities
agreed with staff that speedy implementation of performance budgeting is needed to identify
more specific and durable measures to reduce inefficient spending, but only over time.
22.
The authorities acknowledged that the pension system remains an important
challenge for longer-term sustainability, but systemic reform is not politically feasible in
the near term. The public pension system faces one of the most rapidly aging populations,
lowest average retirement age, and highest pension to wages ratio in Europe. Under current
policies, the demographic pressures are expected to increase age-related expenditures from
19 percent of GDP presently to almost 28 percent by 2050, increasing the public debt to
unsustainable levels (Appendix I). Staff reiterated that systemic reforms are needed to restore
fiscal viability sooner than later with the increasing political clout of pensioners—in less than
ten years more than half of voters are retirees. Noting that pension deficits are contained for
the next decade, the authorities indicated that political support is lacking for more substantive
reform beyond the current program of “active aging”—increasing incentives to retire later—
and removal of restrictions on private pensions. In the absence of a more substantial reform,
staff recommended that the medium-term fiscal consolidation should be more ambitious to
generate savings for future pension payments.
23.
Staff proposed supporting expenditure reform with measures to strengthen the
national fiscal framework. Slovenia currently has a two–year rolling budget framework.

C. Financial Sector
24.
The authorities and staff concurred that risks from rapid credit growth,
especially to the leveraged enterprises, and foreign expansion warrant closer
monitoring. Attractive profits abroad are likely to entice further expansion of foreign
operations of Slovene banks and enterprises increasing market-related risks, while
competition for market share is likely to sustain strong credit growth despite rising credit
risks. To mitigate these risks, the authorities have stepped up supervision, including close
collaboration with foreign supervisors, and plan to broaden the coverage of credit registries.

with adverse impact on efficiency as indicated by Slovenia’s low rank on the market
contestability index (Box 3). The Bank of Slovenia noted that regulations on bank board
memberships are being improved in line with EU norms, which should help improve
efficiency through better corporate governance. In this context, staff recommended rapid
implementation of the government’s plans for bank privatization and supported the listing of
large banks and insurance companies in the stock exchange. Furthermore, a clear business
strategy, including on eventual capital needs, is needed for banks in which the government
holds important stakes. The authorities agreed in principle, although the Ministry of Finance
expressed reservations on selling the largest bank as it might open the door to a majority
foreign ownership, which it opposes until issues with home-host supervision under EU
Directives are resolved in a way that does not separate supervisory decision-making power
from the responsibility for bank failure.
Box 3. Performance of Slovene Banks in the Regional Context
Cost-to-income ratios and distance from the best-practice cost frontier show Slovene banks are
less efficient than their EU peers, especially in the three large state-dominated banks. This is
also reflected in stagnant bank profitability, in contrast with rapid improvements in much of
EU. Slovenia also ranks low within the EU on banking sector contestability index, which may
reflect still limited integration with EU markets and a dominant position of one large stateowned bank.

introduction of new laws on venture capital funds and the amendment of the law on

welcomed plans to strenghen non-bank supervision in a unified structure to ensure a balanced
development in the sector.
D. Structural Reforms
27.
The authorities agreed that reforms in the financial sector and greater labor
participation and flexibility and are needed to boost growth. To increase productivity, the
authorities have attached high priority to high-tech products in exports and value-added, as
shown by increasing R&D support in the budget. Reforms for an active aging strategy is
likely to increase labor participation by the elderly, which is low compared to EU peers. Staff
urged more substantive steps to liberalize employment protection regulations to lower the
high costs of firing and hiring, thereby enhancing labor flexibility and demand. The staff also
pointed out that structural weaknesses in the financial sector may have contributed to
problems in allocating resources to higher productivity activities. The largely bank-based
financial sector in Slovenia may have focused on providing credit to existing clients, while
studies show that arms-length systems are better at allocating resources to new firms,
technologies and activities (WEO 2006). The authorities agreed that the development of
capital markets can also make a contribution to boosting technological upgrading and
productivity.

efficiency.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL

29.
Slovenia’s recent euro zone entry is a testimony of its commitment to sound
macroeconomic policies. Fiscal prudence, income policies that kept wage growth below
productivity, and a cautious monetary stance brought down inflation and interest rates to
Maastricht levels while keeping external deficits and net debt low. Macroeconomic stability
and a deepening integration with the rest of Europe have helped sustain solid growth and
lifted the standard of living for Slovenes.
30.
Sustaining macroeconomic policy discipline while increasing attention to
structural reforms will be key for success in the euro zone. The loss of the exchange rate
instrument puts the burden of macroeconomic management on fiscal and wage policies, and
reinforces the role of economic flexibility and productivity in maintaining competitiveness.
Therefore, more emphasis is needed in Slovenia on policies that reduce structural rigidities,
especially in the fiscal and financial sectors, boost productivity, and ensure sustainable public
finances.
31.
While the outlook remains good, complacency is a risk going forward. Growth is
expected to slow down, reducing excess demand pressures, and inflation to remain contained,
assuming continued prudent wage and fiscal policies. However, tightening capacity
constraints suggest that overheating risks are rising. Sustained strong credit growth and rapid
increases in asset prices add to the risks. Given the cyclical context, the policy mix should
aim at reducing demand pressures with tight wage and fiscal policies. The current favorable

19
economic environment is an opportune time for ensuring future financial stability by
reducing vulnerabilities, and speeding up additional structural reforms.
32.
To contain inflation risks in an economy facing growing pressures on resources,
the fiscal stance in the near term should be at least neutral. Implementing the 2007-08
budget and the railway investments would add an impulse of about 1 percent of GDP to the
already strong domestic demand. A neutral stance requires a fiscal deficit of about 0.6
percent of GDP for 2007 and 0.7 percent in 2008. To preserve the gains from the lowering of
the tax burden, fiscal consolidation needs to focus on reforming the rigid and inefficient
spending structure.
33.
Over the medium term, achieving the fiscal targets without up-front spending
reforms will be difficult against declining tax revenues and mounting fiscal pressures.
While the tax reform package is commendable, it is not revenue neutral. Much of the
spending cuts to reach the medium-term fiscal targets are backloaded and measures remain to
be fully identified. Higher-than-planned wage bill and capital spending, and uncertainties in
income tax collections add to the risks. A faster and more front-loaded consolidation with
cuts in non-discretionary spending and pension reform when times are still good would not
only support balanced growth, but also increase budgetary flexibility and address longer-term
fiscal sustainability concerns from age-related spending. In the absence of substantive
pension reform, medium term fiscal consolidation should be more ambitious than envisaged.
34.
Although the financial sector is sound, the gradual rise in credit risks and
increasing exposure to foreign markets requires close monitoring. Risks from rapid credit
growth, especially to the leveraged enterprise sector, and increasing foreign activities of
banks warrants closer supervision. The active cooperation with foreign supervisors and the
establishment of a credit registry are welcome, and should be complemented by greater use
of bank specific stress tests, and vigilance on balance sheet mismatches.
35.
Using good times to reduce vulnerabilities would enhance future financial
stability. Bank profitability is under pressure from declining interest margins and loss of
foreign exchange revenue. Rapid expansion is also starting to stretch capital adequacy ratios.
Dominance by the state in the sector may be constraining competition, while the absence of
the large banks from the stock exchange weakens transparency and oversight over
management. To reduce these vulnerabilities, rapid progress should be made with bank
privatization and the large banks should be listed in the stock exchange. The government
should establish a clear strategy for banks in which it continues to hold important stakes,
including for possible capital increases, in particular if the rapid pace of expansion in their
foreign operations continues.
36.
Strengthening the role of capital markets in the economy would help contain
vulnerabilities while boosting growth. Financial development is lagging behind EU peers,
and integration with EU capital markets is at early stages. More diversified financial products

20
and deeper integration with EU networks would help lower credit risks by risk transfer and
improving access to equity finance. Plans to link the local stock exchange to EU networks,
reduce minimum return restrictions on private pensions and the adoption of laws on
investment funds and venture capital should deepen markets, help financial innovation and
access to finance of new companies. This, in turn, can speed up technological upgrading of
production and productivity growth.
37.
To maintain competitiveness, further structural reforms are needed in labor
markets and the business environment. At present the real exchange rate appears to be in
line with fundamentals. However, the high cost of doing business and rigid labor markets
have distracted FDI, and contributed to low innovation and structural change with Slovenia
falling behind its peers in gaining market share in the EU in higher technology products.
Recent initiatives for e-government, one-stop shops for company registration, and reduction
of administrative burden are commendable. Linking unemployment benefits to work
acceptance and implementation of the authorities’ “active aging” initiative should increase
labor participation. To safeguard competitiveness, firmer action is needed to implement
privatization plans and reduce the high costs of employment protection regulations.
38.
It is recommended that next Article IV Consultation with Slovenia be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Slovenia: Debt Sustainability Analysis
External sustainability
Although Slovenia’s outlook does not raise major concerns regarding external
sustainability, the recent deterioration in the external debt situation needs monitoring.
The external debt-to-GDP ratio increased by 12.6 percentage points in 2005 to 71 percent of
GDP. Under the baseline scenario, it is projected to continue rising, albeit at a slower pace,
reaching 99.5 percent in 2012 (Table A1). This increase is attributable to two main factors.
First, as part of a worldwide financial globalization trend, gross debt levels for both claims
and liabilities continue to increase. Second, current account deficit, projected at around
2.0 percent of GDP, is primarily financed through debt, as non-debt-generating capital flows,
such as FDI and equity, have a considerably smaller weight in Slovene capital inflows than
outflows. In 2005, such flows accounted for 12 percent of capital inflows and 34 percent of
outflows. As a result, Slovene net debt-to-GDP has gradually increased from -10.8 percent in
2002 to 1.5 in 2005 and is projected to reach 18 percent by 2012.
Stress tests suggest that over the medium term, Slovenia’s gross debt levels are resilient
to standard macroeconomic shocks. Bound tests show a jump in the external debt-to-GDP
ratio in 2008 by an average of 0.6 percentage points and further gradual increases to at most
103.2 percent by 2012 (3.7 points more than the baseline). A scenario with variables at
historic averages would worsen debt trends slightly, increasing debt to 104.7 percent of GDP
by 2012.
Slovene debt position is sensitive to assumptions about the size and composition of gross
capital flows. The baseline projection assumes FDI inflows in Slovenia will be 2.4 percent of
GDP and 40 percent of portfolio inflows will be in the form of equity during 2007-2012. By
historical standards, this scenario is optimistic, as FDI inflows constituted 1.7 percent of
GDP and 20 percent of portfolio inflows were in the form of equity over the past three years.
An alternative projection, based on historical averages for FDI inflows, loan inflows and
equity outflows, shows gross debt increasing to 116 percent of GDP, while net debt increases
to 28 percent of GDP by 2012.

Public debt sustainability
Slovenia’s general government debt remained at 28 percent of GDP at end-2006, well
under the debt threshold under the Maastricht criterion. A decline in fiscal deficits,
supported by growth rising to record levels in this decade, and early debt repayment
contributed to a lowering of the debt burden over the past two years. This trend marks a
reversal of debt dynamics in earlier years when government borrowing through inflationlinked instruments led to a rising debt profile despite a strong fiscal position.
Under the baseline scenario, assuming that deficits stay at currently planned levels, the
medium term debt outlook is favorable. The government medium term budget plans to
lower the deficit to around 1 percent of GDP in 2009, whereby tax reductions are broadly
offset by tightening of some non-discretionary expenditures. Primary surpluses and strong
growth would contribute to a gradual decline of the debt stock to below 26 percent of GDP
by 2012 (Table A2). The public debt position is resilient to standard shocks to growth,
interest rate and the exchange rate and public debt sustainability is not a concern in the
medium term.

For Slovenia, the main challenge to debt sustainability arise from age-related spending
pressures. With one of the fastest aging populations in Europe, and a generous pension
system, Slovenia’s debt is expected to rise rapidly after 2020 undermining its long-run fiscal
sustainability and growth prospects.

The currency of Slovenia is the euro. On June 28, 2004, Slovenia joined the ERM2 at the
central parity of SIT239.64 per euro and the authorities maintained the exchange rate within
a narrow, but unannounced band. Slovenia adopted the euro on January 1, 2007. Slovenia has

accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange system that is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
X.

Article IV Consultation

Slovenia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The 2007 mission visited
Ljubljana during March 5-16, 2007 and held discussions with the Minister of Finance,
Governor of the Bank of Slovenia, and other key economic ministers, government officials
and representatives of the Parliament, financial sector, labor, business and media. Mr.
Kiekens (Executive Director) and Ms. Maver (Adviser to the Executive Director) attended
some of the meetings.
The mission comprised Ms. P. Sorsa (Head), Mr.R Bems, and Ms. A. Tuladhar (all EUR) and
Mr. J. Andritzky (MCM).
The mission held a press conference on the concluding statement and a seminar on the
background papers on the financial and fiscal analysis. The authorities have agreed to the
publication of the staff report.
XI.

FSAP Participation and ROSCs

An FSAP mission took place during November 6–20, 2000, and follow-up meetings
were held with the authorities on February 8–9, 2001 in the context of the 2001
Article IV consultation mission. An FSSA report (Country Report No. 01/161) was
prepared on April 24, 2001 and published on September 18, 2001 (Country Report
No. 01/161). The report includes assessments of the following standards: banking
supervision, securities regulation, insurance regulation, and payments systems.
An FSAP Update mission visited Ljubljana during November 10–21, 2003. An FSSA report
(Country Report No. 04/137) was issued on April 26, 2004. The report includes assessments
of the following standards: Compliance with Basel Core Principles; insurance regulatory and
supervisory system; corporate governance; housing finance; and analyzes options for
monetary operations in the transition to EMU.
The fiscal transparency module of the fiscal ROSC was published in June 2002.

Appendix II. Slovenia: Statistical Issues
39.

Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes.

40.
Special Data Dissemination Standard: Slovenia has subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS), meets SDDS specifications, and its metadata are posted on
the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on the Internet.
http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/sddscountrycategorylist/?strcode=SVN
41.
Real Sector Statistics: The Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia (SORS)
follows the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). Quarterly GDP estimates by
industry and expenditure categories are compiled in both current and constant prices, and are
published within 80 days after the reference quarter. In September 2005, the SORS changed
the base year for compiling constant prices GDP from 2000 to the previous year’s prices and
started using the chain-link index methodology.
42.
The SORS compiles the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for
monitoring compliance with the Maastricht inflation criterion. However, price collection is
restricted to four cities and their surrounding rural areas. The weights are based on the threeyear average of expenditure data for consumer goods from continuous Household Budget
Surveys for 2002, 2003, and 2004. It also compiles a retail price index (RPI), which differs
from the consumer price index in weights only.
43.
Government Finance Statistics: Slovenian fiscal statistics are timely and of a high
quality. The ministry of finance publishes a comprehensive monthly Bulletin of Government
Finance, which presents monthly data on the operations of the “state budget” (Budgetary
Central Government), local governments, social security (Pension and Health funds), and the
consolidated general government. The coverage of general government excludes the
operations of extrabudgetary funds and own revenues of general government agencies
(zavods). However, these operations are small in size. Monthly fiscal indicators are reported
for publication in IFS on a timely basis and annual statistics covering general government
operations, including the operations of the extrabudgetary funds are reported for publication
in the Government Finance Statistic Yearbook (GFS Yearbook).
44.
The data published in the Bulletin of Government Finance are on a cash basis and
broadly use the analytical framework and classification system of the IMF’s 1986
government finance statistics methodology. The data reported for publication in the GFS
Yearbook are also on a cash basis but are recast in the analytical framework and
classifications of the Manual on Government Finance Statistics 2001(GFSM 2001).
45.
The Slovenian authorities wish to adopt the GFSM 2001 methodology, which could
then be used as a building block for the compilation of the ESA 95-based data jointly by the
Ministry of Finance and the SORS for reporting to the European Commission. To assist the
Ministry of Finance resolve several classification issues and develop a migration path, a STA
technical assistance mission visited Ljubljana in April 2006. The introduction in 2008 of a

6
new chart of accounts for all public entities based on accrual principles will greatly facilitate
the adoption of the new methodology.
46.

Money and Banking Statistics: Monetary statistics are timely and of good quality.

47.
Balance of Payments Statistics: Balance of payments data are comprehensive and of
high quality. The data have been published in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook
since 1993 (with estimates of the international investment position published since 1994). In
2002, the Bank of Slovenia revised the balance of payments statistics going back to 1994; the
most significant revisions were related to the income component of the current account and
to the other investment component of the financial account.
48.
External Debt Statistics: External debt statistics were revised and brought in line
with the SDDS in August 2003. The main change comprised the inclusion of trade credits in
the debt data.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Slovenia
On May 18, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Slovenia.1
Background
Economic performance strengthened in 2006, supported by a recovery in investment and
continued growth spillovers from the European Union. Declining real interest rates in the run-up
to euro adoption on January 1, 2007 helped sustain credit growth and domestic demand.
The strong economy boosted job creation, while unemployment declined and capacity utilization
reached record high levels. In this environment, prudent incomes policies helped contain wage
pressures, which, along with receding oil prices, sustained price stability.
Growth is projected to slow down slightly in 2007–08, as the investment boom decelerates.
Domestic demand should remain the primary driver of growth as private consumption is
expected to rise in line with higher disposable incomes and employment. Inflation is expected
to remain broadly stable, assuming continued prudent policies. Overheating is a key risk—with
tightening capacity constraints, the boost to demand from continued strong credit growth,
climbing asset prices, and wage increases can unleash price pressures. Other risks to the
outlook arise from higher world oil prices and euro appreciation.
While Slovenia’s fiscal deficit narrowed in 2006, the authorities’ fiscal plans for 2007 imply an
expansionary fiscal stance despite the overheating risks and major medium-term policy
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

challenges. The general government deficit amounted to ¾ percent of GDP in 2006, reflecting
strong cyclical and one-off gains in revenues as well as a tighter-than-planned wage bill. In
2007, the government has started to implement an ambitious tax reform, which will lower
revenues over a few years, and to increase infrastructure spending, which will be only partially
offset by a tight wage bill and reforms in expenditures. These fiscal plans imply increases in the
general government deficit to 1.3 percent and 1.7 percent of GDP in 2007–08, with a procyclical
fiscal impulse of about 1 percent of GDP over the period. Over the medium term, the authorities
target a deficit of about 1 percent of GDP in 2009 and structural balance by 2011, for which
measures remain to be fully identified. With one of the most rapidly aging populations in Europe,
the pension burden is also a major longer-term challenge for fiscal sustainability.
Cross-border integration of the financial sector has been on the rise as banks continued their
borrowings abroad to finance strong domestic credit demand and expand their foreign
operations. Despite increased vulnerability to credit risks and pressures on profitability, the
financial sector remains sound to deal with these risks. Nevertheless, the largely state-owned
banking sector is relatively inefficient by regional and EU standards and capital market
development lags behind European Monetary Union (EMU) peers.
The main challenge to Slovenia’s medium-term performance is to maintain competitiveness.
Strong export growth and indicators of real exchange rate misalignment presently do not
indicate a lack of competitiveness. Yet, sluggish growth in export market shares in the EU
underscores the need for stronger technological upgrading of exports and productivity growth.
Structural rigidities in the budget and in the labor and financial markets suppress economic
flexibility, which contains potential growth and Slovenia’s ability to deal with adverse shocks.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Slovenia’s successful euro zone entry in January 2007, which
was underpinned by sound macroeconomic policies that have allowed the full observance of the
Maastricht Treaty convergence criteria. Economic growth has been robust and is projected to
remain above the EU average for the next few years, while unemployment has continued to
decline and inflation remains low and stable.
Looking forward, Directors observed that important challenges remain. They stressed that, to
ensure successful euro area membership and sustained convergence, a strong commitment to
fiscal and wage prudence and accelerated structural reforms will need to be maintained.
The current favorable environment should be used to reduce structural rigidities and financial
vulnerabilities, boost productivity and competitiveness, diminish state intervention in the
economy, and improve the sustainability of public finances. Directors also noted that
overheating risks remain and should be monitored closely.
Directors questioned the procyclical fiscal stimulus in 2007–08 implied by the government’s
fiscal plans at this cyclical juncture and recommended a neutral fiscal stance. To this end, they
suggested that the consolidation should focus on reforming the rigid and inefficient spending
structure.

3

Directors emphasized that, over the medium term, fiscal policy needs to deal with the
challenges of an aging population while ensuring that the government’s target of a structural
balance can be achieved. They noted that, while reforms to reduce the tax burden are welcome,
expenditure measures to support these targets remain to be fully identified and that the
envisaged adjustment is backloaded. Therefore, up-front reforms in nondiscretionary spending
and the relatively generous pension system would not only ensure a balanced expansion, but
enhance budgetary efficiency and flexibility and address long-term fiscal sustainability concerns.
Directors encouraged the authorities to take steps to forge the necessary political consensus for
early reforms.
Directors observed that, while the banking system remains sound, Slovene banks are less
profitable and efficient than their EU counterparts. Directors noted the pressure on bank
profitability from declining interest margins, high costs, and state dominance in the banking
sector, and encouraged the authorities to take measures to increase bank competition and
efficiency, including privatization of state-dominated banks. Given the rapid credit expansion
and increasing foreign activities of banks, Directors welcomed the steps being taken to
strengthen bank supervision, including increased cooperation and information-sharing with
foreign bank supervisors, and urged supervisors to closely monitor credit risks and exposures to
foreign markets.
Directors noted that Slovenia’s capital market development lags behind EU levels, resulting in
heavy dependence on bank intermediation and in corporate leverage ratios that are well above
the euro-area average. They therefore commended the authorities’ efforts to foster integration
with EU financial markets, which will expand saving and financing options and help strengthen
the financial sector’s contribution to Slovenia’s development.
Directors stressed that further reforms in labor markets and the business environment would
enhance competitiveness and Slovenia’s long-run growth potential. They welcomed recent
initiatives to remove administrative barriers to doing business, and called for additional efforts to
attract foreign direct investment. While they also welcomed the improved incentives to work,
Directors emphasized that increasing labor market flexibility further will require easing of
employment protection regulations. Some Directors also questioned the sustainability of
improving competitiveness by keeping wage increases below productivity gains.

Statement by Willy Kiekens, Executive Director for the Republic of Slovenia
and Ksenija Maver, Advisor to Executive Director
May 18, 2007
The Slovene authorities appreciate the staff's work and meaningful consultations, as well as
the staff’s report and assessment of economic developments in Slovenia.
Euro adoption
The introduction of the Euro on January 1, 2007 was smooth and with low costs for
companies and households. It is estimated that the changeover to the Euro caused a minimal
increase in inflation, only about 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points. Reduced transaction costs,
absence of exchange rate risk, and low Euro area interest rates have added momentum to the
economy. Also, confidence in the economy has strengthened further. The Euro adoption
process was facilitated by a decade of prudent macroeconomic and financial policies. These
policies have laid ground for further economic expansion and job creation.
Economic developments in the first quarter of 2007
Slovenia’s economic growth accelerated from 4 percent in 2004 – 2005 to 5.2 percent in
2006. This positive trend has thus far also continued in 2007. The first quarter recorded an
increase of 9.3 percent in industrial production and 18 percent in exports over the same
period in 2006. Wage increases continue to be moderate, at 3.1 percent year-on-year in the
first two months of 2007.
Inflation is low. Since early 2005, headline inflation (HIPC) is practically unchanged at about
2.5 percent. After a small pick up in the last quarter of 2006, core inflation declined to
1.5 - 1.7 percent.
Fiscal developments in the first quarter of 2007 seem to be on track and consistent with a
budget deficit target of 0.9 percent. Total government revenues are broadly in line with the
projections. Expenditures continue to be on a downward trend.
The business climate indicator also remained high, at its peak level since 1996.
On May 16, 2007, Slovenia received OECD’s invitation to start negotiations for membership.
Short-term economic outlook
Considering these positive economic trends and the improved economic climate in some of
Slovenia’s important trading partners, forecasts for 2007 – 2009 have been revised upwards.
Strong investment activity and employment growth are expected to contribute to an
expansion in the economy’s potential supply capacity. The government’s base scenario
projects economic growth at 4.7 percent for this year, which is slightly above the staff’s
4.5 percent forecast. For the remaining period until 2009, growth is expected to remain above

2
4 percent, hence facilitating the process of real convergence with the EU. The expansion
during the period 2007 – 2009 is expected to be driven mostly by domestic demand, but the
contribution made by net trade will be positive.
The favorable growth in aggregate demand is expected to exceed the output potential
marginally, but the risks for inflation are considered moderate given the expected
continuation of moderate low growth of labor costs. The 2007 – 2008 inflation is expected to
exceed, the 2005 – 2006 level of 2.5 percent only slightly, by 0.2 percentage points, mostly
because of the prices for food and services. But in 2009, it is expected to return to its present
level of 2.6 percent.
Financial sector
The staff rightly points out that deepening EU financial integration and liberalized capital
flows bring about new challenges, especially to small and open economies like Slovenia.
There is no doubt that the stability and soundness of the financial system, a robust
macroeconomic environment and increased coordination among supervisors make up the first
line of defense. In Europe, financial sector consolidation has been advanced primarily at a
national level. However, EU-wide integration is becoming more significant. In most central
European countries, a large share of the banking sector is foreign owned. Although these
banks are often of systemic importance in the host country, they are supervised by the
authorities of the home country according to EU banking supervision directives. The Slovene
authorities place great emphasis on improving for these banks the flow of information
between bank supervisors, enhancing risk management and improving the cost sharing
arrangements in crisis situations between home and host countries. Discussions of these
issues at the EU level would be timely and welcome.
In early May, the government decided to list on the stock exchange, by the end of this year,
the second largest state-owned bank and offer 49 percent of the shares to institutional and
individual investors. Floating the remaining shares will be decided at a later stage. For now,
the long term strategy is to keep at least 25 percent plus one share under the control of the
state. The government aims at building a strong financial conglomerate around this bank and
including three predominately state-owned insurance companies. The revenues from this sale
would be used for reducing public debt.
Structural agenda
With the Euro adoption successfully completed and the convergence criteria met, structural
policies will be critical for Slovenia to benefit fully from its participation in the Euro zone. In
this regard, some important steps have been taken.
As a result of the government’s Program of Measures for Reducing Administrative Burden,
competitiveness has been increased through improved quality of administrative services and
simplified procedures. In line with this program more than thirty measures have been
adopted. Each new regulation must now pass a test that its implementation can be efficient.

3
Establishing new businesses, especially small ones, has been facilitated. A portal called
“e-VEM” has been recently launched, providing user friendly services such as registration in
Slovenia’s business register and providing essential information for entrepreneurs, including
on taxation. The portal will be further improved and constantly updated.
Slovenia’s integration in the global economy is deepening mainly through trade and outward
investments. Inward foreign direct investment that would promote technological restructuring
in Slovenia’s manufacturing sector is still relatively modest. Thus, the authorities plan to
improve further the competitiveness and flexibility of the economy, including by providing
larger support for R&D. In this context, some important measures are under preparation.
In the fiscal sector, the government plans to make the budget more flexible and to reform the
pension and health care systems to contain the costs as the population ages.
