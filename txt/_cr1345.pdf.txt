STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 30, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. Sound macroeconomic management and strong economic performance continued
in 2012, and the economy is now running close to its potential. Economic activity was driven
by investment, as the weak external environment took a toll on exports and deteriorated the
external current account. Against the background of an exchange rate broadly in line with
fundamentals, the authorities’ policies have been geared toward managing a surge in capital
inflows by intervening in the foreign exchange market and sterilizing the liquidity created,
while at the same time rebuilding fiscal buffers. For 2013, real GDP growth is expected to
remain around potential and inflation to continue to fall as supply shocks unwind.
Risks. The outlook remains favorable but risks remain. On the downside, the economy is
most vulnerable in the short term to a growth shock in China that permeates through lower
commodity prices. A prolonged period of low growth in the U.S. economy could also hamper
Peru’s economy over the medium term. On the upside, risks to growth and inflation could
result from ample global liquidity and capital inflows in the context of low growth in
advanced economies. Over the medium term, the economic outlook hinges on bolstering
resilience to shocks and realizing productivity growth.
Near-term policy mix. The overall policy stance is broadly appropriate as the economy is
growing close to potential, inflation is expected to converge to the middle of the target
band, and capital inflows are expected to ease. The fiscal policy focus on achieving fiscal
surpluses and attending to immediate social needs while continuing to build fiscal buffers is
adequate. Monetary policy should remain flexible and react to changes in domestic and
global conditions. The authorities are committed to maintaining policies flexible, to address
downside risks from the global economy as well as upside risks associated with large capital
inflows.
Medium-term challenges. To support more socially inclusive growth, Peru will need to
implement structural reforms to cement high sustainable growth. This will require
improvements in productivity and competitiveness by boosting human capital and
maintaining labor market flexibility. It will be important to remove infrastructure bottlenecks,
improve further the business climate, and develop the local capital markets. Strengthening
the fiscal framework would require adopting a fiscal anchor that treats adequately Peru’s
non-renewable wealth and reduces pro-cyclicality.

CONTEXT
Following a decade of record-high growth, economic performance continued to be
remarkably good in 2012. The economy decelerated somewhat and is running near
potential despite weak external demand. Inflation slowed and is now within the target
band. The current account deteriorated as export prices fell. Capital inflows surged,
prompting sizable interventions by the central bank. Monetary conditions were tightened
using higher reserve requirements and placements of central bank securities. The fiscal
position strengthened, assisting the central bank in the sterilization of the capital inflows.

1.
Peru’s macroeconomic performance over the past decade has been exceptional. After a
period of prudent macroeconomic policies, ambitious structural reforms, positive terms of trade and
large direct foreign investment, Peru emerged as

2.
The Peruvian economy weathered the global financial crisis of 2008–09 relatively well.
The economy was only temporarily affected by the global crisis due to a well-designed contracyclical policy response that prevented a credit crunch, supported economic activity and sustained
employment. In particular, the central bank (BCRP) dropped its policy rate by 525 basis points to
1¼ percent in 2009, and the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MEF) engineered a fiscal impulse of
about 1¼ percent of GDP. The rapid policy response managed to contain the deceleration in real
GDP growth to 1 percent in 2009, and the economy responded to the expansionary policies growing
by 8¾ percent in 2010. As the policy stimulus was phased out during the second half of 2010 and
2011—with BCRP raising the policy rate gradually to 4¼ percent, and MEF implementing a fiscal
withdrawal of 1¾ percent of GDP—economic growth moderated to 7 percent in 2011.
3.
Economic growth gradually slowed toward potential in 2012. Real GDP growth is
estimated to have moderated further to 6⅓ percent in 2012, with the output gap closing by end2012. Activity has been driven by investment, as the weak external environment is taking a toll on
exports.


Strong domestic demand. This was driven by an acceleration of public investment, which
expanded by 29¼ percent in real terms (yoy) in the first three quarters of 2012
(compensating for an unexpected fall of a similar magnitude in 2011), while private

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PERU

investment grew by 14½ percent in real terms (yoy) (particularly in construction). Private
consumption supported the economic expansion by growing about 6 percent in real terms
in the same period. Altogether, domestic demand expanded by 7½ percent in real terms
(yoy) during the first three quarters of 2012, surpassing real GDP growth of 6⅓ percent (yoy).


Weak external demand. Net exports have remained a drag on economic growth as export
growth decelerated to 5¼ percent in real terms (yoy) in the first three quarters of 2012 (from
around 9 percent the year before) due to lower external demand and weak export prices,
while import growth remained strong, at around 11 percent in real terms (yoy) in the same
period.

Intervention. The BCRP intervened in the foreign exchange (FX) market with a net purchase
of some US$13 billion in 2012 to avoid a sharp appreciation of the currency in the context of
a dollarized economy (about ⅓ of deposits and less than ½ of credits in the banking system

are in U.S. dollars). Gross international reserves, reaching US$64 billion (32 percent of GDP),
are adequate by any reserve adequacy metric and are among the highest in emerging
market economies. Despite the large intervention, the nuevo sol appreciated by 3¾ percent
(yoy) vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar and by almost 9 percent (yoy) in real effective terms during
January-November 2012.


Sterilization. The BCRP controlled the liquidity generated from its intervention by placing its
own securities with domestic financial institutions, and relying more heavily on higher
reserve requirements in nuevos soles to supplement its sterilization efforts (with a hike of
225 basis points on reserve requirements during 2012 and an increase of 25 basis points in
early 2013). These monetary operations sterilized about 70 percent of the liquidity generated
by the intervention. Fiscal sterilization—via public sector deposits at the BCRP—also played
an important role in the first part of the year thanks to a larger-than-budgeted fiscal surplus.
FX intervention was accompanied by increasing sterilization costs, which staff estimates at
about ¼ percent of GDP in 2012.

Average Fiscal Balance to GDP (2002-12)

6.
The fiscal stance was tighter than envisaged in the 2012 budget. The non-financial
public sector (NFPS) overall surplus is estimated to have reached over 2 percent of GDP in 2012,
(higher than the 1 percent surplus included in the



Modified rule. In April 2012, the authorities modified the current expenditure limit under
the fiscal rule, mainly by excluding infrastructure maintenance from the expenditure cap (to
align it with public investment), as well as current expenditures associated with some social
programs and equipment for military and police forces due to higher social and security
needs. In addition, the authorities introduced a temporary target on the structural fiscal
balance (which controls for commodity prices) requiring an annual adjustment of at least
0.2 percent of GDP to maintain a fiscal path consistent with reaching zero structural balance
over the medium term. However, the structural balance objective was achieved ahead of
schedule by end-2012 due to the stronger-than-expected fiscal outcome, and the proposed
fiscal adjustment is no longer binding for 2013 as the fiscal accounts have already reached a

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

PERU

small structural surplus.1 Moreover, the 2013 budget approved in December 2012 eliminated
the temporary target on the structural fiscal balance introduced in April 2012 and proposed
a non-deficit overall fiscal target for 2013. In the absence of new initiatives, the rule in place
before April 2012 will be reinstated in 2014 (although a new system is expected to be in
place by the time the 2014 budget is discussed in Congress).


Tax administration measures: After receiving special transitory powers from Congress in
June 2012, the government enacted a number of measures which focused on strengthening
compliance and enforcement. The measures included: (i) stiffer penalties for customs and tax
law infractions; (ii) changes to the tax code to reduce over-reliance on tax tribunals;
(iii) deduction limits on research and development and other expenditures; (iv) modifications
to transfer pricing laws; and (v) changes in administrative procedures of customs, value
added tax, and other tax laws with a view toward providing more discretion to the tax
revenue agency (SUNAT). These measures should yield significant revenues in the mediumterm as they take effect.

7.
A commission was appointed to revamp the macro–fiscal framework. The current fiscal
framework embedded in the fiscal responsibility and transparency law of 1999, which had a real
current expenditure growth limit of 4 percent and a cap on the deficit of 1 percent of GDP, has
served Peru well. It has resulted in significant debt reduction and public sector savings that proved
useful when implementing the fiscal stimulus during the 2008‒09 global financial crisis. However,
the framework does not prevent fiscal policy from being pro–cyclical and does not steer sufficiently
the management of nonrenewable resources. To improve the framework, a commission was
appointed in July 2012, consisting of domestic and international fiscal experts, and is expected to
provide recommendations in early 2013. Although there is no deadline for the commission to
finalize its report, the government is likely to adopt a strengthened fiscal framework in the
formulation of the 2014 budget (Box 1).

exchange credit risks) aimed to strengthen financial stability. The non-performing loans (NPL) ratio
remains low (at 1¾ percent as of August 2012) and well–provisioned. Overall, private credit growth
has fallen to around 16½ percent (yoy) for the first ten months of 2012, with significant growth in
the consumer and mortgage segments—both also reporting a pickup in U.S. dollar lending.
Outstanding foreign currency credit stands at 43 percent of total credit and could potentially
exacerbate the impact of external shocks via foreign exchange effects on balance sheets. In order to
deter external financing, the authorities extended in May 2012 the 60 percent reserve requirements
on foreign liabilities to those with maturity up to 3 years (from 2 years) and imposed a 20 percent
reserve requirement on foreign liabilities with maturity higher than 3 years.2 While housing prices
have increased lately, it seems driven by strong demand from creditworthy households and
shortages of housing in several metropolitan areas (Box 2).
9.
Despite a widening current account deficit, external stability risks remain contained.
The current account deficit widened from 2 percent in 2011 to about 3½ percent of GDP in 2012
mostly due to deteriorated terms of trade, weak volume growth in mineral exports and strong
growth in import volume. The authorities also noted that the current account deficit could be
overestimated by about ½ percent of GDP due to under-recording of gold exports, as illegal gold
production is no longer intermediated through legal traders. However, the current account deficit
continues to be more than covered by high FDI, projected at 5 percent of GDP in 2012. Short-term
capital inflows rebounded in the second quarter, with a cumulative inflow of 1¾ percent of GDP in
the first three quarters of 2012.
10.
Structural reforms continued to be implemented. These reform initiatives include the tax
administration measures and efforts to revamp the fiscal framework mentioned above, as well as
approval of new labor regulations for the armed forces and gradual wage increases for civil servants
estimated at about ¼ per cent of GDP per year during the next five years starting in 2013. The
reform of the private pension system adopted in July 2012 aims at increasing competition through
raising the number of total workers included in the private funds from the current 30 to 40 percent
of the workforce (requiring workers earning 1.5 times the monthly minimum wage to contribute
10 percent of their income to a pension fund) and lowering the fees for pension contributors. Private
pension funds are administrated by four major private companies (AFPs) and total about
US$34 billion (18 percent of GDP), with investments abroad accounting for 27 percent of total assets
against an operating limit of 32 percent (and a legal maximum of 50 percent). In addition, the
authorities presented a number of proposals to Congress for capital market reform aimed at
improving good governance regulations, encouraging issuance of debt, simplifying procedures and
reducing costs, and establishing special programs for qualified investors; and a plan to expedite the
execution of public-private partnerships investment projects.

2

The BCRP also reduced reserve requirements on trade credit from 60 percent to 25 percent in light of uncertain
global conditions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PERU

11.
Social tensions remain a key concern. While significant progress has been made in the
last decade in reducing poverty and improving standards of living, some social indicators are below
those in other countries with the same level of income. The government has promoted socially
inclusive growth policies consistent with macroeconomic stability. However, persistent social
conflicts and slow progress in social inclusion remain a concern. There are some 250 active social
conflicts, with the majority related to protests about extractive industry projects in rural areas, on the
grounds of environmental destruction and inadequate compensation to local communities. While
the majority of mining and gas projects have progressed without problems, protestors have been
disruptive in several cases. At the same time, teachers and doctors have gone on strike to protest
low salaries.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
The near-term outlook remains favorable despite the adverse external environment, but
subject to risks. In particular, negative terms of trade shocks could reduce exports,
investment and growth; while ample global liquidity and capital inflows could lead to
overheating.
12.
The near-term outlook remains favorable,
with real GDP growth projected at potential. In
staff’s baseline scenario, similar to that of the
authorities, the output gap closes at end-2012 and
growth stabilizes at around potential (6−6½ percent)
supported by domestic demand and elevated
commodity prices. Inflation is expected to remain
subdued and converging to the mid-point of the
target band (1−3 percent). Capital inflows are expected
to ease as: (i) the foreigners’ portfolio shift towards
Peruvian assets is accommodated; (ii) the supply of
additional investment instruments is limited; and
(iii) the appetite for Peruvian risk moderates.

13.
However, the global outlook poses significant risks to the economy in both directions.
As revealed during the global financial crisis of 2008−09, Peru is vulnerable to a collapse in global
trade and uncertainty about global growth, but it is now better positioned to deal with financial
shocks.


10

Downside risks from the global economy could have a significant impact on Peru
primarily through terms of trade shocks. Global growth stagnation due to continued
uncertainty in the euro zone will especially hurt Peru's exports, while its financial exposure to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PERU

the euro zone is limited.3 However, the combination of a sharp relapse in global growth and
a return of global risk aversion is the principal tail risk that could encumber the growth
outlook. In particular, a significant fall in metal prices—triggered by a larger-than-envisaged
slowdown in China, Peru’s largest trading partner—would have a significant negative effect
on exports, investment and growth prospects.


Upside risks could result from ample global liquidity and capital inflows in a context of
anemic growth in advanced economies. Peru’s combination of long-standing
macroeconomic stability and prudent policy management with positive growth prospects
could further stimulate large and sustained capital inflows that could test the absorption
capacity of the economy and pose significant policy challenges. Strong capital inflows could
result in buoyant domestic demand dynamics, heightened overheating risks and potential
credit and asset price booms.

14.
Notwithstanding the favorable medium-term outlook, important challenges remain. As
Peru continues to benefit from steady terms of trade and as investments in natural resources mature,
staff projects the economy to grow at around potential (6 percent) and inflation in the mid-point of
the target band (2 percent) over the medium term. The current account deficit is projected to
moderate (towards 3 percent of GDP) as global conditions normalize. Overall, primary fiscal surpluses
are expected to be anchored at around 2 percent of GDP, while public debt ratios will continue to
decline to below 15 percent of GDP. Going forward, the economic outlook hinges on bolstering
resilience to shocks and fostering productivity growth. In addition to continued prudent
macroeconomic policies, it will be important to identify key infrastructure projects to close the
infrastructure gap, promote a dynamic (but stable) financial system, and ensure a more socially
inclusive growth strategy.

3

One of the links to the euro zone is through the Spanish bank BBVA, which co-owns one of the largest banks in Peru
(BBVA Continental) with a domestic investor; the bank is well-capitalized, liquid, and boasts a large domestic deposit
base. The ownership structure and the regulations of the Superintendency of Banks, make it very difficult for this bank
to provide credit to the parent bank in Europe.

CHALLENGES AND POLICY DISCUSSIONS
With the economy close to potential but external risks looming large, discussions focused
on: (i) the appropriate near-term policy mix; (ii) dealing with additional global spillovers;
and (iii) policies to reinforce high growth prospects over the medium term. Under the
baseline scenario, the overall policy stance is broadly appropriate as it envisages inflation
converging to the middle of the target band and continues to facilitate the buildup of
fiscal buffers. Policy discussions emphasized the need for policy flexibility going forward
given the uncertain global environment.

A. Near–Term Policy Mix

The 2013 budget aims at maintaining a small fiscal surplus, which is broadly consistent
with staff’s previous recommendations. The approved 2013 budget targets a fiscal surplus of
1.1 percent of GDP, in line with the multi-year macroeconomic framework published in mid-2012.
The authorities noted that the 2013 budget includes a number of measures to strengthen tax
compliance. Staff estimates that the fiscal surplus for

expansion of about ½ percent of GDP in 2013, which is mildly pro-cyclical—largely due to the
higher-than-budgeted surplus in 2012. Prudent implementation of the 2013 budget is expected,
which will help to continue rebuilding policy buffers.
16.
The central bank remains vigilant to react to risks associated with strong domestic
demand dynamics, large capital inflows and rapid credit growth. The BCRP has kept the policy
rate unchanged as core inflation was within the target, the economy stayed close to potential and
the external environment remained uncertain (Box 3). In parallel, hikes in average reserve
requirements have resulted in tighter liquidity conditions to dampen strong credit growth. In view of
the expected fall in inflation in 2013, the central bank decision to keep policy rates on hold is
adequate as inflation expectations remain well–anchored. While the central bank acknowledged that
there was scope for further hikes in average reserve requirements, they underscored the risks of
domestic financial disintermediation in the context of easy access to external financing. The proactive
use of reserve requirements, in coordination with other prudential measures, should help in

containing risks associated with excess liquidity and
strong private credit dynamics. Under staff’s baseline
scenario, capital inflows are expected to moderate
significantly in 2013, alleviating appreciation pressure
on the nuevo sol. Fiscal and monetary policy should
be used to mitigate inflationary and demand
pressures. If these inflows prove higher than
expected, a policy of intervention/sterilization would
be appropriate to avoid excessive exchange rate
movements.

With the exchange rate level remaining broadly in line with fundamentals, discussions

economy, but do not target a pre-determined level of the exchange rate. The authorities emphasized
that the exchange rate was broadly in line with fundamentals (see Annex I for a detailed analysis).4

The proactive use of prudential measures is welcome, but further efforts may be

nuevo sol. Prudential regulation has been strengthened, including: (i) liquidity requirements in line
with Basel III criteria; (ii) higher provisioning and capital requirements, especially in relation to
mortgages and long-term consumption lending (to help financial institutions internalize foreign
exchange credit risks); and (iii) targeted measures to discourage FX lending in automobile and other
consumer loans (especially those related to revolving credit). Tighter limits in the derivative and
foreign exchange positions of banks may also help reduce incentives for FX lending. However,
existing regulation may prove insufficient in light of the expected appreciation of the nuevo sol and
easy U.S. dollar funding conditions. In this regard, staff suggested prudential measures that could
penalize more heavily FX lending at long-term maturities (i.e., lower loan to value ratios for
mortgages) as well as strengthening supervision to ensure that banks adequately assess FX credit
risks. The authorities have also adopted key measures in the national plan for combating money
laundering (Box 4).

B. Dealing with Global Spillovers
19.
Preserving policy flexibility is essential given the two-sided risks to the outlook. The
authorities acknowledged the policy challenges faced by the uncertain outlook for Peru during 2013
and recognized that it may require further policy coordination between the fiscal, monetary and
financial authorities to manage distinct macroeconomic challenges. In assessing global risks, the
authorities noted that Peru would be most vulnerable to a shock from lingering U.S. fiscal policy
uncertainty and also to a growth shock that permeates through lower commodity prices in the short
term; while a prolonged lack of a medium-term plan for U.S. fiscal consolidation would hamper
Peru’s economy over the medium term. Although these events have low probability, the impact on
the Peruvian economy could be high (Box 5).
20.
Peru is well-positioned to cope with negative spillovers. Under a scenario of global
financial disruption and a surge in risk aversion which leads to a reversal of capital inflows, the
central bank can deploy substantial actions to maintain confidence and ensure orderly functioning of
financial markets. The high tenure of sovereign domestically-issued debt held by nonresidents makes
Peru vulnerable to a rapid reversal in risk sentiment. Higher exchange rate flexibility in combination
with the use of reserves, liquidity buffers, repo operations and dollar swap auctions can ensure
liquidity in the financial system and avoid a credit squeeze, in line with the authorities’ adequate
response during the 2008 Lehman crisis. Under a long-term global stagnation scenario, monetary
and macro-prudential policies should be relaxed as the first line of defense to support economic
activity, and ease the adjustment. If a sharp deterioration in terms of trade materializes, a fiscal
stimulus—in conjunction with the above—could be effective to ease the adjustment in economic
activity and employment.
21.
The authorities noted that, if upside risks materialize, policy coordination may prove
challenging to ensure a timely and effective response to overheating risks. In the context of
large capital inflows and strong domestic demand dynamics, a multipronged and more coordinated
policy response may be needed to confront demand pressures and overheating risks. Under this

scenario, the authorities noted that tightening monetary conditions will need to rely on a
combination of quantitative measures, including reserve requirements, hikes in policy rates and
higher exchange rate flexibility. In parallel, tighter prudential measures would help prevent the
buildup of financial underlying vulnerabilities in light of rapid credit growth. In coordination with
warranted adjustment in macroeconomic policies, the authorities noted that additional targeted,
transparent and temporary capital flow measures, including those to ease limits on investments
abroad by the private pension funds or to deter external financing through hikes in the reserve
requirement on external liabilities or in the withholding tax for nonresidents’ capital gains, may be
used in response to a surge in capital inflows. If upside risks materialize, fiscal policy may need to
play a countercyclical role in order to avoid generating additional demand pressures and thus
support monetary policy. In the event the surge in capital inflows are of a permanent nature, FX
intervention would be limited to smoothing the adjustment and the exchange rate would need to
play a key role and appreciate to keep the exchange rate in line with the evolving fundamentals.

C. Medium-Term Challenges to Ensure High Economic Growth
22.
An ambitious reform agenda is needed to enhance potential growth and support a
more socially inclusive growth strategy. Staff concurs with the authorities’ view that economic
growth will need to be increasingly driven by higher productivity. Staff also agrees with the
authorities on the need to deepen structural reforms. Key pillars include: (i) enhancing
competitiveness by boosting human capital and maintaining labor market flexibility; (ii) defining a
nationwide strategy to remove infrastructure bottlenecks; (iii) improving the business climate further
to foster investment and innovation (including enhancing formality and strengthening institutions);
and (iv) further developing local capital markets to facilitate investment and better allocate savings.
These reforms, together with more effective implementation of social programs in line with the
agenda of the Ministry of Social Development and Inclusion, will enable the authorities to deliver
more socially inclusive economic growth.

Since elevated commodity prices are expected to persist over the medium term, the
authorities have the opportunity to put the economy on a high and sustainable growth path.
The authorities agreed on the need to define a comprehensive public investment strategy that
upgrades infrastructure and removes bottlenecks. This will require identifying infrastructure needs
and capacity constraints at the national and sub-national levels, establishing priorities for large
investment projects, and evaluating financing needs while identifying opportunities for public-private
partnerships over the medium term. An investment strategy is bound to be costly and needs to be
carefully integrated in the budget over time. Adopting a firm and prudent medium-term fiscal policy
would help contain other short run expenditure pressures, while laying the basis for balanced
economic growth and equitable spending across generations.
24.
Strengthening the fiscal framework would require adopting an adequate fiscal anchor
that manages Peru’s non-renewable wealth appropriately. Building on the success of Peru’s Fiscal
Responsibility and Transparency Law in reducing public debt and ensuring fiscal responsibility, the
authorities noted that a fiscal anchor should enhance the predictability of public spending growth

16

PERU

over the medium term taking into account commodity prices and intergenerational equity in the use
of nonrenewable resource wealth. Staff discussed with the authorities alternatives for the fiscal
anchor, including modifications to the current rules, adoption of a structural balance, and the
possibility of adopting a non-resource primary balance (NRPB) (i.e., excluding non-renewable
resource taxation and interest payments) over the medium term to enhance fiscal savings.5 However,
given capacity constraints, as shown by the under-execution of public expenditure in the last two
years, fiscal savings in the short term could be partially deployed as capacity expands to ensure highquality investment. The authorities recognized the challenge of establishing a fiscal anchor that
balances the need for savings arising from intergenerational equity and fiscal risks,6 with expenditure
pressures to close the infrastructure and social gaps. Over the medium term, the authorities saw
merit on running a small overall fiscal surplus to address unexpected contingencies, but
acknowledged strong expenditure pressures. In parallel, a comprehensive strategy to manage public
savings effectively will be needed without restricting flexibility for fiscal policy formulation. Staff
noted that a strong political commitment as well as the steady implementation of a fiscal rule is
equally important. Once the new fiscal rule is adopted, the practice of adopting supplementary
budgets would undermine the rule and should be discontinued when possible. Moreover, a
communications strategy should be developed to gain public support for fiscal savings in Peru under
the current elevated commodity price cycle. Over the medium term, the authorities agreed that
increases in current expenditure should be moderated to avoid challenges to macroeconomic
management. Staff looks forward to the report of the fiscal commission which is expected to address
these issues.
25.
The authorities’ efforts to strengthen tax administration are welcomed, but mediumterm tax targets are ambitious. The authorities noted that Peru’s tax collections are low compared
with other emerging markets in terms of revenue mobilization and tax effort (i.e., the ratio of actual
revenues to potential) while investment and public social spending is lower than in other emerging
economies with similar per-capita income. In line with Fund technical assistance recommendations,
the authorities have undertaken legal changes in closing tax loopholes, approved the law
strengthening the institutional framework of the SUNAT and the comprehensive overhaul of the
organization of SUNAT. Also, the authorities’ efforts to raise tax compliance are likely to bear
significant results given the high level of informality. In this regard, the government’s goal of raising
tax revenues to 18 percent of GDP by 2016 will allow the country to achieve similar tax-collection
ratios as in other emerging economies and will enable an expansion of social programs. Staff
encouraged the authorities to take the necessary measures to ensure that the ambitious tax objective
is achieved.
5

The primary fiscal balance consistent with debt sustainability is -½ percent of GDP (see Annex II on debt
sustainability analysis). A strong fiscal position consistent with debt sustainability and full savings of the nonrenewable resource revenue (currently 4 percent of GDP) would yield a NRPB of -½ percent of GDP. The NRPB over
the medium term is projected to be -2¼ percent of GDP, which is consistent with saving about 60 percent of the nonrenewable resource revenue.
6

Significant fiscal risks are associated with contingent liabilities and natural disasters, since Peru is vulnerable to
earthquakes and climate change (as well as the “El Niño”/”La Niña” effects).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

PERU

26.
Further enhancing financial supervision and prudential measures may be needed to
limit the buildup of systemic risks. The authorities recognized that large capital inflows to Peru risk
fuelling future credit and asset price booms. The presence of financial conglomerates, coupled with
continued strong credit growth, could increase systemic vulnerabilities as financial deepening may
result in new credit risks. In this regard, the proactive use of prudential measures and efforts to
improve corporate governance and supervision of conglomerates are welcome. Corporate
governance for municipal savings banks should be strengthened, for instance by allowing private
investors to have a seat on bank boards to facilitate private sector participation and enhance private
investment. Going forward, staff noted that consideration could be given to strengthening the
financial resolution framework for systemic stress conditions and revisiting the initiative to include
cooperatives under SBS supervision. Further institutional coordination in managing systemic risks
and designing macro-prudential policy could facilitate prompt policy response. Also, staff
recommends monitoring household and corporate sector balance sheets, including FX mismatches,
in a systematic way to better assess macro-financial risks.
27.
The deepening of domestic capital markets would facilitate channeling resources
effectively in the economy. The actual and potential demand for domestic assets has increased
substantially in recent years, but the supply of assets has been limited. The creation of the Integrated
Latin American Market (MILA) with the integration of the Chilean, Colombian and Peruvian stock
markets is expected to increase market liquidity and the spectrum of investible assets.7 While
structural factors—economic size and selective nature of issuers—are part of the challenges to
overcome, the authorities are taking steps in reviewing regulations and taxation to foster the
expansion of assets available including by easing access to capital-market financing. In this context,
and following up on the 2010 FSAP recommendations, the authorities have started to explore
elements to ease access to capital markets (through review of the public offering regime, market
transactions costs and an analysis of indirect mechanisms for SME access to capital markets). In
addition, the authorities aim at strengthening their supervisory approach via the implementation of
risk-based supervision. Pre-approval of the asset class for pension funds investment portfolio, rather
than the SBS’s approval by instrument, would also facilitate channeling savings more effectively.

Peru’s impressive economic performance attests to its strong fundamentals and sound
policy management. The strength of the economic growth after the global financial crisis has been
underpinned by strong fundamentals, sound balance sheets and policy frameworks and skillful policy
management. With the economy close to potential, the policy challenges ahead involve maintaining
an appropriate policy mix, and weighing policy responses to both downside and upside scenarios.
The near-term outlook remains favorable, but subject to risks. In particular, negative terms of trade
shocks could reduce exports, investment and growth; while ample global liquidity and capital inflows

could lead to overheating. The policy stance and mix have been broadly appropriate so far and have
enabled Peru to cope with capital inflows amid lax monetary conditions in advanced economies.
29.
The fiscal policy stance imbedded in the 2013 budget remains broadly adequate. The
approved 2013 budget aims at a fiscal surplus of about 1 percent of GDP. Staff estimates that the
fiscal surplus in 2013 could be about ½ percent of GDP higher due to elevated metal prices and
normal expenditure execution. Despite a budgeted increase in primary spending of about 10 percent
in real terms for 2013, an overall fiscal surplus is expected to continue. The structural expansion of
about ½ percent of GDP is mildly pro-cyclical and in part due to the higher-than-budgeted surplus
in 2012. Over the medium term, further increases in current expenditure should be moderated to
avoid challenges to macroeconomic management.
30.
The monetary authority should remain vigilant and react flexibly to changing domestic
and global conditions. Under the baseline scenario, policy rates should continue to be neutral if
core inflation remains subdued and expectations well-anchored. There continues to be room for the
proactive use of reserve requirements to manage liquidity and credit dynamics, while being vigilant
to the risks of domestic financial disintermediation. Under the baseline scenario, monetary policy
should be used to mitigate demand and inflationary pressures.
31.
The anticipated higher exchange rate flexibility is welcomed as it will strengthen the
role of the exchange rate as a shock absorber. Staff welcomes the steps by the central bank to
increase exchange rate flexibility and introduce higher intra– and inter–day volatility in the foreign
exchange market. With the exchange rate level broadly in line with fundamentals, the authorities will
allow higher exchange rate flexibility while at the same time accommodating changes due to
fundamentals. Going forward, the higher exchange rate flexibility will play a key role in buffering
external shocks and assist the private sector to better internalize foreign exchange risks and reduce
sterilization costs.
32.
The proactive use of macro-prudential measures should continue to limit the buildup
of financial vulnerabilities in the context of large capital inflows and strong credit growth.
While the financial sector remains strong and resilient, large capital inflows risk fuelling credit and
asset price booms in the future. The increase in FX lending in mortgages and long-term consumption
credit may reflect borrowers’ not sufficiently internalizing foreign exchange risks. Existing regulation
may prove insufficient in light of the expected appreciation of the nuevo sol and easy U.S. dollar
funding conditions. Further institutional coordination in managing systemic risks and designing
macro-prudential policy would facilitate a prompt policy response. Therefore, prudential measures
that penalize more heavily FX lending at long-term maturities as well as strengthening supervision to
ensure that banks adequately assess FX credit risks would be welcome.
33.
Preserving policy flexibility is essential given the two-sided risks to the outlook. The
authorities have the policy buffers to deal with negative spillovers. In the event of a reversal of capital
inflows, the central bank can use a combination of exchange rate flexibility and reserve buffers.
Relaxing reserve requirements would help to ensure orderly functioning of credit markets. If weak
global conditions continue, monetary and macro-prudential policies could be eased to support

economic activity. If a sharp deterioration in terms of trade materializes, a fiscal stimulus could ease
the adjustment in economic activity and employment. Further policy coordination will be needed if
upside risks materialize to prevent overheating. Monetary policy would need to be tightened. In
parallel, tighter prudential measures would be required to prevent the buildup of financial
vulnerabilities in light of rapid credit growth. In coordination with warranted adjustment in
macroeconomic policies (including on the exchange rate), additional targeted, transparent and
temporary capital flow measures could be used in response to a large surge in capital inflows to
address excessive exchange rate movements. Fiscal policy may need to play a more supportive
countercyclical role to avoid generating additional demand pressures.
34.
Strengthening the fiscal framework will require an adequate anchor. Given the
significant reduction in public debt in the last decade, any new fiscal framework should cement the
prudent management of non-renewable resources, taking into account commodity prices and
intergenerational equity, and avoiding pro-cyclicality in the fiscal stance. A fiscal anchor will require
balancing the need for savings for future generations and to cushion fiscal risks with the need to
close infrastructure and social gaps over time. Staff looks forward to the report of the fiscal
commission which is expected to address these issues.
35.
Tax targets are ambitious but necessary to finance the social agenda. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ actions to revamp the SUNAT and improve tax compliance. In this regard, the
government’s goal of raising tax revenues to 18 percent of GDP by 2016 would bring Peru’s tax ratio
in line with those of other emerging economies and help finance the expansion of social programs
and public investment over the medium term. Staff encouraged the authorities to take the necessary
measures to ensure that the ambitious tax objective is achieved.
36.
To improve growth prospects, Peru should tackle long-standing structural bottlenecks
to enhance productivity. Economic growth will need to be driven by higher productivity. Key pillars
for the structural reform agenda include enhancing competitiveness; defining a nationwide strategy
to remove infrastructure bottlenecks; improving the business climate further to foster investment;
and developing local capital markets further to facilitate investment and better allocate savings. The
elevated commodity prices expected to persist over the medium term provide the opportunity to put
Peru on a sustainable high long-term growth path.

Box 1. Peru: Revamping the Macro Fiscal Framework
The Peruvian authorities have announced their intention to improve the macro-fiscal framework. The system of fiscal rules
introduced in 1999 has served Peru well, facilitating the strengthening of public finances and reducing public debt. However, with
the weight of mining revenue growing and pressures to spend mounting in a context of high commodity prices and contained
social demands, there is a case for refining the framework with a view to ensuring the efficient use of commodity revenues and
enhancing public savings while maintaining macroeconomic stability. For that purpose, the authorities have established a technical
commission with local and international experts to come up with proposals that would tie up the previous analyses with a focus on
feasibility. The recommendations of the fiscal commission are expected to be incorporated in the formulation of the 2014 budget.
The current framework embedded in the fiscal responsibility law has been very effective in strengthening public finances
and reducing public debt. The framework contains the following elements: (i) a multi-annual macroeconomic framework which
sets three-year macroeconomic projections of revenue, expenditure, public investment and public debt; (ii) numerical fiscal rules
which could be classified into three main categories: balanced budget, expenditure and debt rules applied to three different levels
of government; and (iii) a fiscal stabilization fund (FEF) which is endowed with any fiscal surpluses generated by the Treasury,
10 percent of privatization proceeds and 10 percent of concessional fees, with a cap of 4 percent of GDP, which is about to be
reached.

However, the implementation of the macro-fiscal framework has not
been conducive to counter-cyclical fiscal policy. When measured by the
correlation between the change in the cyclical component of government
expenditures and the output gap, Peru displays a high level of pro1
cyclicality compared to other emerging economies. Fiscal policy
management has been complicated by changes in the rules regarding
coverage of expenditures (from general to central government); exclusion
of investment; frequent use of supplementary credits; and the
unpredictable use of outstanding balances by sub-national governments.
Furthermore, the rapid increase of transfers to sub-national governments
associated with the natural resource revenues and a lack of absorption
capacity have resulted in added volatility in expenditure patterns,
particularly for those regions and municipalities that are mineral
producers. Furthermore, the multiplicity of rules and their hard-to-grasp
nature is a problem particularly at the sub-national level, where no less
than eight rules exist.

increased over time. Overall, the share of mining in total revenues has increased from 2½ percent in 2000 to 14 percent in 2011 (or
about 2.6 percent of GDP). This has the potential to raise fiscal vulnerabilities since these revenues are much more volatile than
other sources and have a temporary component; while any new increases in current spending are likely to become permanent. At
current commodity prices, Peru may not have fully taken advantage of the commodity boom to increase public savings. Additional
savings may also be warranted in the context of limited absorption capacity in the short term, especially for investment spending,
and necessary in view of the potentially large contingent liabilities (i.e., earthquakes, climate change such as “El Niño”/”La Niña”
effects). Those savings would need to be balanced with the need to increase social and infrastructure spending in the shorter term
to reduce poverty and enhance potential economic growth. Defining a nationwide public investment/social strategy with clear
priorities and objectives would help identify medium-term spending needs and bottlenecks to overcome. In this context, a multiannual budgeting design will also help enhance the management of public finances.

Box 2. Peru: Housing Market Developments
In line with developments in the region, Peru’s housing market has
been performing strongly in the past years.1 The average price of
homes sold in the Lima Metropolitan Area rose 20 percent in 2011, to
S/. 262,000 (about US$100,000), according to the real estate consulting
firm Tinsa, although this may partly reflect a change in the composition
of home sales. Residential home sales went up by 50 percent in 2011.
The districts with most projects are the high-end Santiago de Surco,
followed by Miraflores and San Isidro. Other districts with high demand
are those associated with low socioeconomic status districts (i.e., San
Juan de Lurigancho and Los Olivos). In 2012 and beyond, the housing
market is likely to continue to be strong, with the help of lower
mortgage rates, improved public investment and Peru’s economic strength.

Favorable external conditions, economic growth and stronger fundamentals have boosted housing finance,
supported by rising living standards. Mortgage lending has almost doubled from 2.6 percent of GDP in 2007 to
4.4 percent of GDP as of June 2012. Most of the increase has been in local currency mortgages, which account now for
about half of outstanding mortgages (and represented less than one-fifth in 2007). Rising mortgage lending has gone
in hand with the expansion of the construction sector, which has been the most dynamic sector in the economy.
Given the sustained growth in the housing sector, the supervisory authorities issued targeted prudential
measures in November 2012. These are designed to deter high

which vary according to residual maturity.
Better data would facilitate stronger oversight of
developments in the housing sector. Housing prices in Peru
have being collected regularly for Lima by the central bank.
However, additional measures are needed to close information
gaps such as developing more timely and comprehensive
information on house prices (with national coverage,
distinguishing between new and existing homes, commercial and
residential real estate) and construction activity (housing stocks
and flows, employment in the sector, and price of construction
inputs including land prices).

Box 3. Peru: Neutral Interest Rate1
Policymakers in inflation targeting regimes typically compare the current policy interest rate to a benchmark or
neutral rate—consistent with stable inflation and a closed output gap—to assess the stance of monetary policy.
If the current rate is below the neutral rate, monetary policy is accommodative and the economy expands; if it is above
the neutral real rate, policy is restrictive and the economy
LA6: Neutral Real Interest Rate in 2012
shrinks. The neutral real interest rate (NRIR) is not an observable
(In percent; results from different methodologies)
variable, so there is no unique way to estimate it; and it can
6
6
change over time.
Several static and dynamic techniques were employed to
assess the neutral policy rate. These are commonly used
methodologies in the literature to estimate real neutral policy
interest rate ranges for a set of several Latin American countries
starting in the early 2000s, including Peru (see Table for results
of each methodology).

Peru’s neutral real interest rate is estimated to be in the
1¼‒2 percent range, implying that the current monetary
stance is appropriately neutral. Based on these estimates (which includes an inflation rate of 2 percent), it appears
that Peru has been effective in: (i) containing domestic demand fluctuations and inflationary pressures through
counter-cyclical monetary policy; and (ii) lowering its NRIR amid improved economic fundamentals. In addition, Peru
has also successfully used macro-prudential policies to affect the monetary stance through proactive use of reserve
requirements to manage credit dynamics and liquidity in the financial system.

Box 4. Update on Anti-Money Laundering Efforts1
The authorities have improved the national system for combating money laundering and the
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). The Peruvian authorities, with the assistance of Fund staff, identified at
an early stage the need to develop a national strategy in this area, based on an in-depth analysis of the
specific money laundering and terrorist financing risks that Peru faces. The culmination of these efforts was
the adoption of the “National Plan for Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism” in July
2011.2
The analysis identified several structural vulnerabilities, including high levels of informality, the
prevalence of corruption, and weaknesses in inter-agency coordination. These structural vulnerabilities
made it easier for criminals to conduct money laundering transactions with a low risk of being punished. In
addition, the report specified a number of functional vulnerabilities related to detection and financial
intelligence, and weaknesses in the criminal justice system that could be addressed through: (i) legal
enhancements to the powers of AML/CFT supervisors in the banking, securities, and other sectors; (ii)
training for inspectors, prosecutors, and investigators; and (iii) more formal mechanisms for consultation
between the many institutions involved in the AML/CFT effort. The National Plan, itself the result of strong
inter-agency collaboration led by Peru’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), set eleven general strategic
objectives aimed at remedying these functional vulnerabilities.
Progress has been achieved in implementing many actions included in the plan. Changes in the legal
and regulatory framework increased the sanctions for money laundering, hardened penalties on activities
related to the financing of terrorism, empowered the FIU to freeze terrorist assets, and strengthened
regulation and supervision in key sectors such as money exchanges, public notaries, customs brokers and
casinos. The securities sector regulator was elevated to a Superintendency level and is strengthening its
AML/CFT regulatory and supervisory framework (with further assistance from the Fund). Interagency
coordination had been significantly improved through the institutionalization of the collaborative structures
that the Peruvian agencies created.
The authorities are working on an update to the strategy that will reflect the progress to date and
identify new specific actions. All in all, progress has been satisfactory; over one third of the actions have
been completed, and most of the rest are underway, including legislation currently in Congress granting the
FIU access to information protected by banking and tax secrecy.

Box 5. Peru: International Linkages and Spillovers
Peru’s linkages to the global market have intensified in the past decade through growth in trade and capital
flows. Potential inward spillovers to the domestic economy are therefore closely associated to its increasing
dependence on commodity exports, demand from China, and increasing exposure to international capital flows.

Trade Linkages
There has been significant increase in trade openness but rising concentration in commodity exports that are
sensitive to global price developments and to demand from China. Trade accounted for 47 percent of GDP in
2011—a great leap from just 26 percent of GDP in 2000—led by the rapid increase in mineral exports since the mid
2000s, which now account for 60 percent of total exports. While Peru exports six key metals, the export structure has
become more concentrated, with copper and gold accounting for 80 percent of mineral exports or 12 percent of GDP
in 2011. Similar to other LA commodity exporters, the share of exports to China has risen rapidly over the past decade
to 15 percent of total, replacing the U.S. as the largest single export country for Peru in 2011.

Capital Flows
The bulk of the capital inflows to Peru remained in FDI which is less prone to capital reversal. Net FDI
amounted to 4.9 percent of GDP during 2007‒11, with reinvestment FDI accounting for close to 2/3 of these flows, a
testimony of the attractiveness of Peru as an investment destination. However, FDI in Peru is concentrated in
resource-intensive sectors, and by investing firms from a small number of countries. Based on the 2009 Coordinated
Direct Investment Survey, the mining sector received close to 30 percent of the total FDI inflows as of end-2009 (most
of which from the United States and Canada), followed by 24 percent in services (mostly from Spain, Chile and the
United States) and 17 percent in the hydrocarbon sectors.

Foreign bank subsidiaries are however funded locally, limiting the impact from parent banks. Overall, the share
of external financing in all banks’ financing is estimated at around 12 percent (as of September 2012). Foreign banks
represent 43 percent of the total assets of the banking system (18 percent of GDP) as of September 2012. BBVAContinental (9 percent of GDP), and Scotia Bank (6 percent of GDP), the second and third largest by assets, rely on
domestic deposits (70 percent of total liabilities) as the funding source. They are financially sound and, profitable, and
funding pressure at the parent banks is likely to have limited impact on these subsidiaries. In addition, for foreign
bank subsidiary, as in the case of BBVA-Continental, transfer of financial resources to the parent bank would need the
approval of SBS and the agreement from the majority-owned local partner.

Annex I. Balance of Payments Stability Analysis
Current Account
1.
The current account remains in deficit with net outflow of investment income. Exports
doubled during the last 5 years to 26 percent of GDP in 2011 on the back of rapidly rising mineral
exports that accompanied the surge in copper and gold prices. As a result, traditional exports
accounted for 20 percent of GDP in 2011. Non-traditional exports have also been growing, albeit at
a slower pace, to 6 percent of GDP in 2011. However, the increase in trade surpluses was offset by
an increase in the profit reparation in the range of 6½ to 7¾ percent of GDP. As an illustration of
the impact of commodity prices, if commodity prices were to return to their 2005 levels, the current
account deficit would have reached close to 8 percent of GDP in 2011 (compared with the actual 1.9 percent of GDP), if the real exchange rate did not depreciate.

1/ Profit remittances are reduced accordingly assuming about 40 percent of revenue from mineral
exports are repatriated.

2.
The current account deficit is estimated to have widened to about 3½ percent of GDP
in 2012 and is expected to narrow to 3 percent of GDP over the medium term. This is due the
combined effect of weaker export growth with the moderation of metal prices (export fell to about
23 percent of GDP in 2012) and buoyant import growth supported by domestic demand. Capital
inflows, in particular FDI, are expected to continue to provide stable financing for the current
account over the medium term.

Capital Account
3.
Peru has received large FDI inflows of 5 percent of GDP on average during 2007‒11,
and strong FDI inflow is expected to continue over the medium term. About one-quarter of FDI
goes to mining projects. Prospect for FDI inflows remain positive over the medium term at around
4 percent of GDP per annum as investors are attracted by Peru’s rich mineral resources and medium
term growth outlook.

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PERU

4.
Other capital flows are small in comparison. Portfolio investment inflows from foreign
investors remained small during 2007‒11 and were in most years (except 2008) offset by larger net
portfolio investment outflows by domestic investors such as the pension funds. However, nonresidents’ holdings of government securities have risen in recent years, accounting for about 2¼
percent of GDP in 2010 and 1 percent of GDP in 2012. While Peru is to some extent exposed to the
global short-term capital inflows like its regional peers, net flows are relatively small, other than the
net inflows equivalent to 1.9 percent of GDP in 2007 and net outflows of 1.7 percent of GDP in 2009,
and an estimated net inflows of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2012.

Real Exchange Rate
5.
Peru’s currency appreciation trend is broadly in line with its fundamentals, including
its strong prospects for growth and terms of trade. As of November 2012, the real effective
exchange rate (REER) has appreciated by 15 percent since April 2011, and about 4½ percent since
end-2011.

In staff’s view, there is no significant misalignment of the exchange rate. The average
of the traditional CGER methodologies gives a potential overvaluation of the nuevo sol of about

PERU

regression used in the EBA assessment for the exchange rate does not have a good track record of
fitting Peru well over the years, and these results should be interpreted with some caution. Against
this background, staff believes that the small overvaluation estimated by these methodologies is in
line with an assessment of no misalignments in the exchange rate. The relatively large residuals in
the regressions may indicate that these models are not well suited in Peru’s case and they could be
further improved to reflect the large profit reparation from inward FDI which contributed to the
current account deficit as well as inadequate recordings of illegal gold exports.


The average of all the EBA and CGER methodologies (adjusting for illegal gold exports), yields an
overvaluation of about 5 percent, which is within the margin of error.



The preliminary External Balance Assessment (EBA) model estimates suggest that difference
between the cyclically adjusted current account (CA) norm of a deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP and
the adjusted CA deficit (cyclically adjusted) is 1.1 percent of GDP (CA gap), representing an
overvaluation of about 5 percent. The EBA’s real exchange rate (RER) regression approach (with
its weak fit) points to an overvaluation of 11 percent.



CGER estimates show an overvaluation between 0 to 7 percent. The deviation ranges from
3 percent for the external sustainability (ES) approach (which calculates the RER adjustment
needed to stabilize the net foreign asset position), to 7 percent for the macroeconomic balance
(MB) approach (which computes the RER adjustment needed to close the current account gap),
and zero percent overvaluation/undervaluation for the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER)
approach (which directly estimates the RER needed to restore the equilibrium RER determined
by a set of fundamentals).

FX Intervention and Reserves
7.
BCRP’s interventions in the foreign exchange market have been aimed at reducing
excessive currency volatility, taking into account Peru’s vulnerability to exchange rate reversal
given its still high level of financial dollarization. During 2012, in response to significant capital
inflows, the central bank intervened in the foreign exchange market with a net foreign currency
purchase of US$13 billion or 6½ percent of GDP, surpassing the large net FX purchases in previous
years (US$10 billion in 2007 and US$9 billion in 2010). These interventions are sterilized through the
issuance of BCRP’s Certificate of Deposits, a term deposit with BCRP, reserve requirements in nuevo
sol and fiscal withdrawal (about 30 percent of the total amount). More recently, in response to the
rising appreciation pressure, BCRP also announced the plan to intervene in a fixed daily amount to
further enhance the flexibility of the exchange rate.

Annex II. Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
Peru’s public debt is projected to decline under the baseline debt scenario to below
15 percent of GDP over the medium term. Public sector gross debt declined by half to 23 percent
of GDP in 2011 from 44 percent in 2004. Currency risks have also declined significantly, with the
share of foreign currency denominated public debt in total public debt declining to 54 percent in
2011. High real GDP growth averaging 6.4 percent and overall fiscal surpluses averaging 0.2 percent
of GDP over the 10-year period of 2002–11 have contributed to debt consolidation. In the medium
term, real GDP growth will average 6 percent a year in 2012–17 underpinned by domestic demand
dynamics and external demand supported by high commodity prices. In this context, overall fiscal
surpluses are projected to average 1.8 percent of GDP. Under the baseline scenario, Peru’s public
sector debt stock (including CRPAOs) would decline further from an estimated 19 percent of GDP at
end-2012, to 12 percent of GDP by 2017.
2.
External debt is projected to decline further to about 23 percent of GDP. Peru’s external
debt has been on a downward trajectory, declining by half to 26 percent of GDP in 2011 from
50 percent of GDP in 2001, as a result of a decade of a continuously improving external position.
The baseline scenario projects total external debt to decline further by about 3 percentage points of
GDP from end-2012 to 23 percent by 2017
3.
Peru’s external and public sector debt ratios are robust to alternative assumptions
about underlying macroeconomic variables. Sensitivity tests based on 10-year historical standard
deviations for GDP growth, interest rates and noninterest current account shocks (such as in the
terms of trade) show that they would have a moderate adverse impact on external and public
indebtedness.
4.
However, external and public debt ratios remain sensitive to large and permanent
exchange rate shocks. Under a one-off 30 percent real depreciation of the exchange rate, the
external and public debt ratios would increase by about 11 and 5 percentage points, respectively
above the baseline projections over the medium term.
5.
A contingent liabilities shock to the public sector of 10 percent of GDP would increase
public debt by a similar amount over the medium term. The public debt ratio would rise sharply
in the short run to 26 percent of GDP and decline over the medium term to 21 percent of GDP. By
2017, the debt ratio would remain 9 percentage points of GDP above the baseline scenario.

WORLD BANK RELATIONS
(As of December 13, 2012)

A. Bank Group Strategy
The World Bank Group support to Peru is defined in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
approved by the Board on February 1, 2012. The CPS is closely aligned with the government’s
strategic vision of strong economic growth with greater inclusion and is focused in four strategic
objectives: (i) increased access and quality of social services for the poor; (ii) connecting the poor to
services and markets; (iii) sustainable growth and productivity; and (iv) inclusive governance and
public sector performance. The CPS also addresses cross-cutting issues such as those of governance
and gender. The CPS is a result of extensive consultations with government and civil society.
The indicative lending program is at about US$250 million per annum, reflecting government’s
interest in policy reform support through Development Policy Lending and in reform
implementation support through an investment lending program. The strategy includes
development policy lending operations in the fiscal, social, and environmental sectors.
Peru’s current lending portfolio includes 17 active projects with a commitment of US$1.9 billion and
an undisbursed balance of US$1.4 billion. The portfolio includes twelve investment loans, four
DPL/DDOs and two GEF grants. The areas covered by the existing portfolio are economic policy,
environment, social protection, transport infrastructure, water resources, among others. Examples of
projects include Irrigation in Sierra (US$20 million), Second Justice Improvement (US$20 million),
Rural Water and Sanitation Program Additional Financing (US$30 million), Lima Optimization of
Water Systems (US$54.5 million), and Second Rural Electrification Project (US$50 million).
During FY 12, there were no deliverables given that there was a newly elected government, and a
review of the paused work was carried out during that year. For FY13, a new Social Inclusion DPL
(U$45 million) and a new Social Inclusion Technical Assistance Loan ($10 million) were approved by
the Board on December 13, 2012. New operations such as Higher Education (US$25 million) and
Basic Education (US$25 million) are also being prepared.
In addition, the Bank has an extensive program of analytical and advisory activities for FY 12–14,
including both economic and sector work and non-lending technical assistance. The economic and
sector work covers areas such as public expenditure, fiscal incidence, infrastructure, gas
development strategy, social sectors, climate change, and housing and municipal financing.
Finally, the Bank’s TF portfolio (currently over US$29 million) has been also expanding significantly.
The majority of TFs complements other WB support in the current core engagement areas of this
CPS by providing valuable Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) and technical assistance. They
support the harmonization and alignment of funding from various development partners behind
core government programs.

B. Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas
Tax Reform and Fiscal Decentralization. Fund staff has taken the lead in assisting in the design of
tax reform. Jointly with the World Bank and IDB, staff has worked on drafting laws and regulations
for fiscal decentralization. The World Bank has also focused on the design and implementation of
decentralization of the social sectors and pro-poor spending policies.
Financial Sector. A joint FSAP was completed in May 2001. Follow up technical assistance to
implement FSAP recommendations has been given by both institutions. Joint FSAP updates were
completed in June 2005 and April 2011.
Public Sector Management. Bank-Fund collaboration has focused in the area of results based
budgeting, the implementation of a Treasury Single Account and modernization of budget
processes, institutions and information systems.
Customs Administration Modernization: A needs assessment mission was undertaken together
with the IMF to develop an action plan for modernizing customs administration. The joint team
presented a technical report to SUNAT.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
A. Country Strategy
Peru’s recently approved a new Country Strategy covering the period 2012–2016. The new strategy
will focus IDB’s assistance in helping the authorities on their efforts to close the economic and social
gaps that exist between urban and rural areas, and support productivity gains as the main basis for
inclusive, sustainable economic growth.
IDB’s strategic engagement in Peru focuses on nine areas: (i) social inclusion; (ii) rural development
and agriculture; (iii) housing and urban development; (iv) climate change and disaster risk
management; (v) water, sanitation, water resources, and solid waste; (vi) energy; (vii) transportation;
(viii) public management; and (ix) competitiveness and innovation.
To implement the new Country Strategy, IDB will work with the government on a multi-sector
approach of articulated interventions addressing various development gaps at the same time. Also,
IDB will diversify the instruments it uses to support the country, potentially through service contracts
in priority areas (“fee for services”), larger private sector operations, knowledge sharing and
technical cooperation.
IDB’s financial engagement scenario would entail positive but small net flows between 2012 and
2016, with a base scenario where the Bank maintains its share in Peru’s multilateral debt. The
lending framework for the strategy is consistent with the demand assumptions of the government’s
financing strategy.

B. Lending
As of November 30, 2012, the Bank’s portfolio of active, public sector operations consisted of
24 loans for a total amount of US$738.80 million, of which US$226.91 million (31 percent) had been
disbursed. The public sector lending program for 2012 has all been approved and comprised seven
operations for a total of US$230 million. The public sector lending program for 2013 comprises
three policy-based loans for US$80 million and seven investment loans for US$170 million.
Regarding private sector operations, the Structured Corporate Finance Department’s (SCF) portfolio
in execution consists of four operations amounting to US$205 million in infrastructure and financial
services, the Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC) portfolio comprises 12 operations for
US$142.9 million, primarily in manufacture and financial services, and the Opportunities for the
Majority (OMJ) department portfolio consists of two operations amounting US$18 million, in the
agriculture sector and education. As of November, 2012 disbursement projections for SCF & OMJ
total US$26.4 million.

Private sector lending for 2012 includes one SCF projects for US$5 million in financial markets (there
is a Regional Project in the infrastructure sector that highly benefits Peru of US$100 million), two

PERU

STATISTICAL ISSUES
General. Macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate for policy formulation and surveillance.
Peru subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). A data ROSC was prepared and
published in 2003.
Despite progress in recent years, there is scope for improvement in the following areas:
(i) coordination among the agencies that compile official statistics to avoid duplication of efforts;
(ii) implementing a new benchmark and base year for GDP; (iii) expanding the coverage of the
wholesale price index to include mining, oil and gas extraction, electricity and water, public
transportation, and communication; (iv) finalizing the migration to the standardized report forms for
monetary data [with the introduction of report forms for the central bank, other depository
corporations, and other financial corporations]; and (v) expanding the scope of data sources for
compiling financial flows of individual residents.
National accounts. The authorities published a revised GDP series in 2000. The series used the 1994
benchmark estimates as the base year, and included input-output tables. However, due to limited
availability of periodic source data, estimates after 1994 are largely based on extrapolation
techniques. The lack of current detailed tables for supply and use hampers the reconciliation of
discrepancies. As a result, changes in inventories are mainly determined as a residual. Although the
quarterly accounts have benefited from some improvements in the timeliness of monthly
production indices, coverage is still very limited. The National Statistics Office (INEI) is working on a
new national account series implementing the 1993 SNA and using 2007 as the base year. Four
national accounts statistics missions visited the country in November 2008, May 2009, September
2009, and September 2010. The missions were aimed at are assisting the authorities in compiling the
complete set of national accounts by institutional sectors, and in developing the sequence of
accounts of nonfinancial corporations. More technical assistance will be needed in the coming years.
Price statistics. At the present time, the official measure of inflation for Peru is the CPI for
Metropolitan Lima, compiled and published by INEI. Starting in January 2010, the Metropolitan Lima
CPI has been compiled using updated weights based on the 2008/09 Encuesta Nacional de
Presupuestos Familiares (ENAPREF). Since January 2011, city level indices have been compiled and
disseminated for the 24 departmental capitals and another large urban area using weights from the
2008/09 ENAPREF and a methodology matching that employed for the Metropolitan Lima CPI. A
new law issued in 2009 requires the INEI to compile a new national level CPI that will serve as the
official CPI for Peru in the future. An STA mission on the CPI was conducted in May 2–13, 2011 to
evaluate the methodology of the new national CPI index. The new national level CPI, starting with
the January 2012 index, was disseminated since February 2012 The WPI, statistical techniques used
to compile the index generally follow international standards but the weights for the WPI are
outdated, and were derived from the 1994 input-output table and other reports and publications of
relevant ministries.

Labor market statistics. The authorities monitor labor market developments using four indicators:
open unemployment, underemployment, employment, and remunerations. While monthly
unemployment, employment and income data for metropolitan area of Lima from INEI are timely,
only urban employment indexes are available from the Ministry of Labor for other areas and with
some delays; monthly remuneration data for the government are timely but the monthly
remuneration data for the private sector are no longer available. The nationwide unemployment and
underemployment situation is surveyed quarterly. It would be useful to expand the coverage of
labor statistics to national level and develop competitiveness indicators such as productivity and unit
labor cost indexes.
Government financial statistics. The Central Bank (BCRP) compiles government finance statistics
(GFS) following the GFSM2001, for the general government and its subsectors. Data for all
subsectors are reported on a cash basis and financial assets and liabilities are reported at face value.
The authorities have not yet sent to the Fund information on the components of expenditures by
function. The coverage of published national budget data is narrower than the fiscal statistics
prepared for the combined public sector. The new budget aligned to GFSM 2001 was used for the
2009 budget processing. The authorities report data for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) using the GFSM 2001. No high frequency data is reported for publication
in International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Monetary statistics. The BCRP compiles and publishes the analytical accounts of the central bank,
depository corporations, and financial corporations broadly in line with the methodology
recommended by the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The main divergences are the
exclusion of the deposits of other financial corporations, state and local governments, and public
nonfinancial corporations from the definition of broad money; and valuation of some financial
assets held to maturity at cost rather than at market prices or at the lower of cost or market price for
investment securities. At the request of the authorities, a mission visited the country in January 2007
to assist with the migration to the new standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary data
to the IMF. The mission finalized the SRF for the central bank, recommending improvements in the
classification and sectorization of some accounts. A follow-up mission took place in September
2008. The mission completed the work on the SRF for the central bank and developed a bridge table
linking the source data reported by banks to the BCRP to the report form 2SR (other depository
corporations). The mission identified shortcomings in the management of the database that
generate the accounts of the other depository corporations sector at the BCRP. Although the two
technical assistant missions finalized the groundwork for the migration to the SRFs, the BCRP has
not yet started reporting monetary data using the SRFs. No set date is foreseen for the migration to
the SRFs.
Financial soundness indicators. Peru started reporting data and metadata for financial soundness
indicators (FSIs) with a quarterly frequency in June 2011.

External sector statistics. The BCRP prepares quarterly data on the balance of payments and
international investment position largely in line with the recommendations of the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Data are reported to the Fund for publication in the IFS and
the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. Departures from BPM5 include the lack of coverage of
assets held abroad and land acquisition abroad by residents; and not recording on an accrual basis
some external debt transactions.
The BCRP has been reporting since August 2001 weekly data on international reserves in accordance
with the Operational Guidelines for Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency
Liquidity. Since August 2006, the BCRP is including the full amount of the liquidity requirements in
the reserve template both under official reserve assets and as a contingent net drain (as specified in
Section III of the Data Template). Peru disseminates quarterly data on external debt with an eight
week lag on the National Summary Data Page with a hyperlink to the Fund’s website.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Peru
On February 13, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Peru.1
Background
Strong economic performance and sound macroeconomic management continued in 2012.
Economic growth is estimated at 6⅓ percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012, and the
economy is near its potential. Economic activity was driven by domestic demand, in particular
investment, as the weak external environment is taking a toll on exports and widened the
external current account deficit. Inflation declined to 2¾ percent (y-o-y) in December 2012,
falling with the inflation target band (1‒3 percent) as the adverse supply shocks unwound after
being above the upper limit of the target band during the first ten months of 2012.
Monetary policy has been geared to deal with a surge in capital inflows. While the Banco
Central de Reserva del Perú (BCRP) has kept the policy rate unchanged at 4¼ percent since
May 2011, monetary conditions tightened in 2012 through the use of reserve requirements. The
large capital inflow, of which about one-half is in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI), has
led BCRP to a policy of foreign exchange intervention cum sterilization, to avoid a sharp
appreciation of the currency in the context of a dollarized economy. Private credit growth has
remained at around 16½ percent (y-o-y) for the first ten months of 2012, with significant growth

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

in the consumer and mortgage segments—both also reporting a pickup in U.S. dollar lending.
The banking system continues to be sound, profitable and well-capitalized.
The fiscal stance was tighter than envisaged in the 2012 budget. The non-financial public sector
overall surplus is estimated to have reached over 2 percent of GDP in 2012, (higher than the
1 percent surplus included in the 2012 budget), due to higher-than-forecasted revenues and the
lower budget implementation despite efforts to accelerate public sector investment.
The near-term outlook remains favorable but risks to the economy lurk in both directions. Real
GDP growth is projected at around potential (6−6½ percent) in 2013 supported by domestic
demand and elevated commodity prices. Inflation in 2013 is expected to remain subdued and
converging to the mid-point of the target band (1−3 percent). On downside risks, the economy is
most vulnerable to a growth shock in China that permeates through lower commodity prices in
the short term. The lack of a medium-term plan for U.S. fiscal consolidation could also hamper
Peru’s economy over the medium term. Upside risks to growth and inflation could result from
ample global liquidity and capital inflows in the context of low growth in advanced economies.
Over the medium term, the economic outlook hinges on bolstering resilience to shocks and
fostering productivity growth.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended Peru’s impressive macroeconomic performance, underpinned by strong
fundamentals and sound policy management. Growth is strong, inflation and public debt are low,
and progress has been made in reducing poverty and improving living standards. The near term
outlook remains favorable despite the adverse external environment. However, risks to the
outlook are related to terms of trade shocks on the downside, and to excess global liquidity and
a surge in capital inflows on the upside. Directors emphasized the importance of continued
implementation of flexible and coordinated policies as well as structural reforms to maintain
macroeconomic stability and foster more inclusive long term growth.
Directors considered near term fiscal policy to be broadly adequate and took note that the 2013
budget targets a surplus. While the current fiscal framework has served Peru well in reducing
debt and building public sector savings, Directors saw merit in strengthening the framework by
establishing an appropriate anchor which aims at ensuring prudent management of non
renewable resources and intergenerational equity, and enhancing the predictability of public
spending. They looked forward to the recommendations of the commission appointed by the
authorities. Directors welcomed the efforts to strengthen tax administration and compliance and
agreed that these measures will create space for priority social programs.
Directors supported the neutral stance of monetary policy given low inflation and well anchored
inflation expectations. However, they encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant and flexible

3
to changing domestic and global conditions. Proactive use of reserve requirements, in
coordination with other prudential measures, should help manage excess liquidity and strong
credit dynamics. Directors welcomed the central bank’s recent modifications to its intervention
policy which is expected to increase exchange rate flexibility. Continued efforts in this regard
would help provide a buffer against external shocks, reduce sterilization costs and assist the
private sector to better internalize foreign exchange risks.
Directors agreed that stronger macro prudential measures would help limit the buildup of
financial vulnerabilities in the context of large capital inflows, strong credit growth, and increases
in asset prices. They noted that enhanced institutional coordination between the monetary,
financial and fiscal authorities in managing systemic risks and designing macro prudential policy
would facilitate a prompt policy response. Directors supported closer monitoring of corporate
and household balance sheets to better assess macro financial risks.
Directors underscored the importance of structural reforms to foster a more sustainable and
inclusive growth path. Priorities should focus on enhancing competitiveness, defining a
nationwide strategy to remove infrastructure bottlenecks, improving the business climate, and
developing local capital markets to further facilitate investment and better allocate savings.
Stronger emphasis on improving education and healthcare will also be important.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Pablo Garcia-Silva, Executive Director for Peru
and Oscar Hendrick, Advisor to Executive Director
February 13, 2013
Key Points
•
Peru continues to be a success story despite the external environment and enhanced
risks to the world outlook. The Peruvian economy almost doubled in size over the period 200212, registering a sustained period of strong growth with the lowest inflation in Latin America.
The poverty rate has dropped from near 50 percent of the population in 2005 to 27.8 percent in
2011, an impressive improvement in only a six-year period. This process has continued in 2012
and it is expected to be sustained in the following years. The Peruvian authorities are paying
special attention to the implementation of their socially inclusive growth strategy.
•
Peru’s economic performance in 2012 continues to be outstanding, with a 6.3 percent
real GDP growth, 2¾ percent inflation, low unemployment of 6.8 percent, a 2.0 percent fiscal
surplus, and a net international reserve position equivalent to 34 percent of GDP. The financial
system remains very liquid, profitable, and well regulated. The net public debt is one of the
lowest among emerging markets and industrialized countries at only 5 percent of GDP.
•
This favorable outcome reflects the strong economic fundamentals after two decades of
continuity in the implementation of sound economic policies; key structural reforms, and a very
proactive policy response by the Peruvian authorities to deal with the recent financial crisis.
•
The economic outlook remains favorable in the short and medium term. The Peruvian
economy is set for a steady growth of around 6–6½ percent in the medium term, with stable
inflation at the mid-point of the inflation-targeting band of 1-3 percent. The main challenges are
how to manage the strong flows of foreign direct investment and portfolio inflows, and how to
improve public infrastructure, health, and education to provide a better quality of labor force to
the growth momentum, while reinforcing the process of the improvement in the standard of
living of the population.
•
Nevertheless, many challenges and risks remain. Poverty is still relatively high, despite
substantial progress achieved in recent years, and risks to global recovery remain a factor that
could undermine external demand and induce higher volatility in commodity prices.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Our Peruvian authorities would like to convey their appreciation to Mr. Santos
and his team for a constructive and candid policy dialogue during the Article IV
Consultation. The Staff Report and companion Selected Issues Paper provide an in-depth
analysis of the strong performance by the Peruvian economy and the challenges ahead.
Our authorities are in broad agreement with the staff’s assessment and policy
recommendations. We appreciate the focus on the consultation on the appropriate nearterm policy mix, including dealing with additional global spillovers, and policies to
reinforce high growth prospects over the medium term.
2.
Peru continues to be a success story, but it is fair and important to recognize
that many challenges remain ahead. As clearly shown in the first text-chart of the staff

2
report, during the last decade, Peru grew at an average annual rate of 6½ percent with the
lowest inflation in the region, even below those countries with fully dollarized
economies. The Peruvian economy almost doubled in size over the period 2002-12, while
the gross public debt-to-GDP ratio fell to less than 20 percent of GDP. The country risk
premium is at a historical low. Peru is the second best country in Latin America in the
Doing Business ranking, and the strong fundamentals and excellent economic outlook
makes Peru a magnet for portfolio and foreign direct investment. All these achievements
have been possible thanks to more than two decades of continued implementation of
sound economic policies—despite temporary setbacks—and a strong political
commitment to modernize the country and improve the standard of living of the
population.
3.
Our authorities are mindful of the importance of maintaining a socially
inclusive growth strategy. The poverty rate has dropped from nearly 50 percent of the
population in 2005 to 27.8 percent in 2011, a very substantial improvement in only a sixyear period. Unemployment maintains a declining trend and it was reduced to 6.8 percent
by end-2012. These figures are not only “statistics” but, the “trickle down effect” can be
observed in the dramatic increase in the size of the middle class, and its powerful positive
impact on domestic demand across all economic sectors. Yet, there is still plenty of room
for improvement, and our authorities remain committed to prudent financial policies to
preserve the hard-earned macroeconomic stability and a further deepening of structural
reforms to sustain growth and entrench poverty reduction.
RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK

In 2012, Peru’s economic performance was robust and converging to potential,
while inflation remained within the target band, despite a weak external demand and
the enhanced risks to the outlook for the Euro Area, China, and the United States. For
the second consecutive year, economic growth was higher than originally envisaged by
the staff and the authorities. Real GDP grew 6.3 percent in 2012, and according to the
Central Bank of Peru’s most recent Monetary Program, released in February 2013, the
economic expansion will continue in the medium term at around 6 percent, in line with
the staff’s projections. Inflation declined to 2¾ percent (yoy) by end-2012, despite the
adverse supply shocks in the first half of the year. Core inflation has remained within the
inflation-target band (1-3 percent). Headline inflation in January 2013 was 0.12 percent.
According to the latest Central Bank survey, inflation expectations remain well anchored,
and market participants expect at least a real GDP growth of 6.0 percent for the period
2012-14. Peru has a very strong external position, net international reserves grew to
US$67.7 billion by February 4, 2013, equivalent to 34 percent of 2012 GDP. As
explained by the staff in Annex I, Balance of Payments and Stability Analysis; Peru’s net
international reserves are adequate by any metric, including the IMF’s new reserve
adequacy metric, and Peru’s reserve adequacy is well above its regional peers. Our
authorities feel comfortable with this policy, which has proven to be very effective in
dealing with the capital outflows during the peak of the crisis in 2008-09, without the
need to request emergency credit lines to multilateral organizations. This is also cited as a
one of the sources of strength by rating agencies, investment banks, and corporations
interested in doing business in Peru.

The fiscal position has remained strong in 2012 with a sizable surplus for a
second consecutive year, after withdrawing the fiscal stimulus in 2008-09. The
authorities are taking decisive actions to revamp the tax administration authority—
SUNAT, including improving tax compliance and enforcement, and updating
technological infrastructure. The Fund’s technical assistance is playing a crucial role in
helping SUNAT, as well as the efforts to enhance the macro-fiscal framework in the
Ministry of Finance. In 2012, revenues were higher-than-forecast, and budget execution
was lower in public investment. Thus, the non-financial public sector overall surplus is
estimated to have reached over 2 percent of GDP, about twice as much as originally
envisaged in the 2012 budget. To further enhance the fiscal buffers for future shocks, the
2013 budget approved by Congress last December aims at a fiscal surplus of 1.1 percent
of GDP. It is worth underscoring that this outcome (which could be even higher
according to the staff’s assessment), already accommodates an increase of primary
spending of about 10 percent in real terms, consistent with the authorities’ goals for
social inclusion and a gradual civil service reform. The accumulated public savings by
end-2012 were equivalent to about 15 percent of GDP, which brought the net public debt
ratio to around 5 percent of GDP.

The Central Bank’s anti-inflationary stance has limited the pass-through from
adverse supply shocks into domestic inflation. The monetary authority has been very
successful in complying with the goals set within the inflation-targeting framework.
Headline inflation ended in 2012 within the target band, and the policy rate has been
stable at 4¼ percent since May 2011. The persistence of capital inflows to Peru, both FDI
and portfolio flows, is posing new challenges to the monetary and fiscal authorities. The
Central Bank has been using the whole range of instruments at its disposal, including the
use of reserve requirements, and placement of Central Bank securities to sterilize large
foreign exchange purchases. In the last few weeks, the authorities have continued fine
tuning the implementation of macroeconomic policy to moderate potential risks
stemming from robust capital inflows. While the Central Bank has tightened reserve
requirements further, and allowed more investment abroad of the private pension funds,
the Ministry of Finance has announced additional efforts to ameliorate appreciation
pressures, including prepayment of external debt, larger accumulation of foreign currency
to repay debt, and a significant increase in the Fiscal Stabilization Fund.

Looking forward, the authorities agree with the staff’s assessment that, despite
the adverse external environment, the outcome for the Peruvian economy remains
favorable. The investment opportunities and interest in Peru grow by the day. Only the
pipeline of new investment in mining and agriculture, which is already in different stages
of implementation, ensure at least a sustained real GDP growth of 6-6 ½ percent in the
medium term. The Peruvian authorities are cautiously optimistic that structural changes
and robust private and public investment will increase the potential output to a higher
level.
POLICY ISSUES AND OBJECTIVES GOING FORWARD
8.
The Peruvian authorities are closely monitoring the risks associated with large
capital inflows and rapid credit growth, and they stand ready to use the available

4
toolkit, including macro prudential regulations. In particular, the Central Bank has
made some recent modifications to its intervention policy to increase exchange rate
flexibility in the short term to minimize speculative flows looking only for carry-trade
benefits, to help enhance the shock-absorber role of the exchange rate, and encourage the
private sector to internalize exchange rate risks. This new approach is leading to higher
intra-and-inter-day foreign exchange flexibility, reducing incentives to one-way bets on
exchange rate movement. The authorities agree with the staff that the real exchange rate
is in line with fundamentals. Although credit dollarization has continued to decline, from
67 percent in 2005 to 43.1 percent in 2012, the economy is still highly dollarized, despite
more than two decades of stable inflation and steady appreciation of the exchange rate.
This is the main reason for the monetary authority to closely monitor abrupt variations in
the exchange rate due to the possible negative impact on the balance sheet of corporate
and financial institutions. The Central Bank expects a moderation of capital inflows in
2013 but, if this were not the case, there would still room to increase reserve
requirements as a complementary measure to additional exchange rate flexibility to
reduce the volume of short-term capital inflows.

The financial sector remains strong and resilient and macro prudential
regulations have also been strengthened including liquidity requirements in line with
Basel III criteria. It is relevant to remind the Executive Board that a second FSAP update
was undertaken in 2011, together with the 2011 Article IV, both of which were
considered on a lapse-of-time basis according to the new policy to skip one annual
discussion on countries with sound macroeconomic fundamentals and without substantial
changes to the economic outlook. This joint Fund-Bank mission ratified that the Peruvian
financial system continues to be highly profitable, well capitalized, and resilient to severe
shocks simulated in a variety of scenarios. Yet, the regulatory and supervisory authority
has implemented new safeguards including higher provisioning and capital requirements
for mortgages and long-term consumption lending, and measures to discourage foreign
exchange lending in automobile and other consumer loans. The authorities are evaluating
the staff’s most recent recommendations to further strengthen the regulatory framework,
including the advice to penalize foreign exchange lending at long-term maturities more
heavily.
10.
The sustained economic growth during more than two decades has brought a
different challenge; how to maintain the momentum of economic growth and poverty
reduction. Expanding the public infrastructure (roads, energy, irrigation projects, etc.) is
an ongoing effort, with the help of the private sector in some key projects. But, expanding
the availability of qualified workers may take more time. There is already a shortage of
personnel for qualified positions at the professional and managerial level. The
government is already taking action through the civil service reform, which will require
better training for teachers in schools and universities to improve the quality of education
at all levels. This is a long-term goal but, with a high priority. Our authorities believe that
current policies will deliver a steady economic growth, stable and low inflation, a lower
level of public and external debt, a stronger external position, a consolidated fiscal
position, and sustained poverty reduction. This will take some additional time, but we
need to remind ourselves that it has taken 22 years of continued implementation of sound
economic policies to reach this point.
