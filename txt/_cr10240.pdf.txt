FRANCE
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with France
Approved by Poul M. Thomsen and Martin Mühleisen
July 13, 2010

Context: A gradual recovery is underway in France but downside risks to the outlook have
increased amid concerns about sovereign risks in Europe and uncertainties about the
institutional underpinnings of the euro. The financial crisis cum recession have exerted a large
toll on public finances, and in the financial sector concerns remain about asset quality, possible
spillovers from mature markets, and regulatory uncertainty.
Challenges: Appropriate policy response succeeded in stabilizing the financial system and
cushioning the downturn. The consultation focused on the need for credible consolidation to
safeguard fiscal sustainability without endangering the fragile recovery; putting in place
measures to deal with financial stability risks and prospective regulatory requirements; and
structural reforms to improve competitiveness, create jobs, and increase growth.
Authorities’ response: The authorities agreed that strong fiscal adjustment is needed to ensure
sustainable public finances, and were committed to reducing the overall deficit to 3 percent of
GDP deficit by 2013. While acknowledging staff’s assessment of risks in the banking sector,
they emphasized that the system is sound but expressed concern about the possible adverse
impact on the economy of some new regulatory proposals. The authorities agreed with the
importance of fully implementing their ambitious structural reform agenda.
Previous IMF advice: Policy formulation and implementation have generally been consistent
with Executive Board recommendations. The fiscal stimulus in 2009–10 and the measures to
support the banking sector were in line with what was envisaged in the last Article IV
consultation. The authorities agreed with the need for structural reforms and have continued to
implement their agenda in this area.
Mission team: Ms. Gulde-Wolf (head), Mr. De Vrijer, Mr. Cheng, Ms. Tytell, Ms. Xiao (all
EUR), and Ms. Yakadina (FAD). Staff met with Minister of Economy, Industry, and
Employment Lagarde, Minister of the Budget, the Civil Service, and the Reform of the State
Baroin, Minister for Labor, Social Affairs, and the Pension Reform Woerth, Deputy Governor
of the Banque de France Redouin, other senior officials, and representatives of Parliament and
the private sector. Messrs. Fayolle or Ducrocq (OED) attended the meetings.

amid market concerns about
sovereign risks in the Euro Area.
2.
The recovery has been driven by private consumption and net exports, as well as
a turn in the inventory cycle. Household spending received a significant boost from the
government stimulus measures, notably the car scrapping scheme (Box 1), although
automobile purchases plummeted in early 2010 as a result of payback effects. Fixed
investment declined throughout 2009 and in the first quarter of 2010 despite substantial
public intervention (Figure 1). Net exports have supported the recovery as foreign demand
picked up, although imports strengthened toward the end of 2009 and in early 2010. At the
same time, the large output gap has kept inflation low, despite the rebound in commodity
prices.
3.
Notwithstanding the rebound, the unemployment rate continued to increase,
notably among the young. After reaching a low of 7.2 percent in June 2008, the
unemployment rate has risen steeply and stood at 9½ percent as of May 2010. The increase is
larger than expected given the depth of the downturn, likely reflecting, in part, the
adjustment in specific sectors, including financial services and construction, where the
reduction in employment has likely exceeded the output decline.

4
Box 1. The Impact of the Car Scrapping Program
The French car scrapping scheme (prime à la casse) was launched in January 2009 as a part of the
fiscal stimulus package. The program introduced a bonus of €1,000 off the price of a new car with
emissions under 160g CO2/km if the buyer scraps a car that is more than 10 years old in the course
of 2009. While the scheme remains in place through the end of 2010, the size of the bonus dropped to
€700 in January and is set to further diminish to €500 in July. The total amount of the program is
€620 million, or about 0.03 percent of GDP. In addition, a state guarantee for car loans in the amount of
€6.5 million and several eco-friendly tax measures have also been introduced. Finally, France has likely
indirectly benefitted from the German car scrapping program.
Staff estimates suggest that the scheme’s effects can account for the bulk of private consumption
growth in 2009. The behavior of private expenditure on cars since 2000 can be explained by a simple
model including gasoline price growth, two lags of the dependent variable, and a moving average term.
However, this model cannot explain the rise in car sales during 2009. Dummy variables for the four
quarters of 2009 suggest that the car scrapping scheme raised car consumption growth by about
5 percentage points, on average, with the strongest effect in Q4. These effects translate into a contribution
to total private consumption growth in 2009 of 0.3 percentage points, on average, in quarter-on-quarter
terms and 0.6 percentage points in year-on-year terms. In actuality, private consumption in 2009 grew by
0.4 percentage points, on average, in quarter-on-quarter terms and 0.9 percentage points in year-on-year
terms.

Following the success of the scheme during 2009, auto sales plummeted and lowered private
consumption growth in early 2010. The phasing out of the car scrapping scheme gave rise to the
“payback effect” of the inter-temporal shift in vehicle purchases. Although it may have been mitigated to
the extent that the scheme had crowded out other private spending, the effect was still significant. This
dynamic is in line with past experiences, as France saw sharp declines in car sales following previous
scrapping schemes introduced in the 1990s.

4.
Although financial conditions have improved, credit growth remains depressed.
The global financial crisis has had a relatively less negative impact on French banks than on
most European peers, in part reflecting their comparatively conservative lending practices
and the consistent supervisory coverage of all lending institutions. Nevertheless, asset quality
has worsened and additional writedowns on risky assets are likely. Private credit growth has
remained sluggish but available evidence suggests that loan developments, especially in the
corporate sector, are driven more by depressed credit demand than by short supply (see
Analytical Note 1).
5.
Sovereign spreads remain moderate, but concerns over sovereign risks linger.
The debt crisis in Greece and widespread concerns about its repercussions for other
vulnerable members of the Euro Area continue to influence the economic agenda in the
region. That said, the spread over German Bunds remains moderate. French banks have
relatively large exposures to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain that account for
seven percent of bank assets and 30 percent of GDP. These exposures are dominated by
holdings of private Italian and Spanish debt, while sovereign debt positions in Greece are
small.
B. The Policy Focus is Changing
6.
The policy focus is shifting from crisis management to strengthening the
foundations of the economy. The authorities have taken important policy actions to stabilize
the financial system and implemented a suitable fiscal stimulus package to cushion the
downturn (Box 2). As the recovery gains momentum, the policy focus is on fiscal
consolidation, better financial regulation, and structural reforms to raise potential growth and
strengthen competitiveness. At the same time, the authorities need to stand ready to take
action to support the banking sector if the sovereign near-crisis worsens.
7.
In public finances, the focus is moving from supporting demand to fiscal
consolidation, as both the deficit and the debt have risen sharply. With the operation of
automatic stabilizers and discretionary fiscal measures, the general government deficit rose
from 3.3 percent of GDP in 2008 to 7.5 percent in 2009 (Figure 2). For 2010, a deficit of
8 percent of GDP is expected. France has been under the excessive deficit procedure (EDP)
of the European Commission since February 2009.1 The general government gross debt
reached 78.1 percent of GDP in 2009. Unless a substantial fiscal consolidation is undertaken,
the debt is bound to further increase over the medium term (including as a result of
population aging), thereby threatening the sustainability of public finances.

Box 2. Key Measures Taken by the Government to Support the Economy
Financial sector measures included the creation of two separate agencies to recapitalize banks and
provide government guarantees for bank refinancing:
● Recapitalization has been handled by a €40 billion (2 percent of GDP) bank recapitalization fund
(Société de Prise de Participations de l’État, SPPE). It actually injected about half of this amount into
the six largest French banks in the form of deeply subordinated debt securities and preference shares with
built-in buy-back incentives. In the fall of 2009, banks started to repay the state capital by issuing equity,
cooperative certificates or deeply subordinated debt. All but one bank have now repaid the public capital
injections.
● Refinancing operations have been undertaken by a €265 billion (about 14 percent of GDP) bank
refinancing scheme (Société de Financement de l’Économie Française, SFEF). SFEF issued
government-guaranteed bonds denominated in various currencies and was the largest single issuer of the
new asset class, attracting a wide range of investors. It actually raised the equivalent of €77 billion (about
4 percent of GDP), about 37 percent of which will fall due in 2012. SFEF on-lent to banks in proportion
to the market share of each bank in terms of customer loans and assets at a rate that was a function of the
funding costs, CDS spreads, and a fee of 20 basis points. French banks started to issue bonds without
government guarantees in the summer of 2009 and the bank refinancing scheme was allowed to expire at
end-2009.
Fiscal stimulus in the amount of 2¼ percent of GDP over 2009–10 is helping to cushion the downturn
and its execution is effectively managed. The package includes a series of cash-flow measures to buttress
the corporate sector (tax credits on R&D outlays, accelerated reimbursement of VAT credits, and
accelerated depreciation of investment); actions to support households (a temporary reduction of the
personal income tax in 2009, public expenditures on social housing, and additional unemployment
benefits); and public investment by the central government, local authorities, and public enterprises.
Measures to support the automobile sector, including a car scrapping scheme (prime à la casse), have
been very effective in stimulating consumption. In addition, the government has abolished the local
business tax (taxe professionelle).

In the financial sector, crisis support measures are being phased out while steps
are being taken to improve the regulatory framework. As stability returned to the French
banking sector, a gradual exit from crisis-related financial support proceeded. However, with
asset quality weakened by the recession and new threats to financial stability arising from
sovereign debt concerns, enhanced vigilance, more transparency, better communication, and
effective implementation of newly agreed regulatory guidelines are coming to the policy
forefront. With a view to improving financial regulation, the authorities have created a new
regulatory and supervisory framework and are playing an active role in international and
European financial sector reforms.
II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS: A GRADUAL REBOUND AND CHALLENGES AHEAD
A. The Recovery is Fragile
9.
France is expected to recover gradually. Staff projects real GDP to grow by
1.4 percent in 2010 and 1.6 percent in 2011, in line with Germany and somewhat faster than
in the Euro Area as a whole. The authorities expected a stronger rebound in 2011, assuming a
more vigorous recovery in domestic demand. Staff, however, believes that the recovery is
likely to be weaker than after previous recessions, due to the global nature of the recent
downturn and the damage to financial markets in France and elsewhere (Box 3). In addition,
the same features of the French economy that partly shielded it during the recession—large
automatic stabilizers, high social protection, and long-standing rigidities in labor and product
markets—are also likely to slow the pace of the recovery.

Box 3. The French Recovery in Historical Context
The French recovery is expected to be somewhat faster than in the Euro Area as a whole. The latest
recession has done less damage to the French economy, than to many of its peers in the Euro Area.
Indeed, the output loss in France between the pre-recession peak and the trough in early 2009 was about
3½ percent, compared to over 5 percent in the Euro Area. Staff forecasts that by early 2011 France will
recoup about three quarters of this loss, while the Euro Area as a whole will regain less than a half.
However, the current recovery is expected to be slower than comparable past recoveries. There
have been only three recessions over the past 50 years that are comparable in scope to the most recent
global downturn: the mid-1970s, the early 1980s, and the early 1990s.1/ Of these, the early 1990s
recession was also associated with financial crises in a number of industrial countries, including France.
Staff forecasts that the current recovery will be slower than the recoveries from these past recessions
both in France and in the Euro Area, owing to the more global nature of the most recent downturn and
the more widespread financial distress than in the past.
The current recovery will likely be slow and weak because it follows a global financial crisis. The
recoveries following financial crises tend to be weak due to persistently sluggish domestic demand, as
households and firms adjust their balance sheets amid lower asset prices and scarce credit. However,
countries recovering from financial distress usually benefit from relatively strong external demand,
unless their recessions were synchronized with many other countries. In these latter cases, the recoveries
tend to be slow mostly because export growth is much weaker than after localized recessions

10.
The recovery is expected to be driven mainly by domestic demand, with net
exports supportive in the near term. Private consumption growth is expected to pick up
somewhat in 2010–11, but the resilience of private consumption will be weakened by high
unemployment—forecast at around 10 percent over 2010–11—with the withdrawal of
stimulus measures and prospects of fiscal consolidation adding to caution on the part of
households. At the same time, investment will be held back by excess capacity and
uncertainty, including about continued credit availability, with residential investment
projected to lag business investment as the house price correction continues. Stockbuilding is
expected to buttress growth in 2010–11. The export rebound in the first part of 2010 will
contribute to output expansion but export growth over the medium term would be limited by
the moderate recovery in main trading partners and by competitiveness problems in the
French economy, with the depreciation of the euro likely to provide only limited relief. With
imports boosted by rising demand, the growth contribution of net exports would turn slightly
negative in the medium term. Against this background, and with the impact of recent
exchange rate movements partly offset by the dynamics of commodity prices, inflation is
forecast to remain low at 1.3 percent in 2010 and 1.6 percent in 2011, broadly in line with
that in the Euro Area.

sector, which at about 6½ percent
of GDP is still some 1 percent larger than its historical size. However, the fallout from a
house price correction for household consumption would be limited by the relatively low

13
level of household indebtedness and the relatively difficult access to mortgage financing.2
On the upside, a smaller-than-projected increase in unemployment could strengthen
consumption growth and bolster confidence. A further depreciation of the euro could lend
additional support to exports. Visible progress in the reform agenda, including fiscal
consolidation, financial regulation, and structural measures, would inspire confidence and
boost demand.
B. Potential Growth has Fallen
12.
Potential growth is expected to return to trend over the medium term while the
trend rate would be lower than in the recent past due to demographic factors. Potential
growth is expected to remain at about 1 percent in 2010–11 and to gradually return to its
trend rate of about 1½ percent over the medium term. In staff’s view, the trend rate would be
some ½ percent lower than over the last decade owing notably to population aging. The drop
in potential growth over 2009–11 is associated with the impact of the recession and financial
stress. It is linked to the sharp contraction of investment and the resulting slowdown in
capital accumulation, a rise in structural unemployment, and a possible temporary reduction
in allocative efficiency that could lower total factor productivity growth. Although potential
growth is projected to gradually rebound to its trend rate, the French economy has suffered a
permanent loss of about 3½ percent in the level of potential output. The adjustment to the
diminished productive capacity could result in persistently high unemployment going
forward. The authorities were more optimistic regarding both the trend growth rate of
potential output and the impact of the past recession, mainly reflecting their higher estimate
of total factor productivity growth.

III. POLICY CHALLENGES: SAFEGUARDING FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY, ENSURING
FINANCIAL STABILITY, AND INCREASING GROWTH
13.
To strengthen the French recovery, key policy challenges lie in the areas of
safeguarding fiscal sustainability, ensuring financial stability, and increasing growth.
The authorities have taken important policy actions that have helped to reestablish financial
stability and mitigate the impact of the global downturn on the French economy. However,
the recession has left significant policy challenges in its wake, key among which are fiscal
consolidation, better financial regulation, and structural reforms.
A. Fiscal Sustainability: Achieving a Large and Durable Consolidation
14.
The fiscal stimulus package that has helped support domestic demand is set to
largely expire by end-2010. The stimulus measures of about 2¼ percent of GDP enacted
in 2009–10 have been mostly front-loaded, diversified, and well-targeted. Good public
financial management has helped maintain an appropriate pace of implementation of the
stimulus. The amended budget law for 2010 includes additional stimulus of 0.6 percent of
GDP from the abolition of the local business tax (taxe professionelle), in order to stimulate
business investment, that is only partly offset by other taxes (Box 4), and 0.1 percent of GDP
from the new public investment program focused on education and research (investissements
d’avenir). The bulk of stimulus measures is set to automatically end in 2010.
15.
The impact of the recession on the fiscal balance has aggravated the challenging
debt situation associated with mounting aging-related spending pressures. Under current
policies, the primary balance is set to remain in

Box 4. The 2010 Local Business Tax Reform in France
Beginning in 2010, the government suppressed the controversial local business tax (taxe
professionnelle, TP), as part of the stimulus measures targeted at boosting competitiveness and
growth, especially for SMEs. The TP used to be levied on the value of the fixed asset base of
companies, namely property (that will still be taxed but under a different name) and capital equipment
(abolished). As a result, investment suffered, especially in industry, energy and transport sectors, which
contributed about two-thirds of the total revenues generated by the tax. Over the past years, the
government had already made some concessions to certain types of business, exempting artisans, farmers
as well as rural and urban development zones, introduced an exemption for new capital investment, and
added a cap on tax increases for larger companies.
TP was one of three local taxes that funded local government services in France. In 2007, TP
amounted to 1.5 percent of GDP, as compared to the respective revenues of 1.1 and 0.8 percent of GDP
from the property tax (the taxe foncière, TF) and the residence tax (the the taxe d’habitation (TH). The
proceeds from TP were split between local governments (0.9 percent of GDP, of which about 0.3 percent
came from the central government to substitute for TP exonerations), departments (0.45 percent of GDP),
and regions (the remaining 0.1 percent of GDP). TP came under fire for its poor horizontal redistribution
properties as it favored more industrialized jurisdictions, for some of which it accounted for up to
80 percent of total revenues.
The central government pledged to shelter the local governments from any revenue loss due to TP
reform. After being compensated in 2010, local authorities will be assigned revenues from several other
taxes, many with a less volatile base than capital investment under TP. In particular, the TP revenue loss
is expected to be offset by a combination of quotas from the property tax on enterprises (the cotisation
foncière des enterprises, CFE) and VAT (the cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée des enterprises, CVAE).
The CVAE progressive rates will range from zero to 1.5 percent, depending on turnover. Large energy,
telecommunications, and railway companies will pay an additional lump-sum levy. For the central
government, the losses are projected to phase out gradually, in line with the widening tax base for the
corporate income tax.

16.
The government is firmly committed to undertaking a large fiscal consolidation
starting in 2011, which staff supports. France’s Stability Program 2010–13 aims to reduce
the deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 2013, and important steps have been taken to increase the
national ownership of the targeted consolidation, including by further strengthening the
multiyear budgetary framework for 2011–13. Pursuant a national conference on the public
deficit, a number of working groups are suggesting ways to re-establish equilibrium in public

16
finances in France, encompassing all levels of government. In June, a major pension reform
was announced that is to be legislated in the coming months (see below). Already announced
revenue measures include gradually offsetting the revenue loss due to the abolishment of the
local business tax and reducing the numerous tax expenditures (by €5 billion during 2011–
12, to reach the total of €6 billion in 2013). The proposed ban on introducing new tax
expenditures and exonerations from social security contributions outside the budgetary
process would mark encouraging progress in improving fiscal discipline. On the expenditure
side, the announced measures envisage increased efforts of the central government, including
continued personnel reduction (replacing only one in two retiring civil servants) and a
nominal spending freeze, also applicable to transfers to the local governments, but excluding
interest and pension outlays.
17.
Overall, the recently announced fiscal measures, provided these are legislated
and implemented, are sizeable and ensure that all levels of government participate in
fiscal consolidation. The table below quantifies the announcements in terms of their impact
on revenues and expenditures. Key efforts will come from spending freezes and cuts at the
central government level and from the pension reform package. For local governments, the
freeze on central government transfers is very important to improve spending discipline.

18.
The announced fiscal package contains a range of necessary elements but
further efforts are needed to achieve the envisaged consolidation beyond 2011. The
government’s consolidation program is based on the overly optimistic assumption that
annual growth will increase to 2½ percent in 2011–13. The authorities indicated that they
are in the process of revising their growth projections and saw merit in staff’s advice of
developing a set of contingency spending measures in case economic developments turn out
worse than projected. The baseline scenario, that is built on staff’s macroeconomic
projections and excludes measures that still need to be legislated, shows that the overall
deficit would appropriately decline to about 6 percent of GDP in 2011, but remain at about
4 percent of GDP by 2013. A debt sustainability analysis shows a debt ratio that would

19.
A major pension reform has recently been announced as a key part of the
authorities’ strategy to control social spending over the medium term. On June 16, the
details were unveiled of the proposed reform, which aims to achieve financial equilibrium in
the pension system by 2018 from a current deficit of almost 1.5 percent of GDP. In
particular, the reform would gradually increase the effective retirement age by
simultaneously raising the legal retirement age from 60 to 62 years and the legal minimum
age of full pension entitlement from 65 to 67 years; raise high-income pension
3

18
contributions; and gradually align the pension system of civil servants with that of the
private sector. In parallel, resulting from previous reforms, the contribution period is being
lengthened to reach 41 years in 2012 (Box 5). The reform is expected to provide a tangible
increase in the effective retirement age, currently among the lowest among OECD countries.
This will allow for better synchronizing the retirement policies with life expectancy at
retirement, which at 28 years for women and 24 for men is the longest among advanced
countries. In healthcare, significant reforms are needed to contain spending, in order to put
the healthcare system on a solid financial footing and reduce its persistent deficits. A
number of proposed measures aim to limit hospital and drugs costs and to better enforce the
planned reduction of the existing spending norm (ONDAM), but significantly more needs to
be done.4
Box 5. The Pension System in France
France’s compulsory pay-as-you-go pension system, one of the oldest in Europe, is also one of the
most generous. Currently, about a quarter of the French population (16 million people) receives
pensions that total 13.5 percent of GDP.

the private sector, a situation the government wants to alter.
Previous reform efforts in France succeeded in changing the parameters of the system, though at a
significant cost, including lengthy periods of social unrest. During 1985–91, the government raised
the employees’ contribution rates from 4.7 to 6.55 percent. The 1993 reform increased the base wage for
calculating pensions in the private sector from the top 10 years to the top 25 years. Subsequent attempts
have only brought limited cost-savings. The 2003 reform aimed at linking the contribution years for a
full pension to life expectancy. The minimum contribution period for a full pension was increased from
37.5 to 40 years and, gradually, to 41 years by 2012 and 41.5 years by 2020. The 2007 reform extended
the increase in contribution period to pensions under special regimes. These reforms will continue under
the current reform effort.

4

A working group has outlined a number of detailed recommendations.

19
20.
Efforts to control local government spending are underway but need to be
decisively maintained over the medium term. The significant decentralization efforts
between 1990 and 2004 brought rapid growth of local government spending that averaged
above 8 percent per year in real terms during the past decade, bolstered by increasing
transfers from the central government. The authorities pointed out that freezing central
government transfers to local governments in nominal terms over 2011–13 will encourage
efficiency gains, including by reducing the duplication of responsibilities for each of the four
layers of the local government. The latter could be accomplished by mimicking the central
government policy of not replacing some retiring civil servants at the departmental and
regional levels. The recent local business tax reform, combined with efforts to increase
transparency and accountability, including by tying future increases in the local tax burden
on firms to those on households, are welcome steps.
21.
A sizable consolidation requires strengthening of the credibility and full
national ownership of the medium-term consolidation objectives. Based on the
experience from previous fiscal consolidations in France and elsewhere, successful
adjustments usually rely on credible, comprehensive multi-year budgetary frameworks (see
Analytical Note 2). The authorities concurred that to support the current consolidation plan
the formal fiscal framework needs to be extended beyond the central government to
encompass the local governments and the social security systems. To enhance credibility, the
multiyear budget should rely on realistic independent macroeconomic forecasts (Box 6). The
authorities are considering setting up a council to validate the macroeconomic assumptions
underlying the multiyear budget.
22.
Introducing a fiscal rule would significantly strengthen the credibility of the
consolidation and support better fiscal discipline in the Euro Area. A high-level working
group is examining the modalities of a possible fiscal rule and will present its
recommendations by end-June.5 The authorities indicated their desire to have a rule that is
tailored to France-specific circumstances, notably as regards the coordination of the
contribution of the different levels of government to the implementation of the rule. Staff
encouraged the authorities to adopt, like others European countries, a fiscal rule on the
structural government balance, preferably with a built-in debt-brake mechanism. To be
credible, the rule should be enshrined in high-level legislation (e.g., either the Constitution or
a loi organique). With a further large EU member following this route, the step would
constitute a de facto strengthening of the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact
and boost fiscal discipline in the Euro Area.

5

The working group is chaired by former IMF Managing Director Camdessus and comprises high-ranking
officials, parliamentarians, and leading French and other European academics.

20

Box 6. Strengthening Macroeconomic Assumptions for Multiyear Budgets
Multiyear macroeconomic forecasts done by the budget-preparing entities tend to be
systematically biased upwards for the outer years. This bias has been present, in particular, in the
Stability Programs submitted annually by members of the Euro Area. A recent study by the European
Commission found substantial positive forecast errors in
growth assumptions underlying fiscal projections one

Japan. There is considerable variation in the extent to
which an independent agency of either type is expected to analyze current fiscal developments and the
costs of budgetary initiatives. However, the existence of an independent agency of either type helps
make the forecasts of the relevant macroeconomic variables more realistic.
Country experiences include the Central Planning Bureau (CPB) of the Netherlands which conducts
detailed analyses and provides the economic assumptions for the budget. It also undertakes research on a
broad range of economic issues and plays a key role in the development of the fiscal policy contained in
the agreements among the government coalition partners. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
advises Congress on a range of fiscal issues. It analyzes the administration’s budget based on its own
assumptions, “scores” new legislative proposals, and produces a large number and variety of in-depth
analyses and reports. In Canada, budgets are based on macroeconomic assumptions averaged across the
lower bound of the private forecasters’ consensus. In Chile, to strengthen the implementation of the
structural fiscal rule, the projection of inputs needed for estimating the trend GDP and “trend” copper
prices is delegated to two independent expert panels.

B. Financial Stability: Towards a Safer and More Resilient Financial Sector
23.
French banks are emerging relatively stronger from the global financial crisis
and a gradual exit from crisis-related financial support is under way. Staff and
authorities agreed that the response the financial crisis had been successful. The refinancing
scheme was allowed to expire at end-2009, and BPCE (see below) is the only bank still
retaining some state capital. Driven by rising revenues across business lines (including retail,
corporate and investment banking) and good control over operating expenses, gross
operating profits of major French banks surged from €25 billion in 2008 to about €45 billion
in 2009, in part reflecting low refinancing costs at the ECB. Despite the increase in the cost
of risk, all major banks registered rising net profits and the rate of return on equity rose by
two percentage points to above 6 percent in 2009. Retained earnings, equity issuances and a
reduction of risk weighted assets, helped increase Tier 1 capital ratios from 8.7 in 2008 to
10.2 in 2009, above the Euro Area average of 9.1.

21
24.
The crisis-related mergers in the financial sector increased the systemic
importance of major institutions. A high level of concentration and significant crossownership among financial institutions—including between banks and insurance companies
(“bank assurance”)—have been long-standing characteristics of the French financial system.
As a result of the crisis, this feature became more dominant, given that domestic and crossborder consolidation has been one of the responses to address financial sector problems.
Specifically, the acquisition by BNP Paribas of Fortis Banque in Belgium and Luxembourg
and the merger of Groupe Caisse d’Épargne (GCE) and Groupe Banque Populaire (GBP) to
create BPCE made the sector more dominated by systemically important financial
institutions (SIFIs).
25.
The new supervisory structure responds to the need for systemic supervision
while control over remuneration aims to reduce incentives for excessive risk taking.
The new Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel (ACP) introduced in early 2010 merges banking
and insurance supervision, licensing, and consumer protection. Staff and authorities agreed
that a unified agency can more effectively control risks arising from cross-ownership and the
systemic implications of the large entities active in different sectors. The responsibilities of
the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) now include all markets and products as well as
consumer protection, and a risk committee has been added. The reform will be completed by
the planned creation of a systemic risk board (Conseil de Régulation Financière et du Risque
Systémique), with participation of all relevant supervisors and government bodies. This body
will also be linked to the European Systemic Risk Board to be established at the ECB. The
authorities introduced one-time taxes on bonuses granted in 2009, and implemented G20
recommendations for sound compensation practices. France, along with other EU countries,
is planning to impose a financial levy to protect taxpayers from the costs of future potential
financial crises.
26.
The fragile recovery and possible spillovers from the European sovereign debt
crisis are now putting renewed stress on the financial system. As a result of the recession,
asset quality has worsened, and large exposures of the French financial system to Southern
Europe have raised concerns about spillovers and contagion (Box 7). On asset quality,
nonperforming loans increased to 3.8 percent of the total loan portfolio in 2010:Q1. Staff
expressed concern that the slow and fragile recovery may lead to further pressures on loan
quality and banking income, and require additional provisions. With interest rates and
exceptional liquidity conditions normalizing and competition returning, corporate and
investment banking revenues are unlikely to be sustained at their 2009 level. Additional
writedowns on portfolios of risky assets, including commercial real estate, legacy troubled
and illiquid securities, and leveraged buy-outs (LBOs), are likely to continue, although at a
lower rate than before. Fears of negative spillovers to French banks and insurance companies
from the recession and sovereign debt problems in Southern Europe could have a negative
impact on performance and outlook; they have already led to significant losses in market

22

Box 7. Exposures of French Banks to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal,
and Spain (EA5)
France has diversified exposures to other European countries, including the EA5. Based on the
latest BIS data, French bank exposures to EA5 account for about 7 percent of bank assets and 30 percent
of nominal GDP. Of the French exposures to EA5 countries, 15 percent are to Greece, Ireland, and
Portugal, while 60 percent are to Italy and 25 percent to Spain. The BIS data comprise of holdings of
government debt, interbank loans, equity shares, and subsidiaries in EA5 countries. French banks
published their exposures to Greece.
Exposures of French banks to EA5 are dominated by claims on nonfinancial corporates. The sector
breakdown shows that about half of the exposures are accounted for by claims on corporates and a third
are accounted for by holdings of government securities. The breakdown varies by individual countries
with exposures to Italy’s public and corporate sector being the highest among public and corporate
exposures to EA5 countries and exposures to Spain’s financial sector being the highest among exposures
to banks in EA5 countries.
The direct impact on French banks of the Greek debt crisis is likely to be manageable. The two
French banks most exposed to Greece gain substantial exposures mostly through the loan books in their
Greek subsidiaries, which are small in comparison with the size of the respective French parent banks.
Individual French banks’ exposures to Greece, Portugal, and Spain range from 2 to 10 percent of equity,
compared with about 70 percent of large European banks having exposures above 10 percent of equity
and the largest one having exposures of over several times of equity. The counterparty risk and funding
risk of French banks may increase consequently, but given the dominance of corporate loans, the direct
impact will depend to a large extent on the depth of the recession in these countries.
However, French banks remain vulnerable to spillovers. The foreign exposures of French banks tilt
toward mature markets. Exposure to mature markets represented 83 percent of total foreign claims in
2009, dominated by exposures to Belgium, Germany, the U.S., and the U.K. France would be vulnerable
to spillovers from these countries too if they were to be affected in the first place, which would
significantly weaken the capital and liquidity position of the banks.

valuation, and contributed to the difficulties in medium and longer term funding. Spillovers
of potential financial sector stress in France could imply reduced lending in Central and
Eastern Europe.

23
27.
As a result of spillovers, funding pressures could intensify. The funding
environment for all banks in Europe is difficult: they face high rollover needs, competition
for funding from much higher sovereign issuances, the expected withdrawal of extensive
liquidity support from the ECB, and more competition for deposits to meet new liquidity
requirements. French banks rely considerably on wholesale funding and have increased their
reliance on ECB longer-term funding over recent quarters, although their share remained
lower than their weight in the Euro Area banking sector. Banks have to either find ways to
renew their funding, extend maturities, issue more long-term debt, build stronger liquidity
buffers, or deleverage from the funding side. Staff noted that in addition to pressures
common to all European banks, French banks might suffer from the perceived risks of their
comparatively larger exposures to Southern Europe, which could reduce access and increase
costs of funding, especially in US dollars. The authorities felt that the diversified nature of
the exposures of the financial sector across different Southern European countries, including
both sovereign and commercial debt, would limit potential fallout. Nevertheless, reactivating the government-supported bank refinancing scheme may be considered if needed
as well as continuing with the bank recapitalization scheme, in case banks are unable to raise
sufficient capital to fully address a shortfall should this be revealed by the ongoing stress
tests.
28.
More transparency and better communication may help market assessment of
the French financial system. Staff argued that publication of stress tests and greater
transparency on country exposures could be confidence enhancing. While seeing merit in the
publication of the stress tests coordinated by the Committee of European Banking
Supervisors (CEBS), the authorities were concerned that certain types of stress tests—
particularly those testing resilience to sovereign risk—could put in question the credibility of
the European response to the ongoing crisis.6 Staff noted that appropriate and coordinated
disclosure of key exposures, preferably at the European level, could also provide better
guidance to markets than publicly available but possibly misleading information. More
frequent publication of supervisory data on financial soundness, including developments in
nonperforming loans, would also be helpful.
29.
France actively supports international financial regulatory reform but has
raised concerns that elements of the proposals might impose excessively high costs. The
authorities have participated in the expert groups and discussions of the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision (BCBS) and CEBS on enhanced capital and liquidity requirements.
They have also contributed to the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives markets along
with the AMF and to the design of an EU framework for crisis management and resolution of
cross-border financial institutions along with the US Treasury. While fully supporting the
aims of the regulatory reform proposals for banks and insurance companies, the authorities
6

After the mission, the EU announced the publication of the stress tests results in July.

24
raised concerns that Basel III might require substantial additional capital for integrated
financial systems such as those in France. If implemented without further adaptations, it
could lower lending and depress growth. Staff noted that these reforms remain to be fully
defined and urged France to actively participate in ongoing macroeconomic impact studies
and follow-up work to refine the reform proposals.
C. Increasing Growth: Modernizing the Economic Structure
30.
The output losses from the crisis require a renewed and more effective
emphasis on measures to raise competitiveness, in order to enable France to benefit more
from the rebound in global trade. Like most advanced economies, France has experienced a
marked deterioration in export performance over the last decade, with the current account
balance deteriorating and foreign market shares sliding (Figure 4). Although the overall
exchange rate assessment based on the CGER methodologies does not suggest
disequilibrium, the overvaluation of the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), driven in
part by the dynamics of the euro, points to a lack of competitiveness in global markets. The
recent depreciation of the euro would help strengthen competitiveness vis-à-vis outside the
Euro Area. Within the Euro Area, there is a widening competitiveness gap, in particular
related to diverging unit labor costs, with the best performers, which are France’s principal
competitors in the global market. The current boon to French competitiveness from a sharp
increase in unit labor costs in a number of France’s trading partners is likely to be
temporary, as short-time work schemes in these countries are being phased out. In addition,
supply rigidities in responding to changing global demand have also played an important
role in hampering export performance. Restoring competitiveness will require policies to
encourage wage moderation, foster research and development, promote innovation, improve
competition, and create favorable conditions for businesses to grow (see Analytical Note 3).

31.
The authorities agreed that with the ongoing sluggish recovery, structural
reforms that help increase economic growth in a durable manner are urgent. The
recession has done substantial harm to the productive capacity of the French economy and
has further increased the already high unemployment rate. In this environment, measures
introduced under the Plan de Relance to shield workers and specific sectors, such as the car
industry and construction, during the downturn need to be phased out in order to avoid
lasting damage to incentives and economic efficiency. At the same time, structural reform
efforts must be stepped up to facilitate job creation and achieve higher potential growth. Staff
estimates suggest that further labor and product market reforms that would bring France in
line with best practices could raise growth by about ¾ percent per year over the medium
term. The mission also emphasized that higher growth in France would help to reduce global
imbalances.
32.
The main policy priorities in the labor market include facilitating re-absorption
of the unemployed and increasing the employment rate. The recent recession caused a
substantial increase in the unemployment rate (Box 8). Since the recovery is expected to
remain sluggish, unemployment is likely to stay high for some time, calling for policy action
to promote job creation. At the same time, the French employment rate remains one of the
lowest among OECD countries, especially among seniors, low-skilled, and young workers
(Figure 5). The authorities attached great importance to lifting the employment rate to boost
potential growth and help restore fiscal sustainability, in part through reducing
unemployment-related public expenditures.
33.
The need to re-absorb the unemployed and avoid a rise in structural
unemployment calls for measures to stimulate job creation and to step up activation
policies. On the demand side, staff suggested to consider temporary hiring incentives (in the
form of credits for new hires or lower payroll contributions) that target vulnerable categories
of workers and would encourage employers to take on new employees. On the supply side,
the authorities indicated that the unified job placement agency (Pôle emploi) is poised to
better support unemployed workers in their job search, while continued efforts to improve
training opportunities and reduce skill mismatches would facilitate efficiency-enhancing
labor mobility. In addition, staff considered that job-search requirements need to be strictly
enforced.
34.
Beyond cyclical factors, lifting the low employment rate would require durably
improving job-search and hiring incentives and increasing labor force participation,
especially among seniors, the youth, and the low-skilled. While progress is being made on
this front, the authorities and staff agreed that much remains to be done. The policy priorities
in these areas are:


Eliminating inactivity traps. The high minimum wage (SMIC) keeps potential
employees, especially low-skilled and young workers, out of the labor force. Thus,
moderation of SMIC increases and the elimination of the coup de pouce should be

27
pursued, in order to gradually reestablish a motivating pay scale. Further steps should
also be taken to reduce the relatively high tax wedge and employment protection. The
recently introduced Working Solidarity Benefit (RSA) is a welcome step toward
removing inactivity traps. In addition, the recent creation of the self-employed status
should expand the set of job opportunities.
Box 8. Why has Unemployment Increased?
Notwithstanding the relatively mild recession in France, the unemployment rate has increased on
par with many other advanced economies. In particular, the unemployment rate has gone up
considerably more in France than in Germany and Italy, both of which have experienced much deeper
recessions than France. These developments can be explained by different sensitivities of unemployment
to the recent recession in France and its peers.1/
Staff estimates suggest that in normal times the sensitivity of unemployment to real output growth
in France is similar to its peers, in particular Germany and Italy. The unemployment dynamics can
be explained by Okun’s law that relates changes in the unemployment rate to real output growth.
Estimates of this model suggest that over the 20 years before the latest recession responses of
unemployment to real output growth in France, Germany, and Italy were broadly similar.
However, during the recent recession, the unemployment response in France was stronger than
usual, while it was weaker than usual in Germany, Italy, and a few other countries. In France, nearly
half of the total unemployment increase during the recession cannot be explained by its depth. Some of
this gap can be attributed to the adjustment in specific sectors, including financial services and
construction, where the reduction in employment has likely exceeded the decline in the value added. At
the same time, generous partial unemployment programs adopted in a number of countries, in particular
Germany and Italy, have likely reduced the effect of the recession on unemployment. Staff estimates
suggest that in the absence of these programs unemployment would have increased about ½ percent more
in Germany and 1½ percent more in Italy.

Integrating senior workers. Weak job-search and hiring incentives contribute to
underemployment of senior workers. The removal of financial obstacles to combining
earned income with a pension after age 60 and the abolishment of forced retirement
before age 70 are steps in the right direction. Increasing the minimum age for pension
eligibility, part of the announced pension reform, is a critical step toward raising
senior employment and should be combined with improved incentives for continued
work, including effective implementation of job-search requirements.

35.
Further enhancing domestic competition would increase economic efficiency.
While France is gradually catching up with best practices in product market competition
reform, the authorities agreed that more needs to be done, particularly in retail trade and
services. In retail trade, the Economic Modernization Law (Loi de Modernisation de
l’Economie, LME) has introduced measures to strengthen competition and eased some
restrictions on new retail establishments, but discounters continue to face administrative
limitations to entry into the French market. Deregulating opening hours and sales periods of
stores would promote a more competitive environment leading to lower prices for
consumers. Also, the benefits to the consumer of ending price regulations on key products,
for example over-the-counter drugs, would be enhanced if followed by market
liberalization. In the services sector, the EU Services Directive should be followed to
achieve further liberalization. Introducing greater competition in health-related services and
professional services to businesses and individuals (notaries, accountants) would be
welcome.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The French economy weathered the “great recession” better than most of its
peers, but the recovery is fragile. The less severe downturn in France can be attributed to
the comparatively low trade openness, fairly resilient financial sector, large social safety
nets, and timely and decisive government intervention. Nonetheless, the unemployment rate
has risen steeply, notably among the young. The financial crisis and economic downturn
have exerted a significant toll on public finances, and in the financial sector concerns remain
about asset quality, possible spillovers from mature markets, and regulatory uncertainty.
37.
The turbulence in European debt markets and a challenging domestic policy
agenda make the outlook for France highly uncertain. Growth is expected to pick up only
slightly during 2010–11. Persistently high unemployment and imminent fiscal consolidation
in France and her main trading partners will weigh on demand, while the recent depreciation
of the euro will provide some relief. Inflation is expected to remain moderate. Risks to the
outlook are mostly on the downside in view of concerns about sovereign risks and possible
spillovers in the Euro Area. Potential growth is expected to remain subdued, and the output
gap would narrow only gradually.

30
38.
Under these demanding circumstances, the key policy challenge is to strengthen
the foundations of the economy by implementing a credible multiyear fiscal consolidation
strategy underpinned by pension reform, supporting the full recovery of the financial system
and increasing financial stability, and accelerating progress on structural reforms in order to
boost competitiveness, create jobs, and increase economic growth.
39.
The sharply increased public debt and the turbulence in European financial
markets call for significant and credible fiscal consolidation. While the fiscal stimulus in
2009-10 has been appropriate, the authorities must now focus on achieving their objective
under the Stability and Growth Pact of reducing the overall fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP
by 2013. This is crucial to anchor expectations and avoid an unsustainable debt dynamics.
The adjustment efforts should concentrate on measures that have the least detrimental impact
on economic activity. In particular, entitlement reforms in the pension and health care
systems are key while full attention should be given to limiting the growth of local
government spending.
40.
The announced fiscal consolidation measures would result in an appropriate
deficit reduction in 2011, but further measures need to be prepared to achieve the
medium-term fiscal objectives. Expenditure constraint of the central government, including
continued personnel reductions and a nominal freeze of transfers to local governments are
important. The recently announced pension reform rightly emphasizes an increase in the
effective retirement age in order to reduce the deficit of the pension system over time. Efforts
to control local government spending need to be decisively maintained over the medium
term. The proposed ban on off-budget introduction of new tax expenditures and exemptions
from social security contributions will improve fiscal discipline.
41.
The consolidation effort should be based on realistic macroeconomic
assumptions and supported by a fiscal rule. In order to avoid underestimating the size of
the needed fiscal efforts and derailing the consolidation process, the multiyear budget should
rely on an independent council to validate the underlying macroeconomic forecasts.
Adopting a fiscal rule would strengthen the consolidation strategy and add credibility both to
the national efforts and to the broader European fiscal governance reforms. Staff encourages
the authorities to adopt a fiscal rule on the structural general government balance that is
enshrined in the highest legislation.
42.
French banks are emerging from the crisis with improving profitability but the
sluggish recovery and concerns about European sovereign debt pose new risks. Banks
have significantly shored up capital adequacy ratios and are gradually exiting from state
support. However, nonperforming loans have risen and low growth may put further pressure
on loan quality and require additional provisions. Although the direct impact on French
banks of the Greek debt problem is likely to be manageable, the counterparty risk and
funding risk of French banks vis-à-vis Southern Europe has increased. If needed, the
authorities should stand ready to support banks with public refinancing and recapitalization

31
schemes. More transparency and better communication of key exposures, in addition to
publication of the results of EU-wide stress tests, may help the market’s assessment of the
French financial system.
43.
Reform of supervisory arrangements has progressed well and France is playing
an active role in promoting international regulatory reforms. The recent unification of
banking and insurance supervision is welcome. It is now important to set up the national
systemic risk board to enable close cooperation with the envisage European Systemic Risk
Board. Staff encourages France to remain engaged in the international regulatory reform
process and to actively participate in ongoing macroeconomic impact studies and follow-up
work to refine the current reform proposals.
44.
A more competitive and growth-oriented economy is essential for recouping the
output loss incurred during the recession. To catch up with the most competitive countries
in the Euro Area and benefit more from the expansion in world trade, wage moderation,
promoting competition, and promoting innovation are critical. In view of the considerable
growth impact, it is urgent to focus on job creation and improving market efficiency. In
addition to labor market activation and training policies, minimum wage moderation should
continue to gradually establish a motivating pay scale for young and low-skilled workers. For
senior workers, efforts to improve incentives for continued work, including effective jobsearch requirements, need to be pursued. Further deregulation of product markets would
enhance economic efficiency and raise welfare. The EU Services Directive should be
followed to achieve further liberalization, including in professional services.
45.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the regular
12-month cycle.

France–Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC): Module I–Fiscal Transparency

October 17, 2000

Fiscal Transparency—Update

IMF Country Report
No. 01/196, 11/05/01

Fiscal Transparency—Update

IMF Country Report
No. 04/345, 11/03/04

Summary: The report found that France has achieved a high level of fiscal transparency and
has introduced a number of improvements in coverage and presentation of fiscal information.
Notable areas of progress include the development in the final accounts publication to
include more complete information on government assets and liabilities as well as disclosure
of contingent liabilities. Accounting standards have been changed to reflect accruals
principles in a number of areas, and these standards are clearly explained. The staff suggested
that further steps could be taken to identify and report quasi-fiscal activities in the budget
presentation, provide a more consolidated picture of fiscal activity outside the appropriation
process, and improve the reconciliation of stated policies with outcomes at the general
government level.
These issues have been addressed in the Loi organique aux lois de finance (LOLF), which
has become fully effective on January 1, 2006. In addition to the annual appropriations, the
first multi-annual fiscal framework law was adopted in January 2009, and contains fiscal
objectives for the period 2009–12. The budget is organized along missions and provides
details on the level of appropriations for each mission and performance indicators by which
the expected results of the mission will be assessed ex post. The State Audit Office has been

5
given the new assignment of certifying the public accounts, and implementation of accrualsbasis accounting has been confirmed. Parliamentary oversight powers have been
strengthened.

priority by all financial agencies assessed, and they are in observance of the good practices of
the Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies. The major
agencies disclose their objectives, their legal and institutional frameworks, and have open
processes of policymaking and regulation. The principles of transparency are observed by
dissemination of relevant information to the public and in the agencies’ arrangements for
internal conduct, integrity, and accountability. However, the staff noted that the framework
for supervision and regulation applicable to mutual insurance firms is not as well defined and
suggested to improve its transparency. The transparency of monetary policy was not assessed
by the Fund team as the Banque de France is a member of the European System of Central
Banks and no longer conducts independent monetary policy.
Subsequently, the framework for supervision and regulation applicable to a specific group of
mutual insurance firms was modified in a number of steps. In August 2003, legislation
created a single supervisory body, the Commission de Contrôle des Assurances, Mutuelles et
Institutions de Prévoyance (CCAMIP) by merging the regular insurance supervisor (CCA)
and mutualities’ supervisor (CCMIP). Coordination with the banking sector supervisors was
strengthened and the powers of the supervisory authorities extended.

Summary: The report found that France is in observance of the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS). In particular, the mandate of INSEE and the Banque de
France for the production of the six macroeconomic datasets is clearly defined, with the
reporting burden and the confidentiality provisions given special consideration notably
through the CNIS. Professionalism is central to the statistical operations of the two
institutions, internationally and/or European accepted methodologies are generally followed,
the degree of accuracy and reliability of the six datasets is remarkable, statistics are relevant
and provided on a timely basis, and they are accessible to the public.
The report made a number of suggestions for further improvements: the responsibility of
INSEE as the producer of government finance statistics should be clarified; data sharing
between the Banque de France and the rest of the French statistical system improved;
classification and valuation methods in balance-of-payments statistics reviewed; consistency
between the current account of the balance of payments and the goods and services account
in the national accounts improved; the timing of revisions in the quarterly and annual
national accounts aligned; and identification of data production units of INSEE facilitated.
France continues to implement several of the 2003 ROSC Data Module recommendations,
including by promoting a broader understanding of statistical data revisions, making greater
use of firm-level data to improve the measurement of changes in stocks, and intensifying
work on portfolio investment income with the objective of starting to record those
transactions on an accrual basis.

Summary: The report concluded that France’s financial sector is strong and well supervised.
No weaknesses that could cause systemic risks were identified. The strength of the system is
supported by the financial soundness indicators and the strong conformity to the supervisory
and regulatory standards approved by the Basel Committee, IAIS, IOSCO, FATF, and CPSS.
The degree of observance of the transparency code is high in all relevant areas. The French
banking sector has been modernized and restructured over the past two decades and is well

7
capitalized. Systemic vulnerabilities in the important insurance sector are well contained.
Securities markets are large and sophisticated.
Notwithstanding the strengths of the French financial sector, a number of issues emerged
from the FSAP, including (i) concentration in banking may have reached a point where
further consolidation could intensify concerns over the scope for collusion and long-term
stability where many banks could be considered “too big to fail;” (ii) banks’ large and
growing portfolios of fixed-rate residential housing loans could represent a longer-term risk
in the event of large increases in funding costs and/or a significant fall in real estate prices;
(iii) some administered savings schemes and other policy measures give rise to costs and
impede financial market innovation. These schemes are not well targeted to achieve intended
social goals and are not well aligned with current priorities, such as strengthening the pension
system; (iv) the banking system’s rapid accumulation of capital strengthens banks’ resilience.
This accumulation is harder to control for mutual banks, given their legal restrictions on
remuneration of their members. And, for all banks, it could encourage expansion through
expensive takeovers and risky new ventures; (v) the supervisory system of the financial
sector is composed of specialized segments. Coordination mechanisms need to be further
adapted. Additional steps should be considered in the future as cross-sectoral financial
groups become more prevalent; (vi) the consolidation of the French stock and futures
markets with others in Europe has increased the importance of effective cooperation across
national jurisdictions. Moreover, the authorities face the challenge of adjusting to and
effectively implementing the significant regulatory overhaul that took place in late 2003; and
(vii) the infrastructure for the clearing and settlement of payments and securities is generally
sound and modern. However, there is some room for improvement in the clearing and
settlement of retail payments and securities, where the multilateral netting systems lack fully
adequate safeguards to ensure timely settlement in case of default.

8
II. FRANCE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
The economic database is comprehensive and of high quality, and data provision to the Fund
is adequate for surveillance. The authorities regularly publish a full range of economic and
financial data, and calendar dates of main statistical releases are also provided. France
subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The transmission of data in
electronic form from INSEE (Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques)
and the profusion of data from various institutions (Banque de France, INSEE, ministry of
finance, ministry of labor and solidarity) have helped to build an infrastructure, in which all
data can be easily accessed through the Economic Data Sharing System. A data ROSC
mission conducted an assessment of the statistical system in March 2003, and the report was
published in October 2003. A factual update to the main report was published in November
2004.
France’s monetary and banking statistics methodology conforms with the European Central
Bank framework, which provides comparable details as the Standardized Report Forms
developed by STA. Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions
and monetary aggregates are prepared on a monthly basis and are timely. Monetary data are
also disseminated in the quarterly IFS Supplement on monetary and financial statistics.
France follows the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95). Data
for GDP and its expenditure components are available from 1978 onwards. Both annual and
quarterly accounts provide reliable information, although estimates from the two accounts
differ slightly before the quarterly accounts are revised to be aligned to the annual ones. In
2005, national accounts estimates were rebased to 2000 prices.
Government finance statistics have been strengthened recently. Both central and general
government data are presented in a more comprehensive fashion than previously and the data
for 2006 and 2007 also reflect the various impacts of recent budgetary reform. Although the
source data is collected by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, INSEE is principally
responsible for the compilation and dissemination of fiscal data in a framework that is
consistent with ESA95. INSEE’s website has recently been enhanced; in particular, it
includes expenditure tables and government revenues by subsector (central government,
miscellaneous central government agencies, local governments, and social security
administration).
Balance-of-payments statistics should be interpreted with caution, given large errors and
omissions. Greater coherence between the external current account and the rest of the world
account in the national accounts is needed. In this regard, work with promising early results
has been undertaken on the transportation account.

FRANCE
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with France
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Martin Mühleisen
July 27, 2010
1.
This supplement provides an update of economic and policy developments since the
release of the staff report (7/14/10). The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
2.
Recent data confirm a continuing gradual recovery. Industrial production in May
increased more-than-expected by 1.7 percent and exports expanded further, but new orders
declined. In June, household consumption of manufactured goods fell with durable goods
consumption shrinking by 1.8 percent (month-on-month and seasonally adjusted). House
prices appear to have broadly stabilized in recent months as the demand for new dwellings
has increased. Business confidence further improved in July, reaching its highest level since
a year ago, but consumer confidence moved sideways amid concerns about the high
unemployment rate.
3.
The pension reform is moving ahead. The draft law on pension reform passed the
Social Affairs Committee of the National Assembly on July 21, with debate in the full
National Assembly slated immediately after the summer recess in early September. The
Committee made no material changes to the government’s reform proposals, including the
gradual raise of the retirement age. This is a welcome step towards implementation of this
important and difficult reform that aims to re-establish financial equilibrium in the pension
system by 2018.
The working group on fiscal rules presented a proposal for a new, strengthened
multi-year budgetary framework, enshrined in the constitution.1 A new multi-year
budget framework law would include a binding trajectory towards a zero structural deficit
and reinforce national ownership of the fiscal objectives set forth in France’s Stability
Programs. The budget framework law would define both a revenue floor and an expenditure

ceiling for the central government and the social security administrations, also encompassing
operations of some general-government entities currently off-budget. The revenue and
spending rules set in the budget framework law will be enforced by the Constitutional
Council and would be binding for the annual budget laws. A system of notional accounts, as
in Germany, would help the adjustment over two subsequent budget years in case of
deviation from the rules. In parallel, limits would be set on the resources transferred to the
constitutionally independent local governments that are already subject to a golden rule.
Moreover, a constitutional amendment would cement recent administrative measures to
prohibit any revenue-reducing initiatives outside of the respective budget laws for the central
government and the social security administration. The working group also calls for the
creation of an independent fiscal council, in order to increase the realism of the
macroeconomic assumptions underlying the budgetary framework and to strengthen the
government’s accountability. Staff supports the recommendations of the working group
which, if implemented, would be instrumental in restoring balance in public finances.
5.
The EU-wide stress test results released on July 23 have confirmed the resilience
of French banks. The four major banking groups participating in the stress test represent
about 80 percent of the French banking system. The French benchmark macroeconomic
scenario assumes real GDP growth of 1.2 percent in 2010 and 1.5 percent in 2011, both
below staff’s baseline scenario. The adverse macroeconomic scenario assumes real GDP
growth of 0.7 percent in 2010 and -0.1 percent in 2011. In addition to the adverse scenario, a
shock was applied to sovereign exposures in banks' trading books and loans to the private
sector in their banking books. The stress scenario—adverse macroeconomic scenario coupled
with the sovereign shock—reduces the average Tier 1 ratio of French banks by 165 basis
points relative to the benchmark level of 9.3 percent at end-2011, which is only 60 basis
points below the actual end-2009 level. The impact on Tier 1 capital of the shock to
sovereign exposures is only 16 basis points on average with small variation among banks.
The Tier 1 ratio of individual banks under the stress scenario ranges from 8.5 to 10 percent,
well above the 6 percent threshold used in the test.
6.
The publication of the stress test results, in combination with the full disclosure
of the sovereign holdings of French banks are helpful steps toward better transparency.
As argued in the staff report, steps in this direction may help the market’s assessment of
French banks. In addition to Europe-wide coordinated efforts, France should—as
recommended in the staff report—continue with appropriate national efforts.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
France
On July 28, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with France.1
Background
A fragile recovery is underway in France. The recession was less severe in France than in
most other advanced economies, reflecting the comparatively low trade openness, fairly
resilient financial sector, large social safety nets, and timely and decisive government
intervention. Nonetheless, the unemployment rate has risen steeply, notably among the
young. The financial crisis and economic downturn have exerted a significant toll on public
finances, and in the financial sector concerns remain about asset quality, and possible
spillovers from mature markets.
The authorities have taken important policy actions to stabilize the financial system and
have implemented a suitable fiscal stimulus to cushion the downturn. With the recovery
underway, the policy focus is shifting from crisis management to strengthening the
foundations of the economy through fiscal consolidation, supporting the full recovery of the

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2
financial system and improving financial regulation. The authorities are also implementing
structural reforms to raise potential growth, create jobs, and strengthen competitiveness.
In light of the sharply increased public debt and the turbulence on European financial
markets, the authorities are firmly committed to strong fiscal adjustment beginning in 2011,
and to reduce the overall fiscal deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by
2013. The fiscal stimulus is set to expire by end-2010. Revenue and expenditure measures
that have already been announced are sizable and would reduce the deficit by some 2
percentage points in 2011. However, further measures at all levels of government are
needed to achieve the envisaged fiscal consolidation over the medium term. In June, a
major pension reform was announced that is to be legislated in the coming months. The
reform would gradually increase the effective retirement age and aims to achieve financial
equilibrium in the pension system by 2018.
French banks are emerging relatively stronger from the global financial crisis and a gradual
exit from crisis-related government support is underway. The EU-wide stress test results
released on July 23 have confirmed the resilience of French banks. The new supervisory
structure that merges banking and insurance supervision responds to the need for systemic
supervision while measures to control financial sector remuneration aim to reduce
incentives for excessive risk-taking. The regulatory reform will be completed by the planned
creation of a systemic risk board with participation of all relevant supervisors and
government bodies. However, increases in nonperforming loans as a result of the recession
and possible spillovers from the European sovereign debt crisis may exert renewed
pressure on the financial sector and constrain lending growth. On the structural front, the
authorities continue to implement their ambitious reform agenda, particularly in the labor
and product markets, with a view to boosting job creation, increasing growth, and
strengthening competitiveness.
The French economy is expected to recover gradually. Real GDP is projected to grow by
1.4 percent in 2010 and 1.6 percent in 2011, somewhat faster than in the Euro Area as a
whole. The same features of the French economy that partly shielded it during the
recession are also likely to slow the pace of the recovery. Risks to the outlook are slanted to
the downside. Lingering concerns about sovereign risks in the Euro Area could dampen
confidence, increase financing costs, and depress demand.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the French economy weathered the global crisis better than
most of its peers. The timely government intervention succeeded in stabilizing the financial
system and cushioning the downturn. Directors noted that the outlook is challenging and
that growth is expected to pick up only gradually. Unemployment and public debt are
relatively high; the imminent fiscal consolidation in France and most European countries will

3
weigh on demand; and lingering concerns about sovereign risks call for continued vigilance.
A vigorous implementation of the authorities’ reform agenda will be needed to support the
recovery.
Directors considered the fiscal stimulus in 2009-10 to be well designed, including the
abolition of the local business tax. Given the sharply increased public debt, the focus in the
years ahead should be on a significant and credible fiscal consolidation. Directors
commended the authorities’ determination to reduce the overall fiscal deficit to 3 percent of
GDP by 2013. They welcomed the already specified consolidation measures, including
continued spending restraint in the central government and a nominal freeze of transfers to
local governments. The announced pension reform is a key component of the consolidation
strategy and rightly emphasizes an increase in the retirement age. Efforts to better control
healthcare spending should also be pursued.
Directors noted that beyond the measures to meet the fiscal target for 2011, further
steps, including contingency measures, will be needed to achieve the medium-term
objectives. To enhance the credibility of the consolidation effort, Directors stressed the
importance of ensuring that the multiyear budget framework is based on realistic
macroeconomic assumptions, and saw merit in proposals for the establishment of an
independent council and the adoption of a fiscal rule.
Directors observed that the French banks are emerging from the crisis with improving
profitability, and welcomed the confirmation of the resilience of the French banks by the
Europe-wide stress test results. They noted that the communication of key exposures helps
transparency and allows for a better assessment of financial sector stability. A sluggish
recovery and relatively high exposures to peripheral Europe may pose new risks, including
for asset quality. Although these risks appear manageable, they require continued strong
supervision. Directors recommended that the authorities should be prepared to take
appropriate additional measures to support banks, if needed. They welcomed the recent
unification of banking and insurance supervision and encouraged France to continue to play
an active role in promoting international regulatory reforms.
Directors stressed the importance of pressing ahead with the structural reform agenda, in
order to strengthen competitiveness, boost job creation and promote innovation. In addition
to labor market activation and training policies, minimum wage moderation should continue
to gradually establish a motivating pay scale for young and low-skilled workers. For senior
workers, efforts to improve incentives for continued work, including effective job-search
requirements, need to be pursued in tandem with the pension reform. Directors encouraged
further steps to improve product and services market flexibility.

Statement by Mr. Ambroise Fayolle, Executive Director for France
July 28, 2010
We wish to thank staff for a comprehensive set of papers, which depict well the policy
challenges faced by France. The discussions with the mission were frank and very much
appreciated by my authorities, and provided useful input to policy formulation. The
mission was also an opportunity to follow-up on several recommendations made last year
by the Executive Board, such as the reduction in tax expenditures, the freeze in
expenditures at the level of the central government, and the launch of an ambitious pension
reform which are all being implemented.
At this critical juncture, the French authorities have clearly indicated their strong
commitment to fiscal consolidation so as to ensure long-term sustainability, as well
as their resolution to maintain the momentum of structural reforms with a view to
increasing competitiveness and potential growth. They consider these two pillars of
the economic strategy as mutually reinforcing.
Outlook: the recovery is gaining strength.
The French economy has weathered the crisis relatively well compared to its peers.
The fiscal stimulus, complemented by the full effect of the sizeable automatic stabilizers,
helped maintain private consumption in positive territory throughout the crisis, and the
economy exited recession during the second quarter of 2009. The financial sector proved
fairly resilient and benefited from an appropriately targeted support, which has now been
almost entirely phased out. Structural features of the economy also contributed to soften the
impact of the shock, as mentioned by staff.
The recovery is now underway and my authorities agree with staff’s growth forecast
for 2010 at 1.4 percent. Activity is rebounding faster than the euro area average and is
driven by private consumption, net exports, and a turn in the inventory cycle. The
depreciation of the euro, by 7.7 percent in nominal effective terms between November 2009
and June 2010, is also expected to bolster the recovery during the second half of the year.
Staff’s forecasts seem, however, rather pessimistic on the growth outlook for 2011.
Indeed, while consumption is expected to remain solid, my authorities foresee that private
investment, which has not yet recovered, will bring a significant contribution to growth in
2011. Short-term indicators from business surveys already suggest a recovery in investment,
and the conventional accelerator effect should gather steam. This forecast for private
investment is also underpinned by the level of interest rates, which is expected to remain low,
and the positive effects of the removal of the local business tax. Besides, my authorities
believe that downside risks should be nuanced, as recent data suggest, e.g., that credit growth
has ceased to slowdown.

My authorities are more sanguine than staff about the impact of the crisis on potential
growth. They estimate French potential growth at 1.7 percent per year over the
medium term (2009-13). While staff rightly indicates that this divergence of views is mainly
related to the foreseen impact of the crisis on total factor productivity growth – which is
indeed ambiguous – we would also stress that the crisis had slightly different features in
France, and in particular a less disruptive effect on the financial sector and on households’
balance sheets. Besides, we expect that the pension reform will gradually translate into a
higher rate of activity, as it was the case following previous waves of reforms (the
employment rate in the 55-64 years bracket has already been raised by 3.6 percentage points
since 2002).
A strong commitment to fiscal sustainability
The global crisis and the large fiscal impulse led to a sharp deterioration of the French
public finances, calling for an ambitious fiscal consolidation. The cost of financing for the
Treasury remains at historically low levels (2.9 percent for 10-year bonds) due to flight to
quality effects. However, recent events in Europe triggered a heightened awareness of risks
to debt sustainability.
In this context, the government is firmly committed to undertaking a large and
durable fiscal consolidation starting in 2011. The French stability program will bring the
deficit down from 8 percent of GDP in 2010 to 6 percent in 2011, and aims at returning to 3
percent of GDP by 2013. Half of the adjustment in 2011 will come from structural savings,
the rest being provided by the phasing out of the stimulus and the recovery of tax revenues.
The complete package of measures to secure the announced deficit path will be finalized by
September.
In line with IMF recommendations, and consistently with the comprehensive diagnostic
of France’s public finances which has been realized beforehand, my authorities intend to
achieve most of the consolidation over the 2011-13 period through expenditures cuts,
as explained in paragraph 16 of the report. All levels of government (central, local, and the
social security system) will contribute to this effort to ensure fiscal sustainability.
The recently announced pension reform is a key element of the fiscal consolidation
strategy. Relying mainly on the gradual increase in the legal retirement age from 60 to 62
and the legal minimum age of full pension entitlement from 65 to 67, this major reform will
eliminate the deficit associated with the pension system by 2018 and bring France in line
with the main comparator countries. The reform will considerably improve medium-term
fiscal sustainability without affecting labor cost and will also have an immediate impact on
tax revenue, since it is partly financed with a moderate increase in taxation of investment
income. As for the residual deficits during the transition period, they will be financed by the

Reserve Fund of the pension system (Fonds de reserve des retraites), which has accumulated
over €33 billion of assets. All other things being equal, the reform will reduce the general
government deficit by 0.5 point of GDP in 2013 and 1.2 point by 2020, and will save close to
10 points in the gross public debt-to-GDP ratio through the period.
This consolidation effort is also underpinned by several structural reforms aiming at
strengthening fiscal discipline. The multiyear budgetary framework has been maintained
and should be strengthened to become more binding. The dynamics of healthcare spending
will also be better controlled with the strengthening of the early warning procedure on
spending overruns, while fiscal governance has been improved with the decision of my
authorities to ban the introduction of any new tax measure outside the budget law (Loi de
Finances) or the social security budget law (Loi de Financement de la Sécurité Sociale). And
finally, as mentioned by staff, the authorities are considering the introduction of a fiscal rule
at the constitutional level. Specific proposals made by the working group chaired by Michel
Camdessus will be discussed with major political parties in the coming weeks, with a view to
introducing the rule in 2011.
Pursuing structural reforms aimed at improving growth
My authorities are determined to maintain the pace of structural reforms, in
accordance with the commitments taken in the E.U and under the G20 MAP. This effort
is being pursued in several directions to improve competitiveness, increase flexibility of the
labor and product markets, and raise potential growth.
Raising competitiveness is clearly a key priority, and action has been taken in
three main directions. First, the removal of the local business tax (Taxe
Professionnelle) is a major improvement to the French tax system and will improve
competitiveness and attractiveness to foreign investment. Second, as the rise in unit
labor costs is one of the main causes of the deterioration in export performance over the
recent period, the elimination of the discretionary increase in the minimum wage, as
recommended by the IMF, should contribute to addressing this issue. Third, the launch
of a €35 billion investment program (Grand Emprunt or Dépenses d’Avenir) designed
to only have a marginal effect on public finances and to leverage private resources, is
meant to boost capacities in education, research, and innovation, and promote a vibrant
knowledge economy over the medium term. The success of the tax credit on research
and development expenditures (credit d’impôt recherche ) will further contribute to
stimulating potential growth.
Efforts are under way to improve the flexibility of the labor market and reduce
structural unemployment. The impact of the crisis has been softened by the temporary
unemployment schemes - as illustrated by the fact that France transitioned from above to
below the Euro area average rate of unemployment during the crisis - and net job creations
are expected to resume by end-year. My authorities are also pursuing their efforts to raise

the employment rates, especially among vulnerable groups. The ongoing pension reform
will complement the efforts made over the last few years (as mentioned above) to address the
situation of senior workers and will have a fairly rapid impact since the increase in the legal
retirement age will be phased in at a faster pace than under similar reforms in other countries.
Fostering low-skilled workers’ participation is also necessary and a consistent effort has been
made over the last years to eliminate inactivity traps with the creation of the PIT tax credit
(Prime pour l’emploi) and the recent introduction of the Working Solidarity Benefit (RSA).
Finally, my authorities are in full agreement with staff that further enhancing
domestic competition would strengthen economic efficiency. They recognize that there is
scope to build on recent measures such as those contained in the Economic Modernization
Law and that the transposition of the E.U Services Directive is improving competition
intensity in France. Ongoing reforms to boost competition in the utilities sectors will also be
beneficial.
Financial sector: maintaining stability
The French financial sector has proved resilient to the crisis and remains solid. Banks
have restored their profitability and strengthened their capital base, and are in a sound
position to support the recovery. The results of the E.U stress testing exercise have
confirmed this assessment: all the four French banks that have been tested (accounting
for 80 percent of the total assets of the French banking system) have easily passed the most
adverse scenario, with a Tier 1 ratio above 9 percent on average. This shows the
resilience of the universal banking model that my authorities intend to preserve going
forward.
My authorities are aware that the highly uncertain environment calls for maintained
vigilance, but they consider that potential risks associated with banks’ exposure to the
so-called “EA5” (Box 7) should be nuanced. The geographical breakdown of exposures
must be taken into account in that regard, as well as the nature of claims and the strength of
French banks’ capital base. French banks are indeed mainly exposed through loans to
corporates rather than securities and government bonds, which suggests that potential losses,
if any, would be gradual and slow. Strong revenue flows (the four biggest French banks
posted a 28 percent increase in net income in the first quarter of 2010) would also help
absorb such losses. Full transparency has been made on French banks’ exposures to
sovereign risk in Europe and it clearly shows that such exposures are manageable and that
even the most adverse simulations would leave the banking system with a strong capital base.
My authorities are also actively engaged in the international financial regulatory
reform. The introduction of a financial levy based on financial institutions’ riskiest assets
and the establishment of a framework for sound compensation practices in the financial
industry demonstrate their commitment to avoiding excessive risk taking and promoting
stability. This commitment also underpins the recent reform of the supervisory architecture,

with the creation of a unique supervisor for banking and insurance and the establishment of a
systemic risk board.
International cooperation
Finally, my authorities remain committed to international cooperation and provide significant
financial support to the IMF to mitigate the impact of the crisis. The French commitment to
the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) for SDR 18.6 billion has been ratified by the
Parliament on June 7, 2010. In addition, France pledged a SDR 1.3 billion loan to the PRGT
which will soon be effective.
