EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: Real GDP growth accelerated to 6 percent in 2005, driven by an improvement
in the contribution of net foreign demand while domestic demand growth maintained
momentum. However, the external current account deficit doubled to about 7¼ percent of
GDP, owing to a deterioration in the terms of trade and higher reinvested earnings on foreign
investment. External competitiveness remains satisfactory. Inflation declined to 3.9 percent
at end-2005, and the fiscal deficit fell to an estimated 3.1 percent of GDP. Slovakia entered
ERM2 on November 28, 2005. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for June 2006.
Outlook: Economic growth supported by strong exports is projected to reach 6¾ percent in
2007. The current account deficit is projected to narrow to about 5 percent of GDP over the
medium-term. Continued positive sentiment of investors toward Slovakia together with
Balassa-Samuelson effects are likely to result in some appreciation of the koruna. The NBS
expects inflation to fall to 2¾ percent at end-2006 and has announced a target of below
2 percent for end-2007, which is ambitious when viewed against the structural influences
stemming from the catching-up process and the upside risks to the inflation outlook. The
2006–08 budget framework envisages the general government deficit declining progressively
to about 1¼ percent of GDP, but the implied fiscal stance is expansionary in 2006 and
broadly neutral in 2007.
Policy Discussions
Euro adoption: Slovakia is well poised to adopt the euro, planned for January 2009, but
challenges lie ahead. Securing a successful experience in the monetary union will require
further efforts to strengthen fiscal policy and enhance structural flexibility. More
immediately, policies need to focus on meeting the Maastricht criteria quickly so as to avoid
a prolonged stay in ERM2. A major challenge will be to bring down inflation in a manner
that does not undermine exchange rate stability and competitiveness.
Monetary and exchange rate policy: NBS officials were less concerned than the staff about
the risks to the disinflation objective and believed that Slovakia still had some cushion on
competitiveness. They were ready to increase interest rates at the first signs of second-round
effects from higher energy prices and of demand and wage pressures, as demonstrated in the
increase in NBS’s key policy interest rate in end-February 2006. Staff were concerned that
the scope for sustained real appreciation was small, and stressed the importance of ensuring
that appreciation under ERM2 was not excessive, as this would bite into competitiveness and
risk producing an overly strong conversion rate.
Fiscal policy: Greater priority needs to be put on tightening fiscal policy to support the
disinflation goal while containing koruna appreciation. Staff recommended that the
authorities avoid a pro-cyclical stimulus in 2006 and aim for a significant withdrawal of
stimulus in 2007. The authorities agreed with staff’s proposal to safeguard the anticipated
revenue over-performance. They also recognized the benefits of more durable expenditure
restraint than included in the budget framework. However, they indicated that additional

-5-

measures would not be forthcoming ahead of the parliamentary elections, but would be given
consideration by the newly elected government during the preparation of the 2007–09
budget.
Wage policy: The authorities are encouraging social partners to adopt forward-looking wage
adjustment to inflation. They agreed that public sector wage restraint can be a useful
signaling mechanism for wage moderation. Staff suggested that a slower pace of minimum
wage increases and greater enterprise-level wage bargaining would also help moderate wage
growth and enhance wage flexibility.
Banking sector and other structural issues. The banking system is healthy, but the
increased exposure of banks to credit risk arising from rapid household credit growth calls
for vigilance. The NBS has initiated steps to strengthen oversight. In January 2006, the NBS
unified supervision of the entire financial sector. The authorities are continuing with efforts
to stimulate job creation and address the high unemployment problem.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The discussions took place against the backdrop of Slovakia’s entry into ERM2
on November 28, 2005. The authorities’ goal is to adopt the euro in January 2009.
2.
Slovakia is well poised to adopt the euro, but challenges lie ahead. Sound
macroeconomic management and a wide range of fundamental structural reforms over the
past few years are supporting nominal convergence with European Union (EU) norms and
enhancing the flexibility of labor and product markets. Slovakia already meets the Maastricht
criteria for long-term interest rates and the public debt ratio. The fiscal deficit and headline
inflation have been on a downward trend and are close to euro zone-compatible levels (text
table). However, a key challenge will be dealing with the likely tensions between the

Economic performance in 2005 continued to be strong (text table). Real GDP
growth accelerated to 6 percent, and the output gap narrowed (Figure 1). Domestic demand

The strength of the economy was visible in labor market conditions. Real wage
growth is estimated to have accelerated to about 6½ percent in 2005, from 2½ percent in
2004, with the pace in tradable and nontradable sectors continuing to be broadly similar. Of

The fiscal outturn in 2005 was better than envisaged in the budget and implied a
substantial withdrawal of stimulus (1 percent of GDP), complementing the authorities’
disinflation efforts. The general government deficit (ESA-95 basis) as a ratio to GDP is
estimated at 3.1 percent in 2005, compared with 3.4 percent envisaged in the budget and an
outturn of 4 percent in 2004.2 Collections in most tax categories surpassed expectations,
owing to stronger-than-expected growth in their underlying bases and allaying earlier staff
fears about the possibility of lagged adverse impact of the introduction of the flat tax regime
in 2004 on revenue performance.3 Non-tax revenue received an unexpected boost from
higher dividend payout by a telecom firm. In addition, interest payments came in lower than
expected and, with receipts from the EU budget amounting to only 60 percent of the
envisaged level, there was some saving on co-financing of EU-funded projects. These gains
were partly offset by forgiveness of foreign debt claims on Afghanistan and Sudan not
envisaged in the budget (Table 4). The withdrawal of fiscal stimulus in 2005 was the net
outcome of two opposing influences: a negative impulse from a reduction in the cyclically
adjusted primary fiscal deficit (reflecting structural improvement in revenue performance)
partly neutralized by the positive impulse from higher net transfers from the EU and
associated expenditures.
7.
In January 2005, the NBS adopted a hybrid monetary framework of “inflation
targeting under ERM2 conditions.”4 It announced explicit end-year inflation targets for
2005–08 and began quarterly publication of medium-term inflation projections. At the same
time, the NBS’s concern with the exchange rate has been evident in its intervention policy.
Facing substantial portfolio inflows and persistent appreciation pressures in the first quarter
of 2005, the NBS intervened in the foreign exchange market and lowered its policy interest
rate in end-February by 100 basis points to 3 percent. Consequently, the koruna retreated
from an all-time high reached in February. Thereafter, when investors’ sentiments toward all
emerging markets became bearish in April and October and the koruna came under
downward pressure, the NBS intervened to support the currency (see text figure on the next
page). Since the interventions were effective in containing depreciating pressures quickly, the
NBS kept its policy rate unchanged. Upon ERM2 entry in late-November, the
2

The deficit for 2004 is different from that shown in the latest Convergence Programme update
(3.2 percent of GDP) as it includes forgiveness of debt claims on the health sector amounting to
0.8 percent of GDP. The deficit in 2005 including payments to the newly-established second
pillar pension funds was 3.8 percent of GDP. Under the SGP, these payments will count toward
the deficit, though they can be partially deducted under certain conditions.

central parity was set at Sk 38.455 per euro, equal to the then-prevailing market rate. The
koruna appreciated in the immediate aftermath and strengthened further in January 2006, in
step with other currencies in the region, to nearly 3 percent above the central parity.
Reflecting these developments, monetary conditions eased slightly in the second half of the
year (Figure 4).

increased slightly to about 21 percent.5 With slow growth in resident deposits on account of
lower interest rates and increased channeling of household saving to mutual funds, banks
funded their lending activities largely through foreign financing from parent banks (see text
table on previous page and Table 5). 6

Competitiveness remains satisfactory. The CPI-based and unit labor cost (ULC)based real effective exchange rates (REER) appreciated further in 2005, but the relative
profitability index remained close to the reference level of 1998 (Figures 7 and 8). A recent
staff study7 suggests that appreciation of the REER was largely a manifestation of
convergence toward the equilibrium level: the koruna was undervalued by about 25 percent
during 1997–2002, but the amount of undervaluation started to decline steadily from 2003
and was expected to disappear in 2005. Slovakia’s market share in the EU-15 countries has
increased rapidly in recent periods and has outpaced that of the neighboring new EU-member
states (Figure 9). The pace of export market penetration is likely to be sustained on account
of the market linkages created by large inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) and the
scheduled commencement of production in many large FDI-supported projects. With the
exchange rate close to its estimated equilibrium and a very strong export performance,
competitiveness has not been a problem. However, it still bears close watching as Slovakia’s
bilateral real exchange rate and relative profitability index vis-à-vis neighboring new EUmember states have deteriorated.
10.
The increased foreign financing of banks boosted the external debt ratio. Total
external debt increased to about 56 percent of GDP at end-2005, from 54 percent of GDP at
end-2004, but the net debt position was only 2 percent of GDP. Foreign debt exposure of the
public and non-bank corporate sectors declined in 2005. About ninety percent of banks’
foreign debt was short-term. Consequently, short-term debt (remaining-maturity basis)
exceeded the level of gross official reserves at end-2005 (Table 6). Slovakia’s reserve
coverage of short-term debt was smaller than that of neighboring new EU-member states and
the gap had widened during the past year (see text table on next page). However, in terms of
reserve coverage of imports, Slovakia stood ahead of the others, with about 5 months
equivalent. Slovakia’s external debt service ratio remained unchanged at 12 percent in 2005.

5

Unlike in some other new EU-member states, foreign currency-denominated loans to
households are negligible in Slovakia. This is explained by the relatively low interest rates on
koruna-denominated loans and aversion of households to foreign exchange risk. There are no
regulatory restrictions on foreign currency-denominated lending to households.

The Slovak banking system is largely under foreign ownership (see Table 8).

II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
11.
The discussions centered on policy priorities for ensuring a smooth transition to
euro adoption and for strong performance in the monetary union. The immediate
challenges are to bring down average inflation to a rate that meets the Maastricht criterion,8
maintain exchange rate stability within ERM2 for at least two years; and reduce the fiscal
deficit (including the adjusted cost of the second pension pillar) to well below the Maastricht
limit of 3 percent of GDP. Thereafter, maintaining growth and ensuring adequate
competitiveness in the monetary union would be continuing challenges. The authorities were
optimistic about achieving all the ERM2 requirements and were less concerned than the staff
about the risks to the disinflation objective. The staff highlighted the risk of an overly strong
conversion rate when the euro is adopted and noted that a tighter fiscal stance than envisaged
in the 2006–08 budget framework was the best way to minimize tensions between the
inflation and exchange rate objectives.

8

The authorities intend to request a convergence report for euro adoption in April 2008. The
assessment period would thus be April 2007–March 2008. The recent World Economic Outlook
projections of the three lowest inflation rates in the EU during 2007–08 suggest a reference rate
of 3 percent. The criterion based on current inflation rates in the EU would be 2.5 percent.

- 12 -

12.
Over a number of years, the authorities have implemented policies generally in
line with the Fund’s advice (Box 1).
Box 1. Policy Recommendations and Implementation
In concluding the last Article IV consultation with Slovakia, Executive Directors focused on policies to address three
main challenges: lowering inflation to eurozone compatible levels, securing further fiscal consolidation, and
addressing the high unemployment problem.
(http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft.scr/2005/cr0571.pdf).
During the past year, the authorities have switched to a monetary framework that places added emphasis on inflation
targets and, in line with the Fund advice, have maintained a flexible approach to exchange rate management.
Fiscal policy in the past few years was tighter than envisaged in the budget. In line with Fund advice, the authorities
saved much of the revenue over-performance arising from stronger-than-expected economic growth. However, in
contrast to staff recommendation, progress in restraining spending on subsidies has not been ambitious, and the
envisaged restraint in the 2006–08 budget framework is back-loaded.
A wide array of labor market reforms were initiated in 2003–04. Since then, the focus has been on increasing the
efficiency of the policy measures.
The authorities have strengthened the financial system and supervisory capacity significantly since the FSAP in

2002.

A. Growth and External Outlook
13.
There was consensus that economic growth would strengthen more than
assumed in the 2006–08 budget framework and the latest Convergence Program
update. Real GDP growth is projected by the staff to increase to about 6¼ percent in 2006
and 6¾ percent in 2007 (about 1 percentage point and ½ percentage point, respectively,
above the budget projections) and to moderate to 5¾ percent in 2008. The impetus is
expected to come from the commencement of production at two new automobile plants in
2006 and 2007 and the associated pick up in exports. Export volume growth is projected to
accelerate to 14 percent in 2006 and 21½ percent in 2007 before easing to about 8¾ percent
in 2008. Domestic demand should remain an important driving force but its contribution may
weaken slightly. The pace of real wage increase was somewhat exceptional in 2005—a result
of backward-looking indexation of nominal wages when average inflation was falling
sharply—and is expected to slow. On this basis, and assuming a stable household saving
propensity, private consumption growth is projected to moderate somewhat. With the
completion of several FDI-financed projects, some easing of investment growth is
anticipated. The authorities agreed with the staff’s projections and the assessment that they
may be subject to upside potential. Specifically, there were risks that household saving
propensity might continue to decline and that real wage increases would be higher than
assumed. Higher oil prices and a deteriorating external environment were the main downside
risks to the projections.
14.
However, there were differences in view regarding the degree of economic slack.
Staff estimates as well as Ministry of Finance estimates (reported in the Convergence
Program update) show the output gap turning positive around 2006–07. However, NBS

- 13 -

estimates show the output gap remaining negative in the next few years, narrowing only in
2008.9
15.
The external outlook appears upbeat and external debt sustainability is not an
imminent concern. On the basis of rising car exports and an unchanged import intensity of
absorption, the external current account deficit is projected to narrow progressively to about
5 percent of GDP in 2008. With stronger economic prospects and the upgrading of its
sovereign debt rating, Slovakia is likely to remain an attractive destination for foreign
investors and record large surpluses in the financial account (Table 7). Thus, even assuming
that foreign financing of banks will continue at a steady pace, the external debt ratio is
projected to decline over the medium-term to below 50 percent of GDP (Appendix III). The
baseline scenario would worsen significantly in the event of a sizeable depreciation of the
currency or a combination of shocks to nominal interest rate, real growth, the terms of trade,

likelihood of a
depreciation scenario would seem small, as the anticipated productivity gains and capital
inflows are likely to result in some nominal and real appreciation of the koruna, with the
potential for overshooting. The authorities acknowledged that uncertainties surrounding the
forthcoming parliamentary elections and developments in other foreign exchange markets in
the region may have a temporary impact on the Slovak koruna, but were hopeful that
Slovakia’s ERM2 entry would decouple the koruna to some extent from regional influences.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
16.
NBS officials agreed that the inflation targets for 2006–08 were ambitious, but
were optimistic about meeting the Maastricht inflation criterion. They explained that
their targets of below 2½ percent for end-2006 and below 2 percent thereafter were
influenced by the uncertainty about the reference rate for the Maastricht inflation criterion.
9

The differences between the estimates are explained by differences in methodology and
measurement of variables. See Box 3 of the Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
(IMF Country Report No. 05/71, March 2005). The high unemployment rate is not a good
indicator of slack in the Slovak economy as much of the unemployment is structural in nature.

- 14 -

Their baseline inflation projection assumed some nominal appreciation of the koruna, a
gradual fall in the contribution of oil prices to inflation, continued influence of retail
competition, the output gap remaining negative, and wage moderation. In addition, the new
monetary framework was expected to anchor inflation expectations. NBS officials considered
higher prices of oil and regulated energy items as the main threats to the achievement of the
inflation targets. In this context, they acknowledged that the end-2006 inflation target would
likely be breached by a narrow margin on account of higher-than-expected increases in
regulated utility prices in January 2006.10 However, they deemed the risk of possible secondround effects to be small, noting that efforts were ongoing to change the basis for wage
bargaining from backward-looking to forward-looking adjustment to inflation, and believed
that the end-2007 target of below 2 percent could be met.
17.
The staff observed that there were uncertainties about lowering inflation further
to the NBS’s end-2007 target. The main impediments were likely to be structural influences
stemming from the catching-up process and the upside risks to the inflation outlook. Rising
ULC in the non-tradable sector was a risk for inflationary pressures. This would be the case
especially if wage growth in tradable and non-tradable sectors stayed the same in the face of
faster productivity growth in the tradable
Unit Labor Costs and Prices in the Nontradable Sector
(percent change, year-on-year)
sector (as shown in the text table for ¶4).11
Indeed, historical data show a strong
correlation between developments in ULC
in the non-tradable sector and prices of
market services (text figure). Declining
economic slack was an additional risk,
although its impact on inflation had been
muted thus far and there were
uncertainties involved in its quantification.
In all, staff projected inflation remaining at
about 2½ percent in 2007—within the
projected reference rate for the Maastricht
criterion—and considered this scenario to
be subject to evenly balanced risks.

NBS officials agreed on the need to remain vigilant about inflationary pressures.
They indicated that they would closely monitor developments in bank credit to the private
sector, inflation excluding fuel and energy, and wages, and would increase interest rates if

necessary.12 The staff noted that should it prove difficult to achieve the NBS’s inflation
target, it would still be important to ensure that inflation did not exceed the structural rate.
19.
NBS officials noted that a major challenge was how to meet the inflation goal
while ensuring a viable exchange rate. There was consensus that the choice of central
parity equal to the market exchange rate just prior to ERM2 entry was appropriate, given the
estimated proximity of the actual real exchange rate to the real equilibrium exchange rate.
Looking ahead, NBS officials thought it likely that the European Commission and European
Central Bank would take real exchange rate appreciation generated by structural factors into
account in the assessment of exchange rate stability. Accordingly, with an eye on the
inflation objective, the NBS has not intervened in the foreign exchange market to counter the
appreciation of the koruna since ERM2 entry. During the mission, the NBS was oriented
toward signaling to the market its support for a stronger koruna through its communications.
However, subsequently on January 31, 2006, the NBS publicly announced that it would no
longer comment on exchange rate developments. The staff emphasized the importance of
ensuring that appreciation under ERM2 was not excessive (measured in relation to the
equilibrium real appreciation), as this would bite into competitiveness and risk producing an
overly strong conversion rate, with potential serious long-term consequences.
20.
The authorities agreed that excessive appreciation should be avoided, but
believed that Slovakia still had some cushion on competitiveness. In particular, they
observed that current profit margins in the automotive and metal processing industries—

With real GDP growth in Q4, 2005 (7.5 percent, year-on-year) and inflation in January 2006
(4.1 percent, year-on-year) turning out to be higher than expected, on February 28 the NBS increased
its key policy interest rate by 50 basis points to 3.5 percent.

C. Fiscal Policy
21.
The staff indicated that the hybrid monetary framework would be compatible
with meeting the multiple targets under ERM2 only if strong support came from fiscal
policy. Accordingly, the staff advocated orienting fiscal policy not only toward meeting the
Maastricht deficit criterion, but also toward supporting the disinflation goal while containing
koruna appreciation.
22.
The authorities noted that fiscal policy was on track to meet the Maastricht
deficit criterion in 2007. The 2006–08 budget framework13 envisaged the headline general
government deficit declining progressively to about 1¼ percent of GDP in 2008. Including
the cost of the second pension pillar, the deficit would rise to 4¼ percent of GDP in 2006 and
decline to 3 percent of GDP in 2007 and 2¾ percent of GDP in 2008. Fiscal consolidation
would rely mainly on expenditure restraint on subsidies and transfers (spread across many
categories) and goods and services.
Fiscal Outlook: Budget Framework and Adjustment Scenario, 2006–08
23.
However, the staff observed that
the implied fiscal stance in the 2006–08
budget framework could complicate the
achievement of the inflation and
exchange rate objectives. The deficits
envisaged in the budget framework implied
an expansionary fiscal stance in 2006, a
broadly neutral stance in 2007, and a
withdrawal of stimulus in 2008 (text table ).
The budget framework understated revenue
prospects because, relative to the budget
assumptions, the actual 2005 revenue base
was higher for structural reasons and
economic growth was anticipated to be
stronger. Another source of positive
impulse in the budget was the large
increases in net transfers from the EU in
2006 and 2007, assuming full execution.
24.
The staff recommended that the
authorities avoid a pro-cyclical stimulus
in 2006 and aim for a significant
withdrawal of stimulus in 2007. This

to the EU budget raise the measured deficit but do not increase domestic demand.

would counter the upside risks to inflation, ease the burden on monetary policy during the
assessment period, and provide a cushion against breaching the SGP limit of 3 percent deficit
in the event of a possible downturn in the future. Accordingly, the staff advocated a twopronged strategy:
•

Safeguarding additional revenues. This would entail adhering to the nominal
expenditure targets specified in the budget framework.

•

Durable expenditure saving. The staff thought that there was scope for restraining
expenditure through cutting waste, continued restructuring of inefficient sectors (such
as the railways), and keeping real growth of subsidy expenditures well below the
growth of real GDP.

25.
The authorities acknowledged that additional fiscal tightening was desirable.
They agreed with the staff’s proposal to safeguard the anticipated revenue over-performance,
at least at the central government level, noting that this had been the practice in the past few
years. It was also their intention to safeguard saving in interest payments that they considered
likely. The authorities recognized the benefits of more durable expenditure restraint than
included in the budget framework and that there was room for it. However, they indicated
that additional expenditure-side measures would not be forthcoming ahead of the elections,
but would be given consideration by the newly-elected government during the preparation of
the 2007–09 budget. Though, they cautioned that the post-election political configuration
may have some bearing on the implementation of additional measures. In this context, the
authorities noted that the execution of EU-funded projects would likely fall short of the
budgeted levels, which would serve to lower the fiscal impulse and reduce the need for
additional expenditure-side measures.14
26.
Saving revenue over-performance would require the participation of all levels of
government. Following the launch of fiscal decentralization in 2005, some 94 percent of
personal income tax collections accrue to local governments. However, fiscal rules
applicable to local governments do not prevent revenue over-performance from funding
additional spending and do not ensure operation of automatic fiscal stabilizers.15 The
authorities planned to take steps aimed at improving fiscal management at the local
government level and ensuring the expenditure control necessary to achieve the fiscal
consolidation objective and to enhance the flexibility of fiscal policy. However, the
authorities noted that, because of the technical complexities and need for legal changes and
political consensus, it would not be feasible to introduce any new measures in 2006. They
added that efforts were continuing to strengthen financial management at the central

14

This assumption is incorporated in the adjustment scenario shown in the text table for ¶23.

15

Fiscal rules applicable to local governments are based on ceilings on their debt stock.

- 18 -

government level. In particular, steps had been initiated to speed up the diffusion of resultsoriented budgeting in all departments.
27.
Public debt sustainability is not a major concern. At end–2005, general
government debt stood at about 37 percent of GDP—well below the Maastricht limit. Over
nine-tenths of the debt is long-term and the repayment profile does not entail significant
bunching. Assuming that fiscal consolidation proceeds as per staff recommendation, the debt
ratio is projected to gradually decline to below 30 percent in 2010 (Appendix III).
Vulnerability of government debt to changes in interest rates and the exchange rate is low.
Currently, about two-thirds of general government debt is at fixed interest rates. Foreign
currency-denominated debt (mainly in euros) stood at about 10 percent of GDP at end–2005
and this ratio is projected to remain steady over the medium-term. In the longer-term, from
2020 onward, the budget will come under pressure because of an ageing population.16 To
address this problem, the authorities intend to implement further pension reform that would
entail an increase in the retirement age to 65 years and a change in the indexation of pensions
to only the inflation rate.
D. Price Policy and Wage Issues
28.
The staff saw a need for improvement in policy communication with regard to
adjustments in regulated prices. Unanticipated increases in regulated prices that lead to
overshooting of the inflation target (see ¶16) could undermine the role of the NBS’s inflation
targets in anchoring inflation expectations. Accordingly, the staff suggested that
consideration be given to preparing plans for adjustments in regulated prices in a multi-year
framework that clearly specified the circumstances under which actual changes could deviate
from the planned changes. The authorities noted that regulated prices were typically set on
the principle of cost recovery, but agreed that it would be useful to undertake a review to
determine the scope for efficiency gains and commensurate cost saving in sectors subject to
regulated pricing. They acknowledged that the impending privatization of the largest
electricity producer and the six largest heating plants should contribute to higher efficiency.
29.
The authorities are seeking to moderate wage increases mainly through their
communications efforts, but there is scope for additional initiatives. In meetings with
representatives of employers and trade unions, NBS officials have been pushing for the
adoption of forward-looking adjustment to inflation in the wage bargaining process. The
authorities agreed that public sector wage restraint can be a useful signaling mechanism for
wage moderation, and indicated that appropriate action would be initiated if the inflation
outlook warranted it and provided the post-election political situation was conducive.
Responding to the staff’s suggestion that a slower pace of minimum wage increases would be
helpful, as this was given attention in the private sector wage bargaining process, the
authorities noted that this should be possible with the introduction of earned income tax

credit for low-income earners, currently under consideration. Also, representatives of
employers believed that, although a large part of wage-setting was decentralized, there was
scope for expanding enterprise-level wage bargaining and ensuring greater productivitybased wage adjustments.
E. Financial Sector Issues
30.
The authorities considered the banking system fundamentally sound. Banks
remained adequately capitalized and profitable. With interest margins shrinking during the
convergence process and in a competitive environment, banks had begun to shift their focus
to retail banking and higher-risk category clients.17 However, the data do not show any
evidence of deteriorating asset quality—the share of non-performing loans in total loans
declined further in 2005 (Table 8). NBS officials were not concerned about a sizeable
negative net open foreign exchange position of banks, and noted that much of it represented
contingent liabilities. Banks emphasized that foreign currency-denominated loans and
guarantees were mainly provided to exporters or firms that had access to reliable stream of
foreign currency revenue. Stress testing by the NBS indicated that the banking system was
resilient to increases in non-performing loans, to changes in the exchange rate, and to other
macroeconomic shocks.18
31.
NBS officials were concerned about the increased exposure of banks to credit
risk and had initiated steps to strengthen oversight. They deemed risk management
practices of banks to be generally adequate and did not consider increased foreign financing
from parent banks as a vulnerability. In addition, NBS officials saw rapid growth of bank
credit as an inevitable process of intermediation moving from a very low base to equilibrium
levels. Still, to guard against risk of stresses on the banking sector, the NBS had introduced
new reporting forms and six-monthly bank lending surveys to improve data collection, and
was meeting more frequently with banks. The NBS also was assessing risk management
according to loan categories, instead of on the aggregate, during on-site inspections of banks.
NBS officials were satisfied with the state of cross-border supervision, and indicated that
they regularly interacted with home country supervisors at different levels. In this context,
they noted that preparations for the introduction of Basel II standards, planned for January
2007, were on track. In parallel with these initiatives, the NBS also was publicizing the risks
to which the household sector was exposed.
32.
In January 2006, the NBS unified supervision of the entire financial sector. NBS
officials planned to extend the risk-based forward-looking supervision approach to non-bank
financial institutions, and noted that the task would be complicated because of the
fragmented nature of this sector. They saw a particular need to strengthen supervisory

oversight of pension funds, which were growing rapidly. The staff noted that ongoing steps
were needed to support financial integrity in Slovakia, and encouraged the authorities to
develop a more unified and consistent approach to issues related to anti-money laundering
and combating financial terrorism, as recommended by MONEYVAL examiners. The
authorities agreed with the staff’s recommendation to undertake a FSAP update in 2006 prior
to the next Article IV consultation discussions.

The authorities acknowledged that employment creation and addressing the
high unemployment problem would be a continuing challenge. They had introduced a
wide array of reforms in the past few years to improve labor market flexibility, increase

In November 2005, the
authorities adopted new
criteria for providing
investment incentives with the
aim of promoting greater
investment in highunemployment regions and in
the high-tech and R&D areas

1/ The limits apply to the sum of incentives under programs of tax relief, real estate
provision, and grants (lump-sum and in proportion to new employees and training costs).
2/ For each type of investment, eligibility also requires a certain minimum education
level for the workforce.

Countries of the European Union: A Regional Review,” www.imf.org

•

A scheme is being developed to improve access to capital for start-up small and
medium-sized enterprises. It would be partially funded from the structural funds from
the EU.

•

The authorities are considering the introduction of earned income tax credit for lowincome workers from 2007, which should further increase the incentive to seek work
as well as slow down the growth in minimum wages. They do not favor reducing
labor costs through targeted cuts in social security contributions because contributions
are linked to benefits and the measure lacks political support.

•

Active labor market policy will focus on better targeting of job-training and on
increasing financial and logistical support for fostering labor mobility.

The authorities agreed that more
attention needs to be given to
reducing bureaucracy in the
issuance of licenses and permits
and to further speeding up
enforcement of contracts at
courts. With regard to the latter,
according to a recent World Bank
study, Slovakia lags behind other
EU countries (text table).

III. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
With ERM2 entry accomplished, the authorities now have to focus on
implementing policies that ensure a smooth transition to euro adoption and strong
performance in the monetary union. Sound macroeconomic management and fundamental
structural reforms over the past few years have positioned Slovakia well for euro adoption,
but challenges lie ahead. A major challenge will be to bring down inflation in a manner that
does not undermine exchange rate stability and competitiveness. Progress toward disinflation
could be thwarted by potential upside risks—arising from higher energy prices, strong
economic growth, and rising unit labor costs in the non-tradable sector. Fiscal policy will,
therefore, need to be oriented toward supporting disinflation and minimizing the inherent
tensions between the inflation and exchange rate objectives. The authorities also face the task
of ensuring a sufficient buffer in the fiscal position to allow automatic fiscal stabilizers to
operate without breaching the SGP deficit limit.
35.
Thus, a tighter fiscal stance than envisaged in the 2006–08 budget framework is
necessary. The authorities should avoid a pro-cyclical stimulus in 2006 and aim for a
significant withdrawal of stimulus in 2007. It will be important to ensure additional fiscal

- 22 -

tightening by saving the anticipated revenue over-performance—arising from a higher baseperiod outturn and a stronger economic growth outlook—as well as undertaking durable
expenditure restraint beyond that included in the budget framework. The efforts on both
fronts will require participation of all levels of government. Fiscal management at local
government levels will have to be consistent with the national fiscal consolidation strategy.
Continued resolute political commitment to further fiscal consolidation will remain essential.
36.
The NBS also should guard against upside risks to inflation as well as ensure
exchange rate viability. NBS’s readiness to increase interest rates at the first signs of
second-round effects from higher energy prices and of demand and wage pressures is
welcome. Better policy communication on adjustments of regulated prices would help to
safeguard the role of NBS’s inflation targets in anchoring expectations. While the economic
outlook and the likely continued positive sentiment of rating agencies and foreign investors
toward Slovakia make room for some nominal and real appreciation of the koruna, these
factors also create the potential for overshooting. Excessive appreciation under ERM2 would
bite into competitiveness and risk producing an overly strong conversion rate. Slovakia’s
prevailing level of competitiveness is adequate, but its initial cushion of lower unit labor
costs vis-à-vis competitors has faded. It will therefore be important to ensure that real
exchange rate developments remain in line with the economic fundamentals.
37.
Wage moderation would contribute importantly to disinflation and safeguarding
competitiveness. The authorities are encouraging social partners to adopt forward-looking
adjustment of wages to inflation. They also should aim to influence wage drift by restraining
wage increases in the public sector and negotiating a slower pace of minimum wage increase.
Social partners are encouraged to expand the scope of enterprise-level wage bargaining so as
to ensure greater productivity-based wage adjustments and enhance wage flexibility.
38.
While Slovakia’s banking system is generally sound, new challenges call for
vigilance. Banks are extending credit to households at a rapid pace in a competitive
environment and assuming higher credit risk. The NBS’s initiatives to improve data
collection, monitor risk management practices of banks more closely, and regularly interact
with home supervisors of foreign-owned banks are appropriate. The inherent risks in
increased foreign financing by banks are mitigated as these represent transactions with parent
banks. However, the NBS should ensure that these borrowings are based on proper risk
analysis by the parent bank and domestic subsidiary, to minimize any vulnerabilities to the
banking system. Unified supervision of the financial sector will be demanding, given the
fragmented nature of the non-bank financial sector. NBS’s intention to extend the risk-based
supervision approach to non-bank financial institutions is welcome. The NBS is encouraged
to speedily enhance the supervision of pension funds, which are growing rapidly, and to
continue addressing the money laundering risk in all areas of the financial sector.
39.
The momentum behind structural reforms in other areas should be maintained.
Labor market reforms have contributed to a pick up in the employment rate. Nevertheless,
the unemployment rate remains very high among the low-skilled and in the less advanced
regions. The adoption of new rules on investment incentives according to regional criteria

- 23 -

and project profile should help attract greater investment in high-unemployment regions and
in high value-added projects. Considerations being given to improving access to capital for
start-up companies and to introducing earned income tax credit for low-income workers, with
a view to stimulating job creation and further increasing incentive to work, are welcome.
40.
It is recommended that the Article IV consultation with Slovakia remain on the
standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX II

SLOVAK REPUBLIC: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of data provided to the Fund are adequate
for surveillance purposes. From the point of view of macroeconomic analysis and policy
making, significant data improvements have been made in recent years, particularly in
the national accounts. A data ROSC mission to Bratislava during February–March 2004
found that the integrity, methodological soundness, and reliability of the data were
satisfactory, despite some shortcomings in the data revision policy. The main issues
remaining are: (i) weaknesses in the data on prices and volumes of imports and exports;
(ii) a lack of timely data on the general government operations; and (iii) slow compilation
cycle of the annual national accounts and lack of proper benchmarking of quarterly data.
The Slovak Republic subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)
since 1996 and observes or exceeds all related standards.
2.
With regard to timeliness and public access, the authorities in general follow a
free and open data publication policy. Data are promptly released to news services, and
are also published regularly in various monthly and quarterly statistical publications, and
on the Internet21 according to a pre-announced schedule. Data on core surveillance
variables are provided regularly to the Fund, and with minimal lags: a week or less for
foreign exchange reserves; a day for monthly state budget implementation data; 10 days
to a month for consumer prices, reserve money, broad money, and interest rates; two
months for foreign trade data; and about three months for other fiscal, balance of
payments, and national accounts data. However, the 2004 Data ROSC mission reported
some difficulties in fully reconciling the balance of payments with the national accounts,
monetary, and government finance statistics.
Real Sector and Prices
3.
Significant progress has been made in the elaboration of the national accounts
statistics. However, output estimates for the last few years may yet have to be revised in
the future. The quarterly national accounts data on expenditures exhibit weaknesses and
there is a significant statistical discrepancy between the supply side and the demand side.
An important outstanding issue is the compilation of reliable price deflators for imports
and exports that would enable better decomposition into volume and price changes. The
unit value trade price indices—on which the national accounts trade price deflators are
based—are published with long delays and are not appropriately adjusted for quality
changes; the statistical authorities are aware of these issues and improvements are
pending.

21

Data are available on the website of the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic
(www.statistics.sk), the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) (www.nbs.sk), and the Ministry of
Finance (MoF) (www.finance.gov.sk).

APPENDIX II

4.
Following the fast development of chain stores, which are not fully captured in
surveys, the authorities consider that retail sales and the level of consumption might be
underestimated (especially if compared to VAT receipts), and wage statistics might be
biased.
5.
In the enterprise sector, it would be very useful if the line ministries produced
systematic accounts of the financial positions of the public enterprises under their
purview.
Fiscal Sector
6.
General government statistics are compiled annually in accordance with the
methodology of the ESA95, and disseminated on the Ministry of Finance (MOF) website.
In accordance with the EU acquis communautaire, the authorities report semi-annually
on general government net lending/borrowing on ESA95 basis. Monthly reconciliation of
government operations above and below-the-line is restricted to state budget transactions
on a cash basis. A modern treasury system has been operating since January 2004. The
new system has improved fiscal control and public debt management by allowing the
recording of expenditures at the planning and commitment stages.
7.
The MOF has converted its fiscal accounts to ESA95 standards. The MOF
compiles Government Finance Statistics according to the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) analytical framework; data are available and disseminated on
a cash basis for 2000–02, and on an accrual basis for 2003.
External Sector
8.
The Slovak Republic provides monthly balance of payments in a timely manner.
The balance of payment statements are presented in two formats, an analytical
presentation and the standard presentation. Banks are now reporting their arbitrage
transactions accurately. Improvements have also been made in reporting nonresidents’
claims and liabilities in domestic currency. The balance of payments is compiled and
disseminated quarterly on a cumulative basis during the year; however, dissemination on
a cumulative basis does not follow best practice. Weekly reports of information on gross
international reserves are timely. Moreover, the NBS revised in 2002 its methodology for
reporting foreign exchange reserves in line with IMF guidelines and STA technical
recommendations to include the valuation of gold at market prices and to change the
reporting of repo operations and gold swaps. Also, the reporting of foreign exchange
reserves by commercial banks has been revised to include selected long-term assets in the
item “foreign exchange reserves.” Remaining problem areas include: (i) the measurement
of inward portfolio investment; (ii) the need for more detailed and timely information on
publicly guaranteed external debt; (iii) more timely reporting of information on external
debt, including short-term debt; (iv) the recording of most interest payments on a cash
basis; and (v) the need to improve data compilation on the composition of exports.

- 48 -

APPENDIX II

Monetary Sector
9.
Monetary statistics are of good quality, and are reported on a timely basis to the
Fund. The 2004 data ROSC mission found that the two sets of monetary data compiled
by the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS)—the national monetary statistics (NMS), for
internal use, and the harmonized monetary statistics (HMS), submitted to international
organizations—are broadly in line with the IMF Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. One exception was the treatment, in the NMS, of government’s foreign
liabilities as part of the NBS foreign liabilities, with a counterpart adjustment in NBS
claims on the government. In response to the mission’s comments, the authorities
changed this treatment to exclude government foreign liabilities from NBS foreign
liabilities. Another exception was the exclusion of money market funds from the NMS,
but the authorities recently started including these funds as a memorandum item in the
NMS. A third exception is that market valuation is not applied to certain financial
instruments under both the NMS and HMS.

APPENDIX III

SLOVAK REPUBLIC: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

41.
External and fiscal debt sustainability assessments were conducted applying
standardized sensitivity tests to the staff’s baseline scenario.
A. External Sustainability
42.
Stress testing of external debt dynamics suggests that external debt sustainability is
not seriously at risk, although the external debt ratio surges temporarily under a sizable
depreciation of the currency or a significant current account balance deterioration. Staff’s
baseline scenario assumes rising exports, driven by automobile production, and strong FDI
inflows throughout the period. Under this scenario, the external debt stock falls to 48 percent
of GDP due to a gradual improvement in current account balance (Table 1. A-3 and
Figure 1. A-3). Dynamics of external debt ratio are resilient to shocks to nominal interest
rate, real GDP growth, and terms-of-trade as the debt ratio falls to the range of 50-55 percent
by 2010. A combination of these shocks together with worsening of the overall external
environment and one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation in 2006 raise the external debt
ratio temporarily to the range of 70-79 percent in 2006-07. However, even under these
adverse conditions, the debt ratio starts declining in 2007-08 and falls to the range of
60-63 percent by 2010.
B. Fiscal Sustainability
43.
Stress testing of public debt dynamics suggests that fiscal sustainability is not at risk
over the medium-term. Staff’s baseline scenario assumes forceful fiscal consolidation efforts
throughout the period and completion of privatization by 2007. Under this scenario, the
public debt ratio steadily falls to about 29 percent by 2010 (Table 2. A-3). Dynamics of
public debt ratio are resilient to shocks to nominal interest rate, economic growth, and
primary balance as the debt ratio remains below 40 percent throughout the period
(Figure 2. A-3). Under a no policy change scenario, the debt ratio starts increasing
marginally after the completion of privatization in 2007, but it remains below 40 percent
throughout the period. One-time 30 percent real depreciation and 10 percent of GDP shock to
contingent liabilities in 2006 raise the debt ratio temporarily to the range of 42-47 percent in
2006. However, even under these adverse conditions, the debt ratio starts declining in 2007
and falls to below 40 percent by 2009, well below the Maastricht public debt ratio ceiling of
60 percent.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ Real GDP growth drops to 4 percent throughout 2006-10.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and both non-interest current account and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the
Slovak Republic
On March 20, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Slovak Republic.1
Background
Economic performance in 2005 continued to be strong. Real GDP growth accelerated to
6 percent, as domestic demand growth maintained momentum and the contribution of net
foreign demand improved. Private consumption strengthened appreciably, fueled by large
increases in real wages and employment, and rapid credit growth. Fixed investment also
picked up markedly though inventory accumulation was smaller. Exports continued to grow in
the double-digits. However, because of a deterioration of the terms-of-trade due to rising oil
prices and higher reinvested earnings on foreign investment, the external current account
deficit doubled to 7¼ percent. Competitiveness remained adequate. Much of the external
deficit was covered by inflows of foreign direct investment. However, external liabilities
increased, as banks resorted to external finance to fund their lending.
The strength of the economy was visible in labor market conditions. Real wage growth is
estimated to have accelerated to about 6½ percent in 2005, from 2½ percent in 2004 and large
increases were recorded in both self-employment and wage-employment. Thus, the
economy-wide unemployment rate declined by 2 percentage points to about 15½ percent in
September 2005, with considerable regional variation in the level and trend.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2Inflation declined further in 2005. Headline consumer price inflation (HICP basis) fell by
1.9 percentage points to 3.9 percent at end-December—at the upper end of the NBS’s target
range of 3–4 percent. Koruna appreciation, increased competition at the retail level
subsequent to EU membership, and lower increases in regulated utility prices moderated
inflationary pressures. Higher gasoline prices (which are not regulated) restrained the progress
with disinflation.
The general government deficit in 2005, estimated at 3.1 percent of GDP, was better than
envisaged in the budget and implied a substantial withdrawal of stimulus. Collections in most
tax categories and non-tax revenues surpassed expectations. In addition, interest payments
came in lower than expected, and, with receipts from the EU budget at 60 percent of the
envisaged level, co-financing of projects was below budgeted amounts. These gains were
partly offset by forgiveness of certain foreign debt claims not envisaged in the budget.
In January 2005, the NBS adopted a hybrid monetary framework of “inflation targeting under
ERM2 conditions.” It announced explicit end-year inflation targets for 2005–08. At the same
time, it intervened in the foreign exchange market in both directions on several occasions to
influence the exchange rate. Slovakia entered ERM2 on November 28, 2005. The central
parity was set at Sk 38.455 per euro, equal to the then-prevailing market rate. The koruna
appreciated in the immediate aftermath and strengthened further in January 2006, in step with
other currencies in the region, to nearly 3 percent above the central parity. Following a cut in
February 2005, NBS kept its policy interest rate unchanged at 3 percent until February 2006,
when the rate was increased by 50 basis points to 3½ percent.
Economic growth is projected by the staff to strengthen further and reach 6¾ percent in 2007,
with the commencement of production at two new automobile plants in 2006–07 and the
associated pick up in exports. The current account deficit is projected to narrow progressively
to about 5 percent of GDP over the medium-term. Fundamental improvements in the economy
and continued positive sentiment of investors toward Slovakia are likely to result in some
appreciation of the koruna. The NBS expects inflation to fall to 2¾ at end-2006, and has
announced a target of below 2 percent for end-2007. The 2006-08 budget framework
envisages the general government deficit declining progressively to about 1¼ percent of GDP.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors congratulated the authorities for Slovakia’s recent early entry into ERM2.
Sound macroeconomic management and a wide range of important structural reforms over the
past few years have positioned Slovakia well for euro adoption, but challenges lie ahead, in
particular, to reduce the still-high rate of, and wide regional disparities in, unemployment, and
to bring down inflation in a manner that does not undermine exchange rate stability and
competitiveness. Directors considered that, while agreeing on the benefits of meeting early the
Maastricht criteria and adopting the euro, it is equally important to secure continued strong
economic performance in the monetary union through a strengthening of fiscal policy and
enhanced structural flexibility.
Directors observed that the authorities’ inflation targets for 2006–08 are ambitious, especially
viewed against the structural influences stemming from the process of catching up
economically with other Euro area states. Some Directors expressed concern that the tight
fiscal policy that might be needed to defend the inflation target would have negative effects on

-3the real sector, and saw no obvious gain in targeting an inflation rate lower than that needed
for euro adoption. Directors cautioned that higher energy prices, strong economic growth, and
rising unit labor costs in the nontradable sector are risks for inflationary pressures.
They welcomed the National Bank of Slovakia’s (NBS) readiness to increase its key policy
interest rate to counter second-round effects from these factors, as demonstrated by their
recent step in this direction. Directors urged the authorities to improve policy communication
on adjustments of regulated prices to reinforce the role of the NBS’s inflation targets in
anchoring inflation expectations.
Directors noted that, consistent with the favorable growth and external outlook and continued
inflows of foreign direct investment, some exchange rate appreciation could occur in the period
ahead, and that this would help with disinflation. However, they stressed the importance of
safeguarding competitiveness, noting that while Slovakia’s prevailing level of competitiveness
is adequate, its initial cushion has diminished. Directors cautioned that significant appreciation
under ERM2 would erode competitiveness and risk producing an excessively strong
conversion rate, with potentially serious long-term consequences. They observed that Slovakia
needs to be sufficiently competitive within the monetary union to facilitate a significant
reduction in unemployment over time.
Directors recommended orienting fiscal policy not only toward meeting the Maastricht deficit
criterion, but also toward supporting the inflation goal while containing koruna appreciation.
Most Directors encouraged the authorities to attain a tighter fiscal stance than envisaged in
the 2006–08 budget framework. This could be achieved by saving any revenues collected
above the targeted amount, as appears likely, and by durably restraining expenditure beyond
that anticipated in the budget framework. At the same time, some Directors cautioned against
seeking budgetary savings by not implementing EU-funded public investment projects, as
these are designed to produce long-term gains through increased convergence with the Euro
area. Directors observed that maintaining a tight fiscal stance will require continued steadfast
political commitment to further fiscal consolidation and the support of all levels of government.
With regard to the latter, more binding expenditure ceilings and a stronger fiscal framework for
local governments, consistent with the national fiscal consolidation strategy, would be
advisable.
Directors highlighted that wage moderation would be important to bring inflation down and
maintain competitiveness. They welcomed the authorities’ efforts to encourage the social
partners to adopt forward-looking adjustment of wages to inflation. They encouraged the
authorities to signal the need for wage moderation by restraining wage increases in the public
sector. A slower pace of minimum wage increases and greater enterprise-level wage
bargaining will also help moderate overall wage growth and enhance wage flexibility.
Directors noted that Slovakia’s banking system is generally sound, but that rapid household
credit growth calls for vigilance. Directors commended the NBS’s initiatives to improve data
collection, monitor risk management practices of banks more closely, and regularly interact
with home supervisors of foreign-owned banks. They welcomed the NBS’s intention to extend
the risk-based supervision approach to non-bank financial institutions. They encouraged the
authorities to enhance the supervision of rapidly growing pension funds and to continue
tackling the money laundering risk in all areas of the financial sector. They supported the
authorities’ request for an Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update.

-4Directors observed that structural reform efforts, as well as buoyant economic growth, have
resulted in a strong pick-up in employment, but the unemployment rate remains high.
The recently adopted rules on investment incentives according to regional criteria and project
profile should help reduce unemployment in less economically advanced regions. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ consideration of measures to improve access to capital for start-up
companies and to introduce an earned income tax credit for low-income workers, with a view
to enhancing employment growth and further increasing incentives to work.
