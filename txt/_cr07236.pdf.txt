REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Thomas Krueger and Anthony Boote
June 6, 2007
• Discussions for the 2007 Article IV consultation were held in Antananarivo during March 8–21,
2007 and in Washington during April 11–14, 2007. The mission consisted of Messrs. Ames (head),
Ellyne, Josz (all AFR) and Hallaert (PDR). It was assisted by Mr. van den Boogaerde, the Fund’s
Resident Representative, and overlapped with a Financial Sector Strategy Assessment follow up
mission headed by Mr. van der Vossen (MCM). The mission met with the Prime Minister, the
Minister of Finance and Budget, the Governor of the Central Bank, and other senior government
officials, as well as representatives from the parliament, private sector, non-government
organizations, press, and donor community.
• During the 2005 Article IV which was completed on June 1, 2005, Executive Directors commended
the authorities’ ownership of economic policies and track record. They stressed the importance of
containing inflation and improving revenue performance.
• Directors on July 21, 2006, approved the authorities’ request for a three-year arrangement under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) equivalent to 45 percent of quota and the
activation of the Trade Integration Mechanism. The program focuses on raising tax revenues,
improving public expenditure management, and lowering inflation to single digits. The first review
was completed on December 20, 2006.
• Madagascar has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF’s Articles
of Agreement and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions (see Informational Annex). The Malagasy
exchange rate regime is classified as a managed float with no predetermined path.
• Madagascar’s outstanding use of Fund resources through March 2007 amounted to SDR 27.1
million (22.1 percent of quota). It reached the completion point under the Enhanced Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in October 2004 and received debt relief from the IMF
under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in January 2006.
• Relations with the Fund, relations with the World Bank Group, and statistical issues are presented
in an informational annex to this report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
♦ Madagascar suffered for decades from macroeconomic instability and slow economic
growth. Although inflation has been reduced, poverty remains high and growth
inadequate to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
♦ The new poverty reduction strategy entitled the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP) presents
a vision for addressing the key structural and other problems that have hindered
economic development. Key to the realization of the MAP’s objectives will be
advancements in domestic revenue mobilization and scaling up of donor assistance.
♦ Against this background, the Article IV consultation discussions centered on four main
themes: (i) managing the changing medium-term outlook; (ii) preserving macroeconomic
stability; (iii) improving public sector efficiency and transparency; and (iv) fostering
private sector growth.
♦ The authorities intend to base their policies on the more conservative baseline scenario
underpinning their PRGF-supported program until higher levels of external financing
materialize. This scenario takes into account projected foreign direct investment (FDI)
inflows arising from large projects in the mining sector. The domestic spending
component of this FDI is placing appreciation pressures on the exchange rate and poses
significant challenges for competitiveness and macroeconomic management.
♦ In order to maintain macroeconomic stability, the authorities need to continue to pursue a
monetary policy that is consistent with their foreign reserves and single-digit inflation
targets, and a prudent fiscal policy that minimizes recourse to domestic financing. The
authorities’ exchange rate policy of managed float with no predetermined path remains
appropriate.
♦ Strengthening public financial management and transparency will require steadfast
implementation of tax policy and administration reforms, improvements in budget
execution and control, adherence to the principles of the Extractive Industry
Transparency Initiative (EITI), a financially sound central bank, and enhancement of data
collection and management.
♦ Improving infrastructure (including electricity) will be key to fostering private sector
development. Financial intermediation also needs to be broadened and deepened, and
access to credit expanded. Continued liberalization on a most favored nation (MFN) basis
along with regional integration should also boost growth and exports.
♦ The authorities have requested a delay in Executive Board consideration of the second
review under the PRGF arrangement in order to allow the independent anti-corruption
office to complete its audit of deviations from customs clearance and valuation
procedures.

I. BACKGROUND AND KEY CHALLENGES
1.
Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It ranks
146 out of 177 on the U.N. Human Development index and has performed poorly relative to
other SSA countries on most macroeconomic indicators (Figure 2). Poverty remains high and
progress toward achieving the MDGs has been uneven (Figures 1 and Table 10).

2.
The mission took place following the re-election of President Ravalomanana, the
appointment of a new government, and the launch of the MAP.1 The President retained
key Ministers from the previous government, including the Minister of Finance and Budget.
The MAP provides the authorities’ overall strategic framework for accelerating growth and
reducing poverty in line with the MDGs and is complemented by more specific sector
strategies and actions plans.2
3.
Madagascar is prone to exogenous shocks which disrupt economic activity.
Volatility in key commodity prices (notably for oil and vanilla) (Figure 2.1), the termination
of the textile quota in early 2005, and the expected termination of the third party provision
under the U.S. Africa Growth and Opportunity Act have created uncertainty regarding trade
flows. The country is also vulnerable to weather-related shocks, such as the severe tropical
storms and flooding that hit Madagascar in late December 2006 and in early 2007 and the
drought that affected the southern part of the country.

5.
Domestic revenue mobilization is amongst the lowest in SSA and is insufficient
to finance critical development expenditure in support of the MDGs. Madagascar has
one of the lowest tax revenue-to-GDP ratios in Africa (Figure 2.4); the tax system has been
fraught with exonerations, exemptions, and special regimes, and the tax and customs
administrations are plagued with severe institutional capacity constraints. This not only
impedes the government’s ability to finance its own development agenda, but also
discourages foreign assistance flows as donors expect recipient countries to improve
domestic revenue mobilization.
6.
Other capacity constraints impede implementation of macroeconomic policy.
Weaknesses in public financial management (PFM) hinder the government’s ability to design
and execute the budget and manage its cash flow. Implementation of monetary and exchange
policy is hampered by the central bank’s weak financial position and limited monetary policy

10
instruments. Constraints in data collection and management affect the quality of the data on
which macroeconomic policy is based.
7.
The financial system is shallow, and has not been effective at promoting broadbased growth. Monetization of the Malagasy economy is low, credit to the private sector is
limited, and the economy remains largely cash-oriented (Figure 2.5)—all of which constrain
private sector-driven growth.

Large increases in FDI in the mining sector may signal an important shift in the
structure of the economy. Construction by foreign investors of a US$650 million
(12 percent of GDP) ilmenite mine began in mid-2006. Construction of another foreignowned US$2.5 billion (45 percent of GDP) nickel and cobalt mine and processing facility
commenced in 2007 and will be completed over the next three years. Production and export
of these commodities should begin in 2009/10. These projects contain a large share of local
expenditure (about 20 percent), which is placing upward pressure on the exchange rate.
Other large mining and petroleum projects are at various stages of discussion and could
accentuate this pressure and pose further challenges to macroeconomic management.
9.
Implementation of past Fund policy advice has been mixed. The authorities have
made good progress in managing liquidity and reducing inflation. They have started
ambitious reforms to improve PFM, but ad hoc tax exemptions until mid-2006 and
weaknesses in tax and customs administration have continued to dampen revenue
performance. The country’s statistical capacity remains weak. And limited progress has been
made in improving the reliability of power supply, which is a major impediment to private
sector development according to most business climate surveys.

11

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
10.
In 2006, economic growth
increased while inflation continued
to decline. Growth picked up in 2006,
largely because of the startup of
construction of a large mining project,
sizeable investments in public
infrastructure, and strong performance
in telecommunication, transportation,
and financial services (Table 2).
Meanwhile, primary sector growth
declined owing to a normal rice
harvest after the previous year’s
bumper crop. Inflation continued on its
downward path in 2006 aided by tight
monetary policy, low rice prices, a
decline in world oil prices during the
second half of the year, and the recent
appreciation of the nominal exchange
rate. Agriculture growth (particularly
rice and vanilla) in 2007 has been
negatively affected by the recent
floods, and inflation rose in the early
months of the year owing to an
increase in rice prices.

reduction strategy. The authorities
phased out their capital goods import tax exoneration scheme in September 2005 and
increased excise taxes on petroleum products. Despite these measures, tax revenues as a
share of GDP remained lower than in 2004. The domestic financing target was missed in
2006 due to higher than programmed obligatory spending, principally the result of underbudgeting of civil service pensions, VAT reimbursements, and correspondingly higher

In 2006, the overall balance of payment deficit shifted to a surplus owing to large
foreign direct investment inflows, strong export performance, and a reduction in debt
service (Table 5). The large jump in FDI inflows was due to the large ilimite mining project
and an increase in reinvested profits of foreign commercial banks. With the exception of
vanilla and textiles, exports were strong owing to a pick up in international prices, as were
non-factor services, particularly tourism and business services (owing to the increase in FDI).
Debt service declined by 45 percent due to the implementation of the MDRI. The improved

The demand for real money
balances increased during 2006 and
was accommodated through higher
NFA accumulation (Table 6). The
increase in money demand arose
principally from the domestic spending
requirements related to rising FDI. The
Central Bank of Madagascar (BCM)
accommodated the higher money
demand by purchasing foreign exchange
in the interbank foreign exchange
market (MID). To meet its December
2006 NFA and NDA targets, the BCM
mopped up MGA 50 billion (about
5 percent of reserve money). During the
first quarter of 2007, reserve money
grew at an annual rate of 21 percent as
the central bank purchased foreign
exchange, but without mopping up the
liquidity injected.

Banking sector soundness
improved. In 2006, nonperforming
loans declined as a share of total loans, capital adequacy increased, and foreign exchange
exposure declined (Table 9). A license was issued to a new commercial bank which should
increase competition in the banking sector. At end-October 2006, the IMF’s MCM estimated
that the central bank had a negative net worth of about 5 percent of its balance sheet
(0.6 percent of GDP) according to international financial reporting standards. The central
bank was recapitalized in May 2007 (¶31).

15.
Performance under the PRGF arrangement has been mixed (Tables 11–13). All
program conditionality was observed with the exception of one quantitative performance
criterion (PC) at end-December 2006 and two structural PCs. The quantitative PC on
domestic financing of the budget was missed owing to the spending overruns previously

mentioned (¶11). The authorities have subsequently revised their 2007 budget to fully
account for all obligatory spending and will continue to strengthen their control over
spending commitments within their PFM action plan. It appears that the continuous structural
PC on no departures from the established procedures for valuation and clearance of goods at
customs has not been respected, and the authorities have requested the independent anticorruption office to conduct an audit on compliance with the customs procedures. In turn,
they have requested that Executive Board consideration of the second review under the
PRGF arrangement be postponed until after the audit has been completed, which is currently
expected to be in September.
III. POLICY ISSUES
16.
The Article IV consultation discussions centered on four main themes: (i) managing
the changing medium-term outlook; (ii) preserving macroeconomic stability; (iii) improving
PFM and transparency; and (iv) fostering private sector development.
A. Managing the Changing Medium-Term Outlook

appreciation of the exchange rate. The
current account deficit will rise to about 20 percent of GDP and will be mostly financed by
the FDI inflows, thereby allowing the overall balance of payments to remain in surplus
(Table 8). Gross official reserves are expected to increase to the equivalent of 3.9 months of
imports (excluding mining-related imports) by 2010. Thereafter, the trade balance should
shift to a large surplus as mining exports commence. The current account, however, will
remain in deficit because of large dividend payments to the mining projects’ equity holders.
The authorities and staff have revised upward the economic growth projections to 8 percent
on average over 2007–11 (more than twice the average over the past decade), while inflation
is expected to continue on its downward path to 5 percent as envisaged.

18.
The increase in private sector FDI poses important challenges to
competitiveness. The mission discussed the potential danger of “Dutch disease” arising from
the large external inflows and the impact that an appreciation of the real exchange rate could
have on the competitiveness of traditional exports. The authorities acknowledged that such a
risk exists, but were confident that competitiveness could be maintained through the

15
productivity-enhancing public investments (i.e., education, health, and infrastructure) and
structural reforms (i.e., rehabilitation of the public utility company, streamlining of business
regulations, etc.) that were underway. They reiterated that the government’s strategy is to
encourage FDI and believed that on balance the economy would benefit from these inflows.
19.
Despite these challenges, the authorities saw no need to change the current
exchange rate regime (managed float with no predetermined path). The authorities
expected both the pace and degree of appreciation experienced since the middle of 2006 to
subside as the demand for imports picked up in the aftermath of the presidential, legislative,
and municipal elections. They believed that the economy was undergoing a permanent
structural change, that the exchange rate should be allowed to move to its new equilibrium,
and that intervention should be limited to achieving the foreign reserve target and smoothing
day-to-day volatility. To help reduce pressure on the exchange rate, the authorities have
recently implemented measures to liberalize foreign exchange controls such as lengthening
the time period allowed to repatriate export proceeds and increasing the ceiling on the open
foreign exchange position of commercial banks.

16
The authorities agreed on the need to closely monitor real exchange rate and export
developments, and on the merits of foreign exchange interventions if signs of overshooting
emerged.
21.
The staff also noted the substantial scope for improving the efficiency of the
foreign exchange market in line with MCM recommendations. The staff urged caution,
however, regarding liberalizing capital account transactions, as such liberalization needed to
be carefully sequenced with efforts to strengthen the framework for banking supervision and
prudential regulations. Staff also reminded the authorities of the need not to compromise
prudential regulations in this process.
22.
While the authorities agreed that running a fiscal surplus could help reduce
appreciation pressure on the exchange rate, they did not believe that this was feasible
from a political economy point of view given the need to increase poverty-reducing
spending. They believed that the fiscal program, which allows only very limited recourse to
domestic financing, was already tight. Any further expenditure cuts would therefore come at
the expense of making progress towards the MDGs. The staff concurred but noted that a
further exchange rate appreciation could also be detrimental to poverty reduction. Staff
therefore recommended the identification of contingency spending reduction plans in
nonpriority spending to cope with recurrent problems of revenue shortfalls and expenditure
overruns.
23.
The authorities have prepared an alternative high case scenario within the
context of the MAP. The MAP foresees somewhat higher growth rates, tax revenues,
government investment, and gross official reserves relative to the base case scenario, while
the inflation objective would be broadly the same. Net external aid (including grants) is
assumed to be substantially higher, resulting in a lower current account balance (including
grants). The authorities’ preliminarily estimate the cost for achieving the MAP’s objectives
at Euro 1.5 billion per year over the period 2007–12.4 Based on estimates provided by
Madagascar’s main development partners, however, net external foreign assistance is
expected to decline by 2.5 percentage points of GDP over the period 2006–09, while the
MAP’s high case scenario assumes that donor assistance would increase by about
3 percentage points of GDP per annum. The authorities agreed, however, that they should
continue to base their policies and budgets on the more conservative baseline scenario until
the assumed higher levels of financing materialize. The staff noted that the fiscal stance
could be relaxed if additional concessional external financing was forthcoming, subject to
progress in increasing absorptive capacity and reducing inflation.

The sustainability of Madagascar’s debt outlook has improved thanks to the
MDRI and improved prospects for growth and exports. A joint Bank/Fund debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) was carried out based on the low-income debt sustainability
framework (Appendix I). It reveals that the key debt indicators in 2005, which were already

26.
To help achieve their monetary policy objectives, the authorities will use open
market operations and closely monitor core inflation. With assistance from MCM, the
authorities have converted the consolidated government debt owed to the central bank
(1.6 percent of GDP) into marketable securities bearing market rates of interest. The BCM
can now use these securities to conduct open market operations, thereby providing an
additional monetary policy instrument beyond the short-term deposit auctions (appel
d’offres). In assessing the appropriateness of the monetary stance vis-à-vis the inflation
objective and given the volatility in food and energy prices, the staff suggested that the
authorities also use a measure of “core” inflation (Box 1). Such an indicator removes the

19
effect of highly volatile rice and oil prices that are susceptible to supply-related shocks. The
authorities agreed that core inflation is a useful indicator for assessing the conduct of
monetary policy.
Box 1. Madagascar: Core Inflation 1
Core inflation generally refers to a measure of inflation that excludes volatile and supply-driven
elements such as food and energy prices. It is often used as an indicator in determining the
effectiveness of monetary policy because it captures demand-related pressures. In the case of
Madagascar, the staff calculated core inflation as the weighted average of the price changes for the
consumer price index excluding rice and energy products.
Core inflation can assist policy makers in assessing the underlying trend in inflation and determining
the appropriate monetary policy to pursue. For example, overall inflation was lower than core
inflation during the second half of 2006 owing to lower rice and energy prices. If the monetary
authorities focused solely on general inflation, they could have concluded that monetary policy
should be loosened when in fact it should have remained tight in order to achieve their price stability
objective.

27.
A prudent fiscal stance is essential for preserving macroeconomic stability. The
authorities concurred that total spending should be kept in line with domestic revenues and
concessional external financing, keeping domestic financing of the budget deficit to a
minimum so not to crowd out private sector credit. They intended to absorb the shock of
cyclones and flooding since the beginning of the year with humanitarian aid and expenditure
switching within the envelope approved in the 2007 budget. However, they believed that the
2007 fiscal program should be revised to take into account the impact of the expected
appreciation on government revenue and expenditure (0.3 percent of GDP), the
underestimation of obligatory spending (0.2 percent of GDP), and additional transfers to the
electricity company (0.3 percent of GDP) (¶34). Moreover, as the cost of recapitalizing the
central bank (0.9 percent of GDP) was not known at the time of budget preparation, it should
now be included. With a view to minimizing the government’s recourse to domestic

20
financing, the authorities will undertake reductions in nonpriority spending equivalent to
0.5 percent of GDP. As the recapitalization expenditure would not have an impact on
aggregate demand, it could be financed domestically without undermining the inflation
objective. The staff agreed that the revised fiscal stance was broadly consistent with the
authorities’ macroeconomic objectives for 2007.

C. Improving PFM and Transparency
28.
Problems in tax policy and tax and customs administration continue to
undermine the country’s revenue mobilization effort in support of the MDGs. The
authorities indicated that the MAP’s objective is to raise the tax-to-GDP ratio from
10.7 percent in 2006 to 15 percent by 2011. In the area of tax policy, they plan to implement
a simplified corporate and personal income tax system within the context of the 2008
Finance Law. Following FAD recommendations, the authorities will incorporate the export
processing zone (EPZ) companies into the common law regime and simplify the corporate
and personal income tax structure (Box 2). They indicated, however, that some
recommended measures (i.e., taxation of fringe benefits at market value, elimination of low
yielding taxes which finance local authorities) would need to be implemented gradually. The
staff underlined that urgent efforts to tighten the administration of large-and medium-size tax
payers were required to meet the revenue targets in 2007–08. Remedial actions were also
needed to address serious shortfalls in customs valuation and clearance procedures, which
appear to have permitted about 20 percent of imports to depart from established procedures.
The authorities were confident that the installation of Tradenet—a state-of-the-art electronic
information system that traces imports in real time—would dramatically curtail opportunities
for fraud at customs. The staff concurred with the priority being placed on tax policy and

21
administration, but warned that the MAP revenue objective appears ambitious and will
require considerable progress in tax and customs administration. In light of the mining and
oil exploration potential of the country, the staff urged the authorities to review whether the
fiscal regimes for mining and oil projects were in line with international standards.
Box 2. Madagascar: Tax Policy Reform Priorities1
At around 10.7 percent, the ratio of tax revenue to GDP in Madagascar is some 3 percentage
points lower than the average in comparable low income countries. Most of this
underperformance stems from the low yield of the personal and corporate income tax, and the
limited reliance on trade taxes.
Poor revenue performance arises both from policy measures that erode the tax base and poor
tax and customs administration. The tax system is being poorly administered, most notably in
relation to customs procedures and VAT refunds. This leads to pressures for special treatment to
avoid these burdens which further complicates the tax system.
Tax policy reform priorities for promoting growth and strengthening revenue performance
include: integrating the EPZ companies into a common and more attractive corporate tax structure,
while respecting the benefits already granted to the existing EPZ companies; raising the threshold
of the VAT which will enable scarce administrative resources to be better focused on core tasks
such as refunding excess credits; imposing the VAT on agricultural inputs; reviewing the rate
structure and exemptions under the personal income tax; removing protection hidden in the
structure of domestic excises by raising rates on domestic products; eliminating a wide range of
low-yielding taxes; and reviewing the fiscal regime of mining and oil projects. The resulting
streamlined tax code will foster resource allocation by the private sector in line with Madagascar’s
comparative advantages.

Better public expenditure management is essential for improved budget
execution and control. Building on the 2005 and 2006 Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability assessments, the authorities have been implementing a priority action plan to
improve budget and cash management with donor support, including the IMF. Good progress
has been made in budget preparation and execution with the implementation of the budget
information system (SIGFP) and the early preparation of the 2008 budget. The staff
indicated, however, that major weaknesses remained owing to the lack of comprehensive and
timely reports on budget execution and poor application of the Procurement Code. The
authorities agreed that they should place highest priority in 2007 on implementing SIGFP in
the main spending ministries. They would also strengthen procurement practices with the
assistance of the World Bank. The staff noted that the pay-as-you-go civil service pension
system appears to be severely unbalanced and, if unaddressed, could crowd out priority
budgetary spending in the medium term.5 The authorities agreed and proposed that civil
service pension reform be a key focus of the next program review.
30.
The authorities confirmed their commitment to adhere to the principles of the
EITI. They are creating an EITI committee to be comprised of representatives from the
government, the natural resource companies, and civil society (including the media) and are
launching a public information campaign. They are also considering the possible creation of
an offshore future generation fund for the management of natural resource receipts, with
technical support from Norway. With large-scale mining activities coming on line and with
the possibility of significant offshore oil discoveries in the future, the staff considered these
initiatives to be very timely and helpful in addressing the ensuing macroeconomic
challenges, but insisted on the need for full accountability and transparency of such a fund in
the fiscal accounts.
31.
A financially sound central bank is vital for the conduct of monetary and
exchange rate policy. The staff welcomed the authorities’ decision to recapitalize the central
bank and to remunerate central bank claims on the treasury at market rates of interest. In
addition, it stressed the need to reduce the central bank’s operating costs, including the costs
of banknotes, and to remove from the central bank law the possibility to distribute unrealized
foreign exchange valuation gains. The authorities indicated that this would be done as part of
an overhaul scheduled for 2008 of the central bank law to make it compatible with the SADC
treaty. The BCM expects to propose a cost reduction plan next Fall.
32.
Data are adequate for surveillance purposes, but need to be improved
(Informational Annex). The authorities recognized the deficiencies and agreed with staff that
they should redouble their efforts to improve the provision of macroeconomic economic data,
particularly real sector data. Madagascar is benefiting from technical assistance from STA

and the French authorities in the areas of national accounts statistics, and a revised set of
accounts should be produced next year. The authorities have agreed to publish the statistical
appendix on the government web sites.
D. Fostering Private Sector Development
33.
The authorities are undertaking further trade liberalization, both on a
multilateral and regional basis. Madagascar unilaterally reduced some of its tariffs
resulting in a drop of its simple average MFN tariff from 16.2 percent at the end of 2005 to
12.9 percent in 2007. The authorities have also taken important steps towards regional
integration into the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and believe that the
economic gains from regional integration would be substantial. The findings of a recent staff
study indicate that the direct impact of SADC membership on economic growth in
Madagascar is likely to be quite limited (Box 3). The staff urged the authorities to
complement regional trade liberalization with a multilateral liberalization whose gains were
likely to be larger. The authorities noted that trade liberalization should continue on an MFN
basis in parallel to regional integration.
Box 3. The Economic and Fiscal Impact of Joining the SADC Free Trade Area1
Madagascar plans to phase out its tariff on imports from SADC over the period 2007-12. This will
liberalize 5.6 percent of Madagascar 2006 imports, of which 88 percent will be imports from South
Africa. Because the trade affected by the SADC FTA is small, the gains to real GDP are estimated to be
limited to 0.4 percent. Nevertheless, staff simulations suggest that the SADC FTA would affect
significantly the trade structure as well as the structure of production:
● Madagascar’s trade with SADC, mainly South Africa, would increase by about 5 percent while its
trade with the rest of the world would decline.
● The product composition of Madagascar’s trade would change. The textiles and clothing industries
would be the major beneficiaries and could increase by almost 1 percent.
● Customs revenue could decline by about 8 percent, but total revenue from taxes on international
trade (which accounted for about half of Madagascar’s tax revenue in 2006) would be reduced by less
than 3 percent in the first year. The impact will be more limited in 2007 since the tariff cut initially
scheduled to take place in January 2007 has been delayed.
● A simulation of SADC FTA membership complemented by a small multilateral liberalization
produces much larger gains.

Restructuring and rehabilitating the public utility company (JIRAMA) is
essential for increasing private sector investment, sustaining economic growth, and
strengthening public finances. Private sector representatives complained about the frequent
power surges and outages which disrupted economic activity and increased production costs.
According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the World Bank, at current

24
electricity tariffs JIRAMA would need to increase average electricity tariffs by 45 percent in
order to cover its operating costs. The authorities indicated that they were prepared to phase
in electricity tariff increases (15 percent in October 2007, April 2008, and October 2008,
respectively) and would henceforth adopt an automatic pricing index formula. To address the
interim shortfalls in operating revenues and to finance urgent rehabilitation investment, they
will allocate annual budgetary transfers equivalent to 0.5 percent of GDP to JIRAMA in
2007–08, and identify priority rehabilitation investments in close consultation with the IFC
and the World Bank. Once JIRAMA becomes profitable, the authorities intend to transfer its
management to a private operator through a lease-type agreement, for which an international
tender is tentatively scheduled for end-2008.
35.
Financial intermediation needs to be broadened and access to credit expanded in
order to sustain broad-based economic growth and development. The staff noted that the
part of the FDI inflows that remains in the country will significantly expand bank deposits
and present an opportunity to improve financial intermediation and expand access to credit.
Building on the recommendations of the Financial System Stability Assessment,6 the
authorities have developed a draft medium-term financial sector strategy (Box 4), which they
wish to further elaborate in collaboration with Bank/Fund staff, including through a
supporting technical assistance program. They intend to improve financial intermediation by
encouraging competition and licensing more banks, creating a credit bureau, and improving
the payments system. They pointed to the strong expansion of microfinance institutions
(MFIs), which would improve access to credit and support more broad-based growth, and
noted that the MFI regulatory framework and surveillance were being improved. The staff
supported the authorities’ initiatives and emphasized the importance of close oversight
during this expansionary period.

Box 4. Key Elements of Financial Sector Strategy
The authorities have prepared a draft medium-term national financial sector strategy and are in
the process of developing a supporting technical assistance program. The main objectives are
to:
1. Support the operational independence of the central bank
•

Improve monetary operations and introduce open market operations (2007).

•

Ensure more effective BCM intervention in the MID and enforcement of MID
guideline (ongoing).

•

Revise the central bank statute to conform with SADC requirements and best practices
(2007/08).
2. Build up banking sector supervision
•

Implement decrees under new banking law (2007).

• Increase resources allocated to the banking supervision office (ongoing).
3. Strengthen the nonbank sector
• Improve supervision of microfinance sector and implement decrees covering MFIs
(2007/08, with assistance of World Bank and Millennium Challenge Corporation
[MCC]).
•

Improve supervision of insurance companies and pension funds (2008).

• Audit public pension funds (2008).
4. Improve the efficiency of the financial sector
•

Encourage banking sector competition and license more banks (ongoing).

•

Create a credit bureau for banks and microfinance institutions (2008).

•

Reduce payment delays in banking system (diagnostic study in process under MCC,
2007/08).

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Madagascar has suffered from decades of macroeconomic instability arising
from political crises, poor macroeconomic polices, and exogenous shocks. Poverty
remains high, inflation persists at double-digit levels, and growth has been insufficient for
making adequate progress toward achieving the MDGs.
37.
The authorities’ new poverty reduction strategy (MAP) presents a vision for
addressing the key structural and other problems that have hindered economic
development. Key to the realization of the MAP’s objectives will be advancements in
domestic revenue mobilization, public financial management, scaling up of donor assistance,
foreign direct investment, and electricity sector reform.
38.
Macroeconomic policies should be based on a more conservative base case
scenario until scaling up of aid materializes. Accommodation should be made for

26
additional priority expenditure in support of growth and poverty if financed on a
concessional basis and if capacity to absorb these funds is in place.
39.
Large FDI in the mining sector signals a important shift in the structure of the
economy. The domestic spending component of these FDI flows places appreciation
pressures on the exchange rate as it moves to its new equilibrium. This appreciation poses
significant challenges for the competitiveness of the non-mining tradable sector and
macroeconomic management.
40.
The authorities’ exchange rate policy of a managed float with no predetermined
path remains appropriate. This policy has allowed the exchange rate to move in line with
macroeconomic fundamentals and has maintained the competitiveness of exports. But,
exports and real exchange rate developments need to be closely monitored and there would
be scope for foreign exchange intervention to help avoid an overshooting of the exchange
rate and to utilize capital inflows to help boost foreign exchange reserves. The authorities
should be cautious regarding liberalizing capital account transactions, however, as such
liberalization needs to be carefully sequenced with efforts to strengthen the framework for
banking supervision and prudential regulations.
41.
The authorities need to continue to pursue a monetary policy that is consistent
with their foreign reserves and single-digit inflation targets. They should therefore be
prepared to mop up any excess liquidity, including through their new monetary instrument
(i.e., tradable government securities), while ensuring that the money supply increases in line
with the higher demand for money balances arising from the FDI flows.
42.
A prudent fiscal policy needs to be maintained. While running a fiscal surplus
would in principle help alleviate appreciation pressures on the exchange rate, reducing
expenditure at this time would undermine efforts to increase spending in support of the
MDGs. The authorities should continue to keep domestic financing of the budget at low
levels so as not to crowd out credit to the private sector and place pressure on domestic
interest rates, while redoubling their efforts to increase revenues. Strengthening the
operations of large-and medium-size tax payers units and customs administration is
indispensable to meet the revenue targets. They should also include contingency spending
reductions plans in future budget submissions to address possible revenue shortfalls and
avoid repeated expenditure overruns.
43.
The exchange rate appreciation reinforces the need to implement structural
reforms critical to private sector development. The restructuring and rehabilitation of
JIRAMA, the deepening of financial intermediation, and the liberalization of trade on an
MFN basis should be implemented without delay.
44.
Addressing institutional capacity constraints will alleviate risks to policy
implementation. Exogenous shocks, uncertainty over donor assistance, and institutional

27
capacity constraints could impede policy implementation. The country’s debt situation is
sustainable, especially in the aftermath of the MDRI. Action plans in the areas of tax and
customs administration, public financial management, monetary and exchange rate
management, and statistics, for which the authorities receive substantial technical assistance,
need steadfast implementation. The central bank recapitalization should be followed by steps
to reduce its operating costs.
45.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Madagascar take place
within 24 months subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in
program countries.

APPENDIX I: MADAGASCAR—JOINT BANK-FUND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Madagascar’s risk of debt distress is low. The upgrading of Madagascar’s risk of debt
distress rating compared to the previous debt sustainability analysis (DSA) is on account of
the improved growth and export prospects linked to the big mining projects under
construction. Madagascar’s external debt burden indicators under the baseline scenario
remain below the relevant policy-dependent indicative thresholds. The stress tests do not
result in indicators breaching the thresholds although they reveal that external debt
sustainability is sensitive to export shocks, which are likely given the concentration of
Madagascar exports. The inclusion in the analysis of the small domestic debt does not
change the assessment of country’s risk of debt distress.
A. Introduction
1.
This DSA has been prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank staff. It is based on
the framework for low-income countries approved by the respective Executive Boards. The
framework takes into account indicative thresholds for debt burden indicators determined by
the quality of the country’s policies and institutions.1 It comprises of a baseline scenario
(which assumes, among others, full delivery of Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative debt relief by external creditors) 2 and a set of alternative scenarios.
B. Recent Developments and Current Debt Situation
2.
Madagascar reached its completion point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative
in October 2004. The resulting debt relief, including additional bilateral debt relief from
most Paris Club creditors, reduced the end-2003 NPV of debt-to-exports ratio to an estimated
137 percent.3 4At that time, the ratio was projected to increase to 154 percent in 2004 and
decline thereafter.
1

According to the World Bank Country and Policy Institutional Assessment (CPIA) Index, Madagascar is rated
as a medium performer. This rating is the same using either the latest index or the three-year average. The
indicative sustainability thresholds for external debt applicable for that category of countries are: (i) 150 percent
for NPV of debt-to-exports ratio; (ii) 40 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio; (iii) 250 percent for the NPV
of debt to fiscal revenues ratio; (iv) 20 percent for the debt service to exports ratio; and (v) 30 percent for the
debt service to revenue ratio.

2

As of end-2006, Madagascar has estimated US$595 million in arrears towards non-Paris Club and private
creditors that are not delivering HIPC debt relief (Algeria, Libya, and Iraq are the largest accounting for
92 percent of the total). Madagascar continues to make efforts to contact these creditors, regularize the
payments, and obtain full debt relief under the HIPC Initiative.

3
4

Total debt relief to Madagascar under the Initiative amounts to US$836 million in NPV terms.

Most Paris Club creditors have written-off their outstanding claims after full delivery of HIPC debt relief,
reducing claims on Madagascar by further US$466 million in NPV terms. In 2006, Sweden and Israel canceled
100 percent of the Malagasy debt. In addition an agreement was finalized with Japan and an agreement is under
discussion with the Federation of Russia. Regarding non-Paris Club creditors, cancellation agreements should
be finalized soon with Abu Dhabi and the People’s Republic of China.

Madagascar’s external public debt declined significantly from US$3.5 billion at
end 2005 (including arrears) to US$1.6 billion at end 2006 on the account of the debt
relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). The IMF’s debt relief under
the MDRI became effective in January 2006 and amounts to US$197 million.5 MDRI debt
relief from IDA was implemented starting in July 2006 through the 100 percent reduction of
the debt disbursed as of end-2003 that was still outstanding at the implementation date. Total
MDRI debt service relief from IDA is estimated at SDR1.2 billion (equivalent to about
US$1,780.1 million).6 As for the ADF, the delivery of debt relief under the MDRI though a
write-off of the outstanding obligations as of end-December 2004 became effective in
September 2006 (with retroactive application to January 2006). Estimated MDRI debt relief
from the ADF amounts to US$393 million. This has been partly offset by new borrowings as
well as exchange rate developments7, and the actual outstanding stock of debt has declined
by 55 percent in 2006.
5

See www.imf.org for details on the implementation of the MDRI by the IMF. The amount of relief includes
undisbursed HIPC assistance from the Fund, previously expected to be delivered over time, and MDRI
assistance. Excluding the HIPC share, the MDRI debt relief amounts to US$186 million.

7

For details on the implementation of the MDRI by IDA, see IDA/SecM2005 and IDA/SecM2006-0131.

This refers to the increase on the US$ value of the debt due to the depreciation of the US$ vis-à-vis other
currencies in which Madagascar’s debt is denominated.

44

4.
The MDRI debt relief has triggered a drastic change in the creditor composition.
The share of multilateral creditors has decreased from more than 75 percent at end-2005 to
53 percent at end-2006. Conversely, bilateral and commercial creditors represented
47 percent of total outstanding obligations (with Paris Club creditors accounting for
7 percent), compared to about 23 percent by end-2005. The bilateral Paris Club debt that
remains is mainly to Russia. The current creditor composition is broadly similar to the one
prevailing at end-2003, i.e., prior to the debt write-offs granted by most Paris Club and the
MDRI debt relief.
C. Baseline Medium- and Long-Term Scenario
5.
The baseline scenario is substantially different to the one described in the
previous DSA due to the impact of two large mining projects. Construction of a
US$650 million (12 percent of GDP) ilmenite mine began in mid-2006 and a US$2.5 billion
(45 percent of GDP) nickel and cobalt mine and processing facility commenced in 2007 and
will be completed over the next three years. Such a large inflow of capital is leading to an
appreciation of the currency and the project will result in higher growth and starting in
2009/10 in higher exports (Box 1) than in the previous DSA.
6.
The baseline scenario is built on a number of key macroeconomic assumptions,
the implementation of sound macroeconomic and structural policies and external
financing that is through grants and highly concessional loans. Key macroeconomic
assumptions are indicated in Box 1. With respect to external financing, new borrowing is
projected to remain largely at highly concessional terms. External assistance as a share of
GDP, which had climbed very rapidly to close to 14 percent in 2004 due to large inflows of
external aid and borrowing to finance recovery after the 2002 political crisis, will remain
relatively high in the short term (increasing from 8 percent of GDP in 2005 to 11 percent of
GDP in 2006, in part due to external financing of the presidential election, and 9 percent in
2007 based on recent information from donors) and gradually decrease to about 6 percent of
GDP by the end of the projection period. The borrowing is largely for financing
infrastructure projects aimed at lowering costs and enhancing competitiveness, and to help
Madagascar attain the objectives of the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP) and the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs).
7.
Under the baseline scenario, Madagascar’s external debt indicators remain well
below the thresholds throughout the projection period (Figure 1a and Table 1a). The debt
indicators dropped sharply in 2006 as a result of the MDRI (Table 1a). The NPV of debt-toGDP ratio which was at about 36 percent in 20058 (a level already below the threshold for
medium performers) dropped to below 12 percent in 2006 (Figure 1a and Table 1a); it
increases subsequently to peak at 16 percent in 2017 and drops after to about 13 percent in
8

See IMF Country Report No. 06/306, Republic of Madagascar: Request for a Three-Year Arrangement Under
the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and Activation of the Trade Integration Mechanism.

45
the outer years. The NPV of debt-to-revenue ratios (Tables 2a) exhibit a similar profile. The
increase in these ratios in the initial years (from the low post-MDRI levels) reflects relatively
high new borrowing albeit at concessional terms to finance needed investment expenditures.
The NPV of debt-to-exports is driven by the impact of the big mining projects. Before they
start their exports, these projects are expected to lead to an appreciation of the exchange rate
that will negatively impact competitiveness of exports. This in conjunction with the weak
performance of agricultural prices of key exports, such as vanilla, leads to a deterioration of
debt indicators based on exports up to 2009. The mining projects are expected to start
exporting in end-2009 or in 2010. The value of these exports is so large that the NPV of
debt-to-export ratio is projected to drop from 61 percent in 2009 to 38 percent in 2010 and
grow through the projected period (but remaining well below the threshold ) due to new
borrowing. The debt service-to-exports ratio exhibits a similar pattern. Moreover, given the
highly concessional nature of the existing debt and new borrowing, the debt service ratios are
well below the indicative thresholds throughout the projection period but show a rising trend
due to the accumulation of new debt.
8.
Madagascar’s total public debt ratios, including domestic debt, also stay well
below the external debt sustainability thresholds under the base case scenario (Figure 2a
and Table 2a). The domestic debt is projected to remain under 10 percent of GDP through the
projection period, as total expenditure is assumed to be broadly kept in check with available
financing from tax revenue and external assistance, and the fiscal deficit is projected to
remain predominantly financed by external assistance on concessional terms.
D. Sensitivity Analysis
External public debt indicators
9.
The sensitivity analysis suggests that the external debt indicators are low but
could deteriorate with inappropriate policies, and/or if confronted by adverse shocks.
They would however remain below the threshold.9
• The debt indicators in the historical scenario (Scenario A1 in Figure 1A and Table 1b
based on the average of the years 1999–2006) follow a lower trajectory than under the
baseline. It should be noted, however, that the years leading up to 2006 include years of
political turmoil, large terms of trade shocks, cyclones, and natural disasters. During that
period, although real growth averaged only about 3.5 percent, the current account deficit was
also low as the Export Processing Zone sector (put in place in 1989) was growing at very
9

The stress tests performed under the sensitivity scenario assumed permanent modifications of key baseline
assumptions (“alternative scenarios”) as well as temporary deviations (“bound tests”). The “alternative
scenarios” include a “historical scenario”, under which the main variables that determine the debt dynamics are
assumed to remain at their historical average, and a “financing scenario” that depicts the impact of lower
concessionality in new borrowing. The “bound tests” are designed to examine the impact on debt and debt
service indicators of shocks, based on the country’s historical volatility, to key variables.

46
high rates. This factor explains the relatively benign trajectory of the debt indicators under
the historic scenario. If the years of the political crisis (GDP decline of 12.7 percent in 2002)
and the recovery from this (growth of 9.8 percent in 2003) are excluded, the average growth
is significantly higher at 5 percent, which remains below the baseline scenario but close to it
if the impact of the big mining projects is excluded.
• The financing scenario (Scenario A2) reveals that Madagascar’s external debt indicators
are sensitive to the terms of new borrowing. Under this scenario, the NPV of debt-to-GDP
remains below the threshold but would more than double in the next decade (from 11 percent
in 2007 to 23 percent in 2017), and remains at about that level through 2021 before
decreasing slightly. The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would increase steadily from 46
percent in 2007 to 101 percent in 2027. This increase is substantial although the ratio would
remain below the threshold. The projected path of these two ratios, together with the rising
trend of the debt service ratio from 2 to 6 percent during the projection period, points to risks
from new borrowing at less favorable terms than assumed in the baseline scenario.10
• The bound tests do not reveal major underlying vulnerabilities. The most extreme
stress tests shows the impact of the combined FDI and growth shock on the NPV of debt-toGDP ratio (Scenario B5), and exports shock (Scenario B2) on the NPV of debt-to exports
ratio do not result in indicators significantly breaching thresholds. These scenarios show that
debt sustainability is most vulnerable to changes in the inflows of FDI and to the impact of
these projects on growth and exports. The NPV of debt-to-GDP increases significantly (to
26 percent in 2027) but remains comfortably below the threshold level. On the other hand,
the export based indicator-the NPV of debt to exports, crosses the threshold in 2009 only but
falls back below the threshold as soon as the exports of the two big mining projects
materialize. The shock to exports is somewhat extreme (the standard deviation is about
33 percent) as it is influenced by the rapid increase in exports in the historical period from
textiles exports, and the large decline in exports that took place during the political crises and
the subsequent rapid recovery. The implications of export concentration for vulnerability are
nevertheless to be noted, as they illustrate the impact of shocks to certain export commodities
(such as textiles), which have become large as a share of total exports in Madagascar (about
40 percent in 2005 and 2006), as well as the exports of only two mining projects that are
expected to account for over 50 percent of exports of goods and services over 2011–17.
However, the vulnerabilities associated with the big mining projects appear limited: even if
the exports of the big mining projects are only 1/3 of their baseline level (due either to a
lower volume and/or to lower export prices) the NPV of debt-to-exports would remain below
the threshold (scenario B7) peaking at 71 percent in 2022 (61 percent in the baseline).

10

This scenario is similar to a sharp decline in grant financing, compared to the baseline, compensated by loans.

47
Total public debt indicators
10.
Total public debt indicators are most sensitive to economic growth shocks. A
temporary or permanent deviation from the baseline real GDP growth path would bring the
total public debt beyond the external debt sustainability thresholds beginning in 2015, if
spending plans were kept unchanged, which is unlikely in view of past experience (Table 2b,
Scenarios A3 and B1).
E. Debt Distress Classification and Conclusions
11.
Madagascar’s risk of debt distress is low following the debt relief under the
HIPC Initiative and the MDRI and due to the impact on exports and GDP of big
mining projects. In the baseline scenario Madagascar’s debt indicators are below the
thresholds. The debt situation does not appear to be significantly vulnerable to shocks. Debt
sustainability appears somewhat vulnerable if large export shocks materialize. This is a risk
in the medium term given the high concentration in exports in textiles in the short run and
two mining products whose prices are volatile.
12.
In conclusion, the debt situation seems under control and not subject to major
risks. Sensitivity analysis nonetheless points to the need not only for implementing the
policies underpinning the baseline scenario, but also for careful monitoring of borrowing
policies and, more importantly, export performance. The latter is critical given the
concentration of exports in textiles and clothing in the short run and in two mining projects
starting in 2010. Borrowing at non-concessional terms as well new borrowing beyond the
levels assumed under the baseline could also raise Madagascar’s risk of debt distress.

48
Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth is projected at 7 percent over 2007-2027. This growth rate is higher than
the historical average (5 percent over 1999–2006 if the impact of the political turmoil of 2002
is excluded) due to the impact of two large mining projects that started at the end of 2006.
Without these projects, the real growth rates would have been a little under 6 percent on
average i.e. higher but close to the historical rate.
Inflation as measured by the GDP deflator in dollar terms is projected to average about
3.7 percent, with higher rates of 20 percent in 2007 and decelerating to 2 percent subsequently.
However, reflecting the impact of the large inflows of FDI on the exchange rate, which in turn
will depend crucially of the monetary policy undertaken, the increase in the GDP deflator in
local currency is expected to decelerate from 9.5 percent in 2007 to 5 percent beginning in
2010.
Export volumes grow at 11 percent on average and support GDP growth. The growth rates are
relatively modest in the initial years reflecting the impact of the exchange rate appreciation on
some vulnerable export industries such as textiles and shrimp but will jump as soon as the
exports of the big mining projects start.
Import volumes average about 7 percent for the period. Import volumes are expected to grow
significantly due to the high import content (estimated at about 80 percent) of the mining
projects during their construction phase and will then slow down to about 6.5 percent i.e., at
about the pace of real GDP growth.
The current account deficit is projected to increase significantly during the initial years of the
projections due to the large increase in imports related to the big mining projects. However as
exports of these projects start, the current account deficit would gradually shrink from about
20 percent of GDP in 2008 to 9 percent by 2010 and 5 percent by the end of the projection
period.
Tax revenues are projected to increase from 10.7 percent of GDP in 2006 to about
15.5 percent of GDP in 2027, owing to the termination of ad hoc tax and import duty
exemptions, tax policy reforms aimed at simplifying the corporate and personal income tax
regimes, and steadfast improvements in tax and custom administration.
Total expenditures are broadly kept in check with available financing from tax revenue and
external assistance, resulting in a roughly constant share of GDP over the projection period.
External assistance progressively unwinds from the exceptionally high level of about
11 percent of GDP reached during the period 2004 to 2006 (financing of recovery after the
2002 political crisis and of the 2006 presidential elections) to over 7 percent of GDP over
2007–11 (which is slightly higher than the 6 percent of GDP observed during the late 1990s
because of donor financing of the MAP) and to 5 percent of GDP in outer years. The share of
grants gradually increases from half in the initial years to more than half in the later years.

Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and
non-debt creating flows.
Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are
the same as in the baseline.
3
Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its
baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4
Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5
Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6
Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Because assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at
the completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point, these two amounts can not be added.

2

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed in the interim period.

3

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries.
The debt relief covers all debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member
qualifies for such debt relief. The MDRI is financed by bilateral contributions, the Fund's own resources, and
resources already disbursed to the member under the HIPC Initiative (see Section VII above).

Safeguards Assessments:

A safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Madagascar (BCM) was completed on
March 17, 2006; a previous assessment was completed in November 2001. The 2006
assessment identified continued weaknesses in BCM internal controls, financial reporting,
and legal framework, and made recommendations to address the observed vulnerabilities.
The recommendations included: (i) an annual external audit report on the BCM’s transactions
with the government and their compliance with the central bank law; (ii) quarterly reviews by
the BCM’s internal audit function of monetary program data reported to the Fund;
(iii) adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for BCM accounting;
and (iv) measures to strengthen the quality of the BCM’s external audit, e.g., appointment of
an international audit firm with experience in IFRS and international auditing standards.
X.

Exchange System and Exchange Rate Arrangements:

After April 1982, when the peg to the French franc was discontinued, the exchange rate was
managed with reference to a basket of 10 currencies. By the end of 1991, the authorities
stopped the practice of adjusting the exchange rate to offset inflation differentials with key
trading partners. Since July, 2004, the Malagasy franc has been determined through a
continuous interbank foreign exchange market system, and on January 1, 2005, the Ariary
(AR) replaced the Malagasy franc as the country’s official unit of account, at the rate of
AR 1=FMG 5. The exchange rate in terms of the SDR at end-April 2007 was
AR 2,799 = SDR 1. The exchange rate regime is classified as a managed float with no
predetermined path.
Madagascar accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on September 18,
1996 and maintains no restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. Staff is currently working with the authorities as they put in place
a new foreign exchange law and implementing regulations, to ensure that the new regime
remains consistent with Madagascar’s obligations under the Articles of Agreement. Staff is
also currently working with the authorities to determine if Madagascar has imposed any
exchange restrictions solely for the preservation of national or international security, and to
ensure that any such restrictions are notified promptly to the Fund in accordance with the
procedures set out in Decision No. 144-(52/51) (August 14, 1952).
XI.

Last Article IV Consultation:

The 2005 Article IV consultation staff report was discussed by the Executive Board on
June 1, 2005 (Country Report No. 05/350, September 27, 2005).

II. MADAGASCAR: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of April 24, 2007)
Madagascar’s Development Strategy
1.
The government has put in place the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP), a bold
development plan for 2007–12 that is the second-generation Poverty Reduction Strategy. The
MAP envisages accelerated and better-coordinated reforms and outlines the “strategies and
actions that will ignite rapid growth, lead to the reduction of poverty, and ensure that the
country develops in response to the challenges of globalization and in accordance with the
national vision—Madagascar Naturally—and the Millennium Development Goals.”
2.
The MAP was prepared in a participatory way and makes eight commitments:
(1) responsible governance; (2) connected infrastructure; (3) educational transformation;
(4) rural development and a green revolution; (5) better health, family planning, and the fight
against HIV/AIDS; (6) a high-growth economy: (7) a cherished environment; and
(8) national solidarity. For each commitment, the government identified challenges, goals
and strategies, priority activities, and monitoring indicators. The MAP identifies six
“breakthrough initiatives”—areas requiring immediate attention: (1) public finance reform;
(2) significant increase in investment to promote high growth; (3) sowing the seeds of a
green revolution; (4) transforming public security; (5) implementing bold new measures for
health and family planning; (6) transforming the judiciary.
3.
Programs for implementing MAP commitments are being elaborated in greater detail
in sector strategies. Some of these strategies are already in place, among them the National
Environmental Action Plan and strategies in rural development, health, primary education,
rural water, transport, and HIV/AIDS. The government is finalizing a risk management and
social protection strategy and is working on a financial sector strategy. Implementation of the
MAP is guided by the budget, the Politique Generale de l’État, which represents annual
agreements between the president and cabinet ministers
Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and Lending Operations
4.
The World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy has been designed in parallel with the
elaboration of the MAP in terms of timing, duration, and substance (it was discussed by the
Bank’s Board on April 3, 2007). The CAS covers almost the same time period as the MAP
(2007–12) and supports attainment of the MAP goals. In doing so, the CAS supports the
areas of the government program that have the highest priority; those where the Bank Group
has a comparative advantage. The CAS will continue the Bank Group’s focus on removing
bottlenecks to sustainable and shared growth, anchored in good governance, with
corresponding improvements in welfare indicators and thus MAP goals. The specific sets of
results supported by the CAS are organized around two main pillars. The first concentrates
on activities that will help remove constraints to investment and growth in rural and urban

10
areas. The second brings together activities geared toward improving the scope and quality of
service delivery.
5.
The CAS sets out a program of Bank support that encompasses budget support
(PRSCs); sector-wide operations (SWAPs); investment projects; public-private partnerships;
and analytical and advisory activities (AAA). Poverty Reduction Support Credits will
continue to serve as a forum for policy dialogue with the government and as a platform for
donor harmonization. The next series will further emphasize removing policy bottlenecks to
achieving the MAP and CAS objectives. Given the breadth of the potential agenda, the
Poverty Reduction Support Credits will seek to avoid dispersion and focus on a few critical
issues (such as governance and public resource management). It will provide US$40–60
million a year to complement IDA MDRI debt relief of over US$30 million a year during the
CAS period. In response to the lessons learned from previous Poverty Reduction Support
Credits, the transition to budget support is occurring more gradually and budget support will
only be scaled up gradually to encompass other sectors in tandem with improvements in the
public finance system.
6.
With respect to pillar one of the CAS, removing constraints to investment and
growth, the Bank will continue to provide integrated assistance through the Growth Poles
Project (FY06), the Watershed and Irrigation Adaptable Program Loan (FY07), and two ongoing transport operations, followed by planned transport and growth operations. The
Poverty Reduction Support Credits will complement, as needed, implementation of pro
growth policies, help sort out priorities, address coordination issues, and provide budget
support. Analytical work will supplement these efforts with a comprehensive infrastructure
review to identify the main bottlenecks, draft a strategic vision, and evaluate the impact of
investments.
7.
The forthcoming Country Economic Memorandum on growth will enrich the current
growth diagnostics and help fine-tune future World Bank Group interventions, specifically
the future growth operations. The Bank Group will step up its assistance to better integrate
the economy into global and regional markets and to profit from market opportunities at
home. This will include continued technical assistance to build government capacity and to
help producers adopt improved quality standards within the Trade Integrated Framework
Program. The World Bank Group will also finance investments in irrigation infrastructure
and support marketing and other services to increase agricultural productivity and
diversification. The Bank Group will continue its programs aimed at lowering air transport
and telecommunication costs and improving accessibility through an open sky policy and
upgrades to the telecommunications sector, such as development of a national backbone
connected to the regional communications network via the East Africa Submarine
System (EASSy). This is being supported by a regional IDA project in which Madagascar is
participating, that was approved by the Board in early March 2007.

11
8.
The Bank will increase its support to the financial sector, making sure that all
segments of demand, from microfinance to large enterprises, are adequately covered. IDA
will provide technical assistance to improve supervision and regulation, payment and credit
information systems, and the institutional capacity of the sector. IDA and the IFC will
continue to cooperate on facilitating access to credit and other financial services, including
such emerging areas as guarantees and leasing. Building on the FSAP recommendations and
successful implementation of the microfinance pilot project, the Bank Group will also
continue to help the government to draw up strategy, framework, and programs for scaling up
and expanding coverage of financial sector interventions by using a sector-wide approach
with other donors. A supplemental IDA credit for the microfinance project has been recently
approved (on April 10, 2007) to provide bridge financing until multi-donor sector wide
support is in place and other sources of financing become available.
9.
The Bank Group will continue its efforts to improve the energy sector. The IFC and
IDA will work together with the government on a concession arrangement (Affermage) for
the power company JIRAMA and on attracting private companies to generate and sell
electricity. The main instruments are the Energy and Water Adaptable Program Loan
1&2 (FY07/09) and an IFC–IDA Partial Risk Guarantee for public-private partnership
investments in hydropower (FY08). IDA will continue to assist the government in improving
its business climate and bring in more foreign direct investment. This will include
(i) continued assistance to the Economic Development Board and other agencies to improve
regulation; (ii) increase transparency in issuing licenses and concessions (especially in
mining, fishing, tourism, and forestry); and (iii) improve the quality of governance in
extractive industries; Madagascar’s membership in the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI) will be supported through the current Mining Project and through additional
financing for this project that will be presented for Board approval on May 22, 2007. A
supplemental credit (FY08) and a follow-on IDA project (FY09) in the environment sector
are also planned.
10.
The World Bank Group will complement growth-generating activities under the first
CAS pillar with activities aimed at facilitating access to services. Helping to improve all
aspects of public finances will be a high priority for the CAS. Working jointly with other
partners, such as the IMF and France, IDA will continue to help the authorities work to
mobilize increased internal resources. Work on taxation and customs will seek to streamline
the rules, create a level playing field for all taxpayers by reducing tax exemptions, and
facilitate compliance with tax laws. IDA, working jointly with other donors, will continue to
help the government better align allocation of resources with MAP priorities, improve budget
execution, implement new procurement legislation, and measure the impact of public
resource use. Periodic Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessments
will monitor progress. IDA instruments will include Poverty Reduction Support Credits,
current and new Governance and Institutional Development Program projects, and
complementary analytical and advisory work, such as the programmatic Public Expenditure

12
Review, the Country Financial Accountability Assessment, a social accountability program,
and continued close portfolio management.
11.
IDA, jointly with other donors, will continue to assist the government in its efforts to
achieve universal enrollment in primary education, increase completion rates, and improve
the quality of education at all levels to better prepare the workforce for a more advanced
economy. The primary avenue for assistance will be the Education for All Fast-Track
Initiative with Africa Catalytic Fund resources. IDA assistance will also include advice and
investments in post primary education and review of the labor market. In health, it will help
the government make further progress on reducing child and maternal mortality by offering
access to reproductive services, reducing child malnutrition, improving the availability of
clean water and sanitation services, and keeping HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted disease
rates under control. This will be achieved through current operations in health and HIV/AIDS
and a new series of health operations using a sector-wide approach. IDA will continue to
work with the government on institutionalizing the nutrition program and extending nutrition
support sites nationwide initially through the nutrition project and then through general
budget support.
12.
IDA will help the authorities decentralize the provision of basic services. The
assistance will focus on support to the fine-tuning and implementation of the decentralization
strategy, including assigning revenues and expenditure responsibility across different levels
of government. IDA, the European Union, and other donors will provide financial support for
the Local Development Fund (FY08) which is a new mechanism for financing local
infrastructure that builds on the experience of the Community Development Project.
Technical assistance will be provided through the Governance and Institutional Development
Project, Community Development Project, and sector dialogue. Poverty Reduction Support
Credits will provide budget support to key sectors and help identify priorities and monitor the
implementation agenda.
13.
As of April 24 2007 the Bank’s portfolio consists of 16 IDA projects, one regional
telecommunications project and one GEF project; total commitments are US$1,009 million.
Of that, US$385 million is not yet disbursed. Projects scheduled for up-coming approval
include the Health sector wide project ($10 million, May 2007), additional financing to three
on-going projects (Transport, Governance and Mining, May 2007, for a total of
$28.6 million) and PRSC IV (July 2007, $40 million).
IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Areas where the Bank takes the lead
14.
The World Bank takes the lead in advising in sectors where the Bank has active
lending operations (especially in the social sectors, infrastructure, agriculture, and
environment) and through a number of analytical studies. Together with the government and

13
other donors, the Bank supports aid coordination, which includes mobilizing donor support
for the MAP and the Education for All initiative.
Areas where the IMF takes the lead
15.
The Fund takes the lead in policy advice and reforms related to (i) macroeconomic
policies and targets; (ii) tax policy and administration; (iii) budgetary accounting;
(iv) treasury procedures; (v) public sector wage policy; and (vi) monetary management and
exchange rate policy. The Bank team actively participates in discussions between the Fund
and the government in all these areas, especially with respect to tax policy and the setting of
macroeconomic targets.
Areas of joint responsibility
16.
IMF and World Bank staff work closely together on (i) support to the MAP;
(ii) analysis and reforms in public financial management; (iii) other governance reforms,
including customs; and (iv) financial sector assessment. Joint policy advice is given on
budgetary procedures, including expenditure execution, and the functioning of internal and
external budget controls. The Bank and the Fund are working particularly closely on helping
the authorities to mobilize more internal resources. Work on taxation and customs will seek
to streamline the rules, create a level playing field for all taxpayers by reducing tax
exemptions, and facilitate compliance with tax laws. In addition, IDA and the IMF will
continue to help the government better align the allocation of resources with MAP priorities,
improve budget execution, implement new procurement legislation, and measure the impact
of public resource use. Periodic PEFA assessments will monitor progress.
17.
The Bank and the Fund are supporting implementation of the recommendations of the
2005 FSAP. The dialogue focuses on supporting the financial sector strategy framework and
helping scale up and expand support to the financial sector by preparing a sector-wide
approach with other donors.

III. MADAGASCAR: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data are adequate for surveillance purposes, but need to be improved. The database
remains weak, particularly in the areas of real sector, government finances, the balance of
payments, and social statistics. The authorities are aware of these deficiencies and are
working, with technical assistance from the international community, including the Fund, to
ameliorate them. Since May 2004, Madagascar participates in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS), which provides a framework for evaluating needs for data
improvements and setting priorities. However, the metadata and plans for data improvement
that are posted on the Data Dissemination Bulletin Board (DSBB) need to be updated. Since
2000, Madagascar has benefited from STA technical assistance missions in the following
areas: balance of payments (June 2001); monetary and financial statistics (July 2001);
multisector statistics (February 2004); and national accounts (February 2006, JanuaryFebruary 2007).
Real sector
2.
Production of complete national accounts (based on benchmark data) is infrequent
and depends on irregularly collected source data. The last complete sets of benchmark data
are for 2001. The reliability of national accounts estimates remains weak due to gaps in the
source data and methodological shortcomings. In particular, the estimates of agricultural
activities are poor because there is no suitable information about the size and the evolution of
this sector. Moreover, service activities are not properly covered and little information is
available on the magnitude of the informal sector. The recent national accounts missions
helped the authorities complete a comprehensive exercise for 2001 GDP following the 1993
SNA. INSTAT is completing the details of the 2001 national accounts exercise and using it to
transit to a new base year, 2005. Preparation of provisional estimates for the period 20022005 is underway.
3.
INSTAT currently produces two industrial production indices, one for the export
processing zone (IPI-ZF) and the other for enterprises outside the export processing zone
(IPI-RC). These two indices have different survey frameworks and base years (2000 for the
IPI-ZF and 2001 for IPI-RC). Both are quarterly but are released irregularly, sometimes with
a lag of up to one year.
4.
The current consumer price index (CPI) covers the four principal cities, has a base
year of 2000, and expenditure weights based on the 1999 household survey. The CPI is
generally reported to Fund staff on a timely basis. INSTAT plans to update the base year to
2005 and to derive new weights from the 2005 household expenditure survey in the near
future. Data on producer prices and nationwide employment are not available. Various
considerations underlie current work on revising the wholesale price index (WPI). The key

15
issue is the relative importance of commercial activities. However, the utility of the WPI is
constrained by the limited coverage of manufacturing products and lack of timeliness.
Government finance
5.
The 2004 multisector mission found significant gaps in the coverage of government
financial statistics (GFS) and recommended that it be broadened to include public agencies
that are part of the central government. Also, the mission made recommendations on the
classification and recording of transactions, as well as the calculation of domestic arrears.
6.
Data on central government financial operations are disseminated only annually, and
data on public debt are not disseminated at all. The mission recommended monthly
dissemination of central government data, and quarterly dissemination of the public debt
data, but monthly reporting of both types of data to STA for publication in IFS. The latest
data reported to STA and published in the GFS Yearbook relate to the consolidated central
government for 2004. However, they do not cover all extra budgetary units within the central
government and classification problems remain, which require extensive use of adjustment
entries to current expenditure. Moreover, since 1996, detailed breakdowns of data on
budgetary and nonbudgetary transactions and central government debt have not been
provided. Madagascar does not report sub-annual data for publication in International
Finance Statistics (IFS).
Balance of payments
7.
The Central Bank of Madagascar (BCM) implemented in 1997 the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). However, the current compilation system is flawed,
external trade data are derived from customs data that suffer from inadequate coverage and
deficient recording procedures. Moreover, the significant amount of smuggling, particularly
in the mining sector, further reduces the reliability of the trade data. Because the customs
processing system has experienced numerous technical disruptions since 1998, trade data
require many manual corrections. The implementation of the ASYCUDA (Automated
System for Customs Data, Version 2.7) was largely completed by mid-2002, with the system
installed in most customs offices. The five largest customs offices have been upgraded to the
most recent version of ASYCUDA at end-2006.
8.
The 2004 multisector technical assistance mission reviewed progress in the transition
to BPM5 and found that the authorities had implemented foreign direct investment enterprise
surveys and are using an upgraded international transactions reporting system (ITRS). The
mission noted that the compilation system is still hampered by such recurring issues as
excessive processing lags due to partial automation of customs reports and inadequate
coverage of, for example, transactions for the private sector, NGOs, and foreign embassies.

16
Also, debt relief obtained from multilateral financial institutions is still misclassified as a
current transfer rather than as a capital transfer.
9.
The EPZs that process goods and reexport them to a third economy are not properly
identified within other business services (merchanting and other trade related services).
10.
Although ASYCUDA and port authorities can provide separate data for freight,
insurance and other categories, the current 12 percent c.i.f./f.o.b. correction for balance of
payments statistics is entirely attributed to freight. Data for the services and income accounts
rely excessively on the ITRS reports, and their accuracy is not routinely assessed against
other readily available data.
11.
As noted by previous STA missions, INSTAT and the BCM continue to use different
techniques to adjust customs data and publish two distinct series of trade statistics, bringing
into question the reliability of the balance of payments statistics.
12.
The compilation of external debt statistics is generally satisfactory, and the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) is installing the latest version of
the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System (DMFAS). This system is not yet fully
operational; some data entry is still to be done, and certain DMFAS modules have yet to be
installed.
Monetary and financial statistics
13.
The 2004 multisector mission found that prior TA advice had not been implemented,
most notably: i) improvement of the staff and computer resources of the unit in charge of
compiling monetary statistics; (ii) electronic transmission of monthly call report forms by the
commercial banks to the BCM; and (iii) expansion of the broad money survey to include the
microfinance institutions that issue liabilities that meet the national definition of broad
money. It recommended further improvements to the source data and the compilation of
monetary statistics in accordance with the Fund’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual
(MFSM) methodology.
14.
Since August 2001, the BCM has reported monetary data to STA for publication in
IFS. Data for the monetary authorities and deposit money banks through February 2007 have
been published in the May 2007 IFS release.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
June 25, 2007

1.
This statement summarizes economic developments since the issuance of the
Article IV consultation staff report. These developments do not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
Overall inflation declined to 11.6 percent (year-on-year) in May after having peaked
at 14.5 percent in March owing to the impact on food prices of the cyclones and floods that
occurred earlier in the year. Non-food inflation continued on its downward trend, falling to
8.1 percent.
3.
The nominal exchange rate (in SDRs) appreciated by a further 6 percent in April, and
the central bank intervened in the interbank foreign exchange market in order to avoid a
possible overshooting of the exchange rate. Reserve money rose by 19.2 percent (year-onyear) in April and broad money by 22.3 percent on account of the central bank interventions.
Gross official foreign exchange reserves rose to about 3.3 months of imports at end-April.
Since early May, the exchange rate has remained broadly stable.
4.
Despite the continued appreciation, the trade balance was stronger than projected in
the first quarter owing to better-than-expected export performance by textile export
processing zone companies. Domestic tax revenue performance at end-April was on track,
but custom receipts in local currency terms were lower than expected due to the appreciation
of the ariary and low non-mining project related imports. Net domestic financing of the
budget at end-March 2007 was some MGA 20 billion (0.1 percent of GDP) lower than
projected in the staff report as execution of domestically financed capital expenditure was
slow.
5.
The average yield on treasury bills fell to 8.2 percent in early June from 18.2 percent
at the end of March, on account of excess liquidity, slow execution of the budget, and net
repayment of treasury bills with statutory central bank advances. Treasury bill real rates are
expected to return to positive levels in the coming months as budget implementation
accelerates and the central bank mops up the excess liquidity with its new open market
operation instrument.
6.
Progress in structural reforms has been mixed. As expected, the authorities approved
increases in electricity prices and in government transfers to finance rehabilitation related
investment in the national public utility company (JIRAMA). However, they submitted to
Parliament a draft law that expands tax incentives for Export Processing Zone (EPZ)
companies and makes the reintegration of EPZ companies into a simplified common
corporate income tax regime more difficult to accomplish. Staff are seeking further
clarification.

The authorities have communicated their consent to the Fund’s publication of the
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with the Republic
of Madagascar
On June, 25, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Madagascar.1
Background
Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The country has
suffered for decades from macroeconomic instability arising from political crises, vulnerability to
exogenous shocks, and poor macroeconomic management. Beginning in 2002, the government
embarked upon political and economic reforms aimed at stabilizing the economy. While there
has been some progress in the reduction of inflation, it remains in double digits. Tax revenue
(as a share of GDP) remains among the lowest in SSA. Under the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI), Madagascar received about US$2.3 billion (about 42 percent of GDP) in debt
relief from the IMF, the World Bank, and the African Development Bank, including flow relief of
about US$31 million in 2006 which have been used mainly to finance additional povertyreducing expenditures.
In 2006, economic growth has rebounded moderately, while inflation has declined. Growth was
stimulated by the startup of construction of a large mining project, sizeable investments in public
infrastructure, and strong performance in the telecommunication and financial sectors. Inflation
continued on its downward path in 2006 aided by tight monetary policy, low rice prices, a
decline in world oil prices during the second half of the year, and the recent appreciation of the
nominal exchange rate. In spite of some expenditure overruns owing to higher-than-projected
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as
expressed during the June 25, 2007 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

2
obligatory expenditures, the fiscal deficit was reduced in 2006 because of some improvement in
domestic revenue mobilization, an increase in grants, and tight control on discretionary
expenditure. The overall balance of payments shifted to a surplus owing to large foreign direct
investment inflows, strong export performance, and MDRI debt relief.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the increase in economic growth and the lowering of inflation in recent
years, reflecting the important progress being made in macroeconomic policy implementation
and structural reform. At the same time, Madagascar remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks,
institutional capacity constraints, and uncertainty regarding donor assistance. The recent large
foreign direct investment inflows into the mining sector indicate an important shift in the
structure of the economy that, if not appropriately managed, could affect competitiveness and
pose a macroeconomic challenge.
Against this background, Directors agreed that, in the period ahead, emphasis should be placed
on increasing tax revenues to provide resources for social and development needs,
strengthening public financial management, and improving transparency and the business
environment, to enhance the prospects for sustained growth and achieving the Millennium
Development Goals. They supported the authorities’ new poverty reduction strategy, the
Madagascar Action Plan (MAP), which presents a framework for addressing the remaining
obstacles to growth and poverty reduction.
Directors called on the authorities to maintain a prudent fiscal stance and improve public
expenditure management and budget execution and control. They underscored the necessity of
keeping domestic financing of the budget low so as not to crowd out credit to the private sector
and place pressure on domestic interest rates. Efforts to increase domestic revenues should be
intensified, including by broadening the tax base and implementing the tax policy and revenue
administration reforms. Future budget submissions should include contingency plans for
spending reduction to address possible revenue shortfalls. They also saw the need for a timely
civil service pension reform.
Directors welcomed the recent recapitalization of the central bank. They called for further efforts
to reduce the central bank’s operating costs and improve its internal controls and financial
reporting. They encouraged the authorities to continue pursuing a monetary policy aimed at
increasing foreign reserves and achieving single-digit inflation. The recent creation of a new
monetary policy instrument for open market operations should help improve liquidity
management. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to develop and implement a
financial sector strategy, including expansion of microfinance institutions, with a view to
increasing the sector’s contribution to economic development.
Directors agreed that the existing exchange rate regime of a managed float with no
predetermined path for the exchange rate remains appropriate, as it has allowed the exchange
rate to move in line with macroeconomic fundamentals. At the same time, they saw some scope
for central bank intervention in the interbank foreign exchange market, if needed to avoid an

3
overshooting of the exchange rate. They recommended that capital account liberalization be
sequenced carefully with efforts to strengthen banking supervision and prudential regulations.
Directors considered that the recent trend of exchange rate appreciation underscores the need
for structural reforms and improved governance to maintain competitiveness and promote
private sector development. High priority should be given to reforming the electricity sector and
alleviating the financial problems of the national public utility company, in order to ensure the
reliable provision of electricity. Trade liberalization on a most-favored-nation basis should
continue to be pursued. Directors supported the authorities’ intention to adhere to the principles
of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
Directors observed that debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and
Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiative has set Madagascar’s external debt on a broadly
sustainable basis. To preserve this progress, future borrowing should be limited to concessional
terms, and the authorities should choose large investment projects carefully. Directors also
recommended that the authorities scale their spending plans in the context of the MAP to
conservative assumptions about the availability of donor assistance, until the timing of donor
disbursements comes clearly into view.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ initiative to publish the statistical appendix on the
government’s official website. They encouraged them to continue to work to improve the quality
and timeliness of data for surveillance.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director
for Republic of Madagascar
June 25, 2007

1. My authorities would like thank staff for the fruitful discussions and constructive policy
advice during the recent Article IV consultation mission and for the continuous support.
2. Madagascar’s growth momentum is picking up while inflation is steadily declining. The
authorities are making progress in their efforts to stabilizing the economy and reaching
higher and more sustainable levels of growth to address widespread poverty and raise the
population’s living standards. They remain focused on the implementation of their
poverty reduction strategy, the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP), and the reforms
schedules under the PRGF-supported program.
3. My authorities are grateful to the international community’s financial support and for the
debt relief provided under the MDRI that will enable them to continue to allocate
important resources to the fight against poverty. They welcome the findings of the recent
debt sustainability analysis that indicates that “even under the most extreme stress cases,
the [NPV of debt-to-exports] ratio would remain far below the 150 percent threshold
from 2010 onward”. They would like to reiterate their commitment to a prudent
borrowing strategy.
4. However, substantial additional resources both internal –through a much-needed increase
in fiscal revenues mobilization–, and external –through higher foreign aid– will be
needed to accelerate progress towards meeting the MDGs and to reach their ambitious
development objectives set out in the MAP. Nonetheless, until the resources needed have
been identified and secured they will keep a cautious and gradual approach in
implementing their development strategy. In particular, they will continue to implement
prudent fiscal and monetary policies and a sound management of the economy overall
within the current PRGF-supported program. They will also continue to improve the
business climate and further develop their infrastructures notably in the electricity sector
to address potential growth bottlenecks. Efforts to broaden the exports base and to open
up new regional markets through trade integration will help them address other major
challenges, including the vulnerability to weather-related shocks that have recently
severely affected agricultural output and food prices in a country where the primary
sector represents one third of GDP and employs 80 percent of the population.
I. Recent Economic Developments and the Medium-Term Outlook
5. In 2006, the economy grew strongly reaching nearly 5 percent, driven by large
infrastructure projects undertaken by the government and, more importantly, by new

foreign direct investments in the mining sector. Inflation continued to decrease to slightly
less than 11 percent as a result in part of a tight monetary policy and the appreciation of
the ariary. The foreign exchange inflows associated with these large FDIs have also
contributed to an increase in the money supply, partly mopped up by the central bank to
meet the monetary targets under the program. These inflows have, in addition, led to a
substantial surplus of the overall balance of payments despite a large current account
deficit.
6. Large FDI-related foreign exchange inflows could, in the short-term, have an adverse
effect on the exchange rate and widen the current account deficit due the high import
content of these foreign direct investments. However, in the longer term, the momentary
impact of the large foreign exchange inflows are likely to be offset by the improvement
in the current account deficit once exports of the commodities start. Overall, the net
impact on competitiveness should be limited. Moreover, my authorities believe that their
prudent macroeconomic policies and their far-reaching structural reforms underway
along with the important investments in infrastructure will enhance the productivity of
the economy. This should help further alleviate the impact of a rise in the ariary on the
exports sector. Furthermore, they will continue to modernize and liberalize the foreign
exchange market to alleviate the pressure on the exchange rate. They also remain
committed to the current floating exchange rate regime and to restricting their
interventions in the foreign exchange market to only smoothing daily fluctuations.
II. Policies and Reforms
7. Fiscal Policy. Despite the recent revision of the 2007 budget due to measures that include
the recapitalization of the central bank following a recommendation of an MCM mission,
my authorities concurred with staff that these revisions will not alter their current prudent
fiscal stance. In particular, the increases in expenditures included in the revision will be
partly offset by reductions in initially programmed nonprioritary spending. Progress has
also been made in strengthening public expenditure management, especially in the areas
of budget preparation and execution with the implementation of the budget information
system (SIGFP). However, weaknesses remain in budget execution and the application of
the Procurement Code that the authorities will continue to address.
8. Raising fiscal revenues continues to be one of the main objectives of my authorities. To
this end, they have embarked on strengthening their capacity in fiscal and customs
administration. In particular, they are committed to the reform, as scheduled, of the Tax
and Customs Codes as part of the 2008 Finance Law, and addressing tax exonerations
and exemptions while broadening the tax base.
9. Monetary Policy. Average inflation reached 10.8 percent in 2006 down from 18.4 in
2005 due in part to the authorities’ monetary policy tightening. Despite a highly volatile

3
consumer price index resulting from weather-related supply shocks in the agricultural
sector, the authorities are determined to bring inflation down to single-digits by the end
of this year. To that end, they will continue to monitor closely the money supply and
domestic spending component of the FDI inflows in the mining sector. In monitoring
price stability, the authorities will also increasingly shift their focus from headline
inflation to core inflation in accordance with staff recommendation. This will be made
easier by the securitization of the government’s debt held by the central bank that will
enable the monetary authorities to conduct open market operations.
10. External Sector. Exports have been affected in the past couple of years by increased
competition from other low cost producing countries in products such as textiles with the
termination of the textiles quota in 2005 and a decline in the international prices of
certain agricultural commodities such as vanilla. However, exports are also becoming
more diversified and have increased as a share of GDP. In particular, the mining sector,
where large investments are being undertaken by foreign companies, is booming. My
authorities are determined to make further progress in improving the business climate and
will continue to diversify the exports base and attract investments in other sectors with
strong potential such as tourism and fishing.
11. Financial Sector. The soundness of the financial sector is improving as NPLs continue to
decline and capital adequacy ratios are strengthening. Furthermore, microfinance
institutions are expanding rapidly. The authorities view the financial sector as a crucial
vehicle for economic development and will continue to promote the key role it plays in
the expansion of the private sector. Despite the still limited financial intermediation –
Madagascar’s performance in this area also lags behind its Sub-Saharan African peers–,
the authorities are making progress in improving access to credit and enhancing
competition including with the recent granting of a new banking license. The authorities
are also making efforts to increase the monetization of the economy and reduce its still
high reliance on cash operations.
12. Regional Integration and Trade-Related Issues. Trade liberalization, both at the regional
and multilateral levels, is one of the cornerstone of the authorities’ policy agenda.
Although they are aware that the phasing out of tariffs on imports would in the short-term
adversely affect their already low fiscal revenue levels, they are convinced that in the
longer-term they would benefit largely from the opening of new markets and from
cheaper sources of imports, especially from South Africa within SADC.
13. Other Structural Reforms. Promoting the development of the private sector and
improving the country’s business climate will require the restructuring of the power
utility company JIRAMA, as recurrent electricity outages continue to hamper economic
activity. The authorities’ medium-term intention is to transfer the management of the
company to a private operator once JIRAMA becomes profitable. But prior to that, they

4
intend to phase in electricity tariffs and adopt an automatic pricing index formula in order
to address operational losses and their impact on the government’s budget.
