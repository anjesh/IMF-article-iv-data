EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The success of Nigeria’s reforms brings new policy challenges for preserving and
building on the reform gains. Economic performance has improved since the last Article IV
consultation and the immediate outlook is promising. Growth is high, inflation is in single
digits, and external and fiscal positions are strong. The recapitalized banking sector and newly
active financial markets are supporting private activity. These gains reflect implementation of
Nigeria’s reform program under the Policy Support Instrument while benefiting from
favorable agriculture conditions and high oil prices.
Macroeconomic absorptive capacity—and not oil market developments—should drive
government spending. In this regard, the national government’s fiscal strategy provides a
good road map. The road map can only be effective, however, if state-level budgets are
consistent with the strategy. State governments are pressuring to increase spending by
distributing oil savings to all levels of government in line with constitutional shares. These oil
savings reflect the success of the oil-price-based fiscal rule in containing spending to levels
consistent with macroeconomic stability. This rule was central to the turnaround in economic
performance and without a comparable policy anchor in the future, the gains made are at risk.
The monetary and financial stability challenges of the burgeoning financial sector need
to be met. Nigeria is integrating rapidly into global financial markets, including through a
fivefold increase in government securities trading and a fourfold increase in stock market
capitalization since 2005. An important growth dividend is now within reach. At the same
time, the challenge for monetary policy and of preserving financial stability will only intensify.
Bank supervision will need to be strengthened further to reflect these developments.
The private sector is benefiting from reforms but much more needs to be done. The
consolidated banking sector is playing an important role in supporting growth. Liberalizing the
communications sector and privatization has paid off. Yet, these gains underscore the need to
address other bottlenecks in the business environment, particularly infrastructure. Fiscal space
within the government’s fiscal strategy is adequate to make meaningful progress in addressing
this infrastructure gap.
The balance of payments outlook is consistent with external stability. The current account
is expected to be in moderate surplus in the medium term, reflecting a balance between
Nigeria’s status as an oil producer and a low-income country. External vulnerabilities are
much reduced owing to the substantive reduction of external debt.
The authorities’ macroeconomic policy priorities are centered on meeting the challenges
brought about by the success of the reform program. The authorities recognize that
managing oil savings and revenues consistent with macroeconomic stability and in line with
the constitution is essential. Beyond this, they propose to develop a medium-term economic
strategy that reflects the policy challenges in providing an enabling environment for private
sector activity. They are considering how the Fund might support these efforts.

4
I. DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK1
Nigeria’s economic performance has been strong since the 2005 Article IV discussions
(Figure 1), and the immediate outlook is favorable.
1.
Economic growth has been strong and prospects are good. Non-oil sector growth
is expected to stay robust at about 9 percent. Public and private demand has contributed, with
the latter supported by credit growth. Risks relate to the large share of agriculture that is
weather dependent. In the oil and gas sector, growth is constrained by unrest in the Niger
Delta, but will benefit from the recently completed West African gas pipeline. In the medium
term, the authorities anticipate a 50 percent increase in oil production from current levels.
Box 1 describes revisions to the national accounts.

2.
Fiscal spending has been contained during the oil boom to manage demand
pressures. Unlike in past oil booms, domestic demand was contained by an oil-price-based
fiscal rule and by directing revenue windfalls to an oil savings account at the central bank.
Execution of the 2007 budget was mostly as projected at the fourth review of the Policy
Support Instrument (PSI). The government’s medium-term fiscal strategy is consistent with
macroeconomic objectives.
3.
The central bank met its inflation target. Liquidity mop up, effective appreciation
of the naira (including through unification of the foreign exchange market), a pick up in
money demand, and easing food prices helped bring inflation to about 5 ½ percent on
average at end-2007. Core inflation, while more variable, is also in single digits. Keeping
headline inflation in single digits remains the policy goal. Supply-side developments—
particularly in agriculture—will impact the headline rate.

1

Discussions were held November 7–20, 2007. The staff team comprised Mr. Nellor (Head), Ms. Roehler, and
Mr. Steinberg (all AFR), Mr. Kelmanson (PDR), Mr. Ramírez (FAD), and Mr. Swaray (MCM). Mr. Bell
(senior resident representative) and Ms. Nnaji, of the resident representative office, participated.

5
4.
Challenges in meeting monetary targets are being addressed. The reserve money
program was difficult to implement owing to the large infusion of oil revenues and to weak
and delayed data. Moreover, available operational instruments were limited. These issues are
being addressed, and implementation has improved considerably through a Monetary Policy
Implementation Committee. To improve the operation of the short-term interbank market, the
central bank is using a standing facility and a daily two-way quote in the market.
5.
Fiscal and external sustainability have improved. Oil proceeds were used to build
savings and repay most external debt. This was complemented by Paris Club debt relief.
External reserves increased steeply, boosting both investor confidence and Nigeria’s
sovereign ratings, giving the private sector greater access to international financial markets.
6.
Integration into global financial markets, developments in domestic markets,
and improved fundamentals have resulted in a growing financial sector. Much improved
domestic fundamentals, global liquidity conditions, and investors’ search for yield have
drawn investor flows. In addition, remittances have risen as investment opportunities have
opened up. The banking sector has taken advantage of investor interest to build further on the
increase in capital that was achieved when the 89 banks in the sector were consolidated into
25 banks by end-2005.
7.
The authorities’ policy program, supported by the PSI, was in accord with the
Board’s conclusions at the 2005 Article IV consultation. 2 Directors encouraged the
authorities to continue efforts to stabilize the economy; improve public expenditure
management, including through passage of fiscal responsibility legislation; restructure and
better capitalize the banking system; unify the foreign exchange market; and pursue
structural reforms that would improve government operations and the business environment.
Significant progress has been made in these areas.
Box 1. Revised National Accounts
Nigeria published revised national accounts in October 2007 (Table 6). A revised series,
for 1981–2006, was made possible by new surveys that resulted in a significant upward
revision of nominal non-oil GDP and some revisions to real growth estimates. Nominal GDP
in 2006 is 26 percent higher than in the old series (Table 7). This means that compared with
previous staff reports, ratios of economic variables, such as fiscal balances to non-oil GDP,
are much lower. The share of the oil sector in 2006 GDP declines from 48 to 37 percent.
Efforts to strengthen national accounts statistics are ongoing. The compilation
methodologies for sector data, including natural gas and agriculture, and the deflator are
being reviewed owing to weaknesses in these areas (see Annex III). The IMF and others are
providing technical assistance.

2

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 18, 2005 (IMF Country Report No. 05/302). A
PSI was approved on October 17, 2005 and expired on October 16, 2007. Developments from mid-2005 to
mid-2007—the period covered by the PSI—were reviewed in detail at the fourth review under the PSI
(IMF Country Report No. 07/353).

II. MANAGING OIL REVENUE: DEVELOPING KEY FISCAL INSTITUTIONS
The success of past fiscal policy, which resulted in mounting oil savings, and continued high
oil prices have resulted in pressures by state governments to spend more. Agreement on the
use of oil revenues by all tiers of government must be reached to avoid spending that goes
beyond what the economy can absorb and to preserve macroeconomic stability.
8.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy 2008–10 (MTFS) is a road map for
preserving macroeconomic stability. The consolidated government non-oil primary fiscal
deficit, projected to stay at about 25 percent of non-oil GDP, in line with recent years, is
consistent with macroeconomic stability. The implementation of these deficit targets is
supported by an oil-price-based fiscal rule (see Box 2). This oil-price-based fiscal rule is
enshrined in the recently approved Fiscal Responsibility Act as a framework to guide budget
allocations. The MTFS assumes oil revenues are distributed based on a budget oil price of
about $55 per barrel. The overall fiscal position is expected to stay in surplus.3

9.
The federal government’s budget for 2008 is consistent with the MTFS. The
consolidated government non-oil primary deficit, based on a budget oil price of $53.83 per
barrel, is projected to be about 22 percent of non-oil GDP. For purposes of the
macroeconomic framework, a higher deficit, consistent with macroeconomic stability, of
25 percent of non-oil GDP is used. This larger deficit could allow for the resumption of large
infrastructure projects that were put on hold for review by the incoming government, capital
outlays from the 2007 budget that could carry over into 2008, or allocations of oil savings to
reimburse states that contributed to the Paris Club debt buyback in excess of their own
obligations.
3

At current extraction rates proven and probable oil and gas reserves would last more than 50 years, and
possible reserves well above 100 years. Reflecting these levels of resources, a fiscal path in line with the MTFS
is sustainable, as is also evident in the debt sustainability analysis (see footnote 4), and means the policy focus
is on the macroeconomic stability implications of the spending of oil revenues.

8
10.
The immediate challenge in implementing the MTFS is to manage pressures to
spend oil savings. State governments are reasserting their constitutional right to receive oil
savings and revenues (Box 2). Oil receipts are a shared revenue source and, in recent years,
oil revenue distributions were based on a budget oil price, with oil revenues above budgeted
amounts saved. This oil-price-based fiscal rule delinked fiscal spending at all tiers of
government from oil revenue fluctuations. The rule was instrumental in keeping spending in
line with absorptive capacity and improving macroeconomic stability.
Box 2. Oil Revenues and the Constitution
The constitution provides that all tiers of government – federal, state, and local - share
in oil revenues. All oil revenue inflows (as well as certain taxes) are received into the
Federation Account. The revenue sharing formulas are set by an act of the National
Assembly, based on a recommendation from the Revenue Mobilization, Allocation and
Fiscal Commission. For natural resource revenues, the constitution provides that oilproducing states receive 13 percent upfront as derivation grants. Of the remaining 87 percent,
the federal government receives 52.7 percent, states 26.7 percent, and local governments
20.6 percent.
The oil-price-based fiscal rule in place since 2004 was based on political agreement. The
agreement provided for an allocation of oil revenues, according to the above shares, based on
a budget oil price and volume of production. Oil revenues in excess of the budget oil price
and production level are transferred into the “excess crude account” at the central bank in the
names of the various government entities. It was planned that the recently signed Fiscal
Responsibility Act would institutionalize this voluntary use of the oil-price-based fiscal rule.
The view of many legal observers is that a federal Fiscal Responsibility Act cannot bind
other levels of government. The act prescribes procedures for setting a macroeconomic and
medium term expenditure framework for the federation. However, most of the provisions are
legally binding only on the federal government while encouraging states to adhere to the
same framework. In September 2007, a political agreement was reached under which all
states would pass fiscal responsibility legislation. Such legislation could provide the
foundation for better fiscal coordination; the specific mechanisms for harmonizing fiscal
plans between different government entities have to be defined.

11.
Sizable domestic spending from oil savings would likely result in macroeconomic
instability. If some part of oil savings, estimated to total about $17 billion (16 percent of
non- oil GDP) at end 2007, were distributed, it is likely that state and local governments
would spend the additional resources. The federal government would be expected to adhere
to budgeted expenditures and save the distribution. Overall, depending on the scale of the
savings distributed and the amount spent domestically, the consequences of the implied fiscal
shock could be considerable. Following an immediate stimulus to growth, the spending
would likely destabilize the economy. The implications of additional state government

9
spending from a partial distribution of savings under one hypothetical example are shown in
Box 3.
Box 3. Impact of Higher State Spending
The impact of a hypothetical increase in state spending, resulting in a higher fiscal deficit of
5 percentage points of non-oil GDP in each year in 2008–10, is estimated using a simple
structural model of the Nigerian economy (see accompanying selected issues paper). The
additional spending would likely exceed the absorptive capacity of the economy if it is spent
domestically.
As shown below, after initially accelerating, growth would slow sharply as the central bank
raised interest rates to keep inflation in single digits. (Alternatively, inflation would rise
steeply.) Higher interest rates would, in turn, squeeze credit and dampen private sector activity,
causing the naira to appreciate. The loss of competitiveness would further constrain the private
sector. Knock-on effects on the financial sector would be likely, as demand for credit declines
and financial profits flag. Lower bank earnings would increase already high price-to-earnings
ratios and leading investors to pull out of the stock market.

The authorities, recognizing that the oil-price-based fiscal rule has improved
economic outturns, are seeking ways to manage oil savings consistent with
macroeconomic stability. They hope to reach a long-lasting consensus that respects the
constitutional rights of each tier of government. Apart from agreeing that states would pass
their own fiscal responsibility legislation, the federal government is proposing mechanisms
that would limit the harmful consequences of any allocation of oil savings by (i) distributing
only a small share of oil savings, (ii) encouraging state and local governments to adopt
savings funds, and (iii) suggesting that states participate in infrastructure projects with high
import content to minimize domestic demand pressures from new spending.

10
III. MONETARY AND FINANCIAL STABILITY: CHALLENGES OF GLOBAL INTEGRATION
Nigeria is integrating rapidly into global financial markets and could see a tremendous
growth dividend. At the same time, the challenge of managing monetary policy and
preserving financial stability will intensify as capital flows increase, new financial
instruments are introduced, and commercial bank trading capacity expands. The central
bank faces policy challenges increasingly like those faced by emerging markets.
13.
Private sector interest in naira assets has risen reflecting improved
macroeconomic conditions, reduced external vulnerability, and favorable global
conditions.
•

Macroeconomic conditions. Improved growth and inflation performance, along with
high world oil prices, has boosted domestic and foreign confidence in Nigeria’s
economic prospects and led investors to anticipate a strengthening naira. Foreign
interest in a second-round increase of capital at Nigerian banks has already exceeded
$11 billion and is just one indicator of this interest (Figure 2).

•

External vulnerabilities. External debt fell considerably after Paris Club debt relief,
triggering investor interest. External reserves have continued to mount. As a result, as
shown in the staff’s debt sustainability analysis, Nigeria’s debt outlook appears robust
under the baseline scenario and standardized stress tests.4

•

Global conditions. Strong global liquidity and search for yield have fueled investor
interest in naira assets. Recent financial market turbulence in developed markets since
mid-2007 has not measurably stemmed such interest as evident, for example, in the
pick up in government securities trading in the third quarter of 2007 and ongoing
foreign interest in the banking sector (Figure 2).

4

The updated debt sustainability analysis (see Appendix I) concludes that Nigeria has a low risk of debt
distress. In the baseline scenario, and in the case of the standardized stress tests, Nigeria’s debt outlook remains
robust, while offsetting policy measures would be required in the medium term to keep debt sustainable in the
event of a prolonged oil price shock or sustained higher non-oil primary deficit. The authorities own DSA,
based also on the low-income country template, reaches similar conclusions. Informed by their own DSA, the
authorities are in the process of finalizing a comprehensive debt management framework.

Banks are pursuing activities motivated in part by the need to generate returns
on their much increased capital base. The return on equity is now about half its rate since
consolidation, and is well below that in comparator countries. Banks are seeking to enhance
returns by:
•

Expanding credit to the private sector. Private sector credit has doubled since
banks consolidated two years ago. With higher bank capital, Nigerian banks have
been able to participate in the oil and gas sector; banks are also active in
communications and are exploring infrastructure financing. Retail credit has begun to
expand, with banks identifying customers through corporate relationships.

12
•

Increasing treasury activity. Banks are expanding their treasury capacity and the
related range of products. Larger banks are importing staff to develop products
offered in other emerging markets. The interbank foreign exchange market is
operating effectively and, for the first time, is offering forward positions in the naira.
Large banks are the main conduit for foreign investor activity in the domestic
securities market—both physical securities as well as derivatives.

•

Pursuing cross-border and cross-sector activities. Universal banking groups have
emerged, with more than half the banks having insurance and securities subsidiaries.
As part of a regional expansion, about half the banks have set up cross-border
operations that, while small, are growing rapidly. Operations have been established in
many countries including in South Africa, Ghana, The Gambia, Sierra Leone, the
United Kingdom, and the United States.

15.
Changes in the banking sector underscore the need to strengthen the regulatory
framework and supervision. The central bank has developed a legal, regulatory, and
operational framework for risk-based and consolidated supervision. It has also increased
information sharing and coordination among the domestic supervisors of the various sectors
and coordination with foreign supervisors. The challenge for the central bank is to implement
these frameworks. The Fund is providing technical assistance in this area. The central bank
will also need to build human capacity to understand the complex new instruments being
transplanted from emerging markets.
16.
The banking system is largely robust but needs careful monitoring (Table 4).
Bank restructuring has increased capital and enabled a significant share of nonperforming
loans to be written off. Standard stress tests suggest the banking sector is resilient to most
quantifiable shocks (Box 4). However, shocks have been calibrated only for standard
scenarios, where the asset allocation is constant and banks reduce their capital base. Given
the sector’s large capital base, it is not surprising that bank solvency remains resilient. There
is a need to monitor links between macroeconomic developments and the financial sector,
including for example, the impact of a change in market sentiment on bank valuations and
knock-on effects to general banking activities.

13
Box 4. Banking System Stability
Recent bank consolidation has strengthened the sector (see accompanying selected issues
paper). Most banks are well capitalized, liquid, and profitable; the capital adequacy ratio, at
18.6 percent, is well above the minimum regulatory requirement of 10 percent; holding of
liquid assets is a robust 62.2 percent; and loan portfolio quality has improved. Overall
provisioning levels are high, although they have dipped recently as nonperforming loans have
fallen.
Banks are resilient to most quantifiable shocks that could harm loan portfolios according
to stress tests. A credit risk shock, the largest quantifiable risk facing banks, is manageable:
only a small number of banks accounting for less than 25 percent of assets would be
undercapitalized if nonperforming loans doubled, and only a very limited number of small
banks, accounting for less than 5 percent of system assets, would become insolvent. Direct
foreign exchange risk is small and any exposure is within the net open position limits set by the
central bank. Interest rate risk is also minimal since banks are heavily capitalized.

The situation still bears close monitoring, especially in light of rapid credit growth and
structural changes in the banking system. Encouragingly, part of the credit growth reflects
the new access of the domestic banking sector to well-secured lending activities in the oil
sector, but circumstances vary across banks. Older, well-established banks and newergeneration banks that significantly increased their capital as the sector consolidated are faring
best. Banks formed by multiple mergers have faced more integration challenges. This and the
pressure to rapidly deploy capital to boost returns in new domestic and cross-border activities
underscores the importance of vigilant risk-oriented supervision.

17.
Rapidly changing financial markets along with greater global integration have
led the authorities to consider adopting inflation targeting. On the external side, there has
been a pickup in various forms of capital flows. On the domestic side, despite improvements in
monetary policy, developments in the banking sector and unification of the exchange rate in
2006 have made it more difficult to set monetary aggregate targets. The central bank believes
that an inflation targeting regime might be more effective in this environment where money
demand is less stable (Box 5).

14
18.
The authorities recognize that several challenges need to be addressed before
inflation targeting can be implemented. The 2007 Central Bank of Nigeria Act made the
central bank more independent. A credible mechanism for setting the inflation target
(including possibly by the government) will be needed, as well as a strong internal and
external communication policy. The large liquidity injections from oil-financed fiscal spending
will continue to be a challenge, but fiscal policy in recent years has been more predictable.
Box 5. Developments in Money Demand
In addition to increased confidence in the banking system, staff analysis suggests that three factors
have made money a more attractive asset. First, unification of the exchange rate reduced the return
on holding foreign exchange cash; there was no longer a profit to be made from conducting foreign
exchange transactions outside of the official banking sector. Second, the decline in inflation reduced
the return on holding durable goods as assets. Finally, treasury bill rates fell to levels below rates
paid on time deposits of similar maturity, making deposits the more attractive asset.
Looking forward, several factors will impact monetary management. The emerging financial sector
will not only facilitate further financial deepening, but may increase the length of the transmission
lags to inflation from money. Increasing global capital flows could increase the volatility in money
demand.

19.
The central bank needs to improve its understanding of inflation dynamics and
the monetary transmission mechanism. The link between the central bank’s policy interest
rate and bank’s lending and savings rates needs to be strengthened. Staff discussed a basic
structural model with the central bank, and provided some input on nonstructural time-series
models of inflation. The central bank will also need to build its understanding of market
expectations of inflation and improve its measure of core inflation.
20.
The central bank was in agreement on the challenges of adopting inflation
targeting. It recognized that adopting the new regime in 2009 was ambitious and will adjust
its timeline as needed. Meanwhile, it plans to build on training and seminars already conducted
and to address relevant issues with Fund technical assistance.
21.
Monetary aggregates will remain the anchor of monetary policy, as the central
bank transitions to an inflation-targeting regime. The targeted growth rate in broad money
reflects projected developments in nominal non-oil GDP and the expected impact of further
financial deepening on money demand. Inflation is expected to move toward the targeted level
as the positive supply impact of good weather diminishes, and supply constraints could emerge
due to strong growth.

15
22.
Mounting interest in naira assets and the related strengthening of the interbank
foreign exchange market have increased exchange rate flexibility; this can help put
monetary objectives in reach. The foreign exchange market has increasingly been driven by
the interbank market on account of a rapid growth in supply of foreign exchange from sources
other than the central bank. These other sources include portfolio inflows, instruments to
finance bank capital, remittances, and involvement of the national oil company. After being
relatively stable for an extended period, the naira has appreciated by about 5 percent against
the dollar in the last quarter of 2007 (Figure 3).
23.
The central bank welcomes the increased role of the interbank foreign exchange
market. It expects the interbank market to become the main determinant of the exchange rate.
The greater importance of private capital flows underscores the need to maintain sound
macroeconomic policy, pursue exchange rate management practices that ensure investors face
two-way risk, and monitor the banking sector because it will be the main conduit for these
flows. Recent developments in the exchange rate are consistent with the classification of the
rate as a managed float without a pre-determined path.

The balance of payments outlook is consistent with external stability (Box 6). The
current account is expected to be in moderate surplus in the medium term. By some measures,
the real exchange rate was somewhat undervalued at end 2006 relative to various estimates of
its equilibrium. The central bank did not dispute the possibility of an undervaluation, but
doubted the validity of quantitative estimates, citing data quality and structural changes in the
economy. More generally, the central bank identified the risks of too rapid an appreciation of
the naira and overshooting as possibly negatively impacting the non-oil sector. In this context,
it is likely that nonprice factors dominate any overall measure of competitiveness (see
Section IV).

16
Box 6. Assessing External Stability
The balance of payments outlook is consistent with external stability. The current account
surplus is expected to moderate, averaging 1 to 3 percent of GDP over the medium term, as both
public and private investment boost imports. This reflects Nigeria’s status as an oil-producing, lowincome country. Nigeria, as an oil producer, would appropriately have a current account surplus
during a period of high oil prices; but as a low-income country, it should use foreign savings.
Estimates show the naira as both over- and undervalued. On balance, staff concludes the naira may
have been somewhat undervalued at end-2006. Data limitations and multiple structural breaks
complicate the analysis. Some approaches to assessing the value of the naira are summarized below.
Equilibrium real effective exchange rate (REER). There is a strong long-term relationship between
the REER and real oil prices. Estimates for 1974–2006 suggest that the equilibrium exchange rate
appreciated steadily in recent years as oil prices surged. Since 2000 movements in the real effective
exchange rate have been more moderate. By this approach, the naira was undervalued by about
19 percent at end-2006.
Macro balance. Estimating a “current account norm” is complicated by Nigeria’s status as both an
oil producer and a low-income country. A current account norm of 7 percent of GDP was derived
using the CGER coefficients; this result is in line with that found for other oil producers. With this
current account norm, the naira is overvalued by around 15 percent. However, a current account
deficit could be appropriate in light of Nigeria’s low-income status. Balancing these two
considerations (averaging the ‘oil’ norm with an assumed ‘low-income’ norm of a 2 percent deficit),
a current account norm of a 2.5 percent of GDP surplus was used. This analysis suggests the naira is
undervalued by about 2 percent.
External sustainability. Like the current account norm, estimating the appropriate level of net
foreign assets is complicated by Nigeria’s status as an oil producer and a low-income country. As
such, various target levels of net foreign assets ranging from the current 14 percent of GDP to
100 percent of GDP were considered. On this basis, and netting-off from the trade balance outflows
to the international oil companies, the naira was estimated to be in the range of overvalued by
14 percent to undervalued by 3 percent.

17
IV. GROWTH: POLICY PRIORITIES
The private sector is benefiting from reform but much more needs to be done. Measures such
as liberalizing the communications sector and privatization have paid off. Yet, these gains
have underscored the need to address other bottlenecks in the business environment,
particularly infrastructure. In this context, the MTFS provides an adequate spending
envelope to make meaningful progress in addressing the infrastructure gap. Identifying the
role of the private sector, prioritizing outlays, and strengthening public financial
management are priorities.

The MTFS provides adequate fiscal space for beginning to address
infrastructure and other goals. The expansion of resources for priority spending between
2004 and 2007—federal government capital and priority project spending increased
300 percent—within a prudent fiscal framework demonstrates the scale of resources
available. The immediate policy priority rests with ensuring value for money from these
already higher spending levels.

There is scope to increase fiscal space within the MTFS envelope.

•

Identify areas where the government may not need to be involved. The
privatization program has transferred commercial operations to the private sector,
reduced subsidies and enhanced efficiency. The port concessioning, for example, has
greatly improved port operations while underscoring bottlenecks elsewhere (e.g.,
infrastructure and customs) that

for PPPs to ensure appropriate risk allocation between parties and successful delivery
of value for money.
•

Clearly set government spending priorities and ensure that projects are
completed. Unfinished projects in the power and other sectors have absorbed fiscal
resources without generating benefits. Better prioritization, stronger sequencing, and
a commitment to complete projects would make spending more efficient. The
authorities have already focused 2008 capital budget resources on the completion of
ongoing projects, and plan to improve capital budgeting further for the 2009 budget.

•

Policies need to be costed explicitly to inform policy decisions and ensure
resources are directed to priority areas. If costs are fully estimated and transparent,
policy makers and the public could better assess the tradeoffs between alternative
uses of revenues. Examples where such transparency would better inform
policymaking include: recognizing the lower revenue transfers to government from
the national oil company resulting from the provision of subsidized petroleum
(1.3 percent of GDP in 2007); and, investment policies in the oil sector that address
development and social needs by providing low cost domestic gas and power.

•

Strengthen public financial management to improve value for money. Much has
been done at the national level, especially for public procurement, culminating in the
Public Procurement Act. Next steps include extending procurement reform to all
levels of government. Efforts to improve project selection based on consistent costbenefit analysis in the context of a solid investment planning framework should have
high pay-offs. Operationalizing the budgeting and reporting aspects of the Fiscal
Responsibility Act, including timely budget execution reports, will support decision
making and budget monitoring.

•

28.
The financial sector will play an important role in supporting private sector
activity. The financial sector has grown dramatically but remains shallow by international
measures, suggesting it has strong growth potential. Credit to the private sector and deposits
in the banking system have almost doubled in nominal terms since consolidation of the sector
beginning 2006. The number of bank branches increased by about one third in 2007 and the

20
product base is growing. Capital markets and the nonbank sector have also grown; in the
pension fund industry, assets under management were an estimated N 300 billion (US$2.5
billion) in mid-2007; another N 300 billion are expected to be added by end-2007. The
insurance sector is also undergoing a consolidation process similar to the banking sector.
29.
Still, further development of the financial sector is needed. Intermediation ratios
are still low: M2 to GDP is an estimated 21 percent and private sector credit to GDP an
estimated 19 percent (Figure 5). Capital and asset growth have yet to translate into funding
long-term productive investment and better access to finance for small- and medium-sized
enterprises. Key in this regard are structural reforms to bolster creditor rights, remove
impediments to secured (mortgage) lending, and strengthen disclosure and corporate
governance. A strategy is also needed for financing infrastructure development.

Translating growth into a widespread increase in living standards and poverty
reduction will continue to be a challenge. Poverty is estimated at about 55 percent based on
the 2004 household survey and development indicators are low (Table 8). Many households
are vulnerable to idiosyncratic shocks even when growth is high. Population growth and
urbanization are placing pressure on resources, social services, and local infrastructure.
Moreover, the quality of public services including primary health and education vary widely
across the country, not least because of uneven administrative capacity of the state and local
governments to which they have been devolved.
31.
The authorities are moving forward with targeted interventions under the
virtual poverty fund that are financed from debt relief resources. The virtual poverty
fund aims to provide seed funding, matching grants or funding for mainstreaming activities
in MDG priority areas. It is expected to be part of the budget framework until at least 2015,
even though no official commitment was made to Paris Club creditors. A first round of MDG

21
costings has been conducted with UN support. Further work is underway to align MDGfocused spending with an expenditure envelope consistent with macroeconomic stability,
clarify overlaps and gaps with other spending programs, and identify synergies.
V. ARTICLE VIII, GOVERNANCE, AND STATISTICAL ISSUES
32.
Much progress has been made in Nigeria’s foreign exchange system since the last
Article IV consultation. Foreign exchange is readily available, with demand being met
through the Wholesale Dutch Auction System (WDAS) and increasingly through the
interbank market. The Bureau de Change rate effectively converged with the official rate
since mid-2006, and a parallel exchange market has not re-emerged. Nigeria is not an Article
VIII member. As reported at the time of the last Article IV consultation, the multiple prices,
which are a technical characteristic of a Dutch Auction system, give rise to a multiple
currency practice (MCP), and staff does not recommend approval of this MCP.
33.
Efforts to strengthen economic governance are ongoing. The new government has
emphasized that “rule of law” will be its guiding principle in policy decisions and believes
that steps in this direction will lead to an improved business environment. The Economic and

fight against money laundering in mid-2006. The authorities are now working to implement
recommendations of the recent mutual evaluation conducted by the Inter-Governmental
Action Group Against Money Laundering in West Africa.
34.
Macroeconomic data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but weaknesses
remain. The authorities are continuing efforts to improve data quality in several areas
including to support the introduction of inflation targeting. Technical assistance from the
IMF and other partners is ongoing, particularly on national accounts, fiscal accounting,
monetary statistics, and the balance of payments (see Annex III).

22
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Nigeria has had strong growth, lower inflation, and much reduced external
vulnerability since the last Article IV consultation. This reflects implementation of the PSI
supported reform program as well as high oil prices and favorable agricultural conditions.
While much progress has been made in institutionalizing reforms, including through passage
of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, much more needs to be done to entrench reform gains.
Moreover, the challenges in reducing poverty are daunting.
36.
The immediate economic outlook is favorable. The prospects for growth, supported
by public and private demand, are promising. In the oil sector, an increase in production is
anticipated; however, further set backs in the Niger Delta are a downside risk. The non-oil
sector, particularly in services and agriculture, has been growing strongly and, subject to
weather conditions, is on course for further growth. The buoyant financial sector is providing
added impetus to growth. The strong naira helps put inflation targets within reach; weather
conditions are the main risk.
37.
The success of reforms has brought new challenges that will jeopardize gains if
not addressed. With the success of reforms, Nigeria’s financial wealth has increased, as
evidenced by its growing reserves and lower debt. Macroeconomic stability, the improved
growth outlook, and expectations of a strong naira have also buoyed interest in naira assets.
These developments have given rise to policy challenges that must be addressed if Nigeria is
to sustain and build on the gains made to date.
38.
The immediate challenge is to enshrine a fiscal institution that ensures fiscal
policy is consistent with macroeconomic stability. An oil-price-based fiscal rule has been
an effective device for securing prudent fiscal deficits by containing spending to levels
consistent with absorptive capacity. The oil savings that flowed from implementing this rule
were initially used to meet various external obligations, including the buyback element of the
Paris Club debt agreement. However, with high oil prices, these savings have continued to
grow and, according to the constitution, are to be shared by each tier of government. State
governments are now lobbying to receive their share of the savings and plan to spend these
resources. An agreement between all tiers of government must be reached on a fiscal
framework that ensures that any spending of oil savings and revenues is in accord with
macroeconomic stability.
39.
Nigeria’s integration into the global economy brings new challenges for ensuring
financial stability. Successful bank consolidation, along with improved macroeconomic
conditions, has transformed the financial sector. Accounting for about one third of subSaharan Africa GDP (excluding South Africa), Nigeria is attracting great interest from global
financial markets. The potential growth dividend, already evident in the form of increased
intermediation, requires ongoing financial stability. The central bank needs to redouble its
efforts to keep pace with the dramatic changes in the sector and to ensure that its supervisory
capacity is commensurate with growth and activities in the banking sector.

23
40.
Monetary policy has strengthened. The central bank has successfully brought
inflation to single digits, from more than 20 percent at the last Article IV consultation.
Nonetheless, monetary policy implementation has been difficult because of large swings in
liquidity, stemming from the injection of oil-related revenues, as well as limited policy
instruments and data weaknesses. Economic developments triggered by the reforms have
resulted in greater uncertainty regarding money demand. Against this background, the
authorities’ interest in considering an inflation targeting regime is understandable. Such a
regime, however, poses its own challenges, and staff welcomes the authorities’ view that,
while pursuing their ambitious timeline for its adoption, flexibility is important to ensure that
the right conditions are in place.
41.
The balance of payments outlook is consistent with external stability. To underpin
external stability, the staff welcomes efforts to finalize a comprehensive debt management
strategy and stresses the importance of a prudent approach to any new borrowing. The
outlook for a modest current account surplus is appropriate, reflecting a balance between
Nigeria’s status as a low-income country and as an oil producer. In the staff’s view, the level
of the naira is broadly consistent with external stability though may be somewhat
undervalued. The staff welcomes the increased flexibility of the exchange rate in recent
months; while enabling the exchange rate to find its equilibrium, this development should, in
the short term, help support Nigeria’s monetary objectives.
42.
Non-oil sector growth can only be sustained with supportive macroeconomic
policies and a resolution of the infrastructure gap. Successes of recent reforms are evident
and signs in key sectors like telecommunications, where a regulatory and enabling
framework has been put in place, are encouraging. The government’s spending envelope in
its MTFS is adequate to make meaningful progress in eliminating the infrastructure gap. In
fact, substantial increases in public capital spending have already taken place. The focus
should be on improving the effectiveness of public spending and establishing a policy
environment conducive to private sector activity.
43.
The outlook is positive as long as the reforms are sustained and extended. The
government is compiling a medium-term national framework, laying out its reform agenda

Appendix I. Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 2007 Under the
Debt Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries
1.
Exit from the Paris Club and subsequent London Club operations significantly reduced
Nigeria’s external debt burden. This, combined with a sustained period of high oil prices, along
with prudent fiscal policy stemming from the application of an oil- price based fiscal rule, have
transformed Nigeria’s debt outlook. This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) concludes that Nigeria
is at a low risk of debt distress (the same finding as in 2006). In the baseline scenario, and in the
case of the standardized stress tests, Nigeria’s debt outlook remains robust. However, a prolonged
oil price shock, or sustained higher (non-oil primary) deficits, would require compensating policy
measures in the medium-term to avoid debt sustainability problems.1
A.

The Baseline and Alternative Scenarios

2.

The baseline scenario for 2007–27 underlying this DSA assumes the following:

•

Average growth of 7.1 percent over the period reflecting buoyant growth of non-oil GDP of
around 7.8 percent and more modest growth of oil GDP of 3.0 percent.2

•

Monetary policy geared towards maintaining single-digit inflation.

•

In line with WEO projections, increasing oil prices in the short term, before falling back to
levels just above US$80 per barrel by 2012, and remaining constant in real terms thereafter. 5

•

A consolidated government non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) averaging around 24 percent of
non-oil GDP. This is consistent with the medium-term projections outlined in the
government’s medium-term fiscal strategy, and with the framework that underpinned
Nigeria’s previous Policy Support Instrument (PSI).6 Such a stance is also consistent with
the range of estimates derived from a permanent income hypothesis exercise. In addition, it

This DSA updates the analysis presented in the Country Report 07/20 and utilizes the updated Bank-Fund debt
template for low-income countries.

2

This DSA is based on new estimates for the GDP time series provided by the authorities in November 2007.
Compared to GDP estimates previously used by the IMF, 2006 nominal GDP is higher by 26.1 percent for overall GDP
and 57.7 percent for non-oil GDP. Based on the revised GDP series, historical averages for real growth over the
previous 10 years were 7.0 percent for overall GDP and 9.2 percent for non-oil GDP respectively.

The DSA is based on WEO oil price projections as of December 7, 2007

The government is assumed to resist pressures to loosen the current fiscal policy stance and establish a medium- and
long-term sustainable fiscal position. This implies large but declining overall surpluses until 2020. At that time, deficits
appear and are financed by previously accumulated financial assets.

37
remains in surplus over the medium term, before turning into deficit after 2020. Reserve
coverage is projected to average 25 months of imports over the projection period.
3.
Various standardized stress tests and country-specific alternative scenarios are also
examined (see Tables 1b and 2b, and Figures 1 and 2):
•

Standardized alternative scenarios and stress tests include holding key variables at their
historical averages, financing on less concessional terms, and various bound tests. The most
extreme bound tests hold export values and GDP at their historical averages minus one
standard deviation in 2008-09.

•

Country-specific alternative scenarios are designed to illustrate the impact on debt dynamics
of (i) a prolonged oil price shock (in light of Nigeria’s high dependency on oil,7 as well as
the high level of oil prices projected over the medium term), and (ii) a higher deficit
reflecting a prolonged period of elevated spending (in light of pressing infrastructure and
social needs). The oil price shock is calibrated as one standard deviation of Brent crude
prices over the 1970-2006 period. This reduces future oil prices by US$19 per barrel, such
that average prices are around US$61 per barrel.8 The higher deficit scenario holds the nonoil primary deficit of the consolidated government constant at just over 27 percent of non-oil
GDP over the projection period. These alternative scenarios start in 2008.

•

New debt placement assumptions. In the higher deficit scenario, it is assumed that the
authorities split the additional debt required to finance the deficit between domestic and
external issuance. However, in the oil shock scenario, in addition to financing the deficit, the
sharp balance of payments deterioration requires a greater share of external issuance to
ensure adequate reserve coverage (especially in the later years).
B.

External Sustainability9

4.
Following the final phase of Nigeria’s 2005 Paris Club Agreement in 2006, early repayment
of its par bonds in November 2006, and efforts to address related oil warrants in March 2007,
Nigeria’s external public debt is projected to total US$3.3 billion, or 2.0 percent of GDP, at end2007. In the baseline scenario (Table 1a and Figure 1), the nominal external debt burden is

7

In 2006, oil revenue accounted for 78 percent of the consolidated government’s revenue base and oil–related export
proceeds for over 95 percent of Nigeria’s export earnings.

8
9

The impact of a two standard deviation shock to oil prices is discussed in footnote 11.

The LIC debt sustainability framework (DSF) provides a methodology for assessing external debt sustainability which
is guided by indicative, country-specific, debt burden thresholds based on the relative strength of a country’s policies
and institutions. Given Nigeria’s rating of 3.07, which is the three year average of the World Bank’s Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA), the relevant country-specific thresholds are an NPV of debt to GDP of 30 percent, an
NPV of debt to exports of 100 percent, and a debt service to exports ratio of 15 percent.

38
projected to be broadly unchanged throughout the projection period.10 The debt-service to export
ratio falls from 1.9 percent in 2007 to an average of 0.3 percent throughout the projection period.
The grant element of Nigeria's external debt is projected to decline from over 50 percent, to around
30 percent by 2027, reflecting a shift towards less concessional borrowing (including Nigeria’s
graduation to IBRD financing). Hence, the net present value (NPV) of debt-to-GDP ratio would be
slightly lower than the nominal external-debt-to-GDP ratio, averaging under 2 percent over the
period.
5.
Standardized stress tests (Table 1b and Figure 1), even the most extreme, show that the NPV
of the debt-to-GDP ratio is not likely to exceed 16 percent of GDP over the projection period, with
debt service remaining below 5 percent of exports.
6.
However, the country-specific alternative scenarios (Table 1b and Figure 1), illustrate the
vulnerability of Nigeria’s public finances, and consequently, its external debt position.
•

In the case of the prolonged oil price shock scenario, Nigeria’s external debt ratio could
reach 37 percent of GDP (or 30 percent in NPV terms), and 166 percent of exports, by the
end of the projection period, while debt service payments would remain low at around
1 percent of exports. Furthermore, in the oil shock scenario, international reserves would
peak in 2009 (at over 17 months of imports), against 2019 in the baseline scenario (at around
32 months).

•

In the case of the higher deficit scenario, Nigeria’s external debt ratio could reach 13 percent
of GDP (or 9 percent in NPV terms), and 41 percent of exports, by the end of the projection
period, with debt service payments rising to around 1 percent of exports.

7.
Nevertheless, Nigeria’s robust starting position in terms of government deposits and
international reserves, would enable the authorities to avoid the accumulation of debt projected in
either scenario, if fiscal policies are adjusted in time. As such, prudent fiscal and external policies
would allow Nigeria to prevent the risks associated with either scenario from materializing.
C.

Fiscal Sustainability

8.
As a result of the application of a budget reference oil price fiscal rule, government deposits
at the central bank are projected to reach around US$23 billion at end-2007. In the baseline scenario
(Table 2a and Figure 2) consolidated government deposits continue to accumulate at the central
bank, reaching around US$240 billion by 2021. Subsequently, these deposits are assumed to be
drawn down gradually as oil revenues decline as a share of GDP, and the overall budget surplus
turns into deficit. In light of the accumulation of such significant levels of government deposits, and
10

Given Nigeria’s federal structure, sub-national borrowing is possible but is constrained by various regulations. While
at present such borrowing is limited, careful management and monitoring at the sub-national level will be crucial to
support future debt sustainability. In this regard, inclusion of a sub-national debt strategy in the national Debt
Management Framework is welcome.

39
the low level of gross debt,11 the fiscal debt sustainability exercise for Nigeria utilizes a concept of
net debt, defined as gross consolidated government debt (external and domestic) less gross
consolidated government assets (specifically, the balance in the excess crude account).12 As a result
of the inclusion of these government assets, net debt is projected to be negative throughout the
baseline scenario.
9.
As is the case with external sustainability, the fiscal sustainability baseline is relatively
robust to the standardized stress tests, with public sector net debt becoming positive only towards
the end of the projection period. Debt service is projected to average around 2 percent of revenues
over the projection period in the baseline, and peak at 31 percent, in the most extreme test (Table 2b
and Figure 2).
10.
However, as noted above, in the case of the country-specific alternative scenarios (Table 2b
and Figure 2), Nigeria’s fiscal position could weaken significantly in the absence of an appropriate
fiscal policy response.
(a)
In the case of the prolonged oil price shock scenario, government deposits at the
central bank would be exhausted around 2019, and external and domestic borrowing would
be needed to finance the deficit.13 As a result, Nigeria’s public debt to GDP ratio would
reach 46 percent, debt to revenue 258 percent, and debt service to revenues 10 percent in
NPV terms by the end of the projection period (Table 2b and Figure 2).
(b)
In the case of the higher deficit scenario, government deposits at the central bank
would be exhausted in 2026, just before the end of the projection period, after which
external and domestic borrowing would be needed to finance the deficit. As a result,
Nigeria’s public debt to GDP ratio would reach 12 percent, debt to revenue 58 percent, and
debt service to revenues 6 percent in NPV terms by the end of the projection period.
D.

Conclusion

11.
Nigeria is at a low risk of debt distress. In the baseline scenario, and in the case of the
standardized stress tests, Nigeria’s debt outlook remains relatively robust throughout the projection
period. However, either a prolonged oil price shock or a prolonged loosening of the non-oil primary
deficit—without compensating policy measures—would undermine the recent progress made in
achieving macroeconomic and debt sustainability. But given Nigeria’s strong financial starting
position, timely policy action should be able to avert future sustainability problems.
11

The NPV of the public sector’s gross debt burden would decline through the medium term, before rising towards the
end of the projection period.
12
13

For illustrative purposes, Figure 1 also traces the evolution of gross debt in the baseline scenario.

For illustrative purposes, assuming an oil price shock of two standard deviations—thereby reducing prices to around
US$43 per barrel in 2007 prices—and the current baseline fiscal deficit, government deposits at the central bank would
be exhausted by 2011.

Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3
Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4
Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5
Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6
Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

Nigeria’s exchange rate arrangement is classified as a managed float without a predetermined path for the exchange rate of the naira. On February 20, 2006, the CBN executed
its first auction under the new wholesale Dutch Auction System (DAS). The introduction of
the wholesale DAS with sales direct to interbank market participants was an important
step towards unification of the two major foreign exchange markets—the retail market for
nonfinancial traders and investors and the interbank market. The naira also continues to be
traded in two markets for small-scale cash transactions—the bureau de change market and
the curb market. Since May 2006 the exchange rate has effectively been unified. The
introduction of the wholesale DAS also represents an important step toward accepting the

48
obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3 and 4 of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, although
the multiple prices, which are a technical characteristic of a Dutch Auction system, give rise
to a multiple currency practice. A comprehensive assessment by MCM and LEG is needed to
identify the extent of remaining restrictions and multiple currency practices.
VIII. Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) was
subject to a full safeguards assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement, which
expired on October 31, 2001. The assessment, which included an on-site visit, was completed
on November 28, 2001. The assessment concluded that vulnerabilities existed in the areas of
financial reporting and legal structure of the Central Bank. Staff findings and proposed
recommendations are reported in the Country Report No. 03/3.

ANNEX II. NIGERIA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
Partnership for development
1.
The Nigerian government has been making progress with implementation of the
National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS), a program of
reforms aimed at achieving economic and social transformation in Nigeria. President
Yar’Adua’s 7-Point Agenda builds on the NEEDS and focuses on the following 7 areas of
priority: (i) ensuring sustainable growth in the real sector of the economy; (ii) building
physical infrastructure—power, energy and transportation; (iii) supporting agriculture;
(iv) enhancing human capital development—education and health; (v) strengthening security,
law and order; (vi) combating corruption; and (vii) developing the Niger Delta. These efforts
at the Federal level, working in parallel with state development plans, are continuing to
improve the environment for development assistance and strengthen the framework for aid
effectiveness.
2.
The World Bank assistance to Nigeria is based on a joint World Bank/DFID Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) prepared in consultation with government, civil society, private
sector and other development partners and approved by the British Government and the
Board of the World Bank on June 28, 2005. This strategy, which is guiding the assistance of
the Bank and UK’s DFID to Nigeria for the period FY06 to FY09, supports selected
priorities under the three broad pillars of the NEEDS/state development plans framework,
namely: (i) empowering people through improved service delivery for human development;
(ii) promoting private enterprise through improved business environment for non-oil growth
and improved access to productive infrastructure; and (iii) changing the way government
does its work through improved transparency and accountability.
3.
Under the CPS, both the World Bank and UK’s DFID are deepening engagement
with Nigeria, in response to the improved policy environment and the importance of Nigeria
for meeting the MDGs in Africa. More support is provided to states where constitutional
responsibility for most functions related to achievement of the MDGs lies. At the same time,
the Bank and DFID are more selective in approach, concentrating assistance at the Federal
level and in a set of lead states that are strongly committed to reforms and where
development assistance can achieve the greatest impact on growth and poverty reduction.
Currently, the Partners have signed State Partnership Agreements with four of such lead
states. In the last two years, the partnership has also been extended to include USAID,
particularly at the state level, and cooperation with UNDP, EU and the African Development
Bank.
4.
Under the strategy, IDA expended financial support to Nigeria for FY06 and FY 07
of about US$1.17 billion. Indicative lending plans for the remaining two years of the CPS
will be set during the mid-term review of the CPS which will go to the Board in March 2008

51
(based on an expected increased IDA allocation, as Nigeria’s performance has been
improving).
5.
The Progress Report assesses progress made to date in supporting Nigeria’s
development objectives and makes adjustments to better align partner support to the
emerging priorities of the Administration, as articulated in the 7 point agenda. While the
strategy and its approaches remain relevant to Nigeria’s needs and the Government program,
in the next two years increased emphasis will be placed on supporting the power sector, state
governance reforms, and addressing the Niger Delta issues.
World Bank–IMF relations
6.
The IMF and World Bank staffs maintain a close collaborative relationship on
Nigeria. Both institutions are coordinating their policy advice to the government in several
areas (including the financial sector, public financial management, and statistics) through
collaboration on analytical work, and through joint technical assistance missions. The Bank
staff is regularly invited to join IMF macroeconomic missions. The Bank’s work and support
to Government in key structural reform areas informed the PSI program. Nigeria is also a
pilot project for enhanced Bank-Fund collaboration in the area of management of natural
resources. Efforts under this pilot project have identified a range of joint Bank-Fund
activities aimed at strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for the management of
natural resources.
7.
In 2005, the Bank and the IMF staff collaborated on a Debt Sustainability Analysis
for Nigeria and prepared a Joint Staff Assessment Note on the NEEDS which was discussed
by both the Boards of the World Bank and the IMF. In 2006 and 2007, the Bank and the IMF
staff jointly updated the Debt Sustainability Analysis.
Lending activities
8.
The IDA commitment in Nigeria continued to show an upward trend; growing from
about US$1.5 billion in FY05, to current US$2.6 billion; out of which only about 16 percent
is at risk by amount. This represents a significant improvement compared to 79 percent in
FY03 and 43 percent in FY05 respectively. This portfolio comprises 23 IDA projects
covering activities in various sectors of the economy. About 41 percent of the portfolio is in
infrastructure (water supply, power and transport). About 32 percent is in human
development covering health, education and HIV/AIDS. The remaining projects support rural
development (10 percent), private sector development (10 percent), and economic
management and governance (7 percent)
9.
As of December 2007, about US$1.07 billion has been disbursed out of the total IDA
commitment of US$2.6 billion. While the disbursement ratio reached 24.5 percent at end
FY07, it is currently in FY08 at 8.6 percent. Overall disbursement has gone down somewhat
due to the number and volume of projects entering the portfolio at end FY07–08, the new

52
administration, and implementation of new projects. However, efforts are being made to
speed up implementation of new projects and improve overall disbursements. The Bank is
also continuing to focus on strengthening monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements to
ensure that projects in the portfolio achieve their development objectives.
Non-lending activities
10.
The World Bank has continued to expand its program of economic and sector
analysis as part of its efforts to strengthen policy dialogue and improve on the quality of its
investment operations. The current Economic and Sector Work program has a strong focus
on public expenditure management, competitiveness and growth, and power. It is also has
been paying growing attention to regional integration agenda, poverty analysis, and trends in
the social sector. Key proposed analytical pieces include a Fiscal Federalism study (FY08),
an Agriculture Financing Review (FY08), an Agriculture PER (FY08), an Employment and
Growth study (FY09), a Poverty Assessment (FY10) and a Trade and Regional Integration
study (FY10).
International Finance Corporation (IFC) activities
11.
Nigeria remains IFC’s largest commitment portfolio in Sub-Sahara Africa with an
outstanding portfolio of US$553 million in private sector investments as of November 30,
2007. IFC’s outstanding portfolio in the country represents over 37 percent of the subSaharan Africa region’s portfolio, having grown from US$42 million on June 30, 2001.
IFC’s strategy for Nigeria involves collaboration with the Bank and UK’s DFID and is driven
by both IFC’s Sub-Saharan Africa Strategy and the CPS for Nigeria. The strategy focuses on:
(i) proactive project development in the key sectors of financial markets, infrastructure,
manufacturing & services, indigenous oil-gas-petrochemicals, agribusiness and healthcare;
(ii) diversification within financial markets to include trade finance, housing finance
including mortgages and securitizations, insurance, MSME finance, microfinance;
(iii) utilizing technical assistance to enhance private sector development in Nigeria such as
improving investment climate and developing the local fixed income capital market; and,
(iv) designing and implementing select financing and technical assistance pilots to support
Bank/DFID initiatives such as exploring the potential of sub-national financing of the four
lead states for which the Bank has signed States Partnership Agreements. Further highlights
of IFC activities in the various sectors of Nigeria are described below.
12.
Financial sector. Over the past five years, IFC has disbursed over US$220 million to
five Nigerian banks in terms of long-term credit lines. It also signed on seven Nigerian banks
as issuing banks under the IFC Global Trade Finance Program. The total utilization of the
trade finance facilities was approximately US$315 million in FY07. In addition, IFC is
providing Nigerian banks with specialized financing facilities and technical assistance, to
open up financing opportunities in new or untapped markets such as women entrepreneurs,
construction finance, retail and consumer banking through assisting with establishment of a

53
private credit bureau, mortgages and securitization, and corporate governance. IFC’s
involvement has helped its portfolio banks strengthen their governance and risk management
capabilities. Moreover, IFC is increasingly diversifying to finance non-bank financial
institutions such as insurance and asset management companies. IFC has been able to provide
naira long-term financing to both banks and real sector companies because of the existence of
long-term cross-currency swaps from naira into convertible currencies.
13.
General manufacturing services. In recent years, IFC has increased its exposure
significantly in a variety of general manufacturing projects including a US$75 million
investment in the Obajana Cement Company. This is a Greenfield cement plant with an
annual capacity of 5 million tons, and includes a 135 MW power plant, a 92km natural gas
pipeline, a water supply dam and other support facilities. IFC is also providing technical
assistance to design and implement community development programs in the rural Obajana,
as well as improve the supply chain management for SME distribution of cement across
Nigeria. Other notable investments in the sector include a US$40 million investment in
UPDC, a real estate development and management company, and a US$10 million
investment in Star Paper Mills Ltd.
14.
Oil and gas, mining and petrochemicals. IFC’s strategy in this sector has been to
target the services area in linkages to projects with the oil majors, as well as indigenous oil
and gas production and services companies. There have also been recent opportunities in the
petrochemicals sector as a result of privatizations, such as the Eleme petrochemicals project,
where IFC has approved a US$75 million investment for rehabilitation and expansion of
capacity, and is providing technical assistance for establishment of a community
development program.
15.
Advisory and technical assistance projects. Private Enterprise Partnership (PEP)
Africa initiative designs and implements programs to support the development of the private
sector in three areas: improving the investment climate, proactively identifying investment
opportunities, and supporting SME development. In Nigeria, under PEP Africa, the leading
projects include the SME Entrepreneurship Development Initiative, the Oil Sector SME
Linkages Project in coordination with INSOK from Norway, corporate governance program
for banks, and fixed income capital market development. IFC is also the lead adviser to the
government for the privatization of Nigeria airports, beginning with the Abuja airport. In the
power sector, a joint World Bank/IFC Energy Team is working with the federal government
on sector reform and strategies for privatization.
World Bank Institute activities (WBI)
16.
Nigeria is a WBI Focus Country. WBI has continued to partner with relevant
stakeholders in building capacity for the implementation of programs that will empower
communities, improve economic governance and ensure non-oil private sector development.
WBI also aims to strengthen the national parliament, increase civil society participation in

54
governance through youth programs, facilitate the development of good quality and
pluralistic media, and support science and technology developments by assisting the African
Institute of Science and Technology (AIST). A Global Distance Learning Network (GDLN)
center is expected to be completed and functional in Abuja before end-2007. WBI cooperates
with the Federal Center for Health Systems Studies through its training programs of key
managers and decision makers involved in health sector reforms. Other important WBI
programs include support for NEEDS Implementation, HIV/AIDS, and building capacity in
Nigerian youth organizations.
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
17.
MIGA is one of few political risk insurance providers that offers long-term coverage
in Nigeria, and is committed to be a productive partner in the government’s NEEDS strategy
and assist in its efforts to diversify the economy away from the hydrocarbon sector.
18.
Currently, MIGA’s gross exposure in Nigeria is $102.9 million and consists of five
projects in support of the country’s manufacturing and services sectors. In its FY08 pipeline,
the Agency expects to provide coverage of two additional investments, in the agribusiness,
and infrastructure (power) sectors. These projects, to be sponsored by investors from the
United Kingdom and Lebanon, have an anticipated combined gross exposure of
$106.6 million.
19.
MIGA’s online investment promotion services (www.fdi.net and www.pricenter.com) are unique web portals that offer free country analyses and information relating
to foreign direct investment (FDI) and political risk management and insurance for
175 countries. These initiatives contribute to MIGA’s mandate of promoting FDI in
developing countries as a way to enhance growth and development. At present, these services
feature 221 documents on investment opportunities and the related business, legal and
regulatory environment in Nigeria.

ANNEX III. NIGERIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Macroeconomic data are broadly adequate for surveillance; however serious data
deficiencies continue to hamper policy design and monitoring. These deficiencies affect the national
accounts, government finance, monetary and external accounts—including major inconsistencies
between balance of payments and customs data on trade. Numerous problems prevent the
compilation of timely and internally consistent data, in particular lack of data sharing between data
producing and collecting agencies, and insufficient computerization.
2.
Nigeria participates in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and as one
of 22 participants in the Fund’s GDDS Project for Anglophone African Countries (funded by the
U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), it has undertaken to use the GDDS as a
framework for the development of its national statistical systems. In phase 2 of the GDDS project
Nigeria has joined the external sector statistics and the national accounts modules.
National accounts
3.
The national accounts statistics are of poor quality, largely owing to a deterioration in
business and household surveys. Estimates of value added for agriculture, mining (oil), industry,
transportation, and financial and other services are based on old surveys with extrapolations that use
out-of-date ratios and other indicators. Where more recent survey information is used, the survey
data suffer from poor response rates. Many sector deflators are not soundly based and have a
number of inconsistencies. In the past, the use of the official exchange rate resulted in a gross
understatement of value added in the oil and export sectors. The expenditure accounts suffer from
unreliable external trade and government budgetary data.
4.
A July 2003 mission helped the authorities implement the GDDS recommendations in the
area of national accounts and provided guidance on institutional reforms in the statistical system. A
new Statistics Act was enacted in 2007, giving autonomy to the National Bureau of Statistics.
Results of a 2003 household living standards survey are now available. Moreover, the GDP
methodology has been amended for estimates from 2004 onward, and a spliced series constructed
back to 1981, in a move toward the SNA 1993 and to incorporate new data sources. The authorities
published a revised series dated October 2007, but the estimates continue to be reviewed in the
context of the IMF/ DFID GDDS Phase 2 Project for Anglophone Africa. The revised estimates of
October 2007 resulted in a shift in the level of GDP of over one-third, particularly stemming from
GDP estimates for “agriculture and fishing.” However, this increase in agriculture output was
inconsistent with available data and inadequately documented. There are also methodological
concerns regarding petroleum output, exclusion of natural gas, and deflators. A rebasing of the
series (the current base year is 1990) is needed in light of the structural changes in the economy.
Prices
5.
The official monthly consumer price index (CPI) is a composite of urban and rural price
data, and the consumption weights are based on the 1996/97 National Consumer Expenditure

60
Survey. The weights are price-updated to May 2003 which is the new reference period for the
index. Some data on producer prices are collected, but these statistics are not comprehensive and no
producer price index is compiled. As a consequence, some sector GDP deflator indices are based
not on producer prices, but on consumer price subindices and ad hoc assumptions. Expenditure
deflators also suffer from methodological shortcomings.
Government finance
6.
Fiscal data have historically been opaque and complicated not only by the federal structure,
but also by a multiplicity of off-budget funds and by accounting practices that underestimate the
actual size of public expenditure. Most pressing shortcomings are related to inadequate data
coverage, the lack of monthly and quarterly compilation, and inadequate timeliness.
7.
Despite the creation of a National Committee on Government Finance Statistics (NCGFS),
progress has been limited in implementing past technical assistance recommendations notably
owing to an unclear institutional arrangement and lack of sufficient staff. In 2002, a STA mission
conducted a compilation exercise using data for 2000 that showed substantial room for
improvement in the consistency of source data and reconciliation between above- and below-theline data. This exercise compiled data for the consolidated central government and general
government, with special effort to capture the numerous special funds and dedicated accounts that
carry out large financial transactions. The mission used the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) framework (on a cash basis).
8.
The 2002 mission also laid out a detailed 3-stage “action plan” and recommended to expand
the NCGFS and increase GFS unit staffing; improve the consistency of OAGF and Central Bank of
Nigeria (CBN) source data; expand CBN work to reconcile government financing data (available
in-house); and have the GFS unit document an inventory of source data. Also, the action plan
suggested that a second step focus on improving the coverage of reporting to include state and local
government operations, as well as to ensure adequate dissemination of GFS data. In addition, a
subsequent step was to focus on a more complete application of the guidelines contained in
GFSM 2001.
9.
Annual fiscal data are not reported for inclusion in the GFS Yearbook, but aggregated fiscal
data are reported for inclusion in the IFS, although no quarterly or monthly data on financing are
reported.
Monetary accounts
10.
The reporting of monetary data for IFS was recently interrupted because of major
unresolved accounting problems at the CBN. Throughout 2006, the CBN took steps to change its
core accounting system, but no provision was made for a transition period in which the old and the
new accounting systems would run in parallel to test the operational reliability of the new system.
As a result, a number of serious distortions arose in the accounting records of the CBN, including
erroneous recording of some asset balances as liabilities and vice versa, and failure to capture a
number of large foreign currency transactions. Many of these issues have now been resolved and in

61
June 2007 a new monetary survey was introduced. The most recent central bank data published in
the STA database are those for September 2006, while monthly data for the other depository
corporations are those for April 2007.
Balance of payments
11.
Balance of payments statistics are mostly compiled from the foreign exchange records in the
banking system. Private capital movements are under-recorded and the trade data reported by the
NBS (based on customs data) sharply differ from those reported by the CBN (based on banking
data). Based on comparisons with counterparty data, both sets of statistics appear to significantly
understate imports. Oil and gas exports are estimated by the CBN based on information provided by
the Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC).
12.
After a hiatus of several years, the CBN has recently resumed submitting balance of
payments data to STA; however, the balance of payments include large negative errors of
omissions, which probably reflect an underestimation of current account debit transactions.
13.
An October 2007 technical assistance mission guided the CBN compilers in developing new
methodologies for external sector statistics, including for the estimation of oil and gas exports and
for the recording of private capital flows and stocks. Revised balance of payments data were
constructed for 2006 and a partial international investment position statement was developed for
end-2005 and end-2006. Both sets of statistics can be further improved in the short-term with the
processing of information from the financial statements of oil and gas, and the telecommunications
sectors, and with the implementation of other key recommendations of the mission.
14.
The authorities have not yet initiated compilation of international reserves data in line with
the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity. Moreover, the staff
has been unable to assess whether data on official reserve assets are in principle consistent with the
template; the data may not adequately reflect foreign currency liabilities or distinguish other foreign
currency assets.
External debt
15.
Following its establishment in August 2000 the Debt Management Office (DMO) has made
significant progress in collecting, recording, reconciling, and disseminating public external debt
data. This facilitated the recent Paris Club and London Club debt operations.
16.
The DMO does not collect data on private sector external debt, and should work to extend
the coverage of their database to include private sector liabilities and foreign investment in
domestically issued debt securities.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Nigeria
On February 13, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Nigeria.1
Background
Nigeria’s economic performance has been strong since the last Article IV consultation.
Output has grown strongly, inflation reduced to single digits, and the external and fiscal
positions strengthened significantly. A burgeoning financial sector is supporting private
activity. These gains reflect the implementation of an ambitious reform program that was
guided by the homegrown Nigeria Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy
(NEEDS) and supported by a Policy Support Instrument 2005–07, as well as a favorable
external environment and debt relief.
Economic growth is buoyed by strong performance of the tertiary sector against the backdrop
of solid agriculture growth. Oil sector output at currently about 2.2. million barrel per day of
crude remains below potential due to the unrest in the Niger Delta. The main obstacle to nonoil growth is the infrastructure gap, especially the lack of electricity. The recent strong
performance of the telecommunication and financial sectors demonstrate the growth potential
once regulatory frameworks are established and macroeconomic conditions are favorable.
Poverty remains high despite several years of solid growth. Poverty is estimated at about
55 percent based on the 2004 household survey and development indicators are low. The
authorities are making efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and have
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

established targeted programs financed, for example, through a virtual poverty fund with debt
relief resources.
An oil-price-based fiscal rule was instrumental for realizing the benefits of the current oil
boom and avoiding a repeat of past boom-bust cycles. This rule—centered on a prudent
budget oil price—delinks fiscal spending from oil market developments and thereby helps
manage domestic demand pressures in line with absorptive capacity. Oil revenue windfalls
were directed into the “excess crude account” and used to build up savings and repay most
external debt. The budget oil price is also an important parameter for macroeconomic
planning in the recently signed federal Fiscal Responsibility Act.
Nigeria is increasingly integrating into global financial markets. Interest in naira assets has
been spurred by improved macroeconomic conditions, reduced external vulnerabilities, and
global liquidity developments. Hence, since 2005 bank capital has increased two fold,
government securities trading five fold, and stock market capitalization four fold.
The financial sector is expanding rapidly, supporting private sector activity. A bank
consolidation and recapitalization program—effective from 2006—has formed stronger
banks. Banks are increasing their lending to the private sector including for larger projects,
for example, in the oil sector. They are strengthening their treasury capacity to offer new
products found in other emerging markets, and they are expanding into cross-border and
cross-sector activities.
Inflation has been brought down to single digits, while the changes in macroeconomic
conditions and the financial market bring new challenges for monetary management. With
increasing capital flows, reduced inflation and a unified exchange rate, money demand is
expanding and less stable. Hence, targeting of monetary aggregates is becoming less
reliable and the central bank is planning to adopt inflation targeting.
Nigeria’s external position is favorable. International reserves exceed US$54 billion as of
end-January 2008. The remaining external debt of US$3.3 billion at end-2007 is largely to
multilateral creditors. Foreign exchange markets have improved. The introduction of the
Wholesale Dutch Auction System (WDAS) in early 2006 replaced a retail DAS. Regulatory
changes in 2006 led to a unification of foreign exchange markets. More recently, the
interbank foreign exchange market has become more important owing to an increase in
private foreign exchange flows.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for Nigeria’s strong macroeconomic
performance during the last several years. Growth is high, inflation is in single digits, and
external debt is low. The economic outlook is favorable, provided that appropriate policies are
maintained.
Directors highlighted the essential role that prudent fiscal policies—in particular, the oil-pricebased fiscal rule—have played in achieving macroeconomic stability. They encouraged the
authorities to secure agreement with the states on a fiscal framework that would continue to

3
delink spending from oil revenue flows, and thus protect macroeconomic stability and the
positive outlook for faster growth, reducing poverty, and attaining the Millennium
Development Goals.
Directors considered the government’s medium-term fiscal strategy a sound foundation for
fiscal policies, and encouraged the authorities to adhere to the strategy’s deficit targets.
Spending on priority areas has increased appropriately during the last few years within a
prudent resource envelope and in line with absorptive capacity, providing scope to address
pressing infrastructure needs. At the same time, Directors cautioned that if overall spending
were to again increase significantly, medium-term prospects for non-oil growth would likely
deteriorate, to the detriment of development and poverty alleviation efforts.
Directors encouraged the authorities to finalize and implement the debt management
framework, including at the level of state and local governments. They supported the
authorities’ intention to rely only on concessional external financing, to avoid the
re-accumulation of unsustainable debt.
Directors recognized the challenges for monetary management arising from less predictable
money demand, owing to the rapidly changing financial system and increased capital flows.
They took note of the central bank’s plans to introduce inflation targeting at the appropriate
juncture, while emphasizing the importance of improving the understanding of the inflation
process and the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In this regard, they welcomed the
authorities’ intention to move forward with an inflation targeting regime only once the
institutional underpinnings for it are firmly in place.
Directors welcomed Nigeria’s increasing integration into global financial markets and the
growth opportunities this creates. This is attributable in large part to the successful bank
consolidation program, which has strengthened the banking sector. Directors encouraged the
authorities to stay ahead of developments in the financial sector, and move forward with
plans to further strengthen banking supervision.
Directors agreed that the balance of payments outlook is consistent with external stability,
and that the projected modest current account surplus reflects an appropriate balance
between Nigeria’s status as a low-income country and as an oil producer. Most Directors
viewed favorably the increased flexibility in Nigeria’s exchange rate, which should help
support the authorities’ monetary policy objectives.
Directors emphasized the need for ongoing structural reforms to maintain the growth
momentum. The private sector environment has been strengthened, but more needs to be
done. Directors encouraged the authorities to move forward to address the infrastructure gap
and to strengthen further the public financial management system.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to maintain a close ongoing dialogue with the
Fund, possibly in the context of a second Policy Support Instrument.

This statement reports on developments since the staff report for the Article IV was
issued to the Board on January 22, 2008. Some of these developments confirm the spending
pressures highlighted in the staff appraisal. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
2.
The external position remains robust. International reserves stood at US$54.2 billion
(equivalent to about 10 months of imports) at end-January 2008.
3.
Nigeria has not been affected by the recent volatility in financial markets. Capital
inflows into the domestic bond and stock markets are reported to have continued. The stock
market was up by 1 percent in January having traded in a fairly narrow range. The naira
appreciated by 0.3 percent with respect to the U.S. dollar in January on the interbank market.
4.
Headline inflation increased to 6.6 percent year-on-year in December due to food
price inflation. Core inflation (less food and energy) was negative as tradable prices declined
further on the strength of the naira. The increase in food price inflation largely reflects the
impact of regional droughts and a stronger than normal seasonal pick up in prices. November
monetary aggregates indicate a slight pick up in broad money as the expansion in private sector
credit continued.
5.
The National Assembly has yet to approve the 2008 federal budget. It appears likely
that the budget oil price will be increased to US$59 (from the proposed US$53.83) per barrel.
The federal government plans to use about one half of the additional oil revenue disbursements
to reduce domestic debt financing and the remainder on infrastructure projects. The higher
budget oil price is expected to result in higher oil revenue allocations to state and local
government. Implications for the fiscal balance cannot be assessed until the budget details are
issued following parliamentary passage.
6.
Additional allocations from oil savings (the excess crude account) have been made.
An amount of US$1.8 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) was allocated to a number of states to
compensate them for their financing of the Paris Club debt settlement in excess of their own
state debt obligations. The allocations were made in foreign currency accounts that can be
drawn upon either by conversion to naira through the interbank foreign exchange market or by
direct import spending. Hence, these allocations will not inject naira liquidity into the economy.
It is reported that in early February, the various tiers of government reached understandings on
an additional distribution of US$4 billion (1.9 percent of GDP) from the excess crude account.
This amount will also be allocated in foreign currency and released in three separate
installments. While it is understood that subnational governments are being encouraged to use
the funds for budgeted investment, staff does not have sufficient detail to determine the impact
on fiscal balances.
The government has authorized the national oil company to seek commercial
financing for its investment needs in joint venture oil and gas projects. This financing
would be tied to the project and be non-recourse to both the government and the national oil
company.

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Executive Director for Nigeria
and Godwill Efiong Ukpong, Alternate Director
February 13, 2008
1.
The Nigerian authorities appreciate the constructive dialogue with the Fund on their
economic and structural reform policies aimed at sustaining macroeconomic stability and
high growth necessary for poverty reduction and attainment of the MDGs. They thank staff
for the lucid and comprehensive set of papers and broadly agree with their analyses and
recommendations.
Economic Developments and Outlook
2.
The implementation of prudent macroeconomic policies and ambitious structural
reforms, supported by a favorable external environment, including high oil prices, has
contributed to impressive macroeconomic performance since the last Article IV consultation
in July 2005. Real GDP growth rose from 6.5 percent in 2005 to a projected rate of 9.0
percent in 2008; inflation has declined substantially and is now in the low single digits; the
exchange rate has stabilized; and there has been strong fiscal and external positions.
3.
The immediate economic outlook is favorable. Real GDP growth is expected to be
robust, at 8.3 percent in 2009 and 8.1 percent in 2012, supported mainly by sound sectoral
policies and private and public demand. The authorities expect an increase in oil and gas
production as new investments come on stream and downside risk in the Niger Delta is
mitigated through government mediation efforts and public-private sector development
activities in the area. Non-oil sector growth, especially agriculture, communications and
financial services, which has been very strong, is expected to be sustained in the mediumterm in line with increased investments in the sector. Inflation is projected to rise slightly to
7.3 percent in 2008, compared to 5.4 percent in 2007 because of pressure from factors
underlying expected higher real GDP growth, but increasingly more effective monetary
policy of ensuring price stability would ensure that it remains at its relatively low level.
Fiscal spending has been increasingly contained during high oil prices to manage demand
pressures by saving revenue windfalls in an oil savings account. The monetary authority’s
success in facilitating much needed bank consolidation, along with improved macroeconomic
conditions, has not only enhanced rapid growth of private sector credit, but is also driving the
fast pace of integration of the country’s financial sector into the global financial system.
4.
Notwithstanding the many policy achievements and relatively favorable medium-term
prospects, significant challenges still remain, including sustaining high GDP growth, with
low inflation; saving oil revenue through reliance on the oil price-based fiscal rule;
maintaining fiscal prudence; further improving the effectiveness of bank supervision;
safeguarding gains made through structural reforms by strengthening related new institutions;
and having the benefits of economic growth reach all segments of the population.

Fiscal Policy
5.
The authorities have made considerable progress in implementing prudent fiscal
policy, the success of which has continued to result in high oil savings and consolidated
budget balance since 2005. The authorities consider their medium-term fiscal strategy
(MTFS) for 2008-10 as an adequate guideline for preserving macroeconomic stability. The
implementation of the consolidated non-oil primary fiscal deficit, projected to remain at
about 25 percent of non-oil GDP in line with the levels in recent years, and supported by the
Fiscal Responsibility Act’s oil price-based fiscal rule, is also deemed consistent with
macroeconomic stability. The non-oil deficit target envisaged would accommodate
resumption of large infrastructure projects previously put on hold.
6.
The federal government has continued to emphasize the importance of saving oil
revenues against lean times. Its success in making such savings in recent years has generated
pressure from state and local governments for increased sharing and spending of some saved
oil revenues. The federal government has resisted these pressures and has encouraged and
supported the two tiers of government to adopt and apply the provisions of the Fiscal
Responsibility Act and the Procurement Act of 2007. In this regard, the National Economic
Council (NEC), the apex body responsible for coordinating economic policies of the various
tiers of Government, has approved that all states should pass similar versions of the two Acts.
At present, the process for adoption of the Acts has reached advanced stage in all the States.
Additional measures being proposed by the federal government to enhance oil revenue
savings by the two tiers of government and eliminate adverse macroeconomic effects of
allocation of oil savings include: distribution of a small proportion of oil savings; adoption of
savings fund; and participation in high import-content infrastructure development to suppress
demand pressure.
7.
Regarding the development of relevant institutions, fiscal institutions such as the
Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and the Office of Accountant General of the
Federation (OAGF) are being strengthened through Fund TA. The Staff’s Debt Sustainability
Analysis indicates that the authorities have developed a debt management strategy for
effective debt management; and that the country faces a low risk of debt distress. The federal
government has reaffirmed its commitment to limit borrowing to concessional sources so as
to preserve the current strong external position, while states are being provided TA on setting
up their Debt Management offices.
Monetary Policy
8.
A judicious combination of suitable policy instruments by the Central Bank of
Nigeria (CBN), and increased coordination of monetary and fiscal policies have strengthened
the conduct and effectiveness of monetary policy in Nigeria. The Bank has, thus, been
successful in bringing inflation to single digits from a rate of more than 20 percent during the
last Article IV consultation. In order to further strengthen the capacity to meet inflation

3
objective going forward, the authorities have the intention to put in place a credible
mechanism for setting realistic inflation targets through increased alignment of fiscal and
monetary policies. However, they would only do so once they are satisfied that all the
requisite conditions, including the necessary capacity, are in place. As there is pressing need
to spend on essential infrastructure (power, transport, water supply, security), any assessment
of possible inflationary impact of fiscal expansion should take into account the composition
of the increase in public spending.
9.
The adoption of the whole-sale Dutch Auction System and increasing role of the
interbank foreign exchange market have strengthened the flexible foreign exchange regime,
while the exchange rate has been stable. The authorities, therefore find it difficult to agree
with staff characterization of the exchange rate regime as “a managed float”. The Bank has
reservations about the validity of quantitative estimates of possible undervaluation of the
exchange rate on grounds of data quality and structural changes in the economy, while it
remains vigilant to ensure that banks are the main conduit for foreign exchange inflows to
avoid undue appreciation of the exchange rate that would be inimical to real sector economic
activities and exports. The authorities are of the view that the need to increase interest rate in
response to the estimated output gap should be nuanced, in the light of the challenges
involved in establishing output gap for a country like Nigeria and the fact that core inflation
remains very low. The Bank is also having its research efforts focused on better
understanding of the link between its policy lending rate and banks’ lending and deposit
rates, given the antecedent of past wide-spread loan delinquency rates and high lending rates.
10.
On banking and financial sector stability, it is evident that the bank consolidation
undertaken by the Central Bank in the last three years, has significantly strengthened
soundness of the sector. The banks are now well capitalized, liquid, profitable, and resilient
to shocks according to stress tests by staff, while portfolio quality has improved, and
provisioning levels high. A key challenge is how to manage monetary policy effectively and
preserve financial stability as strong economic fundamentals induce increased capital flows;
and new financial instruments and products are introduced at a fast pace by highly capitalized
banks seeking profitable outlets. The monetary authority’s strategy for addressing these
challenges include ongoing Fund TA on the development of capacity to better assess risks
and carry out effective risk-based supervision; strengthening of prudential regulations and
ensuring better compliance; deepening the financial sector; and encouraging improved
economy-wide financial intermediation, given banks’ huge capital base.
Structural Reforms
11.
The authorities have implemented extensive structural reforms under the recently
completed PSI arrangements, including privatization of many public enterprises,
liberalization of the communications sector, and concessioning of ports. They, however
consider that much remains to be done. Infrastructure gap has been identified as the main
impediment to private sector growth. The authorities are committing huge resources to

4
infrastructure development, especially power generation, while ensuring value for money.
They have therefore, instituted and are relying on the Public Procurement Act, which
provides due process in public contract awards and procurements. To fund new infrastructure
projects, with private sector expertise, the authorities are considering a cooperative public
private partnership (PPPs), with clear regulatory and legal framework. The authorities have
provided resources in the 2008 budget to help address concerns about uncompleted and
delayed projects, especially in the power sector. While the authorities are aware that
following due process in order to institutionalize the reforms may give the impression of
delayed visible results, such an approach would lead eventually to a robust legal and
regulatory framework and serve as a building block for acceleration of economic activities
and future reforms.
12.
The authorities recognize further development of the financial sector as a priority
since financial intermediation ratios are still low and capital and asset growth of financial
institutions have not been significantly translated into financing of long-term productive
investments and improved access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises. The CBN
is focusing on meeting these priority needs, including adoption of suitable strategies in the
context of vision 20/20 financial sector development.
Conclusion
The authorities have sustained an encouraging record of economic performance and are
committed to continued implementation of necessary reforms to maintain macroeconomic
stability essential for growth and meeting the country’s MDGs. They value the Fund’s policy
advice and engagement and look forward to continued strong support for the country by the
International community, including the Fund.
