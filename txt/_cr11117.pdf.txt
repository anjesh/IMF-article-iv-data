STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 3, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Context: Papua New Guinea has enjoyed a decade of solid economic growth, supported
by greater political stability, a sound fiscal framework, and a healthy banking sector.
National elections are scheduled for 2012.
Growth prospects: High commodity prices and the construction of a liquefied natural
gas production facility (LNG) are fuelling an economy already facing capacity constraints.
Rising consumer and asset price inflation are threatening macroeconomic stability. Risks
are tilted to the upside and include the potential for new mines and natural gas
production.
Macroeconomic stability: Tighter macroeconomic policies are needed to contain
inflationary pressures. Staff welcomed last year’s withdrawal of the large fiscal impulse
that was in place in 2009 and recommended continued fiscal restraint during the LNG
construction boom. Monetary tightening is needed to contain inflationary pressures and
reduce the risk that higher inflation becomes entrenched in expectations. Greater
exchange rate flexibility would help cushion demand shocks.
Raising living standards: Minerals have the potential to transform the PNG economy
and raise long-term growth and living standards. Public spending needs to be better
aligned with policy priorities and provision of essential social services improved, so that
the benefits from the natural resource boom are more evenly spread. Structural reforms
should be implemented to support the development of the nonmineral sector.
Financial and external stability: The financial sector assessment program (FSAP) found
that the financial system remains sound and should be able to withstand moderate
shocks. A large current account deficit, related to the LNG investment, is temporary and
largely financed by FDI. The real exchange rate is expected to appreciate.

underestimated in official data, which take
inadequate account of rental increases and are
based on an outdated consumption basket.

Inflation is expected to accelerate in

major driver of core inflation, and headline inflation

international food and energy prices. Inflationary
pressures are exacerbated by increases in public
spending, higher wage costs—resulting from a
shortage of skilled labor—and rapidly increasing
prices associated with the use and development of
land. Moreover, staff sees a risk that high inflation
becomes entrenched in expectations. However, the

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

The Impact of Food Price Movements on the Poor in PNG

Food price increases over the past year were
moderate. In 2010, the prices of imported foods
increased faster than those of domestically produced
items. Nonetheless, urban households, in particular
the landless urban poor, benefited from low-priced
rice imports. Rural households living near major cities
such as Port Moresby have become important food
suppliers to the urban population.1 Their incomes
increased moderately in 2010 and less than they had
done during the food price surges of 2008. They cut
back on imported foods, which represent a small
portion of their diet, but an important source of
protein.2 Subsistence farmers, and households further
away from urban centers, were largely unaffected by
increases in urban prices of domestically produced
items.

Higher world demand for agricultural
commodities has benefited rural regions, which
export these products. Coffee price increases have
increased cash income of the Eastern and Western
Highlands, while high cocoa prices have benefited East
New Britain and Bougainville. Oil palm production
areas, such as the Hoskins project in New Britain, have
enjoyed a price boom.
An elastic domestic supply response by
substitute foods producers will mitigate the
effect of projected increases in international food
prices. Econometric analysis by Mellor (2009) suggests
a weak and temporary pass-through from import
prices to domestically produced goods prices in the
major cities apart from Goroka.3 The likely channel is a
high propensity for peri-urban farmers to substitute
between subsistence and market production in
response to price changes.

Staff’s Views
11.

For 2011, the government targets a

balanced budget. However, the government’s
target does not include spending from trust
accounts. Staff includes additional spending out of
trust accounts, and assumes that trust-account
spending remains just below the Medium-Term
Fiscal Strategy (MTFS) ceiling of 4 percent of GDP—
though with national elections in the offing, this
assumption might be optimistic. In addition, it is
unclear how much of the 2009 withdrawals from
trust accounts has actually been spent or is still in
the banking system, waiting to be spent during the
election period. On the other hand, staff assumes
higher commodity prices than the authorities,
leading to higher-than-budgeted mineral revenue.

currently facing inflated prices as they are
competing for scarce resources with private sector
construction activities. Delaying these projects until
the LNG construction phase is over, would lower
demand pressures, raise value for money, and help
achieve better service delivery.
14.

Further reductions in public debt

would reduce PNG’s vulnerability to shocks.
The steady reduction in public debt over the past
decade is commendable. However, none of the
windfall revenues was used for debt reduction in
2010, in contrast to the previous MTFS rule to use
30 percent of above-normal mineral revenues for
this purpose. Instead the government modified the
MTFS rule to allow 100 percent of above-normal
revenues to be devoted to public investment in
future budgets, as long as debt stays below
30 percent of GDP. In light of falling oil and copper

Following several years of surpluses,

Staff’s Views

the current account shifted into deficit amidst
weak commodity prices in 2009. Despite the
recovery in commodity prices and exports, staff
estimates the deficit to have widened to 24 percent
of GDP in 2010, reflecting LNG-related goods and
services imports and income deficits, mainly due to
higher compensation of foreign employees, and
higher dividend payments associated with increased
mining profits from strong commodity prices
(Table 3). However, current account deficits are
largely financed by FDI and equity investments of
the LNG partners. Foreign reserves are estimated to
be around US$3.2 billion by March 2011 and cover
almost five months of imports of goods and
nonfactor services. The increase in reserves reflects
strong inflows associated with mineral taxes and
foreign investment.
25.

The nominal effective exchange rate

(NEER) depreciated by more than 7 percent in
2010. PNG is classified as a floating exchange rate
regime. Over a longer horizon, the NEER remained
roughly flat, while a positive inflation differential

the case for a prudent approach to borrowing and
enhanced fiscal discipline.

Exchange Rate Assessment

Papua New Guinea’s real effective exchange rate
remained stable throughout 2010. After
appreciating by 4.7 percent in 2009, it rose by only
0.5 percent in 2010.
Staff estimates point to an undervaluation of the
Kina relative to medium/longer-term
fundamentals. Standard CGER methodologies are
tailored to advanced and emerging market countries,
and should be treated with caution when applied to
PNG. To evaluate the distance from medium-term
fundamentals, projections for 2017 (when PNG’s

output gap is expected to close) are used. We use an
amended MB approach taking into account the effects
of LNG production on the trade balance and conclude
that the REER is undervalued by about 20 percent
relative to its projected value after LNG production
begins. This is consistent with the assumed real
exchange rate appreciation by 2015 in the
government’s 2011 budget. The ERER approach yields
only a slight undervaluation. However, it does not
account for the structural break in the PNG economy
due to LNG production.

The New Development Plans

The Development Strategic Plan 2010–2030 (DSP)
targets broad-based private-sector-led economic
growth. To create a level playing field, tax
concessions and subsidies are to be reduced.
The DSP envisages Papua New Guinea to become
a middle-income country by 2030. This requires an
annual average growth rate of about 8½ percent.
Main DSP targets are to triple GDP per capita, create
two million additional jobs, and convert 20 percent of
land into bankable assets. In addition, the DSP sets

specific growth targets for key economic sectors.
The Medium-Term Development Plan 2011–2015
(MTDP) identifies seven key priority areas, called
enablers. The enablers focus on unlocking land for
development; improving law and order; establishing
quality economic corridors to link rural populations to
markets and services; providing higher and technical
education and universal access to basic education;
providing key utilities such as electricity, water, and
communications; and improving health outcomes.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Papua New Guinea—Authorities' Response to Recent Fund Policy Advice1
Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
Monetary policy needs to be focused on emerging
inflation pressures. The central bank should be
tightening monetary policy now with a view to
achieving real lending rates of around 6 percent.

The central bank kept the policy rate stable
throughout the year at 7 percent.

Fiscal Policy
Delaying some infrastructure spending would ease
overall demand pressures and help ensure that good
value is achieved from this spending.

Spending outside the budget fell sharply, compared to
2009. It is expected to be under the MTFS threshold of
4 percent of GDP.

It would be prudent to lower the assumption of
normal mineral revenue to 3 percent of GDP between
now and 2014, when LNG production should
commence.

Modification of the MTFS did not include the revision
of the normal mineral revenue threshold.

Closer coordination of monetary and fiscal policy is
desirable. Public trust accounts should be moved to
the BPNG and procedures to automatically deposit
above normal mineral revenue with the central bank
should be introduced.

Fiscal and monetary authorities meet regularly on a
monthly basis. The authorities decided to open all new
trust accounts at the BPNG.

The SWF needs to be integrated into the macro
framework and thereby supported by other fiscal
institutions, such as the MTFS and the Fiscal
Responsibility Act.

The authorities plan to review the current MTFS in
2011. They have indicated that the new MTFS will
incorporate new guiding principles governing the
revenue from SWF.

Financial Sector Policy
Banks should be encouraged to maintain strict lending
standards as credit demand increases in line with
opportunities associated with the LNG projects.
Furthermore, all financial institutions need to guard
against overexposure to the property sector that could
become significantly overvalued during the LNG
construction phase.

NPLs have decreased, while provisioning remains high.
Lending rates have increased little. All commercial
banks remain well capitalized and profitable.
Backward looking financial soundness indicators are
all well above the prudential norms set by the BPNG.

Structural Reforms
The best way forward is a financing fund that directs
all public spending through the budget, thereby
enhancing macroeconomic stabilization and helping to
ensure high quality spending aligned with
development objectives. To minimize the potential for
currency appreciation that would undermine the
welfare of rural populations that depends on
agriculture exports, the fund’s resources should be
invested offshore.

The Government has decided to establish an SWF
consisting of a consolidated pool of three offshore
funds: a stabilization, savings, and infrastructure fund.
All expenditures are to go through the budget
process.

Papua New Guinea—Land Reform1

Ninety-seven percent of total land in PNG is held
under customary tenure, while only 3 percent is
under formal tenure, mostly owned by the State.
Poor administration and an inadequate legal
framework have prohibited productive use of both
customary land and alienated land.2 The government’s
development strategies recognize the need to
implement appropriately designed land reforms to
ensure that land is available for development. Past
land reform initiatives in PNG have, however, largely
failed. There is strong public resistance due to
concerns that land reform will result in breakdown of
traditional social safety mechanisms provided by
communal ownership of land. Customary land
supports more than 85 percent of the national
population.
The National Land Development Program (NLDP)
was launched in 2007 and the PNG parliament
unanimously passed two laws in 2009 aimed at
mobilizing land for development. The guiding

principles underlying this legislation were that the
customary ownership of the land was never to be lost
but remain with the traditional landowners, and that
any system of titling was as good as a state title. The
first principle was demanded by PNG customary
landowners and the latter by financial institutions.
Despite some progress, the implementation of
the NLDP has generally been slow and its
successful implementation remains a significant
challenge. The Office of Urbanization is
implementing pilot project areas in different parts of
the country to accommodate urban expansion of cities
and towns on land currently held under customary
tenure using the new laws. To maximize chances of
success the government must remain committed to a
nationally-owned reform process that is transparent
and inclusive and engage in broad participatory
consultations that allow for full understanding of
stakeholder interests and incentives.

Papua New Guinea—Debt Sustainability Analysis1

Papua New Guinea (PNG) is assessed using the low-income country debt sustainability analysis (LIC DSA).2 While
PNG remains at a moderate risk of debt distress, public debt sustainability has improved compared to the 2010
DSA assessment because of a stronger growth outlook. Under the baseline scenario, all external debt
sustainability indicators remain well below their applicable thresholds. Stress tests indicate that the threshold for
the present value of external public debt to GDP is breached only if prices of commodity exports in 2011–2013
are substantially below WEO forecasts and the government borrows to finance domestic consumption. Overall
public debt should continue its downward path under the baseline. However, contingent liabilities related to the
LNG project, arrears to public pension funds, and other domestic liabilities would delay this long-term
adjustment. Substantial deterioration in the primary balance would harm PNG’s debt performance.

I. Background
PNG’s public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt levels have fallen dramatically over the past decade.
Total public debt declined from 70 to 26 percent of GDP from 2001 to end-2010 (Appendix Table 1). External
public debt fell from 50 to 11 percent of GDP during this period (Appendix Table 3a). Multilateral lenders such
as the World Bank and the AsDB account for around 75 percent of PPG external debt, while Japan and Australia
are the largest of the bilateral creditors. Private sector external debt at end-2010 is estimated at 13 percent of
GDP.
II. Economic Outlook and Underlying DSA Assumptions
PNG weathered the global financial crisis well due to a large fiscal stimulus, strong domestic demand
due to LNG project construction activities, and rebounding commodity prices. Real GDP growth was
7 percent in 2010 after a modest slowdown in 2009, and is projected to accelerate in 2011. PNG’s
terms of trade and export earnings recovered dramatically from the lows of 2009, and both are projected to
improve strongly in 2011 under the baseline scenario. Foreign reserves increased to around US$3.2 billion by
March 2011, reflecting large and continuing financial inflows associated with the injection of equity and
drawdown of loan funds for the financing of the LNG project by its partners. As indicated in the previous DSA,3
PNG is vulnerable to external demand and growth shocks. Due to rising commodity prices and strong growth,
unfavorable public debt dynamics did not materialize in 2010.
Under the baseline scenario, commodity prices will remain high over the medium term while real
GDP will move in line with the LNG sector. During the construction phase of the LNG project, elevated
levels of domestic demand and the current account deficit will continue. With the start of LNG production in
2015, real GDP is projected to jump by 20 percent and the current account will move into a large and persistent
surplus. Appendix Box 1 summarizes the medium-term macroeconomic framework underlying the DSA.
III. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Over the projection period, all baseline PPG external debt and debt service indicators stay well below
the policy-dependent debt burden thresholds (Appendix Table 3b and Appendix Figure 1). The PV of PPG
external debt as a percentage of GDP is on a declining path and stays under 10 percent in the medium term, far
below the 30 percent threshold. The PVs of PPG external debt-to-exports and debt-to-revenue ratios are also
expected to stay below their applicable thresholds. Since additional financing needs for the LNG project and the
current account deficit would be met with projected large FDI inflows, there would be no extra debt burden

Since Papua New Guinea is an IBRD/IDA blend country, this DSA is prepared by Fund staff in consultation with the World Bank and
the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) under the IMF-WB DSA framework for Low-Income Countries. The fiscal year of Papua New
Guinea is the calendar year.
2
Papua New Guinea is rated by the World Bank as a weak performer for its policies and institutions for the purposes of the IMF-WB
low-income country DSA framework. Hence the applicable thresholds for this category for external public debt are: 30 percent for
the present value (PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio; 100 percent for the PV of debt-to-exports ratio, 200 percent for the PV of debt-torevenue ratio, 15 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and 25 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio.

created. After 2015, the external debt burden is expected to fall even faster due to the projected large increase
in exports and revenue from LNG production.

External debt sustainability is maintained under an array of possible stress tests, but would be
threatened by poor fiscal policy in response to a large terms of trade shock (Appendix Table 3b).
Consistent with WEO commodity price forecasts, the baseline scenario predicts PNG’s terms of trade to improve
in 2011 before settling at a permanently high level. This, combined with the boost from LNG production, makes
PNG resilient to a wide range of GDP growth and depreciation shocks. If we instead use the PNG authorities’
more conservative estimates for export prices over 2011–2013,4 and allow the government to borrow to finance
the baseline levels of real consumption and imports (contrary to their stated fiscal strategy), then the PV of PPG
external debt breaches the threshold of 30 percent of GDP. The price of gold is the most important price for
external sustainability before LNG production kicks in.
Delays to the LNG project could generate adverse debt dynamics, even if PPG external debt indicators
remain within the thresholds. While it is unrealistic for the LNG project to halt completely, delays to the
project would slow down GDP growth and worsen PNG’s debt ratios. The historical scenario charts in Appendix
Figure 1 can be interpreted as representing PNG’s debt dynamics in the absence of LNG construction and
production, and without its associated liabilities, assuming that historical levels of real GDP growth are
maintained.
IV. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis5
In the baseline scenario, PNG’s public debt ratio will continue its downward path over the medium
and long term (Appendix Table 1 and Appendix Figure 2). This trend is aided by high commodity prices, rapid
real GDP growth and the implementation of the authorities’ Medium Term Debt Strategy. The public debt-toGDP ratio is forecast to decrease over the projection period as long as windfall revenues are saved during years
of booming commodity prices. Provided these policies are in place, the PV of public sector debt will decline from
27 percent of GDP in 2010 to 13 percent of GDP in 2016 and to 7 percent of GDP by 2031.
Economic growth and saving of commodity tax revenues are the key factors for the projected public
debt path as shown in alternative scenarios and bound tests (Appendix Table 2). The public debt-to-GDP
ratio would rise to 30 percent in 2031 if there is a negative shock to real GDP growth in 2012–13 with
permanently lower revenues and unchanged expenditures until 2031.6 Keeping the primary fiscal surplus at
2.3 percent from 2011 through 2031 instead of moving into deficits over the medium term as in the baseline
would result in the PV of the public debt-to-GDP ratio falling to zero by 2016. This scenario emphasizes the

The stress test uses authorities’ prices for gold, copper and oil only. This amounts to an average negative shock to export values of
22 percent relative to the baseline for each of the three years.

Public debt includes domestic central government, external public, and publicly guaranteed debt.
6
This is a temporary shock to GDP growth, so that the growth rates during 2012–13 are set to the historical average minus one
standard deviation. Another permanent GDP growth shock, which could bring the PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio to 31 percent in
2031, is defined as the baseline GDP growth rate minus one standard deviation divided by the square root of the length of the
projection period.

sensitivity of the public debt outlook to saving of windfall commodity revenues. Substantial deterioration of the
primary balance in future budgets relative to the baseline would negatively affect debt sustainability.
Realization of contingent liabilities related to the LNG project, arrears to public pension funds, and
other domestic liabilities would delay the downward trend in public debt ratios. The government’s
unfunded superannuation liabilities, estimated to be 7 percent of GDP by end-2010, continue to grow,
especially given the decision in the 2009 and 2010 budgets not to fully fund the central government’s
8.4 percent employer contributions. The government should develop a firm payment schedule for these
unfunded liabilities. Contingent liabilities related to the LNG project are estimated to be about 7 percent of GDP
in 2015.7 Although information is limited, attention should be given to the government’s possible need to
backstop SOE borrowing.8 Should these factors materialize, unfavorable debt dynamics would not undermine
public debt sustainability, but would substantially delay fiscal consolidation (Appendix Table 2 and Appendix
Figure 2).9
V. Conclusion
PNG remains at moderate risk of debt distress, but PPG external debt sustainability has substantially
improved as a result of high commodity prices and upcoming LNG production. The baseline scenario
indicates that all external PPG debt burden indicators stay well below their indicative thresholds. External debt
sustainability remains resilient to most stress tests, but would be threatened by a large negative terms of trade
shock coupled with a poor fiscal response.
Public debt sustainability is sensitive to growth shocks and saving of windfall revenues over the
longer term to pay down the debt. The government needs to carefully consider the risk of accumulating
public liabilities until LNG taxation revenues are realized. Despite recent changes to the Medium Term Fiscal
Strategy to allow 100 percent of windfall revenues to be used for public investment, it would be advisable for
the authorities to use some portion of such gains to pay down high interest rate public debt. This would
insulate the economy from adverse debt dynamics after possible negative growth shocks. One-off realizations of
contingent liabilities would delay the paydown of government public debt, but would not generate
unsustainable debt dynamics.

These liabilities arise from the issue of exchangeable bonds by the PNG government to finance its equity participation (in 2009) and
its completion guarantee for debt financing (by 2015). Under the scheme, the creditor acquired exchangeable bonds, amounting to
US$1.1 billion, with the option to exchange the bonds for equities in the Oil Search Company. Under the completion guarantee, if
the project fails, the government may have to pay up to US$2 billion to the creditor.
8
From 2008 Article IV DSA estimates based on end-2007 financial statements of nine SOEs, contingent liabilities related to SOEs
amount to about 2.5 percent of GDP. Off-balance sheet liabilities, which also may be significant, are not considered. Improving the
financial data of SOEs, especially related to contingent liabilities, would help authorities get a better picture of public debt. Staff is
supportive of government intentions to move toward a whole-of-government debt stock approach.
9
The alternative scenario (All Other Liabilities: Pension, SOEs, and LNG contingent liabilities) assumes that pension and SOEs liabilities
are to be covered in the 2012 budget (total about 8 percent of 2012 GDP) and all LNG contingent liabilities will materialize in 2015
(about 7 percent of GDP).

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA



Real GDP growth is projected to be 8 percent on
average over the medium term, above the
historical average of 4 percent, and slow gradually
to 3–4 percent in the long run. In the medium
term growth in the LNG and nonmineral sectors
will offset the decline in copper and petroleum
production.



Construction of the LNG project will be finished
and production and exports are expected to start
in 2015, with a maximum capacity of 6.6 million
tons of LNG produced per annum. LNG
production is estimated to raise the level of real
GDP by about 20 percent in 2015. However,
accounting for substantial income outflows, the
LNG project is expected to increase annual GNI by
about 8 percent.



Inflation is projected to rise to 9 percent in the
near term due to increasing domestic demand
and near-term capacity constraints, while
stabilizing at around 4 percent in the long run.



The current account (including grants) is
estimated to be in deficit in 2010 and the deficit
is expected to remain sizeable until 2015,
primarily reflecting the strong import growth
during the construction phase of the LNG project.
FDI inflows from foreign shareholders are
projected to increase substantially and finance
most of the imports.



The grant element of loans is expected to
decline. As per capita income rises, the share of
external financing provided on concessional terms
is expected to decline over the projection period.1



The primary fiscal balance is projected to be in
surplus of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2011 accounting
for spending from the trust accounts. In the
medium term primary deficits are anticipated, but
these turn into surpluses over the long run as LNG
tax revenues are realized.

_________

Grant-equivalent financing (in percent of GDP) decreases over
time. From 2016 onwards, the majority of new AsDB
disbursements are through OCR facilities, which carry a higher
interest rate than ADF loans.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Papua New Guinea—FSAP: Main Lessons and Take-Aways

The joint IMF-World Bank FSAP mission, which visited
Port Moresby in May 2010, took place against (i) a
backdrop of wide-spread optimism for the operation
of the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects after 2014
and (ii) a mild impact of the financial crisis on PNG
largely due to the broad insulation of the financial
sector from the global financial markets. The main
findings and recommendations, which were updated
during the 2011 Article IV consultations, are
summarized below.

currently have access to formal financial services.
Although financial services providers make efforts to
expand their services, the majority of people in rural
communities are still financially excluded. The staff
supports the authorities’ plan to conduct a financial
literacy survey in partnership with the World Bank and
UNDP during 2011. This survey could lead to specific
projects aimed at extending financial services to
complement the banking services provided by
microfinance institutions to people in rural areas.

PNG’s financial sector

The authorities are committed to support
financial inclusion. The PNG Development Strategic
Plan 2010–2030 identifies the extension of
microfinance banking services to all districts in PNG as
a priority. In addition, the national payment system
development program aims to encourage the
introduction and use of innovative, convenient, and
cost-effective new retail payment instruments, with a
special focus on rural areas.

Total financial sector assets have grown to
roughly 95 percent of GDP and are held by a
wide range of institutions. Currently, there are four
commercial banks, seven authorized superannuation
funds, and a number of other nonbank financial
sector institutions licensed and regulated by BPNG.
General insurance companies regulated by the
Insurance Commission and the stock exchange by the
Securities Commission.
Banks and superannuation funds dominate the
financial sector. Since the financial sector reforms in
early 2000, banks have increased their assets fivefold
to almost K17 billion by end-2010. The nationally
owned Bank of South Pacific is the largest, followed
by subsidiaries of two Australian banks and a
Malaysian bank. In addition, there is a state-owned,
non-deposit taking National Development Bank, which
has a primary function of providing accessible credit to
people in rural areas. Nonbanks are important, too,
with about K7.5 billion in assets. Among them, the
authorized superannuation funds (ASFs) are the
largest, holding more than 70 percent of total
nonbank financial assets. ASFs, in terms of assets size,
are followed by the savings and loans societies,
finance and microfinance companies, and insurance
companies (including general, life, and broker).

Financial Sector Institutions

Access to finance is one of the major hurdles to
further financial sector deepening. Only about
10 percent of the population and 17 percent of adults

Overall financial sector soundness is satisfactory
Indicators point to a generally well-capitalized
and highly profitable financial sector. Credit and
market risks in the banking sector are relatively low
and can easily be offset by prevailing high levels of
capital, low levels of nonperforming loans, and high
provisions. Nonetheless, high capital ratios are
appropriate to accommodate lending to larger clients
and growing credit risk that is expected in the medium
term. Also, high concentration of the financial sector,
the absence of secondary market for government
securities, and the lack of repo and discount windows
require banks to maintain higher liquidity.
Regulation and supervision of the banking sector
has been strengthened, although several
elements will still be required to move toward a
more risk-based approach. The BPNG has been
developing its supervisory techniques since the
reforms of 2000, but it is essential that it completes
the suite of prudential standards, enhance the
available supervisory tools, and make better use of the
tools it has. The crisis management framework is
incomplete, and steps need to be taken to put this in
place.
Authorized Superannuation Funds (ASFs) are the
principal source of long-term investment. Papua
New Guinea’s demographic profile and a system of
compulsory savings in the formal sector, along with
wage growth, will ensure a positive net cash flow and

(continued)
anchor the role of these funds as a key source of
domestic savings. The ASFs and general insurers have
been performing with increasing efficiency, while
general insurers are well capitalized, profitable and
exhibit sound risk management.
The reform agenda needs to continue
Payment and settlements systems need major
reforms. The legal framework does not recognize
payment services as an independent activity, while the
lack of an inter-bank real-time payment system with
collateralized liquidity management creates systemic
risks. The clearing house operations are manual and
paper based. Establishing an independent Payment
Systems Department in the BPNG is crucial to support
regulation and oversight.
Efforts to develop the local government
securities markets need to be intensified.
Although the overall operation of the primary market
reflects best practice, banks have limited incentives to
canvass investors. Smaller investors face hurdles, as
the minimum amount to participate on a competitive
basis is high and there is no opportunity for smaller

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

investors to enter noncompetitive bids. Exposure of
PNG to international investors through the LNG
projects may provide new opportunities to attract
nonresident investors.
Improving access to financial services remains a
developmental challenge, and efforts need to be
stepped up. Around 85 percent of the adult
population is excluded from the formal sector, largely
those in rural communities. The main barriers are
operational challenges and infrastructure weaknesses,
resulting in high intermediation costs.
Further developments on AML and CFT issues
should be pursued. This should include enacting
legislation on terrorist financing and the use of
existing supervisory powers to encourage banks to
undertake detailed customer due diligence.
The establishment of a sovereign wealth fund is
under consideration, but modalities need to be
carefully designed. In view of the large revenues
anticipated from the LNG projects, a key concern for
the government is the setting-up of the appropriate
institutional and investment management
arrangements.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 20, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Papua New Guinea
On May 18, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Papua New Guinea.1
Background
Papua New Guinea has enjoyed a decade of solid economic growth, supported by greater
political stability, a sound fiscal framework, and a healthy banking sector. Nonetheless, Papua
New Guinea remains a low-income country highly exposed to commodity price fluctuations. A
weak infrastructure, problems with governance, and high crime curtails development.
The economy has weathered the global recession relatively well and real GDP growth is
estimated to have picked up from 5½ percent in 2009 to 7 percent in 2010. Higher commodity
prices and the construction of a liquefied natural gas production facility (LNG)—a 190 percent of
GDP project—have boosted the economy, while banks continued to provide finance, and
agriculture production rebounded. However, the country’s infrastructure—roads, ports and
utilities—has shown signs of capacity constraints, and bottlenecks have appeared in the
markets for skilled labor and land. Inflation has reached 7.8 percent at end-2010 and is
increasingly driven by domestic demand.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
A large fiscal impulse in place in 2009 was unwound. Higher commodity prices boosted
revenues in 2010, at the same time spending from off-budget accounts slowed. As a result,
after the deficit had reached 9½ percent of GDP in 2009, a balanced budget was almost
achieved in 2010. The Bank of Papua New Guinea has kept the policy interest rate at 7 percent
since end-2009. However, monetary conditions loosened as short-term interest rates declined
to around 3 percent and the nominal effective exchange rate depreciated by more than
7 percent in 2010.
The financial sector has weathered the global financial crises well and remains sound. Banks
are well capitalized and liquid. However, despite lowering their exposure, financial institutions
are vulnerable to a possible correction in property markets.
Although commodity prices and exports recovered in 2010, the current account deficit has
widened to 24 percent of GDP. It was, however, largely financed by FDI related to the LNG
project. External debt declined to about 11 percent of GDP at end-2010.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Papua New Guinea’s strong economic growth over the past
decade, supported by sound policies. Directors considered the near-term outlook to be
generally favorable but encouraged the authorities to consider tighter macroeconomic policies in
the face of rising inflationary pressures. Over the longer term, it would be important to
reinvigorate structural reforms to support the development of the non-mineral sector, while
ensuring effective use of mineral resources to sustain economic growth and raise living
standards.
Directors stressed the need for appropriately tight fiscal policy during the construction phase of
the liquefied natural gas plant. They welcomed the agreement on a balanced 2011 budget and
recommended strict adherence to budget allocations and the limit on trust-account spending.
Directors considered that it would be prudent to save windfall mineral revenues and use part of
such resources to reduce government debt. They also commended the government’s decision
to allocate funds to meet its superannuation obligations and called on the authorities to settle
the remaining arrears.
Directors recommended a tighter monetary policy stance to address inflationary pressures.
They considered the staff’s assessment of the real effective exchange rate and supported
greater exchange rate flexibility, while noting the need to preserve the competitiveness of the
non-mineral sector. Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to reduce excess liquidity in the
banking system by considering a further increase in the cash reserve requirement. They called
on the authorities to implement fully the decision to move all new trust accounts to the Bank of
Papua New Guinea.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to manage resource revenues through a sovereign
wealth fund (SWF). They stressed that the SWF should be well governed and adhere to the
Santiago Principles to ensure effective management and use of the resources. They also

3
considered it important to integrate use of the resources in the SWF into the budget and
macroeconomic framework, supported by strong fiscal institutions.
Directors observed that the liquefied natural gas and other resource projects provide an
opportunity to raise long-term growth and living standards. They urged the authorities to deliver
better social services—in particular, security, health, education, and basic infrastructure—to
ensure that the benefits from the mineral boom are more evenly spread among all segments of
the population. Directors encouraged the authorities to make further progress in structural
reforms to support the development of the non-mineral sector and sustain economic growth.
They also stressed the importance of firm implementation of the priorities in the authorities’
medium-term development plan.
Directors noted that the financial sector remains sound and able to withstand moderate shocks.
They urged the authorities to implement the FSAP recommendations and supported their efforts
to improve access to financial services in rural communities.

Statement by Christopher Legg, Executive Director for Papua New Guinea
and Susan Bultitude, Advisor to the Executive Director
May 13, 2011
PNG has experienced an unprecedented period of growth and stability, lasting more
than 10 years and withstanding the global financial crisis.
Our PNG authorities are now in the process of establishing a path towards
economic and social development and prosperity, as set out in the Papua New Guinea
Vision 2050 (Vision 2050). The vision aims to mobilize service delivery, wealth creation
and human capital development across seven key pillars of society and the economy. In
particular, the authorities are undertaking an ambitious reform program to harness PNG’s
significant resources wealth to improve the living standards of the entire population,
including future generations. A detailed strategy for the first stage of the Vision 2050 is
set out in the Development Strategic Plan 2010-2030 (DSP), which establishes an interim
objective of achieving middle-income status by 2030.
However, while PNG’s resources wealth provides significant opportunities, it also
imposes significant macroeconomic challenges. These include the challenge of
managing overheating pressures, and of capturing and productively investing profits from
the resources industry for the benefit of the broader community. The authorities are
keenly aware of the ‘boom and bust’ cycles experienced in other resource-rich
developing nations, and previously in PNG, and are committed to avoiding this disastrous
outcome. The establishment of an offshore sovereign wealth fund (SWF) to manage
wealth from PNG’s natural resource projects is an important component to the
authorities’ strategy to overcome the ‘boom and bust’ cycle.
Fiscal policy
The balanced budget forecast for 2011 is a significant achievement in the context of
the upcoming 2012 elections and rising public expectations of the Government’s
spending capacity. It withdraws the large fiscal impulse of the previous year and avoids
the temptation to borrow against future LNG revenues. The authorities also take note of
Staff’s recommendation that the budget be tightly managed to avoid exacerbating
overheating pressures. In this regard, they note that, on balance, it may be preferable to
take a pragmatic approach to the savings target in the Budget in order to reduce the
subsequent pressures for unplanned or unbudgeted spending.
Our authorities remain committed to a sustainable medium-term fiscal strategy
(MTFS). In relation to the evolution of the MTFS rule - most recently to allow windfall
revenues to be used for development investment instead of debt reduction while debt is
below 30 per cent of GDP - they emphasize the need for fiscal rules to be both
conceptually sound and politically realistic. The objective must be to build credibility by
reinforcing political commitment to a binding but achievable framework, rather than risk
eroding commitment to a framework which is too inflexible. Moreover, they note that,
for countries such as PNG with relatively low levels of Government debt and large

2
development needs, further debt reduction may not always be the most productive use of
windfall revenues.
Trust fund and other off-budget accounts are being better integrated into the
budget and public financial management frameworks. As part of the 2012 Budget
process, the Government will require agencies to report on public monies held in trust
accounts, including by reconciling actual spending, projecting future spending, providing
details on how the funds will be spent, and identifying the legal authority for the
operation of the trust account.
Our authorities agree that the quality of development spending is crucial if resources
wealth is to be translated into genuine improvements in living standards across the
economy. To this end, the Medium-Term Development Plan 2011-2015 (MTDP), which
establishes the framework for development spending in accordance with the DSP and
Vision 2050, has been designed to address the main shortcomings of its predecessor, the
Medium Term Development Strategy. In particular, the MTDP is policy-based, focuses
on seven key priority areas, seeks to create a greater sense of ownership among local
communities, and involves improved planning processes including harmonization
between recurrent and development spending and between provisional and national
programs. The authorities are also investing in stronger public financial management and
monitoring and reporting systems.
Monetary policy
Our authorities agree that inflation is a key risk given the economy’s capacity
constraints and the additional demand associated with the construction of the LNG
project. They are closely monitoring inflation developments, including through monthly
meetings between the Bank of PNG, Treasury and the Treasurer which track the
performance of the budget and its implications for inflation.
The authorities have taken a number of steps to withdraw liquidity from the
economy, including requiring new Government trust accounts to be opened with the
Bank of PNG instead of commercial banks, and allowing contractors involved in the
construction of the LNG project to hold offshore accounts and pay for imported materials
used for the project directly from these accounts. Further increases in the cash reserve
requirement are also being considered by the Bank of PNG.
The Bank of PNG also stands ready to tighten monetary policy as necessary to
contain inflation within single-digits, while being mindful that prematurely tightening
monetary policy could unnecessarily retard growth. The Bank expects inflation to fall
short of this threshold in 2011, at 8.5 percent.
The authorities are taking steps to improve the quality of inflation data, including by
using the 2010 household income and expenditure survey to update the CPI basket.

3
Exchange rate policy
Our authorities continue to support a floating Kina. The Bank of PNG’s intervention
in the exchange market is guided by its price stability objectives, and is primarily
designed to provide liquidity, especially to smaller institutions, given that there are few
participants in the market. Two-way movement of the Kina is accommodated and the
Bank has been a net seller of foreign reserves.
An appreciating Kina will bring challenges as well as benefits. While acknowledging
that further appreciation of the Kina as LNG revenues begin to flow may help to reduce
imported inflation and overheating pressures, the authorities are also conscious of its
distribution implications. Whereas inflation impacts particularly on the urban poor, Kina
appreciation is particularly damaging to rural citizens relying on export cash crops, such
as coffee, cocoa and copra. With 85 per cent of the population living in rural areas with
limited alternative sources of income, the impact of Kina appreciation is likely to be
widespread. Moreover, Kina appreciation will exacerbate the challenges of developing
the non-minerals sector in order to diversify the economy.
Sovereign wealth fund
The Government will establish an offshore sovereign wealth fund (SWF) to manage
the revenue inflows from the LNG and mineral projects, and their impact on the
economy. The SWF will comprise three components - a savings fund, a stabilization
fund, and an infrastructure fund. The objectives of the SWF are to: promote savings to
finance future spending and smooth Government spending over the long term, insulate
the budget and the economy from destabilizing movements in commodity prices and
output, and provide capital for the delivery of strategic nation-building infrastructure.
The SWF will be funded from the dividend and tax revenue from mineral projects, in
addition to the LNG project. Drawdown arrangements are under discussion, and will be
integrated into the budget framework.
The SWF will operate in accordance with international standards and be subject to
a high degree of legislative protection. The SWF will comply with the Generally
Accepted Principles and Practices (Santiago Principles) established by the International
Working Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds. The PNG authorities will also consider
participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative once the SWF has been
established. To avoid future political interference with the operation of the Fund, the
legislation establishing the SWF will require a two-thirds majority vote by Parliament to
be amended.
Cross-departmental bodies have been established to reach a consensus on the design
and operation of the SWF. A Secretaries Committee chaired by the Secretary of the
Treasury and including the Governor of the Bank of PNG is overseeing the establishment
of the SWF. It is being supported by an inter-departmental working group.

4
Our authorities are committed to having the legislation establishing the SWF in
place before the 2012 elections. Given the uncertainty about the political landscape
following the elections, the authorities wish to build upon the current high level of
consensus and seek passage of the laws establishing the SWF by early 2012.
Our PNG authorities would like to thank Fund staff for the timely technical assistance
that is being provided to facilitate the establishment of the SWF.
Structural reforms
Our PNG authorities are pursuing wide-ranging structural reforms to mobilize
investment under the guidance of the Vision 2050, DSP and MTDP.
Land development is a particular priority, as less than 5 per cent of PNG’s land mass
is currently available in the formal market, largely reflecting PNG’s unique and diverse
arrangements for customary ownership of land. The authorities are piloting new
mechanisms for facilitating land leasing by groups of traditional landowners, under
arrangements that protect the rights of both landowners and investors. The MTDP also
provides for strengthening land administration, including through computerized land
titling and land use records, streamlining dispute resolution and reducing the backlog of
unresolved disputes, and introducing a Land Use Planning Scheme.
Another key priority is improving law, order and justice, as crime has become a
significant deterrent to investment and tourism in recent decades. The immediate
emphasis is on rebuilding the sector’s capacity through the employment of additional
police and court officers, improved training, establishment of new police stations and
village courts, and more reliable payment of judicial officers. Additionally, the
authorities will seek to address the backlog of court cases through additional judicial
positions and early resolution of new cases at the community level.
The Government will also pursue policies to diversify the economy, by supporting
improved productivity and market access for sectors such as agriculture, livestock,
forestry, fishing, manufacturing and tourism. A range of initiatives have been identified
to develop small- and medium-sized enterprises and foster local entrepreneurs, such as
microfinancing, training courses, better access to markets and reducing the regulatory
barriers to establishing a business.
Investment in human capital and transport, utilities and communications
infrastructure will support economic development across the economy. Providing
access to markets and social services remains challenging in PNG, which has some of the
most rugged terrain and isolated communities in the world. The Government has
identified ten ‘economic corridors’ where physical and social infrastructure development
will be targeted, in order to maximize economies of scale and focus on areas where the
gains are likely to be the greatest.

5
Financial sector
PNG’s financial system remains well-capitalised and profitable. The banks have
limited off-shore borrowing requirements, low loan-to-deposit ratios, high levels of
liquidity, and low non-performing loans.
Banks are well-provisioned against future risks. Banks maintain a healthy degree of
caution as to the risks associated with the mining projects and their impacts on asset
prices. They have tightened their lending standards and reduced their exposure to
property markets.
The PNG authorities welcome the findings of the Financial System Stability
Assessment (FSSA) and take note of its recommendations. They will continue to
strengthen regulation and supervisory techniques and bolster the crisis management
framework. The authorities have also commenced a National Payments project to
strengthen clearance and settlement infrastructure, which will combine financial stability
objectives with the goal of improving financial inclusiveness. Other financial inclusion
initiatives include mobile banking and payments services, financial education and
microfinance.
