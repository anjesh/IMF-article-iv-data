Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation Discussions
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Djibouti

Approved by Amor Tahari and Scott Brown
April 16, 2007

•

Discussions for the 2007 Article IV consultation were held in Djibouti during
January 7–21, 2007. The staff team comprised Messrs. Guillaume (head),
Bouhga-Hagbe, Iradian, Pani, and Thiam (all MCD). Mr. Schlotterbeck (FAD)
provided technical assistance in the area of tax administration. The mission was
assisted by Mr. de Schaetzen, the Fund resident representative in Djibouti.
Mr. Bah, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director for Djibouti, participated in
the discussions.

•

The mission met with Central Bank Governor Mr. Djama M. Haïd; Minister
of Finance Mr. Ali Farah Assoweh; Secretary General of the Government
Mr. Mohamed Hassan Abdillahi, and representatives of various government
agencies, the banking sector, the business community, nongovernmental
agencies, and the donor community.

•

Djibouti accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on
September 19, 1980, and maintains an exchange system that is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions. Djibouti’s exchange rate regime is a peg to the U.S. dollar under a
currency board arrangement that has been in place since 1949. The peg has
been unchanged since 1973.

•

Djibouti has indicated its willingness to participate in the General Data
Dissemination Standard (GDDS). Djibouti’s statistical base is very weak, and
barely adequate to conduct surveillance.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Focus of the report
The discussions for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Djibouti focused on (a) the medium-term
growth prospects and policies necessary to ensure that growth is broad-based and accompanied by
sufficient employment creation, (b) policies to enhance medium-term fiscal sustainability, while
reducing poverty, and (c) key financial sector reforms.
Background
Real GDP growth is estimated at 4.8 percent in 2006, driven by fiscal expansion, and a sizeable
private investment in the port and construction sectors. Consumer price inflation has increased
slightly from 3.1 percent on average in 2005 to 3.6 percent in 2006, reflecting mainly increases in
the prices of food, housing, and water and electricity. Broad money growth remained stable in 2006.
Domestic liquidity grew, supported by the favorable economic environment and financing
conditions. The fiscal stance was slightly restrictive in 2005, but expansionary in 2006, with the
base fiscal deficit—domestic revenues minus domestically financed spending—widening from
2 percent of GDP in 2005 to 7.1 percent in 2006. The external current account is estimated to have
shifted from a small surplus in 2005 to a deficit of 9 percent of GDP in 2006, following a surge in
imports mostly related to new foreign direct investment.
Views of the authorities
The authorities are aware of the need to ensure that favorable growth prospects are not limited to an
enclave around the port, but generate sufficient employment for all Djiboutians and help reduce
poverty. In this context, the president launched a “National Initiative for Social Development.” The
authorities also indicated that the government intends to reduce the base fiscal deficit. At the same
time, they intend to review the overall tax framework, including by preparing the introduction of a
value-added tax (VAT), and a Common External Tariff (CET). The authorities view the current
currency board arrangement as necessary to maintain financial stability. They have requested an
evaluation program under the joint Fund-World Bank Financial Stability Assessment Program to
help address the new challenges raised by the rapid expansion of the banking system.
Staff recommendations
The staff encouraged the authorities to develop a medium-term poverty reduction strategy with the
assistance of the World Bank, and to enhance competitiveness through macroeconomic and
structural reform measures. Key structural reforms include adopting an integrated strategy to reduce
energy production costs, fully implementing the new labor code, and improving the efficiency of
the judiciary system and good governance. Staff stressed the need to improve tax revenues by
simplifying the tax regime and reviewing tax exemptions, and to reduce the size of the wage bill, by
implementing effectively the ongoing civil service reform, including through the elimination of all
ghost workers. It also underscored the need for greater fiscal discipline through strict adherence to
the budget, and no accumulation of new domestic or external arrears. Staff also urged the authorities
to strengthen the architecture of the financial sector, develop new monetary policy instruments to
gain better control over monetary liquidity, and enhance the supervision capabilities of the central
bank. It urged the authorities to strengthen the statistical base to facilitate the formulation and
monitoring of macroeconomic policies.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Djibouti’s performance under a previous PRGF arrangement and two
staff-monitored programs (SMP) was mixed (Box 1). Real GDP growth accelerated
somewhat in recent years, and consumer price inflation remained low (Figure 1). Fiscal
performance was, however, generally weak, although improving in 2005 as the result of
expenditure restraint (Figure 2). Cash management was typically strained, with the recurrent
emergence of new external and domestic arrears. Implementation of structural reforms has
generally been slow.
Box 1. Performance Under the July–December 2005 Staff-Monitored Program (SMP)
All quantitative fiscal targets were largely met (Table 8). However, mostly because of
higher-than-programmed reimbursements of domestic and external arrears, the cash
situation of the treasury remained strained resulting in the accumulation of new domestic
and external arrears, and some small deviations from the quantitative monetary targets.1
Most external arrears accumulated in 2005 have been repaid in early 2006.
On the structural side, only limited progress was made in making the economy more
competitive and improving fiscal management. A new Labor Code was adopted in
December 2005; most technical work related to the introduction of a single registry file for
the civil service has been completed; and several steps were taken towards the introduction
of a value-added tax (Table 9).
__________________________
1

This accumulation of arrears resulted from a large repayment of arrears towards Arab donors ahead of the
December Round Table, and the unbudgeted repayment of one additional month of wage arrears.

2.
Djibouti’s growth prospects have improved considerably, anchored in the
development of the port. The authorities’ strategy has been to foster the involvement of
foreign investors and Arab donors in building essential infrastructure. As a result, very large
foreign direct investment will help develop services around the port and the expansion of
exports over the medium term.
3.
The main policy issues discussed during the consultations were (a) the need to
ensure growth is broadly based and accompanied by sufficient employment creation,
(b) policies to enhance medium-term fiscal sustainability, while reducing poverty, and
(c) key financial sector reforms. Djibouti is facing particularly high unemployment and
poverty rates—respectively estimated at 50–60 and 42 percent in 2002, albeit informal
employment is largely underestimated. A major challenge ahead for Djibouti is therefore to
ensure that growth is not confined to an enclave around the port, and results in an increase of
local employment and improved fiscal revenue. This will require measures to significantly
improve competitiveness and more determined implementation of structural reforms.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Growth was strong in 2006. Real GDP growth is estimated at 4.8 percent in 2006,
driven by fiscal expansion, and large foreign direct investment (FDI) in the port and
construction sectors. The share of investment in GDP grew from 19 percent in 2005 to
about 30 percent in 2006. Consumer price inflation is estimated to have risen slightly from
3.1 percent on average in 2005 to 3.6 percent in 2006, reflecting mainly increases in the
prices of food, housing, water, and electricity.
5.
Broad money growth continued its trend deceleration of the past few years
in 2006 at about 10 percent (Figure 3). Domestic liquidity grew, supported by the favorable
economic environment and financing conditions. The share of foreign currency deposits in
total deposits decreased slightly to 56 percent in 2006. After several years of decline, credit
to the private sector increased by about 9 percent, primarily benefiting those sectors with
business related to the direct or indirect implementation of foreign direct investment.
6.
A surge in imports largely financed by foreign investment led to a deterioration
of the trade and current account balances (Figure 4). As a consequence the external
current account is estimated to have shifted from a small surplus in 2005 to a deficit of
9 percent of GDP in 2006. However, the large capital and financial account surplus has more
than offset the deficit in the current account, resulting in an increase in gross official reserves
to US$117 million at end-2006 (equivalent to 3.2 months of imports of goods and services
and a currency board cover of 109 percent).
7.
The Djibouti franc has continued to depreciate in real effective terms in 2006 but
competitiveness remains weak (Box 2). Tentative staff’s estimates of the equilibrium real
effective exchange rate suggest that the actual real effective exchange rate was substantially
overvalued in the 1990s (about 40 percent above the equilibrium rate in 1994–96), but the
gap with the equilibrium rate has since narrowed significantly, as a result of higher efficiency
and productivity of the port and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis the Euro since
2001.1 These estimates do not, however, take into account recent and projected future current
account deficits and the expected sharp increase in external debt over the medium term. More
generally, a variety of indicators suggest that competitiveness remains weak, as reflected by
high electricity, labor, and other domestic production costs, low skill levels, a labor
productivity negatively affected by khat2 consumption, and a weak institutional environment
1

Estimates are derived using coefficient estimates in IMF’s Working Paper No. 06/236, which applies
Edwards’ methodology to a panel of WAEMU countries. These estimates are not based on Djibouti-specific
parameter estimates, and should be seen as only suggestive of changes of Djibouti’s equilibrium real effective
exchange rate, and as an additional indicator of developments of Djibouti’s competitiveness over the past
25 years.

Leaves of the khat tree contain the alkaloid cathinone, a mild amphetamine-like stimulant. Khat leaves are
chewed fresh, usually in the afternoon since most of the khat consumed in Djibouti arrives on a special midday
flight from Ethiopia and is then swiftly distributed throughout the country.

8.
The fiscal stance turned from slightly restrictive in 2005 to strongly expansionary in
2006. The base fiscal deficit—domestic revenues minus domestically financed spending—
widening from 2 percent of GDP in 2005 to 7.1 percent in 2006, as outlays related to regional
elections and the summit of Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)
countries were only partly offset by the good revenue performance. The overall fiscal balance on
a commitment basis also worsened slightly from a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2005 to a
deficit of 2.4 percent in 2006, despite higher payments from the United States for the lease of
their military base. The stock of domestic arrears increased by 0.2 percent of GDP in 2006.
9.
After a period of downsizing with the closure of troubled banks, the banking sector
has been rapidly expanding. The banking sector is well capitalized and profitable, and banks
have progressively reduced their portfolio of nonperforming loans. The arrival of two new
foreign banks in 2006, with four more slated in 2007, is expected to foster competition by
reducing borrowing costs and widening the range of financial instruments such as off-shore and
Islamic type products, and instruments for small- and medium-sized enterprises, away from
traditional trade financing.
10.
The implementation of structural reforms remained weak. The adoption of a new—
more flexible—labor code in December 2005 is yet to be enforced by the adoption of
implementation decrees and the renegotiation of sectoral collective agreements. The single
registry file for the civil service is well-advanced, but not yet implemented. A civil service
reform was initiated in early 2006, but the physical audit of the civil service has not been
finalized, and the subsequent phases, the organizational and strategic audit are yet to start.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
Medium-term growth prospects have improved considerably as a result of the
government’s development strategy to transform Djibouti into a trade and services
platform for the COMESA region, centered around a modern deepwater port (Box 3). This
made it possible to attract at least US$1.4 billion (equivalent to 180 percent of 2006 GDP) of
confirmed foreign financed investment, mostly private, over 2005–11.
12.
The authorities are determined to ensure that growth is not limited to an enclave
around the port, and that it generates sufficient employment for all Djiboutians and helps
reduce poverty. In this context, the president announced in January 2007 a “National Initiative
for Social Development” that aims at promoting basic social services particularly to the
vulnerable segments of the population, and modernizing production to create more jobs. The
mission welcomed the initiative, and encouraged the authorities, with the assistance of the World
Bank, to translate it into a time-bound action plan with specific benchmarks defined within a
medium-term fiscal framework possibly in the context of the preparation of a draft new PRSP.
The mission also urged the authorities to maintain macroeconomic stability, and to implement
decisively the structural reforms needed to foster the development of small- and medium-sized
enterprises.

13
Box 3. Growth Prospects and Key Challenges in Djibouti
Building on its strategic location on the horn of Africa and political stability, Djibouti has succeeded in attracting at
least $1.4 billion of confirmed FDI and loans from mostly Arab creditors over 2005–11 (equivalent to 180 percent of
its 2006 GDP).1/ These investments are anchored on the development of the port, managed by Dubai Ports World
(DPW), and are aimed at transforming Djibouti into a regional service hub through the creation of a modern deep-sea
port (with a 240,000 cubic meters storage oil terminal, a container terminal, and a bulk terminal); an upgrade of
Northern and Southern roads to Ethiopia, and new access roads to Northern parts of the country; the modernization
of the railway to Ethiopia under private management by COMAZAR; the transformation of the airport in a regional
cargo hub; and increased competition in telecommunications. These large investments will put the economy on a
higher growth path in the range of 5–7 percent annually for the next few years.

The main growth sectors are:
•

Cattle trade for up to 4 million of sheep, camels, and cows per year, from Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia,
to Saudi Arabia, and potentially other Middle-Eastern countries such as Egypt, Jordan, and Syria;

•

Tourism sector with the construction of one 5-star hotel (to be expanded to 1,000 rooms) and potentially several
other 4- and 5-star hotels, and the development of diving sites and casinos;

•

A commercial and industrial Free Trade Zone (FTZ) around the port expected to attract businesses currently in
Dubai FTZ to cater for the COMESA market;

•

Construction of private housing and industrial buildings;

•

Banking system with the establishment of at least six new banks, in addition to the two existing French bank
subsidiaries, and the provision of new financial products, such as Islamic financing and possibly off-shore
banking for the region.

There are, however, considerable challenges ahead to ensure a steady flow of FDI, and generate broad-based,
pro-poor growth that is accompanied by the creation of sufficient productive employment opportunities for the local
labor force:
•

Continued commitment to macroeconomic stability in the face of large capital inflows, particularly a prudent
fiscal stance to contain potential inflationary pressures;

•

Substantial improvement in external competitiveness;

•

Development of the private sector outside of the FTZ, in particular the creation of small- and medium-sized
enterprises;

•

Other structural reforms, including reduction in the production cost of electricity; training of the labor force to
meet new market needs; and improvement in the business environment and the judiciary system.
_________________________
1/ Loans are at concessional terms with terms varying from interest rate of 0.75 percent, 10 year grace period, and
50 year maturity, to interest rate of 3 percent, 5 year grace period, and 20 year maturity.

14
13.
Medium-term growth prospects are not without risks. A possible worsening of the
political and security situation in Somalia and in the rest of the region could adversely affect
Djibouti’s development prospects, which are highly dependent on regional trade. In addition,
sustaining high levels of investment will require sounder and more effective institutions. On the
positive side, the current favorable growth prospects could be considerably enhanced if an oil
refinery project of $4–6 billion (equivalent to 7–9 times the 2006 GDP), with a capacity of
250,000 barrels a day, currently under discussion with potential investors, is firmed up.
A. Fiscal Policy
14.
Fiscal policy in 2007 will continue to be expansionary. The overall deficit is projected
to widen to 3.4 percent of GDP, reflecting planned disbursements of investment loans from Arab
donors. The base deficit is assumed to narrow to 3.7 percent of GDP, mostly as result of keeping
the wage bill constant in real terms, and limiting expenditure on goods and services to their
medium-term level (excluding the one-time spending related to the COMESA summit in 2006).
Tax revenues are projected to remain constant in terms of the GDP outside of the FTZ. The
authorities also intend to slow down the repayment of domestic arrears to DF 1.2 billion per year,
and to increase somewhat the stock of government deposits at banks to facilitate cash
management.
15.
The authorities aim at a modest reduction of base fiscal deficit in the medium term.
The staff argued that this would leave little room for potential slippages, and that the base fiscal
balance should be in surplus over the medium term. This would ensure sufficient rebuilding of
government reserves at the central bank to help avoid the recurrent emergence of arrears, and
allow the repayment of accumulated domestic arrears in line with the original 10-year plan
adopted in 2002.
16.
The authorities intend to review the overall tax framework with a view to facilitate
the creation of new enterprises, starting with the introduction of a value-added tax (VAT)
and a Common External Tariff (CET) to replace the existing consumption tax, in the
context of the COMESA (Box 4). In cooperation with customs from Dubai and with the help of
external technical assistance, they also intend to strengthen revenue administration. The staff
concurred on the need for an in-depth review of the tax system ahead of the introduction of a
VAT, and against the backdrop of a potential erosion of the tax base resulting from advantages
granted in the context of the FTZ.

15
Box 4. Tax Reform and the Introduction of VAT
In line with their commitment with the COMESA and the European Union under the
Economic Partnership Agreement, the authorities are planning to adopt a Common
External Tariff (TEC) and a Value-Added Tax (VAT) in 2008–09 to replace the
existing consumption tax.
In that context, the authorities have made some progress in improving tax
administration, most notably through the modernization of the department of indirect
revenues with the introduction of the MIRSAL and SAS software, and an improvement
in the functioning of the Large Taxpayer Office (LTO).
Several key measures need to be taken before the introduction of the VAT, including:
•

In the tax policy area, the adoption of the structure of the CET, the revision of
exemption regimes, and the determination of the rates for the VAT;

•

In the tax administration area, the enhancement of the LTO, the adoption and
implementation of a strategy to improve tax compliance and recover tax arrears,
and enhanced cooperation between customs and tax departments.

A permanent project team in charge of the introduction of the VAT, with external
technical assistance, and a clear timetable, is also essential.

17.
On the expenditure side, the staff urged the authorities to take additional measures
to reduce the size of the wage bill to less than 10 percent of GDP to reduce the base fiscal
deficit and finance potential additional spending entailed by the National Initiative for
Social Development. While the authorities noted that several measures were currently being
contemplated to contain the public wage bill, including increasing the number of hours worked
by teachers and possibly extending it to the entire civil service, laying off ghost workers, and
rationalizing the system of indemnities, they indicated that no political decision had yet been
taken. The staff also urged them to effectively implement the ongoing civil service reform with
technical assistance of the World Bank, with a view to reducing the size of the wage bill and
increasing substantially productivity, while ensuring that developmental and social needs are
covered and that the sustainability of the pension funds is ensured.
18.
The authorities indicated that negotiations were under way to purchase oil at a
preferential price from Arab countries, and that subsidies or transfers to the Electricity
Company would be therefore halted, and electricity tariffs would not be raised further. A
grant of about US$7 million had already been received in 2006 for the purchase of fuel in July
and August. Investment financed by Arab donors would also help replace inefficient turbines.

16
The staff underscored that if no agreement was reached on preferential oil prices for the
electricity company, substantial spending cut elsewhere (up to 1 percent of GDP) will be needed
to avoid raising further electricity tariffs, which would hurt the economy and the poor. It also
stressed the need to develop a strategy to substantially reduce electricity costs and put the
electricity company on a sound financial footing. The authorities indicated that they intended to
divest industrial public enterprises.
19.
The staff urged the authorities to strengthen considerably public financial
management and fiscal transparency in order to avoid unbudgeted expenditures and the
recurrent emergence of arrears by tightening cash management, streamlining government
accounts with a view to introducing a single treasury account, incorporating extra budgetary
funds and accounts in the budget, revising budget classification in line with 2001 GFS Manual,
and reinforcing controls on budget execution. The staff also stressed the need to develop a
medium-term budget framework. The authorities noted that they will review the bidding process
for public projects with the assistance of the World Bank.
20.
The authorities concurred with the staff that the ongoing rapid accumulation of new
debt put the country at a high risk of debt distress (Appendix I). Notwithstanding the fact that
most of the projected investment is privately financed, the stock of public debt would increase
substantially from 56 percent of GDP in 2006 to 71 percent in 2011. The staff therefore urged the
authorities to reevaluate the prioritization of new projects and their effectiveness in reducing
poverty in the context of their forthcoming medium-term strategy. It also stressed the need to
receive external financing mostly in the form of grants or highly concessional loans, and to
strengthen considerably debt management, including through the development of a medium-term
debt strategy.
B. Exchange Rate, Monetary, and Financial Policies
21.
The authorities view the currency board arrangement as appropriate to maintain
financial stability and to develop Djibouti as a financial center. They noted that the currency
board and stable parity since 1973 have helped maintain low inflation, attract large deposits from
neighboring countries, and encourage a large flow of foreign investment. The staff agreed that
maintaining the currency board arrangement—as opposed to moving to a more flexible exchange
rate policy—would be more appropriate at present in view of the high degree of dollarization in
the economy and the limited development of financial markets. However, staff noted that despite
recent developments further improvement in competitiveness is needed, and this will require
macroeconomic and structural measures (Box 2).
22.
The authorities view the development of monetary instruments as useful to mitigate
possible inflationary pressures in coordination with tighter fiscal policy. The staff urged
them to consider introducing new instruments such as reserve requirements within the
framework allowed by the Banking Law, financial securities issued by the central bank. To
preserve the integrity of the currency board, which does not allow for the financing of

17
government deficit, the authorities would not favor the issuance of Treasury bills. Increased
competition among banks should also lead to a reduction of the spread between lending and
deposit rates.
23.
The authorities are aware of the challenges stemming from the expansion of the
banking system, particularly with regard to Islamic and offshore operations. They view
these developments as potentially stimulating competition among banks and widening the offer
of financial products. The staff reiterated the importance of strengthening the financial sector. In
this context, it supported the authorities’ request for an evaluation program under the joint
Fund-World Bank Financial Stability Assessment Program, scheduled for the Fall 2007, to assess
the vulnerabilities of the newly enlarged banking system, and develop recommendations
regarding its architecture.
23.
The authorities concurred on the need to strengthen banking supervision. The staff
underscored the importance of (i) amending the banking law to incorporate accounting and
regulations standards appropriate for banks that operate in accordance with Islamic principles;
(ii) conducting risk self assessments of banks; (iii) improving the central bank’s staffing and staff
skills in banking supervision and draw a plan for more regular onsite and offsite supervision;
(iv) developing an early warning system to detect bank vulnerability and crisis situations;
(v) granting banking licenses in line with Basle core principles; and (vi) developing an action
plan to deal expeditiously with troubled banks. The authorities also intend to take steps to
modernize the payments system.
24.
The authorities are taking steps to strengthen Anti-Money Laundering regulations,
notably to incorporate references to the financing of terrorism with the assistance of the
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The mandate of the Financial Intelligence Unit in
place at the Central Bank since 2006 will also be clarified.
C. Structural Reforms and Poverty Reduction Strategy
25.
Discussions on structural issues focused on reforms needed to enhance
competitiveness and on the authorities’ Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). The staff, in
coordination with the World Bank, stressed the need to develop without delays an overall
strategy in the energy sector to reduce production costs and integrate various ongoing initiatives,
such as the planned connection with the Ethiopian grid, the installation of wind farms, the
development of geothermal energy, and the possible installation of an oil refinery. Reducing
energy costs is also important to give to the poor greater access to basic services. The staff
welcomed the adoption of the new labor code as a first step towards enhancing the flexibility of
labor markets, and urged the authorities to speed up its full implementation. The staff also
underscored the need to enhance the efficiency of the judiciary system.

18
26.
With the technical assistance of the World Bank, the authorities are finalizing a
Progress Report for the first PRS paper covering the period 2004–06. A draft full PRS paper
covering the period 2008–10 is expected to be finalized by end-2007, and a full PRSP will be
prepared in 2008 on the basis of a new population census and household income and expenditure
survey.
D. Data and Other Issues
27.
Data provision is barely adequate for surveillance purposes. Weaknesses are
particularly significant in the area of national accounts, the trade balance, and external debt
management. In addition, key data, particularly inflation and fiscal data, are produced with
considerable lag. The staff welcomed the authorities’ metadata submissions, which will
eventually lead to Djibouti’s participation in the General Data Dissemination System.
28.
Djibouti participated in its first WTO trade policy review in 2006. Although
some progress was recognized by the WTO, several concerns were raised, such as
Djibouti’s high consumption tax which is not paid on domestically produced goods and services.
This concern should be allayed by the planned introduction of a value-added tax (VAT) by
2008–09.
29.
The authorities have expressed the wish to begin discussions on a PRGF-supported
program. They consider such a program as potentially enhancing Djibouti's attractiveness to
foreign investors and helping mobilize donor assistance to reduce poverty.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Medium-term growth prospects are favorable, but may not be sufficient to lead to a
significant reduction in unemployment and poverty. While the authorities’ strategy to attract
foreign direct investment is starting to bear fruit, reforms to enhance Djibouti’s competitiveness
and prudent economic policies are critical to ensure a broad-based growth that is accompanied by
sufficient employment creation. It is important that these challenges be addressed in the new
National Initiative for Social Development.
31.
Containing potential inflationary pressures and ensuring fiscal and debt
sustainability will require a cautious fiscal stance. In light of the erosion of the tax base
related to the FTZ regime, it is essential to enhance tax revenues by a simplification of the tax
system, a reduction of tax exemptions, and effective preparation for the introduction of the VAT.
The size of the wage bill should be reduced over time by a decisive implementation of the
ongoing civil service reform, including the elimination of all ghost workers and putting in place
meaningful controls on hiring. It is also essential to strengthen debt management in the period
ahead given the high risk of debt distress.

19
32.
Greater fiscal discipline and transparency is needed through strict adherence to the
budget. Keeping expenditure within the budget ceiling is particularly important given the risk
posed by possible losses of the electricity company. Cash management should also be greatly
improved, and the accumulation of any new external or domestic arrears avoided.
33.
The rapid expansion of the financial system is expected to lead to increased
competition, but will require a strengthening of the role of the central bank. In particular, it
is essential that the central bank reinforces substantially its supervision capacities, and that
central bank and banking laws and regulations be adapted to tailor for the introduction of new
financial instruments. The central bank should also start developing monetary policy
instruments.
34.
The staff agrees with the authorities’ decision to maintain the existing peg to the
dollar under the currency board arrangement—as opposed to moving to a more flexible
exchange rate policy—given the high degree of dollarization of the economy, the limited
domestic financial markets, and the lack of available monetary instruments. However, while
improving in recent years, competitiveness of the economy needs to be strengthened further
through macroeconomic and structural reform measures. The latter should include, inter alia,
the adoption of a strategy to reduce electricity production costs, full implementation of the new
labor code through the completion of sectoral collective agreements, improvement in the
functioning of the judiciary, and good governance.
35.
Improving the statistical base is essential to facilitate the formulation and
monitoring of macroeconomic policies. The development of an effective strategy to alleviate
poverty and reduce unemployment will also be greatly facilitated by the planned population
census, and labor market and household income and expenditure surveys.
36.
Regarding the authorities’ wish to begin discussions on a PRGF-supported
program, staff agrees that such program would enhance prospects of structural reforms.
While discussions could be initiated as soon as key structural benchmarks not met under the
2005 SMP have been implemented and the authorities have prepared a medium-term reform
strategy, agreement on a potential new PRGF arrangement would require the authorities to
produce a new PRSP document, and on agreement on measures to improve data provision,
strengthen fiscal discipline, and enhance external competitiveness.
37.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation discussions with Djibouti be held on
the standard 12-month cycle.

4/ Estimates for 2006 are preliminary, and reflect mostly expenditure related to the COMESA meeting in
November 2006. Some of this spending might need to be reclassified as investment expenditure.
5/ Excluding housing subsidies. In 2006, it includes subsidies to the EDD for DF 500 million to cover
losses incurred in 2005. These subsidies are not projected to reoccur in the medium term, as the EDD
intends to contain costs by purchasing oil at concessional prices from Arab donors, as in 2006, and by
developing alternative sources of energy.
6/ For 2007, it is assumed that the government will repay all outstanding arrears, excluding those relating to debt
toward Spain and Italy that has not been restructured.
7/ Defined as domestic revenue minus expenditure financed from domestic sources.

1/ The increase since 2007 derives from enhanced exports of cattle and fish.
2/ Includes value-added produced in the free-trade zone.
3/ The increase in imports during the projection period reflects rising investment on the new port facility and free zone, as well as imports of cattle for re-export.
4/ Includes the French and U.S. contributions for the military bases.
5/ Previously counted as errors and omissions.
6/ Outflows in 2003 reflect an exceptional repatriation of illegal immigrants (authorities' estimates).

8/ Including repayments to the IMF.
9/ Includes both changes in overdue and non-overdue obligations, secured debt relief, and program financing from IMF, AMF, World Bank, and AfDB. Positive
values after 2006 are related to the accumulation of arrears on debt service obligations to Spain under dispute.

Scheduled for Adoption

Progress

Publish the 2003 report of the
Chamber of Accounts and Fiscal
Discipline in the Journal Officiel.

End-September 2005

Completed.

Publish a detailed report on
priority social expenditure for
2004 on the ministry of finance
website.

End-September 2005

Completed.

Adoption of the new labor code
by the National Assembly.

End-December 2005

Completed: Code adopted by the
National Assembly in December
2005 and published in the JO on
February 28, 2006.

Publish the audited 2004
financial statements of public
enterprises (Djibouti Télécom,
EDD, and ONED)

Partially completed. Financial
statements approved by the board of
directors but not published in overall
form on the IMF website.

Finalize the project to unify and
simplify the system of tax
exemptions by merging the
various preferential tax regimes
and including the remaining
exemptions in the general tax
code.

End-December 2005

Partially completed. Coordination of
the investment code and the general
tax code completed. The texts on
investment still need to be
harmonized and the exemptions
granted by special decree prior to
introduction of the VAT need to be
eliminated.

Finalize the unified registry of
civil servants in 2005 and adopt
it in 2006.

End-December 2005

Partially completed.
The IT application seems to have
been finalized and tested. However,
the payroll and civil service records
are still not integrated. Final record
expected in the first half of 2007.

Finalize the computerization of
the expenditure chain.

End-December 2005

Partially completed. New software
(WMONEY) apparently in use in the
MF. Development of the conceptual
scheme, as well as of all the
specified functionalities, pilot testing,
and the connection of other
ministries to the network remain to
be done.

1/ For the last four structural targets, the outcome only applies to the July–December 2005 program.

29

Table 9. Djibouti: Structural Benchmarks for the July–December 2005
Staff-Monitored Program 1/ (concluded)
Structural Reforms

Scheduled for Adoption

Progress

Establish a new timetable for
finalizing the code of commerce
in 2006

End-December 2005

Partially completed, but no recent
progress. Mid-term report submitted
in mid-February 2006. A new
schedule has been completed by the

provisional code is expected to be
discussed with the authorities
between June-September, 2007
before being finalized.

Adopt proposed measures for
the VAT.

End-December 2005

Partially completed. Implementation
of the envisaged actions has fallen
behind the initial schedule. The

property to the SGE, the start of the
work of the survey teams, the
system-wide IT rollout, and the
inauguration of the power of the
government to supervise enterprises
in the free trade zone remain.
Implementation of the action plan for
the introduction of the VAT (project
group, timetable, work sequence)
will require external technical
assistance.

Adhere strictly to the monthly
cash flow plan.

exchanges with ONED and
Djibouti Télécom.

Ongoing

Not completed. The practice of
exchanging checks continues.

are transfers between budget
categories.

The government will report
monetary and external debt data
and the TOFE to the IMF each
quarter, within a period of four
weeks.

Completed as far as the monetary
data are concerned.
Partially completed for the TOFE,
which is sometimes submitted late.
Partially completed for the debt
figures, which are submitted late.

APPENDIX I. DJIBOUTI: JOINT FUND-WORLD BANK DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS (DSA)
This DSA, prepared in close cooperation between the Fund and Bank staff, updates the previous
DSA prepared in September 2005. The results show that despite a realistic high-investment,
moderate-growth baseline scenario, the long-term risk of debt distress is high. Specifically, the
NPV of the debt-to-GDP ratio remains well above the policy-dependent threshold over the entire
projection period. Furthermore, stress tests indicate that Djibouti remains vulnerable to adverse
shocks, notably the risk of lower-than-projected growth of GDP and exports. It is therefore
important that the authorities focus their efforts on achieving prudent macroeconomic
management and maintaining a careful approach to new borrowing, obtaining external
assistance in the form of grants or highly concessional loans.
I. DATA AND METHODOLOGY
1.
This DSA focuses on external public and publicly-guaranteed debt, and on domestic
government debt. While data on private debt are not available, it is believed to be negligible,
although it could increase in relation to forthcoming foreign private investment. Domestic
government debt consists mainly of domestic arrears towards employees, public enterprises,
social security funds, and private suppliers, and also includes past loans from the banking
system. Fiscal sustainability is assessed excluding government-guaranteed debt of public
enterprises that is not in arrears (i.e., explicit contingent liabilities) from the definition of the
public sector. However, in assessing vulnerability to adverse shocks, the government’s
contingent liabilities were subjected to sensitivity analysis (Appendix Table 16;
Appendix Figure 6).
II. CHANGES COMPARED TO THE DSA IN THE 2005 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATIONS
2.
The 2005 DSA for Djibouti included a baseline scenario based on relatively low
foreign direct investment but wide-ranging structural reforms that enabled the country to
achieve sustained growth rates, and an alternative low-investment, low-growth scenario. Under
the assumptions for the baseline scenario, the debt sustainability indicators improved over time,
but vulnerabilities appeared under stress test conditions.
3.
The present DSA incorporates recent economic developments including large
foreign direct investment (FDI), that are projected to put Djibouti on a growth-path
slightly lower than the one under the baseline scenario in the 2005 DSA. These changes
include large FDI flows to finance new port and transport infrastructure and the expansion of
port-services, the development of a new free-trade zone, and the development of tourism,
mining, and cattle trade (Box 3). The present DSA does not include an alternative reform
scenario which would put the country on a higher growth path.

33
III. DJIBOUTI’S DEBT SITUATION
4.
Djibouti has continued to incur arrears—albeit mostly temporary—in servicing its
external debt obligations reflecting weaknesses in public cash management. While new
arrears outstanding at end-2005 were paid in 2006, the stock of outstanding arrears has increased
from $31.5 million in 2005 to $33.2 million in 2006, of which $3 million were incurred in
December 2006.
5.
In February 2006, an agreement was reached with Italy concerning the
restructuring of debt in the framework of the May 2000 Paris Club agreement.1 The
agreement, which covers debt contracted before March 1998, entails the transformation of debt
service obligations into a specified list of projects of social interest. This effectively reduced
Djibouti’s external debt by about $15 million. 2
6.
At end-2006, the total stock of external debt was estimated at $427 million,
equivalent to 56 percent of GDP (Appendix Table 12). Almost all borrowing is from official
lenders, and most of it is concessional. The largest creditors are the World Bank ($125 million)
and the African Development Bank (AfDB) ($94 million), followed by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
($23 and $21 million respectively); 30 percent of total debt is from Arab creditors, and about
one-third ($152 million) is government-guaranteed debt of public enterprises.
7.
Over the next five years, disbursements of external loans are projected to increase to
an annual average of $110 million, bringing the total external debt to $869 million, equivalent
to 71 percent of GDP. The new borrowing comes in the wake of the November 2005 Round
Table of Arab creditors, resulting in pledges of $370 million to finance investment in
infrastructure and social development to be disbursed over the next five years. In addition, an
AfBD loan of $25 million is expected for the financing of the interconnection with the Ethiopian
power grid.
8.
Government debt outstanding at end-2006 amounted to about $467 million,
equivalent to 61 percent of GDP. This included external debt toward official creditors for about
$295 million (of which some $20 million is external government-guaranteed debt in arrears), and
domestic public debt of $172 million. Most of this debt consists of arrears toward public
employees, pension funds, public enterprises, and other suppliers for about $158 million
(compared to $156.5 million in 2005), scheduled to be repaid by 2020.

1

Djibouti signed the Paris Club agreement on May 25, 2000, and receives treatment under Classic terms,
whichare the standard terms applied to a debtor country coming to the Paris Club. Specifically, credits (whether
ODA or non-ODA) are rescheduled at the appropriate market rate with a repayment profile negotiated on a
case-by-case basis. In Djibouti’s case, this involves treatment of maturities falling due from October 31, 1999, up
to June 30, 2002.
2

The Paris Club agreement also covers debt owed to France and Spain; an agreement with France was reached in
2003, whereas negotiations with Spain are still under way.

IV. EVALUATION OF EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
9.
The baseline scenario, developed on a realistic set of assumptions about economic
policies and outcomes (see Appendix Box 5), shows that, although Djibouti’s large external
debt may be manageable, there is a high risk of debt distress. The analysis was conducted
under the debt sustainability framework for low-income countries (LICs). According to the
World Bank CPIA rating, Djibouti’s policies and institutions are assessed as those corresponding
to a “poor performer.” The debt-burden thresholds for countries in this category are: (a) NPV of
the debt-to-exports of goods and services of 100 percent; (b) NPV of the debt-to-GDP of
30 percent; and (c) NPV of the debt-to-fiscal revenues of 200 percent. The relevant debt service
thresholds are: (a) 15 percent of exports of goods and services and (b) 25 percent of revenues.
10.
Under the baseline scenario, the NPV of the external debt-to-GDP ratio is projected
to breach the policy-dependent threshold throughout the period, peaking at 60 percent in
2010 and remaining above 40 percent until at least 2027. The risks that this poses for external
solvency are mitigated somewhat by the growth in financial inflows associated with the
projected strong increase in exports. Hence, the NPV of the external of debt-to-export ratio is
projected to decline from 125 percent in 2006 to 88 percent in 2007 and then decrease further to
about 46 percent by 2027, well below the 100 percent threshold. Meanwhile the external debt
service-to-export ratio (equal to 9 percent in 2006) is projected to remain comfortably below the
15 percent policy-dependent threshold (Appendix Table 13) throughout the projection period.

35
Appendix Box 5. Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP is projected to grow by 6–7 percent a year in the medium term and by 3½–5 percent
per year in the long run, spurred by foreign direct investment (FDI) and by exports of goods and
services. It is assumed that large-scale investment in transport infrastructure and in the free-trade
zone (FTZ), as well as progress in the implementation of the COMESA customs area, will
strengthen Djibouti’s integration with the other economies in the region and transform it into a
regional trading hub, attracting further flows of foreign direct investment and enhancing the
country’s export and productive capacity in the long run. A large share of the new borrowing
over 2006–11 is expected to finance social projects that are projected to have an impact on
growth only in the very long run.
Exports of goods and services are projected to increase threefold in value between 2006 and
2011, as a result of services related to the expansion of the port and of tourism, as well as of
exports of cattle and the free-trade zone; in the long run, exports are projected to continue
growing by 7–8 percent a year.
The current account deficit is projected to rise to 14–18 percent of GDP between 2007 and
2011, driven by a surge in investment-related imports, and to gradually decline to about 8 percent
by 2027 as a result of sustained export growth. It is however largely financed by the projected
high flow of FDI.
The overall fiscal deficit is projected to temporarily increase in the medium term owing to the
restructuring of port management, but the restraint in expenditure announced by the authorities is
expected to restore balance by 2011. In the long run, the fiscal deficit is projected to increase to
3–3½ percent of GDP as tax revenues are projected to decline, partly as a result of tax
exemptions granted in the free-trade zone. Spending would evolve in line with revenue, but,
owing to rigidities in several expenditure areas, the shortfall in revenue will need to be
compensated in part by additional external financing. Domestic arrears to public employees,
pension funds, public enterprises, and private suppliers, currently estimated to $158 million, are
projected to be repaid by 2020 in line with the schedule announced by the authorities.
Projections of external borrowing terms incorporate authorities’ data for identified project
loans, and are based on the assumption that additional loans would continue to be extended by
official creditors to the government (or under government guarantee) on concessional terms. The
large debt disbursements between 2007 and 2011 will finance mainly social and infrastructure
projects that have only a long-term impact on growth.

11.
The less favorable outcome obtained from the stress tests reflects the high
vulnerability of external debt solvency to adverse shocks. Under the historical scenario—
which assumes that key macroeconomic variables evolve in line with the record of the past
seven years, before the current increase in foreign investment started to stimulate growth and
trade—the NPV of the external debt-to-GDP ratio peaks at 73 percent in 2012 and then
remains above 50 percent. Additional tests assessing the sensitivity of debt sustainability
indicators to less favorable lending conditions—specifically, export and real GDP growth, and
inflation and exchange rate developments—also yield less favorable sustainability indicators

36
(Appendix Table 14; Appendix Figure 5). Under the “most extreme stress test”—corresponding
to a one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation in 2008, equivalent to a 22 percent decline in
nominal GDP—the NPV of the external debt-to-GDP ratio would be about 20 percentage points
higher than in the baseline, and the NPV of the external debt-to-exports ratio would breach the
100 percent threshold until 2017.
V. EVALUATION OF FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY, 2007–27
12.
Under baseline assumptions, the NPV of the government debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to decline below the policy-dependent threshold only by 2015. The NPV of the
government debt-to-revenue, which is projected to stay below the 200 percent threshold, keeps
an upward trend after 2020. The government debt service-to-revenue ratio, instead, is projected
to remain well below the 25 percent threshold (Appendix Table 15). The stock of domestic debt
arrears is scheduled to be repaid only by 2020.
13.
The prospects of long-term fiscal sustainability could substantially worsen under
adverse circumstances simulated by the stress tests. Under the “most extreme” stress test
(featuring real GDP growth at its historical average minus one standard deviation) the NPV of
the debt-to-GDP ratio would remain above 35 percent throughout the period, increasing after
2020, and the NPV of the debt-to-revenue ratio would break the 200 percent threshold in 2025.
Under another stress test—assuming that the government primary balance would remain at its
projected 2007 level—the NPV of the government debt-to-revenue ratio would increase above
150 percent by 2027, again raising concerns about long-term sustainability. If instead both real
GDP growth and the primary deficit remained at the average level of the past seven years, the
outcome would closely reflect projections under the baseline scenario (Appendix Table 16;
Appendix Figure 6).
14.
The contingent liabilities related to the government-guaranteed external debt pose a
major risk for fiscal sustainability. If the government was called to honor all these guarantees
(equivalent to 1-2 percent of GDP per year) until 2027, the NPV of the government debt-to-GDP
ratio would remain almost always above the 30 percent threshold and keep an upward trend after
2020, and the NPV of the government debt-to-revenue ratio would rise to 170 percent by 2027.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
15.
While the updated DSA for Djibouti projects moderate GDP and export growth rates,
largely propelled by high levels of foreign direct investment, the country’s risk of debt distress is
high. In addition to a sustained and significant breach of the policy-dependent threshold for the
NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, Djibouti has incurred external arrears over the past few years.
Moreover, substantial domestic arrears have accumulated, equal to 20 percent of GDP. Unless
Djibouti follows prudent macroeconomic policies—supported by a shift in the composition of
external financing from concessional loans to grants, combined with concerted efforts to clear
substantial arrears and lower domestic debt—the country’s vulnerability to adverse shocks will
increase. Given the continuing risks, development of a comprehensive public debt management
strategy, taking into account public enterprises and contingent liabilities, should be a priority.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past ten years, subject to data availability.

Source: Staff projections and simulations.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguards assessments
In response to staff recommendations, the BCD hired in August 2002 external auditors from
Ernst & Young to audit its1999, 2000, and 2001 accounts. This audit was completed by
end-2002 and the 1999–2001 audited financial statements were transmitted to the Fund in
2004.
Since 2003, the BCD has had its accounts audited on a yearly basis in accordance with
international auditing standards. The audit of the 2002 financial statements was completed
by Ernst & Young at end-2003 and published in the Journal Officiel of August 31, 2004.
The accounts of 2004 and 2005 were also audited respectively in October 2005 and June
2006 and published in the Central Bank 2005 Annual Report and the 2005 Journal
Officiel.
Exchange arrangements
Djibouti has a currency board arrangement. The Djibouti franc is pegged to the U.S. dollar at
the rate of DF 177.721 = $1. Djibouti maintains an exchange system that is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation
Djibouti is on an annual consultation cycle. Discussions for the 2005 Article IV consultation
and a new staff-monitored program (SMP) were held in Djibouti from June 26 to July 10, 2005.
The staff report, the letter of intent, memorandum of economic and financial policies, and
technical memorandum of understanding, were discussed by the Executive Board on
September 28, 2005.

ANNEX II. WORLD BANK RELATIONS WITH DJIBOUTI
World Bank lending and non-lending interventions in Djibouti are tailored to support the
pillars of the CAS, which are broadly aligned with Djibouti’s full PRSP endorsed by the
Boards of the World Bank and the IMF in June 2004. The FY2005–08 CAS, endorsed by the
Bank Board in March 2005, is centered on three pillars: (i) growth and competitiveness,
(ii) human development, and (iii) governance.
The CAS pillars are supported by various (lending) projects. The current portfolio has
six active Bank-funded projects valued at US$72.4 million. Of this total, 37 percent, by
value, is for health-related activities, 27 percent for social development, 14 percent for
education, 10 percent for energy and water, and 12 percent for flood emergency
rehabilitation. The distribution of projects across the CAS pillars is as follows:
•

The growth and competitiveness pillar is being supported through: (i) a power and
water sector project to lower the cost of utilities and increase the poor’s access to
electricity and water and (ii) a partial risk guarantee to the concession of the
operation and management of the joint public railway company, following on a
previous Bank road corridor project. Together with the port, transit activities along
this corridor are a major source of growth in Djibouti.

•

The human development pillar support focuses on: (i) a second school access and
improvement project, following on a first successful project; (ii) two health sector
projects (the HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB control and the health sector development
projects); (iii) a social development and public works project; and (iv) an emergency
floods rehabilitation project, for which an additional financing (grant) was approved
on February 22, 2007 and is not yet included in the current portfolio.

•

Support to the governance pillar is sought through IDF grants aimed at implementing
the action plan and recommendations of the Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) and Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR).

In addition to the assistance through lending, the Bank supports Djibouti through country
analytical work. Following a Public Expenditure Review completed in FY 2005, a country
economic memorandum, aimed at recommending a set of policy options to face Djibouti’s
growth and competitiveness challenges, was completed in FY 2006. The Bank is also
supporting policy reforms in close collaboration with the Fund in the area of public
administration reforms. Close collaboration with the Fund is also prevalent on
macroeconomic issues (e.g., debt sustainability analysis) and on the PRSP evaluation and
update.

6
Finally, given Djibouti’s weak institutional capacity, a great deal of emphasis is put on
technical assistance and capacity building efforts. Currently, the Bank manages a portfolio
of US$9.4 million in trust funds, including two IDF grants, three multiple donors’ trust funds
and a statistical capacity-building trust fund. The IDF grants finance institutional capacity
building in the areas of public procurement (US$357,000) and budget and debt management
(US$343,000). The multiple donors’ trust funds support Djibouti’s participation to the
Education for All Fast Track Initiative (US$6 million) and efforts aimed at controlling avian
and human influenza (US$2.1 million). The statistical trust fund (US$252,700) supports the
strengthening of national accounts and the implementation of a new census planned at the
end of 2007. An additional IDF grant (US$244,000) to finance the capacity-building to
prepare the implementation of an integrated social protection system was approved in
February 2007, but is not yet effective.
In spite of Djibouti’s poor economic environment, the overall performance of Bank projects
is good and development objectives are expected to be achieved satisfactorily for all projects
in the portfolio. The Bank’s FY2005–08 CAS proposes to intensify the policy dialogue with
the authorities to delineate the most appropriate and feasible reform policy venue to address
wage level misalignment. It reserves financial support to this reform under a high-case
scenario which would be triggered by the government’s willingness to undertake this reform.
Collaboration with the Fund in these areas will be crucial.

7
ANNEX III. DJIBOUTI: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Outstanding statistical issues
1.
Data provision is barely adequate for surveillance purposes, and is affected by serious
shortcomings in coverage, periodicity, timeliness, and dissemination. Weaknesses are
particularly significant in the areas of national accounts, the trade balance, and external debt
management, and to some extent for fiscal data. However, recent developments indicate an
increasing awareness of the importance of statistics among government officials. In 2002, the
authorities created the Directorate for Statistics and Demographic Studies (DISED) in order
to enhance the capacity of the statistical system and the efficient use of available resources.
Balance of payments data in line with the 5th edition of the Balance of Payments Manual
(BPM5) have been provided since 2004. In February 2004 the authorities indicated their
intention to participate in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and have
submitted metadata. The authorities are currently working on updating the national accounts
data and extending the coverage of the consumer price index (CPI).
National accounts
2.
National account data have not been provided since 1999. The methodology used
followed the 1968 System of National Accounts (SNA) and was based on a decomposition by
production sector, with aggregates by expenditure available only in nominal terms. The data
were affected by serious weaknesses concerning the sources, the use of an inadequate
reference year and lack of enterprise surveys and coverage of the informal sector. These
factors, and insufficient human and financial resources, partly explain the limited progress
made in implementing the recommendations of the 2002 national accounts and balance of
payments mission. With World Bank assistance, the DISED has been re-estimating sectoral
GDP for 2000–05 and elaborating national accounts according to the 1993 SNA, using a
wide range of data based on surveys, import statistics, and financial statements of public
enterprises. DISED expects to finalize the calculations by end-2007. However, it does not
intend to prepare GDP data by expenditure. The revision of the methodology is necessary to
reconcile national account data with the new BOP series.
Prices
3.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI), calculated by the DISED on a monthly basis since
April 1999 using price surveys in Djibouti City, is the only measure of inflation. Before
1999, the Fund staff monitored price developments on the basis of the CPI index compiled
by the French government for French expatriate residents in Djibouti (with some corrections
since late 1998). The DISED is currently working to expand the national coverage of the
index to areas outside the capital.

8
Government finance
4.
Following the establishment of a coordination unit in the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
in 1998 to improve data coverage and timeliness, fiscal data are now available monthly
although with some delays; however, these data do not cover a number of extra-budgetary
accounts, including three pension funds. In 2002, a comprehensive audit of domestic
arrears was completed with assistance from the European Union and the World Bank.
Foreign-financed capital expenditure and some foreign-financed current expenditures and
their financing (i.e., grants and loans) have been reported since 1999. However, additional
efforts are needed to improve the compilation and coverage of fiscal data, particularly at the
institutional level, in order to fulfill the recommendations made by a government finance
statistics mission in 2001; several extra-budgetary funds, including three pension funds, also
need to be incorporated into a consolidated general government budget. The MOF is not
reporting data for publication in the GFS Yearbook and the International Finance Statistics
(IFS).
Monetary accounts
5.
Monetary statistics are generally adequate and cover the central bank, two operating
commercial banks, and one bank in liquidation. Two new banks have started their operation
during 2006, but their data are not yet integrated in the monetary statistics. The authorities
initiated the publication of a quarterly bulletin in 1995 and increased its periodicity to a
monthly bulletin beginning in 2001. Monetary data are also posted on the BCD’s web site
(http://www.banque-centrale.dj/).
6.
In 2004, a STA mission assisted the BCD in compiling monetary and financial
statistics in accordance with the Fund’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
The mission highlighted various weaknesses, including the definition of the criterion of
residence and the classification of domestic assets and liabilities by sector, and advised on
the preparation of financial sector metadata for the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS). In September 2005, the BCD reported test monetary data to STA by using
Standardized Report Forms, which are consistent with the MFSM’s methodology. A followup MFS mission is planned in FY2008.
External sector
7.
Substantial progress has been made in improving balance of payments data in line
with recommendations made by Fund’s technical assistance missions over the past few years.
At the end of August 2004, new balance of payments data adhering to the standards set forth
in the BPM5 were prepared. The new data set incorporates improvements involving transit
trade to neighboring countries, imports by the foreign military forces stationed in Djibouti,
and the treatment of the rent paid by the United States for the military base. The BCD is

9
compiling data on the country’s international investment position (IIP) for 2003 and
commenced collection of some balance of payments data on a quarterly basis. However,
significant issues remain. The distinction between residents and nonresident accounts in
banking statistics appears highly uncertain; statistics on traded goods only capture data from
customs; trade associated with the free zone is not included in the BOP; and no data on FDI
is systematically collected.
8.
The BCD has not submitted balance of payments statistics for publication to STA
since 2004.
9.
With financial and technical assistance from the World Bank and UNCTAD, the
authorities adopted in 2002 a new system for the management of external debt, centralized
within the Direction du Financement Extérieur (DFE) of the MOF; the system became
operational in mid-2003, and external debt statistics were revised based on information
received from creditors and covering the period from 1999 onward. Debt statistics are
however provided irregularly and with delay, and affected by weaknesses.

Djibouti
On April 27, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Djibouti.1
Background
Growth performance strengthened in 2006, but was accompanied by accelerated inflation.
Despite structural bottlenecks and weak competitiveness, real GDP growth reached
4.8 percent, driven by fiscal expansion and large private investment in the port, construction and
services sectors. However, consumer price inflation rose to 3.6 percent in 2006, its highest peak
since 2003, reflecting mainly higher prices of food, housing, water, and electricity. Broad money
growth continued its trend deceleration of the past few years, in an environment of favorable
economic conditions and more attractive financial conditions. Credit to the private sector
increased notably compared to previous years, benefiting primarily sectors related to foreign
direct investment. With a still low and little diversified export base, the surge in foreign financed
related imports led to a sharp deterioration of the trade and current account balances. However,
large capital and financial inflows resulted in a substantial increase in gross official reserves, the
equivalent of about three months of imports.
Fiscal policy was expansionary in 2006, as strong revenue performance was mitigated by
higher spending related to the financing of local elections and the summit of the Common

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). While the external debt profile is
manageable, the stock of public debt is projected to increase substantially over the period
2006–11. Progress in implementing structural reforms has been slow and many of the structural
benchmarks contemplated under the last SMP remain to be fully implemented. The more
flexible labor code adopted in December 2005 needs to be fully enacted. The single registry file
for the civil service is well-advanced, but not finalized. A civil service reform initiated in early
2006 is still unfolding. There have been various initiatives in the energy sector, but an integrated
strategy to reduce electricity production costs in the short and medium term has not been
formulated. These measures are crucial to enhance growth prospects, improve competitiveness
of the economy, and reduce poverty and unemployment. It is expected that some of these
issues will be addressed in the new medium-term poverty reduction strategy that is expected to
be formulated in the coming months with the assistance of the World Bank.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the Djibouti authorities
for the progress in attracting foreign private investment and transforming the economy into a
regional trade and services hub. They welcomed the resulting acceleration of economic growth
in the past two years, and the improvement of Djibouti’s medium-term growth prospects.
At the same time, Directors observed that major challenges remain. Poverty and unemployment
remain widespread, and debt sustainability could become a concern in light of the authorities’
ambitious borrowing plans. Directors shared the authorities’ concern that growth should not be
confined to an enclave around the port, but should be broad-based and accompanied by
sufficient employment creation. In this respect, Directors welcomed the new “National Initiative
for Social Development,” and encouraged the authorities to translate it into a time-bound action
plan.
Directors encouraged the authorities to tighten the fiscal stance in order to ensure fiscal
sustainability and contain potential inflationary pressures. Simplification of the tax regime, a
reduction of tax exemptions, and the introduction of a value-added tax are all needed to boost
government revenue, while tight controls on public wages and effective implementation of the
ongoing civil service reform are crucial to reduce the government’s wage bill. Directors also
underscored the need to adhere strictly to the budget, eliminate off-budget transactions,
improve cash management by adopting a single Treasury account, and avoid the accumulation
of new external or domestic arrears. They encouraged the authorities to strengthen debt and
contingent liabilities management, carefully prioritize investments projects, and move ahead
with their privatization plans.
Directors agreed that the currency board arrangement has served Djibouti well as a credible
anchor for containing inflationary pressures and building the confidence of foreign investors.
Directors emphasized, however, that Djibouti’s external competitiveness needs to be further
strengthened through macroeconomic and structural reform measures. Important measures,
in addition to fiscal adjustment, will include the adoption of a strategy to reduce electricity

production costs, accelerated and full implementation of the new labor code to enhance labor
market flexibility, and improvements in governance and the efficiency of the judiciary system.
Directors welcomed the increased entry of foreign banks, which has helped lower interest rate
spreads through increased competition. At the same time, they stressed the importance of
strengthening the central bank’s supervisory capacities and the regulatory framework, and
looked forward to the upcoming evaluation under the Financial Sector Assessment Program
later this year. They welcomed the development of new instruments of monetary policy to help
contain inflationary pressures. Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to clarify the
mandate of the Financial Intelligence Unit and to strengthen anti-money laundering regulations.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to participate in the IMF’s General Data
Dissemination Standard, which they considered an important step toward improving the quantity
and quality of economic data, particularly in the areas of national accounts, the trade balance,
and external debt.
Directors noted the authorities’ wish to begin discussions on a program supported by the IMF’s
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, as it would help to accelerate the implementation of
structural reforms and mobilize foreign aid. They stressed, however, that to move forward in that
direction, the authorities would need to implement the key benchmarks not met under the 2005
staff-monitored program, and prepare a medium-term reform strategy as part of an overall
poverty reduction strategy. They would also need to commit to strengthening fiscal discipline,
including reducing domestic arrears, and to improving data production and enhancing external
competitiveness. A few Directors were of the view that, given the healthy balance of payments
and adequate reserve coverage, Djibouti currently does not need Fund financing.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
