INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2006 Consultation with the Republic of San Marino
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Anthony Boote
February 7, 2007
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: San Marino is reinventing itself in response to global competition. A slew of
reforms has been initiated, which, combined with stronger growth in neighboring Italy and
the euro area, have improved macroeconomic prospects. Growth has rebounded. Public
spending has been contained, but the budget surplus has been eroded mainly due to initiatives
to preserve tax advantages. While the financial sector is sound, it is in transition as
institutions adapt to changes in taxes and regulations. Supervision is being strengthened.
Challenges: These are two-fold: to manage the transition toward an economy based on the
high value-added service sectors, including the financial sector, and to counter fiscal
pressures arising from an ageing population, mobile factors of production, generous
entitlements, and the need to keep tax rates competitively low. The small size of the territory
and population and its land-locked location within Italy pose constraints.
Staff views: Already-enacted reforms must now be implemented. In particular, the Central
Bank of San Marino (CBSM) should be allowed room to implement the new regulations
expeditiously, and exercise greater oversight of financial institutions as they venture into new
lines of businesses. Public finances should be shored up through measures to broaden the tax
base, improve public enterprise balances, and further curtail current spending. Additional
pension reforms may become necessary, and a fiscal rule could be considered. Plans to
streamline public administration and introduce a mandatory defined-contributions second
pillar pension system should proceed. Reforms are also necessary to boost the supply of
high-skilled labor to support the growing service sectors. Finally, statistics must be improved
to facilitate policy formulation.
Authorities’ views: There is wide recognition that reforms need to continue, and that the
future of the economy lies in the service sectors. The authorities are cognizant of the risks
inherent in a financial sector in transition, and have taken measures to strengthen oversight.
Increased investment, modernization of laws, streamlining of procedures, and a reduction of
the tax burden should strengthen growth prospects. The staff’s fiscal policy recommendations
were well received, although a fiscal rule might need to await further improvements in
budget accounting. The authorities believe that labor market reforms will not be easy to
implement due to resistance from entrenched interests and geographical constraints.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
San Marino, a small country embedded within Italy, is inextricably linked to its
large neighbor. The countries are bound in a monetary and customs union. Porous borders
facilitate trade and factor mobility, with much of San Marino’s exports destined toward Italy,
and Italian commuters representing a quarter of its labor force. Well diversified for its size,
San Marino relies principally on its manufacturing and, increasingly, financial sector, for
growth. The former is supported by Italian manufacturers benefiting from the lower costs and
tax advantages of San Marino. The latter has flourished due to the inflow of Italian funds into
the banking system in response to tax advantages, and bank secrecy laws.1
2.
Recently, San Marino has begun to reinvent itself in response to global
competition. It has come a long way since the early part of this decade when growth was
sputtering, public finances were precarious, and the economy was mired in old-fashioned
modus operandi. A slew of ambitious reforms have been initiated (text table). These, together
with a pick up in growth in Italy

While the public accounts are in surplus, they deteriorated sharply in 2006
(Figure 2). As growth picked up and financial sector profitability stabilized, the budget
deficits of yesteryears were reversed, public debt contained, and reserves accumulated. The
authorities improved revenue collection through tax administration reforms, and controlled
current spending by reining in healthcare costs and fending off steep public sector pay
increases. Nevertheless, revenue losses due to corporate tax cuts (from 24 to 19 percent

San Marino acts as an offshore Italian financial center offering a broader range of services than banks in
neighboring Italian regions. It is a member of the MONEYVAL Committee of the Council of Europe, a regional
body committed to mutual evaluations in anti-money laundering. It is not on any offshore financial center
(OFC) list.

in 2005), steadily deteriorating balances of public enterprises2, and election-related spending
overruns, have reduced the surplus considerably in 2006. An ambitious pension reform,
implemented in 2006, has yet to affect the fiscal outcome.

4.
The financial sector appears to be in good shape: profitable, liquid and well
capitalized (Figure 3, Tables 4–5)3. Always a significant contributor to budget revenues, it
has become an increasingly important contributor to growth, and there is a general
recognition that the further development of this sector will be vital for the future of the
economy. Deposits have surged, reflecting a stronger domestic and Italian economy, and the
return of funds which fled in response to the 2002 Italian tax amnesty. Currently, the sector is
bracing for the full impact of the EU withholding tax4 which has not hurt competitiveness at
the current tax rates. Profit growth has remained subdued due to heightened competition in
an increasingly crowded field, leading to greater risk-taking, as evident in a sharp increase in
lending to the nonfinancial private sector, mainly corporations, to meet their investment
needs. Nevertheless, the number of bank failures has been limited. In 2006, for the first time
in Sammarinese history, two small financial institutions were placed under CBSM
administration following on-site inspections of their books. One was found to have negative
capital due to bad loans and improper oversight, and required liquidity support. The other
operated an illegal mutual funds business, and was saddled with governance problems. These
cases did not have systemic effects as deposits shifted to other banks, and Sammarinese
banks remain more efficient and better capitalized than most of their comparators, with fewer
nonperforming loans (Table 5).
5.
The financial sector is undergoing a quiet revolution. Supervisory powers have
now been transferred from the government to the CBSM, which is in the midst of
implementing a broad range of initiatives to modernize the sector, facilitate new lines of
business and attract a broader clientele, while preserving its soundness and good standing. Indepth off-site and on-site supervision of financial institutions have been initiated, and are
beginning to bear fruit as evident in the resolution of difficulties faced by the two problem
institutions with no untoward repercussions. Supervisory resources have been increased and
supervisors are keeping a close eye on the internal controls and management of financial
institutions.

3

The financial system is dominated by four large “historic” banks and remains concentrated. Nonresident
deposits—mostly from Italy—represent about half the banking system liabilities, and the main activity of the
financial sector is to place these funds in low-yield/low-risk interbank loans and government securities. The
nonbank financial institutions offer fund management, private banking services, and real-estate related financial
products.
4

The EU withholding tax, introduced on July 1, 2005, applies to nonresident deposits and bonds at a 15 percent
rate for the first 3 years, 20 percent for the subsequent 3 years, and 35 percent thereafter.

Reforms have been implemented to further improve the economy’s
competitiveness and broaden the sources of growth. Several useful steps have been taken
to improve labor market flexibility, simplify procedures for hiring non-residents, and
enhance productivity by providing fiscal incentives for training. Wage growth has remained
subdued, not least due to the efforts to contain public sector wages. Enterprises in the
manufacturing sector have started relocating to low-cost countries and Italy, to remain
competitive and avoid cumbersome customs procedures for trade with the euro area. A
recently enacted business-friendly corporate law seeks to improve governance and the
investment climate by clarifying various rules of operation in one comprehensive document.
The new financial sector regulations seek to do the same in the financial sector. Lower tax
rates, greater clarity in tax liabilities through double taxation agreements with countries, and
further simplification of tax payment processes have improved the investment climate and
lowered the cost of doing business. All of this has improved competitiveness, especially with
respect to the neighboring regions of Italy which account for the bulk of Sammarinese
exports (Figure 4). 5
II. RISKS AND CHALLENGES
7.
Given the small size and location, the Sammarinese authorities have limited
leverage on macroeconomic outcomes in the short run. Monetary policy is non-existent,
and the mobile factors of production imply that growth, fiscal outturns, and inflation depend
heavily on developments in Italy. Given the reliance on an international reputation of good
standing, foreign expertise and demand, especially in the financial sector, policy formulation
needs to focus on long-term consequences, as short-term benefits are likely to be short-lived.
8.
San Marino remains vulnerable to external developments, especially in Italy. The
sharp drop in growth in 2002, partly due to the exodus of funds in response to an Italian tax
amnesty, is testimony to this vulnerability. International efforts to reduce tax avoidance and
bank secrecy and prospective changes in the tax regime or financial system in Italy may also
affect the economy.

5

The part of production based in Italy is likely to have been affected by the declining competitiveness of Italy
vis-à-vis the rest of the world. However, this effect is difficult to quantify due to the lack of statistics regarding
the direction of trade for San Marino and detailed information about the manufacturing sector.

The relative decline of traditional sectors adds a further dimension to the
adjustment process. Until recently, San Marino has adjusted quickly to shocks by
successfully parlaying the relative flexibility of its economy and institutions to attract a
continuous stream of factors of production from Italy. However, manufacturing, historically a
powerhouse of the economy, contributes

only over time.6
10.
Fiscal policy is constrained by the need to balance the twin objectives of
preserving competitiveness while remaining sustainable. On the one hand, tax and social
security contribution rates have to stay low to attract businesses and commuters, and revenue
collection is vulnerable to the mobile factors of production and risks to growth. On the other
hand, expenditure is constrained by generous entitlements which are expected to increase
over the medium term as the population ages.
11.
Policy design and monitoring is hampered by the lack of up-to-date data. Key
statistics are available with long lags (Appendix II), and the dissemination of statistics is
behind times, hurting efforts to reach new markets and clients, while increasing the risk of
being blind-sided by shocks.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.
Discussions focused on measures to sustain strong growth over the medium term
amidst these constraints. In particular:
•

how should fiscal policy safeguard competitiveness while remaining sustainable;

•

how can the financial sector retain its competitive edge without compromising
stability; and,

•

what reforms in the labor market and business climate are needed to support growth?

6

The authorities have prepared the legislative base to allow new businesses to operate, e.g., the registry of ships
and aircrafts on Sammarinese territory.

13
A. Growth Outlook
13.
On current trends and barring unforeseen circumstances, growth is likely to
remain strong in the near term but moderate thereafter (Table 1). While traditional
sectors are beginning to slow, the strong fundamentals and competitive advantage over Italy
are likely to remain in place for now. Growth is, thus, expected to hover around 5 percent
during 2007–08, but moderate thereafter to some 4–4½ percent by 2011, on the assumption
that the financial sector would not be able to adjust to avoid the full impact of higher
taxation, and that the small size of the economy will constrain diversification.
B. Fiscal Sustainability
14.
The draft three-year rolling plan for 2007–09 envisages a further erosion of the
consolidated government budget surplus (Table 2)7. The plan, binding only for 2007,
envisages a further reduction in corporate taxes to 17 percent in 2007, and cautiously
assumes no increase in nominal revenues from other sources. On the expenditure side, a key
measure is to switch expenditure from current to capital spending, given the relatively
modest investment outlays in the past, while holding the line on all other spending in nominal
terms8. As a result, the central administration budget surplus is likely to decline steadily,
despite plans to control current spending. The recent pension reform will begin to reduce the
deficit of the social security fund from 2007 onward. However, the balances of public
enterprises are expected to continue to deteriorate as tariffs fail to adjust in line with raw
material cost increases.
15.
There was full agreement that the deterioration in public finances must be
forestalled. The authorities well understand the need for fiscal prudence to cover future
contingent liabilities due to ageing costs and to create room for further tax cuts should they
become necessary to preserve competitiveness. Given the limited room for maneuver on the
revenue side, and the intention to increase capital spending, savings will have to come from
current spending and further improvements in the balances of public enterprises. To help
reduce transfers to the enterprises, discussions have already begun to establish a mechanism
for automatic tariff adjustments from 2007 onwards. The authorities acknowledged that it
was time to consider introducing demand-side measures (such as copayments) to further
contain healthcare spending, which despite measures to restrict access and coverage, remains
7

Under the authorities’ presentation, the three-year plan targets balanced budgets. However, this includes items
under both revenues and expenditures which are typically considered as financing (e.g., a drawdown of deposits
of the central administration and reserve accumulation of the social security fund). Under staff’s presentation,
these items have been reclassified as budget financing.
8

This will be achieved by reducing new hiring and transfers to the private sector. In addition ad hoc transfers to
the social security fund are not expected to recur because of improved management and consolidation of some
pension funds.

high. Finally, budget accounting practices will be modernized in order to be better able to
develop fiscal policy.

Further changes in the pension system are not off the table. The 2006 pension
reform compares favorably with reforms enacted elsewhere (Box 1). Nevertheless, actuarial
calculations suggest that the pension fund would require increasing budget transfers for the
foreseeable future to stay in surplus (Figure 5). Even then, demographic pressures will be so
great that the pension fund will need to dip into its reserves to pay social security benefits
after 2019. Alternative scenarios highlight the gravity of the problem. The authorities, well
aware of this state of affairs, are not averse to further changes in the first pillar pension
system, if they become necessary. For now, they intend to update actuarial calculations
annually to better monitor sustainability, improve the management of the social security
fund, and streamline and consolidate pension funds for non-salaried workers to prevent
unforeseen overruns. They also plan to introduce a defined contributions second pillar
in 2007 to bolster the private sector’s own efforts to save for retirement. Staff proposed that
improvements in the labor market could also be considered a way to boost the deteriorating
ratio of workers to retirees.

More generally, staff proposed that it might be worth considering a rules-based
mechanism to minimize the pressures arising from risks on the revenue side and high
spending commitments. Ideally, the rule would seek to ensure that the consolidated
government’s net assets are sufficient to cover its forthcoming nonreversible spending
commitments. Without insisting on a specific rule at this stage, staff proposed that a target on
the government’s net assets might be the most appropriate for San Marino, given the
problems of monitoring an expenditure-based rule, and since transparency and accountability
are already addressed by the existing three-year rolling plans.9 The authorities considered that

would need to run surpluses in the range of 1½ –2 percent of GDP a year to allow sufficient
reserve buildup by 2011 to cover, say, about two years of projected pension and health
expenditures, providing an appropriate and achievable cushion.
C. Financial Sector Development and Stability
18.
The main challenge for the financial sector is to ensure a smooth adjustment to
the new regulatory and economic environment. Thus far, banks have successfully
weathered the transition to tighter tax and bank secrecy legislation, managing to remain costcompetitive by European standards, although less so by international standards (Table 5).
Financial institutions are gearing up to adapt to impending changes, with banks diversifying
9

“Promoting Fiscal Discipline Over the Business Cycle”.

18
into more sophisticated products and other markets, and non-bank financial institutions
preparing to enter the mutual funds business.
19.
Views differed on the ability of the financial sector to cope with the transition.
The transformation of the financial sector will, to some extent, depend on its ability to
persuade traditional customers to assume greater risks, and to attract a broader clientele.
Most banks and, to some extent, the CBSM, remained optimistic, pointing to bank secrecy,
simpler modus operandi and personalized banking as factors that will continue to provide
Sammarinese banks a comparative advantage. The CBSM also noted that given the small size
of the sector, it would be able to withstand the effect of the withholding tax if it could capture
even a small fraction of the global mutual fund business.
20.
Staff is less sanguine. Clearly the financial sector is venturing into lines of
businesses, products, and clients where it has less experience. In addition, staff analysis
indicates that disparities in capital, credit quality, and risk management capabilities imply
that some institutions are less prepared than others to successfully undertake this transition
(Figure 6). Finally, San Marino would need to revamp its financial market infrastructure in a
fairly brief period of time if it is to compete effectively in an increasingly financially
integrated world, where competition is likely to be global and stiff. This would require
significant investment in financial sector infrastructure including in human capital (Table 6),
a daunting task given the limited resources at the CBSM’s disposal and labor market
constraints.
21.
It therefore called on the CBSM to closely monitor the financial system through
greater oversight. Staff supported plans to increase supervisory resources further, and urged
that the initial round of in-depth on- and off-site supervision be completed quickly and,
thereafter, be performed at regular intervals. It also indicated a need to ensure that banks and
their clients are aware of the risks involved in the new lines of business through strengthened
transparency and disclosure requirements, and that financial institutions are equipped to
assess and manage their own risks.
22.
The authorities are pressing ahead with plans to improve supervision. Key
initiatives in the pipeline are to: finish enacting implementing regulations consistent with the
new financial sector law; further increase training and resources; hold banks to more
stringent reporting standards and initiate in-depth off-site supervision on that basis; and
complete the first round of on-site supervision. Deposit insurance is on the policy agenda, but
will be introduced only after supervision capacity has been sufficiently improved. The
CBSM is cooperating closely with other supervisory authorities to facilitate cross-border
exchange of information, consolidated supervision, and improve business practices.

(1994-05) using the Feasible Generalized Least Squares estimator. The interest rate elasticity of net
interest income (as a ratio to total assets) is estimated to be -0.32 (t = -2.13), a magnitude broadly
consistent with the literature. The negative sign suggests that interest rate changes affect margins
relatively more through banks’ assets than through net interest incomes.

21
23.
The key task now will be to manage the transition and allow the CBSM the
necessary room to implement the new supervisory framework in an arms-length
manner. The government and the CBSM are collaborating effectively to resolve problems in
the financial system. Nevertheless, pressures from vested interests may arise down the road
and it will be important to ensure that the CBSM’s independence is not compromised,
especially in licensing, supervision, and extraordinary administration of problem institutions.
Greater autonomy in the financing of the central bank’s budget would be a step in this
direction.
24.
The authorities have requested a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
which should further examine these issues. The next AML/CFT mutual evaluation by
MONEYVAL is scheduled for spring 2007.
D. Structural Reforms and Competitiveness
25.
San Marino’s intention to diversify and modernize its economy puts a premium
on flexible labor markets. Recent initiatives are useful and have helped improve
competitiveness. However, they do not go far enough as they mostly target blue collar
workers. As a result, economic activity is running up against capacity constraints for growth
because of the difficulty in hiring the highly-skilled labor force needed to compete
effectively in a global economy. This is specially true in the financial sector where the need
for high-skilled multilingual labor is paramount, as demonstrated by other financial centers
which have circumvented this impediment to sophistication by attracting the right talent from
abroad.
26.
The constraints are manifold. Procedures to hire non-resident workers are lengthy
because of the need to establish the unavailability of the required skills from among residents
currently listed as unemployed. While there are plans to ease these restrictions somewhat
in 2011, businesses consider this to be too little and too late. Restrictions on the length of
work contracts that can be offered to non-residents and uncertainties regarding the tax
treatment of commuter workers from Italy make it difficult to attract the best qualified
workers. The lack of a regulatory framework hampers outsourcing, and restrictions on
residency are a deterrent to attracting labor from further afield. In addition, active labor
market policies are not well designed: they are costly to the budget; they do not have the
support of the labor force as they entail temporary income losses; and they are ripe for abuse
by firms which could use them merely to reduce costs than to improve workers’ productivity.
27.
The authorities are cognizant of the need to improve labor market flexibility, but
progress is likely to be slow due to entrenched vested interests. The small territory and
generous entitlements limit the extent to which residency can be opened up. Maintaining low
unemployment is an important priority and explains the preference for training over hiring
non-residents. To this end, the authorities are collaborating with Italian and Sammarinese
universities to help improve the skills of the Sammarinese work force. While sympathetic to

22
these concerns, staff noted that the rapid transition of the economy underscores the need to
increase the supply of skilled labor quickly, and that the right skills may not be available
simply through training. The incentive structure for active labor market policies also needs a
rethink to achieve greater buy-in. Finally, eliminating the “employer of last resort” role of
public enterprises, and further containing generous public sector pay scales would make
private sector employment relatively more attractive.
28.
Thanks to business-friendly policies, San Marino’s business climate compares
favorably with its competitors (Table 7). New initiatives are being planned: further tax
reductions, a resumption of discussions with Italy regarding an economic cooperation
agreement, and improvements in public administration. Given the rapid changes in the global
economy, improvements in the business climate are, by necessity, a work in progress, and
thus, existing initiatives would need to be continually upgraded on the basis of lessons that
emerge during implementation. An important priority for the authorities is to finalize the
cooperation agreement with Italy to clarify the terms of economic engagement in important
areas10. Staff also urged that the authorities finish upgrading the laws of the country to ensure
full compliance with international anti-money laundering provisions as this would help open
markets hitherto closed to San Marino.
E. Statistics
29.
Despite some improvements, data shortcomings remain (Appendix II). Staff
pressed for shortening the time lag in producing statistics and improving dissemination as a
matter of priority. The authorities agreed to participate in the GDDS.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Macroeconomic conditions are benign and are likely to remain so in the near
term. After faltering briefly earlier in the decade, growth is once again on the upswing,
bolstered by a recovery in Italy and a thriving financial sector. A raft of reforms have been
initiated, which bode well for the resilience of the economy to shocks. Past fiscal deficits
have been reversed and public debt remains low. Nevertheless, revenue losses from tax cuts
and deteriorating balances of public enterprises will lead to a sharp reduction in the budget
surplus in 2006–07. Reflecting improved macroeconomic prospects both domestically and in
Italy, the financial sector appears to be in good shape. Financial supervision has been stepped
up and is beginning to produce results.
31.
Reforms need to continue to help the economy adjust to the changing global
environment and to improve competitiveness. San Marino’s small size and location make
10

This would facilitate, inter alia, the operation of Sammarinese financial institutions in Italy, the operation of
Italian businesses in San Marino, the registration of Italian aircrafts in San Marino, and joint initiatives on
health services.

23
it particularly vulnerable to policy changes in Italy and Europe. More flexible and modern
institutions and markets are therefore needed to facilitate quick adjustment to changing
circumstances and ease the transition toward an economy which is increasingly reliant on the
high value-added service sectors. Fiscal policy would perforce need to play a key role in
maintaining the competitiveness of the economy, while limiting the vulnerability arising
from the combination of a mobile tax base and generous entitlements.
32.
Public finances need to be shored up as a matter of priority. Unless corrective
action is taken, the consolidated government budget surplus will decline further in 2007–09.
It might be advisable to target a somewhat larger surplus than currently envisaged, to the tune
of some ½ –1 percent of GDP. Revenue losses from tax cuts should be offset by broadening
the tax base, and public enterprises must be allowed to operate as viable commercial entities
by permitting tariff adjustments in line with growing raw material costs. The government’s
efforts to increase tariffs and implement a system of automatic tariff adjustments are
welcome. Further cuts in current spending could be made, including reductions in healthcare
spending through demand-side measures. A second round of reforms in the first pillar
pension system may be warranted if the fiscal position does not improve sufficiently. A
defined contributions second pillar pension system would help cushion the impact of further
modifications to the first pillar, and should be introduced as planned.
33.
The government should consider introducing a fiscal rule to build adequate
savings to finance ageing-related costs over the medium-term. A rule based on the
consolidated governments’ net assets and liabilities would seem appropriate as this would
directly take into account the financing of contingent fiscal liabilities. Planned improvements
in budget accounting would help with the execution of this rule. Preliminary calculations
suggest that, under a rule balancing the government’s net assets and liabilities, surpluses of
1½ - 2 percent of GDP at the consolidated government level would be required to finance
pension and health expenditures over approximately a two-year period.
34.
The modernization of the financial sector should be managed with care. The
CBSM has started taking the lead in financial sector matters, until this year exclusively
within the government’s purview, and it should be allowed the necessary room to manage the
transition expeditiously. The newly enacted regulatory framework should be implemented in
an arms-length manner, and the central bank’s independence in licensing, extraordinary
administration and supervision should not be compromised.
35.
The CBSM should provide greater oversight of the financial sector. While the
withholding tax has not yet hurt competitiveness, institutions are bracing for the full impact
of this tax down the road by venturing into new lines of business and clientele where they
have less experience. Moreover, a wide variance in capital, credit quality and risk
management capabilities indicate that not all financial institutions are equally equipped or
able to cope with this transition. These risks would need to be closely monitored and to this
end, supervisory resources should be beefed up further and the first round of in-depth off-site

24
and on-site supervision completed expeditiously. The planned introduction of deposit
insurance should await the improvement in supervisory capacity. The authorities’ decision to
participate in the FSAP is timely and welcome.
36.
The labor market needs to adjust to meet the demand for high-skilled labor of
the rapidly growing service sectors and to improve competitiveness. More flexibility
would be required in procedures to hire non-residents, work contract tenures, and granting
residence permits. Regulations would be needed to facilitate outsourcing and the incentive
structure for active labor market policies should be amended to ensure that they effectively
enhance productivity.
37.
Improvements in the business climate would need to continue. The consolidation
of regulations into a single corporate law and the planned streamlining of public
administration should help businesses. The regulatory framework should be continually
updated in line with the times. The most important remaining challenges are to finalize the
cooperation agreement with Italy, and to finish upgrading the laws of the country to ensure
full compliance with international anti-money laundering provisions.
38.
Finally, the long lags in producing and disseminating statistics should be
reduced as a matter of priority. This would aid policy assessment and development. The

1/ Projections for 2007–09 based on the three-year rolling plan. The decline in direct taxes partly reflects an increase in tax exemption for house purchases; the decline in non-tax
revenues partly reflects a decline in profit transfers from public enterprises. Import taxes remain robust in line with growing trade with non-EU countries. Current expenditures are
assumed to decline and capital expenditures to increase in line with the authorities' commitments.
2/ Net of tax reimbursements.
3/ Includes custom duties, state monopolies, other special revenues, revenues from financial assets, interests on credits and deposits.
4/ Includes purchases of goods and services, remunerations for consultancies, contribution to interest payments on publicly subsidized loans, and transport costs.
5/ Net financial wealth according to the Government Financial Statistics Manual 2001 , minus the stock of unemployment compensation fund (Cassa di Compensazione).

and Italy, acting on behalf of the European Union.

APPENDIX II. SAN MARINO: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Progress has been made, but there are important shortcomings in the statistical database due
mainly to resource constraints. The authorities recognize these deficiencies, and requested
and received a STA multisector TA mission in 1997, and a STA Monetary and Financial
Statistics TA mission in 2004. Authorities also received assistance from STA in GFS
compilation. On January 12, 2007, the authorities announced their intention to participate in
the GDDS and named two National GDDS Coordinators. The authorities are planning to
increase the frequency of website updates starting January 2007 in order to improve data
dissemination.
Since 1992 the authorities have produced an experimental set of national accounts. Data
for 1995 onward have been calculated in accordance with ESA95. The authorities have also
calculated sectoral value added. However, output data are published with two-year delay.
Consumer prices are collected directly at the source and published monthly with short delay.
Furthermore, a business production index was launched in 2006, and the authorities are
planning to compile a business sentiment index starting 2007.
Regarding the government finance statistics, the authorities have provided data for the
consolidated central government as well as budgetary central government, extra budgetary
accounts, and social security funds for 2002–05 in accordance with the Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 methodology. However, the data have been compiled with 1–2½
years lag. Beyond reporting to the Fund, budgetary accounting does not follow international
best practice. The central government budget is written so as to close at par, which implies
that standard financing items, such as amortization, are included as an expenditure while
”borrowing requirement” is included among the revenues. In the event, however, revenue
shortfalls have been financed by (i) drawing down deposits at the central bank; (ii) changes
in volumes of payables/receivables; and (iii) new loans. The deficit/surplus concept
monitored by the authorities (the avanzo/disavanzo d’esercizio) is the difference between
assessed revenues and committed expenditure on an accrual basis, and by the difference
between asset float and liability float eliminated. This concept is different from a standard
central government balance on an accrual basis, as it includes arrears and yet-to-be-collected
revenues among accrued expenditures. The authorities launched a new publication on crosscountry pubic finance data in 2006 based on existing data.
Regarding monetary statistics, the authorities have, since May 1997, provided balance sheet
data on the commercial banks and the monetary authorities to the STA’s EIS database. These
data are provided on a quarterly basis, with approximately a six-week reporting lag. The
authorities have introduced laws and took some measures to improve coverage and timeliness
of banks’ reporting, and the CBSM has improved sectorization (allowing for reliable
identification of all transactions of the central government and the social security fund in

4
monetary statistics) and expanded data collection to cover the offshore asset management
activities of banks. The breakdown of deposits (and other assets and liabilities) between
residents and nonresidents and the breakdown of short-term credit by public and private
sector components are also available. However, there is no broad money survey and data on
nonbank financial intermediaries are lacking.
San Marino does not compile balance of payments accounts; given the currency union with
Italy and the subsequent introduction of the euro, the authorities have not considered this a
high priority and have, therefore, not committed the necessary resources.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for Republic of San Marino
and Valerio Crispolti, Advisor to Executive Director
February 23, 2007

At the outset, we wish to convey our authorities’ deepest appreciation for the work done by
the Fund’s mission team and for the high-quality paper, which underscores the progress made
by San Marino's economy and identifies its medium-term challenges. The authorities have
greatly benefited from the staff’s advice and continue to enjoy an extremely fruitful
relationship with the Fund. In the coming months, staff’s recommendations will be at the
center of policy discussions with unions and business associations.
Background
San Marino’s economic performance remains robust, benefiting from an improved external
environment and the implementation of important structural reforms that are now producing
concrete results. In 2006, GDP growth is estimated to have reached a robust 5 percent, while
inflation remained subdued. In this context, the unemployment rate is expected to show a
further decline to about 3 percent – after a peak of 4 percent in 2003.
In July 2006, a new government took office with the mandate to revamp international
cooperation agreements, most importantly with Italy; further consolidate San Marino’s fiscal
position; and support the integration of its financial system into global financial markets.
Fiscal policy
The authorities are fully committed to maintaining public finances on a sustainable path.
They are well aware of the risks stemming from an erosion of the consolidated government
budget surplus, and intend to implement appropriate measures to further consolidate the
country’s fiscal position.
On the revenue side, despite the limited room for maneuver due to San Marino’s mobile tax
base, the authorities intend to enhance revenue mobilization by further strengthening tax
administration, while maintaining tax rates at low levels to preserve competitiveness.
On the expenditure side, our authorities aim to reduce the share of current spending over total
expenses, so as to increase capital outlays. Such a strategy will provide San Marino with the
modern infrastructure necessary for its transition to an economy increasingly based on
high-value-added service sectors. Within this framework, measures have already been taken
to reduce transfers to public companies: on February 1, 2007, tariffs were significantly
adjusted, and a second round of adjustments is due on July 1, 2007, leading to a cumulative
average increase of almost 14 percent in tariffs paid by households. Moreover, the authorities
are pursuing a gradual reduction in the size of the civil service. In this respect, greater

2
attention will be paid to making the civil service more effective, including by encouraging
mobility within the administration, simplifying procedures, and streamlining red tape. To
further contain healthcare spending, the government is considering implementing
supplementary measures in the form of co-payments.
In 2006, following the Fund’s recommendations, the pension system was thoroughly
reformed so as to prevent a further deterioration in the social security balances. The reform
also envisages the introduction of a defined contribution second pillar, whose nature is
currently the subject of intense negotiations between the government and the relevant social
counterparts (Box 1 in the staff’s paper). In addition, the authorities intend to strengthen the
management of the social security fund and to consolidate pension funds for non-salaried
workers so as to prevent unforeseen overruns. Further, the government does not exclude the
possibility of new changes to the first pillar pension, should the actuarial calculations indicate
clear sustainability risks.
Finally, while carefully considering the staff’s proposal for a fiscal rule to ensure adequate
savings at the consolidated government level, the authorities remain under the impression
that the current system already provides sufficient safeguards. In addition, they note that for
an effective and transparent implementation of such a rule, further improvements in budget
accounting would be necessary.
Financial sector
The development of a sound and modern financial system, capable of attracting foreign
investors and competing with other international financial centers, is a priority in the
authorities’ agenda. Thus, several important measures have been taken to strengthen the
institutional and regulatory framework, in accordance with staff’s recommendations.
In 2005, the recently established Central Bank of San Marino (CBSM) was granted financial
sector supervisory powers by the government, and a new financial sector law was passed to
modernize and align the regulatory framework to international standards. More recently, the
CBSM and the government implemented the necessary regulatory and fiscal measures to set
up the Sammarinese mutual fund business.
The government acknowledges the importance of allowing CBSM to implement the new
supervisory framework in an arm's-length manner and stands ready to further buttress its
independence, if necessary. At the same time, CBSM is committed to enhancing oversight of
the financial sector, including by strengthening transparency and disclosure requirements as
well as by hiring additional staff. Accordingly, CBSM is currently finalizing a new banking
regulation to further improve prudential supervision safeguards. CBSM is also recruiting
additional supervisory resources.

3
Meanwhile, the CBSM has been able to start a more in-depth round of on-site supervision.
This led to the discovery of irregularities in two small financial institutions -- currently under
direct administration by the CBSM -- and, on February 15, 2007, to the immediate
suspension of another financial company’s activities for a period of six months.
To benefit from the introduction of international best practices, the authorities have been
opening the system to greater international scrutiny. To this end, they have requested a
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), which will also help them prioritize the
necessary interventions to further strengthen the sector. Importantly, the authorities’ efforts
to develop the financial sector have been accompanied by the strengthening of anti-money
laundering surveillance. San Marino has signed all the relevant international agreements,
such as the 1990 Strasbourg Convention, the European Convention on Mutual Assistance on
Criminal Matters, and the European Convention on Extradition. San Marino is also a member
of the Council of Europe's Select Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money
Laundering Measures. More recently, San Marino has become a member of the Egmont
Group. The next AML/CFT evaluation by MONEYVAL is expected to take place in March
2007.
Statistics
Notwithstanding serious resource constraints, San Marino has made commendable progress
in the compilation of statistics: data on fiscal accounts and on monetary and financial sectors
are now produced according to international standards and published in the IFS.
Nevertheless, the authorities acknowledge that further efforts are necessary to reduce current
lags in the compilation of statistics and to improve dissemination practices. We are happy to
inform the Board that the authorities intend to participate in the General Data Dissemination
Standards (GDDS). In this regard, two National GDDS Coordinators have already been
appointed.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of San Marino
On February 23, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of San Marino.1
Background
San Marino has been undergoing a profound transformation. It has come a long way since
the early part of this decade when growth was sputtering, public finances were precarious,
and the economy was mired in old-fashioned modus operandi. Responding to global
competition, San Marino is becoming a more dynamic economy oriented toward the
service sectors, by modernizing its laws and regulations and opening itself to new
opportunities for growth. At the same time, it is experiencing the impact of an ageing
population and has started taking action on several fronts to ensure that there are enough
savings to make good on the promise of generous entitlements to its residents.
These policies have begun to bear fruit. Output growth has rebounded to an estimated 5
percent in 2006, reflecting the recovery in Italy and Europe and improving competitiveness.
Barring unforeseen circumstances, growth is expected to remain strong in the coming
years. The budget deficits of yesteryears have been replaced by a string of surpluses
through spending restraint, especially on wages and healthcare. However, revenue losses
from tax cuts, increasing transfers to public enterprises, and spending overruns have
eroded the budget surplus in 2006, and this trend will likely continue in 2007-09 under
current plans. Nevertheless, public debt remains low, and an ambitious reform of the first
pillar pension system has been enacted to combat ageing-related spending pressures.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

Reflecting the healthy economy and an increase in international deposits, the financial
sector appears profitable, liquid and well capitalized. A wide-ranging reform of the
regulatory framework and supervision is underway to modernize the financial sector and
make it conform to international standards. Financial institutions are adjusting, so far
successfully, to these and other changes relating to international taxation. Efforts to
improve supervision are beginning to produce results. Finally, tax cuts, greater efficiency in
tax payment procedures, and labor market reforms to simplify hiring procedures and
encourage training have improved the business climate and competitiveness, and
bolstered growth prospects.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed San Marino’s strong economic performance and improved
growth prospects, supported by a broad range of policy initiatives, which bode well for
strengthening the economy’s resilience. They encouraged the authorities to continue with
reforms to enhance institutional flexibility and help ease the economy’s transition to
increased reliance on high value-adding service sectors. Directors also drew attention to
the fiscal policy challenges arising from an ageing population, mobile factors of production,
generous entitlements, and the need to keep tax rates competitive to attract and retain
investment.
In light of ageing-related spending pressures over the medium term, Directors encouraged
the authorities to take measures to stop the further reduction in the budget surplus
expected over 2007–09. The tax base should be broadened further to offset the revenue
losses from tax rate cuts, and current spending should be restrained further to make room
for needed public investment. Transfers to public enterprises should be reduced by
allowing these enterprises to operate as viable commercial entities, and, in this context,
Directors supported the government’s decision to increase tariffs. They also noted that
healthcare spending should be further contained through demand-side measures.
Directors considered that a second round of reforms in the first pillar pension system may
be warranted if the fiscal position does not strengthen. They supported plans to introduce a
mandatory defined-contribution second pillar pension system in 2007. While the current
fiscal framework may already provide sufficient safeguards, Directors noted the authorities’
intention to consider a rules-based approach to promote fiscal discipline.
The financial sector appears to be adjusting well to the new taxation and legislative regime.
Directors called for an expeditious implementation of the new regulatory framework,
allowing the Central Bank of San Marino (CBSM) to operate in an arms-length manner.
Directors observed that institutions in the financial sector are venturing into new lines of
business with new risks, increasing the importance of adequate supervision and oversight
of the sector. In this vein, the first round of in-depth examinations should be completed
expeditiously. Directors recommended that the introduction of deposit insurance should

3

await the strengthening of financial sector supervision. They welcomed the authorities’
decision to participate in the Financial Sector Assessment Program.
Directors considered that maintaining competitiveness will be key to sustaining growth. To
accommodate service sector demand for skilled labor, a further easing of restrictions on
hiring non-residents and residency may be appropriate. Directors welcomed the
improvements in the business climate, including the planned streamlining of public
administration, and encouraged the authorities of Italy and San Marino to finalize the
cooperation agreement between the two countries. They looked forward to further progress
in adjusting San Marino’s legislation to the highest international anti-money laundering
standards.
Directors welcomed the improvements in fiscal, financial, and monetary statistics, and
encouraged the authorities to further reduce the lags in data production and dissemination.
They supported the authorities’ decision to participate in the General Data Dissemination
Standard.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
