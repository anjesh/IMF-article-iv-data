IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Kiribati

On July 24, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Kiribati, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a
meeting2.
Recent economic performance has been strong. Donor-financed large infrastructure projects and
a pick-up in credit to households have boosted real GDP growth to close to 4 percent in 2014 and
to about 3 percent in 2015. Inflation remains low, underpinned by lower food and commodity
prices. The current account turned into a strong surplus in 2013–14 on account of the high
fishing license fees.
The fiscal outlook has improved markedly in recent years. The recurrent balance was in large
surplus in 2014 and is expected to remain positive in 2015, reflecting high revenue from license
fees and notwithstanding a large increase in development expenditures. On structural reforms,
significant progress has been achieved with the introduction of VAT in 2014 and implementation
of the State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) Reform Act, including privatization of key assets.
The medium-term outlook is relatively favorable although growth is expected to weaken in the
next few years with the completion of large donor financed infrastructure projects. A major risk
to the outlook is the revenue from fishing license fees, which has been very high in the last few
years but could decline sharply in future given its volatility. The recent damages caused by
Cyclone Pam and high tidal waves underscore the risks and the economic and social costs related
to climate change and natural disasters.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse of time procedure when it is agreed by the Board that a
proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.

Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2015 Article IV consultation with Kiribati, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Economic performance has been strong, buoyed by large donor-financed infrastructure projects.
Staff projects real GDP growth will remain above 3 percent in 2015, while inflation should stay
low.
The fiscal position has improved markedly, but further efforts are needed to ensure
sustainability. We commend the authorities for achieving substantial fiscal surpluses in recent
years, although the improvement was mainly driven by record-high fishing license fees which
can be volatile. Recent increases in recurrent expenditures are partly explained by a more
transparent support to SOEs. Nevertheless, the historical pace of increase in spending is
unsustainable over the long term.
Nominal expenditure growth should be limited to 1½ per year over the next years. In order to
enhance fiscal discipline, budget contingencies should be built in for unexpected expenditures,
consistent with this expenditure path. Public sector wages and SOEs’ subsidies should be
contained to create room for pro-growth and climate change-related expenditures. Expenditure
growth path may be increased over time when the fiscal position has strengthened and become
more sustainable, depending on the fishing license fees outturn.
The introduction of the VAT has overall been successful and revenues are in line with
expectations. Consideration should be given to phase out existing exemptions and replace them
with targeted support of low income households. If exemptions are to be maintained, the list
should be short and narrowly defined.
Strengthening the RERF (Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund—sovereign wealth fund) should
remain a key policy goal. Important progress has been made in reforming RERF financial
management. Transfers and withdrawals should be more transparent and symmetric around the
proposed expenditure path: subject to maintaining a cash buffer equivalent to around two months
of budget expenditures, a substantial part of the current above-average surpluses should be saved
to allow for sustainable drawdowns when they fall below the average. Accordingly, the major
part of the 2014 surplus should be transferred to the RERF.
Progress has been made in creating conditions for private sector growth. Going forward, further
lowering telecommunication and transportation costs, streamlining business registration
processes, and facilitating the private usage of land will be critical to improve the investment
climate and lift growth prospects.
There has also been progress on implementing the reform of SOEs to improve their efficiency
and contain the drain on public finances. Going forward, the authorities are encouraged to further
reduce the copra subsidy and speed up the restructuring of the energy sector through further

3
increasing the efficiency of the two energy companies and rationalizing the structure of both fuel
and electricity prices.
Given fiscal constraints, Kiribati will need continued support from donors and IFIs. Future
donor-supported projects should focus on climate change mitigation measures, and improving
the provision of basic services such as water, electricity, housing, education, and health.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Donor-financed large infrastructure projects, increased public spending, and a
pick-up in credit to households have boosted real GDP growth to close to 4 percent
in 2014 and to about 3 percent in 2015. Inflation remains low, underpinned by lower
food and commodity prices. Steps are being taken to reduce the many hurdles to private
growth that Kiribati faces, among which are high transportation and communication
costs and an increasing impact of climate change.
Fiscal policy. The fiscal outlook has improved, but further efforts are needed to ensure
sustainability. The recurrent balance was in large surplus in 2014 and is expected to
remain positive in 2015, reflecting high revenue from license fees, and notwithstanding a
large increase in expenditures. But under the historic pace of spending the sovereign
wealth fund (Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund—RERF) would be depleted in about 20
years. Ensuring sustainability requires containing nominal expenditure growth to around
1½ per annum over the next five years (after accommodating climate-change-related
costs), with transparent and symmetric transfers and withdrawals from the RERF around
this path.
Structural reforms. There is a consensus among donors that significant progress has
been achieved. The State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) Reform Act is being implemented in a
satisfactory way, as illustrated by the recent successful privatization of the
telecommunication company. Key outstanding issues include further reforming the
energy and copra sectors and improving the investment climate.

KIRIBATI

BACKGROUND
1.
Kiribati is one of the most remote and geographically dispersed small states in the
world. Its territory comprises 33 islands spread over 3.5 million square kilometers of ocean and a
population of about 100,000. High transportation and communication costs, together with weak
infrastructure and poor investment climate, are key obstacles to development. Extreme poverty is
low, at around 5 percent, but 22 percent of the population lives below the basic needs poverty line.
Climate change presents significant challenges given the low elevation of the land and rising sea
levels.
2.
Kiribati’s economy is supported by revenues from the sovereign wealth fund, fishing
license fees and donors’ aids. The sovereign wealth fund (RERF) was established in 1956 to save
proceeds from mining phosphate deposits before they were exhausted in 1979 and for fiscal
stabilization. Its balance declined from 565 percent of GDP in 2006 to 365 percent last year due to
higher than sustainable drawdowns (to finance deficits stemming largely from weak tax compliance
and increasing subsidies to SOEs) but also because of capital losses during the Global Financial
Crisis. Fishing license fees have been volatile, but their management has improved due to a regional
agreement to charge higher fees and limit the total number of fishing days and the number of
vessels (‘Nauru Agreement’). The country relies on foreign aid to finance its large development
needs.
3.
The key policy challenge is to continue to manage these resources wisely, while
overcoming obstacles to private sector growth To this end, the authorities have embarked on an
ambitious macroeconomic reform program supported by the IMF (through provision of technical
assistance) and other development partners. 1 The Economic Reform Plan intends to restore fiscal
sustainability through improvements in revenue performance and containing public expenditure,
while safeguarding vital public services and infrastructure investments. Significant progress has been
made following the previous Fund advice, including in the area of debt management (costly
overdraft debt has been cleared and non-concessional borrowing eliminated), tax reforms
(implementation of the VAT last year), asset management of the RERF, and SOE performance. But
more progress is needed in fiscal reforms to fully secure sustainability and improve resilience to
shocks, and in structural reforms to support private sector growth.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
4.
Recent economic performance has been strong. With the strengthening of the vessel day
scheme, fishing license fees have been on the rise in the last three years, reaching a record-high
68 percent of GDP in 2014 (compared to the past average of about 20 percent). Donor-financed
infrastructure projects (mainly in the road, port, and aviation sectors) have also reached
unprecedented levels (45 percent of GDP in 2014). This, together with a pick-up in credit to

World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (AsDB), the EU, and Australia and New Zealand development partners.

households, boosted GDP growth, which was around 4 percent in 2014. Growth is projected at
about 3 percent in 2015, driven by stepped-up infrastructure projects feeding through into activity
in the retail sector, as well as reconstruction activity after the extreme weather damages earlier in
the year. Inflation remains subdued, underpinned by lower food and commodity prices.

5.
The current account turned positive in 2014 on account of the high fishing license fees,
but is expected to revert to a deficit in 2015. High imports related to donors’ projects—largely
matched by external grants—are projected to offset gains from lower oil prices, estimated at around
5 percent of GDP in 2015. Remittances have decreased in recent years, but they should pick-up as
employment overseas increases back to past levels after the implementation of additional
employment schemes. Reflecting developments in the Australian dollar, the exchange rate has
depreciated in real effective terms to below the historical average, but the effect on the current
account is expected to be limited as trade dynamics are dominated by structural factors (Box 1).
6.
Fishing license fees should remain high in 2015. On the one hand, fishing license fees
revenues have been very strong during the first four months of 2015, exceeding their level during
the first four months of 2014. On the other hand, the Phoenix Island Protected Area (PIPA) has been
temporarily closed to protect the stock of fish, and the significant drop in tuna price since the
beginning of the year should have a negative impact on revenues going forward. On balance, staff
anticipates that fishing revenues should remain high in 2015, although below the 2014 peak.
7.
Against this backdrop, the recurrent fiscal balance is expected to be positive in 2015 for
the third consecutive year. The recurrent balance turned positive in 2013, further strengthened
in 2014, and should remain in surplus in 2015. The improvement was mainly driven by record high
fishing license fees. Recurrent expenditures increased by nearly 13 percent in 2014 and a further
5 percent in 2015 (per supplementary budget), but wages and salaries have remained under control.
The increase in expenditures in 2014 reflected bringing on budget the previously non-transparent
support to the state-owned power company (equivalent to around 3½ percent of GDP) and a oneoff transfer to clear the debt of one large SOE (worth around 4 percent of GDP), both following
previous staff recommendations. The increase in 2015 expenditures was largely the result of weather

on the one hand, and global commodity prices on the
other hand).
The use of the Australian dollar as the official currency remains appropriate 2. Kiribati needs a strong
nominal anchor and does not have institutional capacity to conduct its own monetary policy. The choice
of the Australian dollar is dictated by strong trade and financial linkages (investment of a large share of
RERF assets in Australian markets).

2

The Australian dollar circulates as legal tender. Kiribati has accepted the obligations under Article VIII of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.

8.
The medium-term outlook is more uncertain and will be mostly driven by the realized
level of future fishing license fees. The fishing license fees are expected to stay higher than their
historical level but fall from their 2014 peak. These revenues remain highly volatile and subject to
downside risks. Furthermore, donors’ activity is projected to diminish with the completion of large
infrastructure projects. This will reduce growth in the medium term and, if the discipline is not
maintained, could again expose fiscal pressures. Furthermore, the extent of the recent damages
caused by Cyclone Pam and high tidal waves underscore the risks and the economic and social costs
related to climate change. Finally, returns on RERF and other financial assets could also be affected
by global risks. A protracted period of slower global growth and low inflation could compress both
equity returns and bond yields for several years (RAM Annex).

RESTORING SUSTAINABILITY AND IMPROVING
RESILIENCE TO SHOCKS
The key policy challenge is to manage the intergenerational benefits of Kiribati’s large sovereign
wealth fund against a background of uncertainty about future fishing license fees and spending
pressures to address important infrastructure and social needs and prepare for the adverse
consequences of climate change. Spending growth should be reduced from historic levels, public
investments largely grant-financed, and structural fiscal reforms accelerated.
9.
The medium-term fiscal outlook appears more favorable in the context of higher
expectations for fishing license fees, but downside risks are significant. The baseline for the
main fiscal revenue—fishing license fees—has been revised upwards. The large increase in this
source of revenue in the past years can be attributed to the recent changes adopted under the
Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA): effective in 2012, the PNA introduced a US$5,000 minimum
fee for fishing per vessel day, subsequently increased to US$6,000 in 2014 and to US$8,000 in 2015.
If member countries manage to enforce the agreement, this could lead to a lasting increase in
revenues. Staff considers such enforcement as the baseline scenario, and annual fishing license fees
are accordingly projected to be around 40 percent of GDP on average over 2015–20, up from an
average of about 24 percent of GDP over the past decades, but below outturns averaging more than
50 percent of GDP in 2013–14. Because these revenues are inherently uncertain (fishing stock and
prices are volatile, including the risk of overfishing), lower fishing license fees represent a plausible
and high impact downside risk. Staff accordingly discussed fiscal policy approaches that would be
sustainable in the event that license fees revert to the past historical average (Box 3).3
10.
In addition, spending pressures are increasing. First, additional infrastructure and other
spending will be needed to mitigate the effects of climate change, such as drought, loss of potable
ground water, and rising sea levels. Climate change related costs are highly uncertain but are
assumed to be at around 3½ percent of GDP per annum (Box 2). Second, room needs to be made

within the budget envelope to accommodate future maintenance costs of the newly constructed
infrastructure, which are expected to be only partly covered by user charges. Taken together, these
pressures could require additional budgetary expenditures amounting to around 4 percent of GDP
per annum (largely for capital maintenance and recurrent climate-change-related costs), and the
continuation of high donors’ support for capital spending.

Box 2. The Key Challenge of Adapting to Climate Change
Climate change poses a major threat to Kiribati and could lead to significant fiscal pressures.
The rise in the sea levels has both a structural and a cyclical component. The structural component is
related to climate change and while still moderate, it is on track to become much more significant as
Kiribati’s average height above sea level is only around 2 meters and climate model simulations estimate
that sea level could increase by 24 cm by 2050 and 61 cm by 2100 compared to the 1985–2005 average .1
This trend is compounded by the medium term cyclical impact of predominance of El Niño, putting upward
pressure on sea levels and causing larger and more frequent high tide levels (the current cycle could
continue for another 10–20 years).
The main impact of climate change will be through rising sea levels, but also warmer average
temperatures and more frequent and severe storms. This would lead to permanent erosion of the
shoreline and loss of land, frequent inundation, lower biodiversity, lower agricultural production, and water
resource and food security issues. Waves and unprecedented flooding already caused severe and costly
destruction earlier this year. Higher temperatures and wider flooded areas could increase the spread of
vector borne diseases such as dengue fever.
While the fiscal costs are uncertain, they are likely to be substantial. Coastal protection costs alone are
estimated be in the region of 1 percent of GDP per annum.2 These estimates can be seen as a floor: they
exclude any transition costs, as well as the potential cost of inefficiencies in adaptation responses. Additional
expenditures will be needed to adapt to climate variability, such as repairing damages arising from more
frequent extreme weather events, or those associated with adjustments in response to the salinization of
agricultural land. The annual adaptation costs could be in the range of ½ to 1½ percent of GDP (medium
emissions scenario) and as high as 2½ percent of GDP in the worst case scenario.3
Overall, climate change related costs could reach 3½ percent per year, and possibly more in worst
case scenarios. Given Kiribati’s fiscal constraints, this would require more donor funding towards these
needs, including from the new Green Climate Fund.

Against this backdrop, continued fiscal prudence is required to preserve fiscal
sustainability and maintain resilience to shocks. Given that the (RERF) is the main mechanism to
save wealth for future generations and a buffer against shocks, staff policy advice focused on
strengthening its role as an anchor for fiscal sustainability:


Preserving wealth. Returns on RERF investments are an important source of income for Kiribati.
For intergenerational equity, they should be distributed proportionally to the growing
population, ensuring constant real per capita budget drawdowns over time. From this
perspective, the sustainable level of drawdown is estimated at about 3–4 percent of GDP (the
wide range reflects uncertainty surrounding projected investment returns and population
growth). Given the downside risks to fishing license fees, staff recommended that expenditure
plans be framed around a more conservative fiscal stance, aiming at a RERF drawdown
averaging about ½ percent of GDP over 2016-2020. This would help accumulate savings when
fish license fees remain strong, while limiting the RERF drawdown in the event that they would
disappoint.



Expenditure rule. The RERF drawdown of ½ percent of GDP annually would be consistent with
recurrent expenditure growth of 1.5 percent per annum over the next 5 years, assuming fishing
licenses fees remain robust. This would result in a gradual reduction in real per capita spending,
but leave sufficient room to cover pressing expenditure needs (see below). If license fees remain
strong, real per capita RERF balances would rise, implicitly saving for future generations part of
the fishing revenues and providing a buffer against higher climate-change-related costs. With
greater confidence about the durability of fishing license fees, the sustainable rate of spending
could be revisited, perhaps leading to faster spending growth beyond the 5-years horizon. With
lower fishing revenues—closer to the historical average—RERF per capita balances would
initially fall, but later stabilize, guaranteeing that the proposed expenditure path is sustainable,
although with smaller buffers (Box 3). This approach to fiscal sustainability would also require
that capital spending be primarily grant-financed.



Stabilization. For the RERF to perform its dual role, the policy of budget transfers and
withdrawals should be more transparent, systematic and symmetric around the proposed
expenditure path. Staff recommended saving a substantial part of the revenues in the RERF
when license fees are above average to allow for a sustainable drawdown when they fall below
the average. Given more volatile weather patterns, staff also recommended maintaining a larger
cash buffer—equivalent to around two months of budget expenditures (around
AUD20 million)—in light of volatility of revenue and in case of emergency needs. A part of the
cash balance from the 2014 budget surplus could be used for this purpose, with the rest
transferred to the RERF. To date, only AUD 10 million out of the record 2014 fiscal surplus of
around AUD 50 million was transferred to the RERF.4

4

Last year, the authorities purchased 20 square kilometers of land in Fiji in 2014, for around AUD 9 million drawn
down from the RERF, so the net savings in the RERF was very small. The aim of the purchase was to improve food
security through agriculture and fish farming projects and eventually for potential resettlement if rising sea levels
threaten to submerge parts of Kiribati.

from around AUD 9,300 in 2000.
Staff simulations indicate than targeting an annual expenditure growth of 1½ percent in the medium
term would restore sustainability. Staff analyzes two scenarios for revenues from fishing license fees: (i) a
baseline where they stay high (AUD 100 Million on average over 2015–35); (ii) a decrease to an average of AUD
63 million, consistent with the historical average of around 24 percent of GDP since 1991:



would be unsustainable, leading to a depletion of the RERF in about 20 years, even in the higher fishing
revenue scenario.



Expenditure growth of 1½ percent per year would
ensure sustainability in both scenarios. Under the lower
revenue scenario, it would stabilize the RERF around
AUD 4,000 in real per capita terms by 2035. In the higher
revenue scenario, this path would increase RERF real per
capita balances to around AUD 6,000, effectively saving
part of the fishing revenue windfall, and therefore
further improving intergenerational equity. This would
allow for higher sustainable transfers to the budget,
helping stabilize real per capita expenditures in the long
term.

Fishing revenues are likely to remain volatile, and long-term policy commitments should be guided by
indicators that are not affected by such volatility. While the proposed expenditure path is a viable anchor,
complementary indicators could include the recurrent non-fish balance (i.e. the current fiscal balance excluding
fishing revenues). The proposed expenditure path would be consistent with maintaining the recurrent non-fish
deficit at below 35 percent of GDP.

12.
Improved management of the RERF is critical for the success of the adjustment. The
disappointing financial performance of the RERF in the past several years highlighted that
investment policy and strategic asset allocation were not aligned with the long term objectives and
10

nature of the fund. With ongoing assistance from the World Bank, the Cabinet of Ministers recently
approved reforms that are in the process of being implemented. The current phase is focusing on
the appointment of new asset manager(s), which is advancing well. In the context of reforming the
fund investment mandate, staff also discussed the idea of better articulating the saving and
stabilization roles of the RERF and making these objectives explicit in formulating the optimal
investment strategy of the fund.
13.
The recommended fiscal path has sufficient room to accommodate new spending
needs, but it will require the continuation of efforts on several fronts. The 2015 budget
includes one-off expenditures—mainly for weather-related damages—equivalent to around
4 percent of GDP. Staff projections assume that costs of a similar magnitude (covering both climatechange-related spending and the maintenance of new capital assets) will become permanent. There
is sufficient room for this in the overall budget envelope provided that other recurrent spending
remains contained. This requires the continuation of the current wage policy (allowing for a ‘wage
drift’ from the automatic promotion process, but no additional wage increases) and maintaining
subsidies to SOEs at the current nominal level (by exploiting efficiency gains from the restructuring
of the energy sector and the copra sector, for which Technical Assistance is underway). To avoid
expenditure surprises and enhance fiscal discipline budget, contingencies for unexpected
expenditures should be provided within the envelope consistent with the recommended path. The
authorities’ prudent debt management and policy of avoiding non-concessional debt financing of
the recurrent budget should also continue. Given moderate growth prospects, the scope for external
borrowing—even from IFIs at concessional terms—remains limited (DSA Annex).
14.
Improving tax compliance and collection is also an essential element of the strategy.
After staying broadly stable at around 19 percent of GDP in the two decades leading to 2007, tax
revenues started declining in 2008 and had dropped to about 14 percent of GDP in 2014. The VAT
was introduced in 2014 as a key element of the fiscal reforms. The implementation of the tax has
been successful, as revenues are in line with expectations. This, together with efforts to improve
compliance and strengthen SOE efficiency, would allow for the tax ratio to gradually increase to
17 percent in the next five years. However, recent policy proposals—such as widening the already
broad list of exemptions to essential services—would undermine tax collection. It would also
increase tax administration and compliance costs for businesses. To guard against this risk, further
exemptions should be avoided, and consideration should be given to phasing out existing
exemptions and replacing them with targeted support for low income households and direct
transfer payments. If exemptions are to be maintained, the list should be short and narrowly
defined.
Authorities’ Views
15.
The authorities remain committed to secure a sustainable fiscal position. They
acknowledged that given the volatility of fishing license fees, they cannot count on fees staying at
their 2014 level for an extended period. Reflecting these concerns, spending in 2014 and 2015
budgets had remained contained, notwithstanding increases that were due to more transparent
budgeting, one-off spending, and natural disasters. They have the intention to maintain spending

discipline in the future, and are considering additional transfers to the RERF, as well as maintaining a
larger cash buffer and investing part of the surplus in alternative safe financial assets given the
transition in RERF asset management. They also pointed out the trade-off between the need to
strengthen the RERF and the immediate infrastructure and social needs of Kiribati, and in this
context they welcomed staff advice to allocate additional resources to climate-change-related and
maintenance expenditures. Regarding tax policy, the authorities were concerned about the negative
public perception of the impact of VAT on prices, which led to the proposal to exempt essential
services from the tax, but the authorities remain committed not to undermine the tax.

PROMOTING GROWTH AND REDUCING POVERTY
Increasing growth opportunities will require alleviating key barriers to private sector growth, pursuing
the implementation of SOE reforms, and enhancing access to finance for viable business projects, while
maintaining adequate financial risk management.

A. Removing Barriers to Private Sector Growth
16.
Important progress is being made in creating conditions for private sector growth, but
more needs to be done. In addition to progress in improving the physical infrastructure through
donor-funded projects, the authorities have successfully privatized the telecommunication company.
Improvement in telecommunication can lower transaction costs and foster private sector activity in a
number of areas. Most importantly, it could promote the development of mobile banking, where
Kiribati is currently lagging behind other small states in the Pacific. It could also facilitate the delivery
of government services and the payment of taxes, fees and bills via electronic and mobile devices. In
this context, consideration could be given to initiatives that may further support investment in these
areas utilizing donors’ funding. The government is also making efforts to promote competition in
the airline industry. Enhancing competition could make Kiribati more accessible by reducing
transportation costs, and promote tourism. Going forward, improving business climate, in particular
through further streamlining business registration processes and facilitating private usage of
government-owned land, is critical to fostering private sector growth (see Box 4).
17.
Supporting policies should continue to focus on building human capital and better
utilizing marine resources. The recent expansion of the Marine Training Center will help raise
teaching standards for fishermen to internationally-recognized levels. This is an important
achievement given improved employment prospects abroad and also in the context of government
efforts to develop the domestic fishing industry. In this context, the expansion of joint projects with
Kiribati Fishing Limited—if well-managed—may boost employment, exports and domestic activity.
Developing other domestic resources—such as agriculture production— should also be encouraged
particularly if government support is limited and if it facilitates a gradual reduction in copra
subsidies. As donor-funded infrastructure projects are completed, shifting the focus to maintenance
of infrastructure could also promote private sector growth and employment by outsourcing this
activity to microenterprise units.

Authorities’ views
18.
The authorities broadly agreed with priorities identified by staff to foster private
sector growth. They reiterated that continued development of the fishing sector is key to improve
growth and employment. They are also committed to reducing communication and transportation
costs, not only internationally but also between Tarawa and outer islands, but pointed to difficulties
in developing viable alternatives for international air transport links.

B. Implementing SOE Reforms
19.
Significant progress has been made in SOE reforms. Reforming SOEs is important not
only for a better allocation of scarce public resources (through reducing subsidies and guarantees to
underperforming enterprises), but their divestment would also open opportunities for private sector
growth. Recent progress includes the adoption of the SOE Act in 2013, the closure of
underperforming SOEs, and the measures taken to commercialize and improve the operational
efficiency of other SOEs (Box 5).
Box 5. Improving the Efficiency of State-Owned Enterprises1
The SOE Act approved in 2013 was an important milestone, stipulating the requirement for every SOE
to operate as a successful and sustainable business. The key areas of focus are the following:



Improved financial reporting and governance. All SOEs (currently 18) should submit Statement of Intents
no later than 2 months before the beginning of the financial year. This allows SOEs to think strategically,
improve their business plans and better manage their cash flows. The number of civil servants on SOE
Boards has also been reduced.



Greater transparency of subsidies, in particular through introducing on-budget subsidies covering
community service obligations.



Restructuring. Because the public sector had expanded excessively into several commercial activities that
could be undertaken by the private sector, it was decided to assess for each SOE whether it should be
kept as a fully public entity (and possibly restructured), privatized, or moved towards a public-private
partnership model. Decision criteria included the SOE primary role (commercial, regulatory,
administrative), its supply of community service obligations, and its viability.



Monitoring. The Act also established the SOE Monitoring Unit within the Ministry of Finance and
Economic Development to monitor the performance of all SOEs.

Significant steps have already been taken, with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank and the
World Bank. Several SOEs were successfully privatized (government hotel, government retailer, and
Telecommunications Company) and a few others should be transformed into public-private partnership
concessions (shipping and shipyard), although the majority will remain under government control. The
government is also merging the two SOEs in the coconut sector to improve efficiency. Overall, profitability of
most SOEs has been improving. Future technical assistance will assist in seeking solutions to improve
performance of the electricity company.

20.
Staff also encouraged the authorities to speed up the restructuring of the energy
sector. Notwithstanding recent improvements and plans for further increasing the efficiency of the
electricity and oil importer/distributor companies, the financial situation of the former remains a
drain on public sector resources and also undermines the performance of the latter through
payment arrears. Going forward, rationalizing the structure of both fuel and electricity prices
(cushioning the impact of higher tariffs through targeted transfers for the poor) would be an
important step towards increasing the transparency of public sector operations and improving the
provision of essential services. The current level of oil prices provides an opportunity to implement
these changes without delay.
Authorities’ Views
21.
The authorities remain fully committed to the SOE reform agenda. On the energy
sector, they noted the need to see more efficiency gains in the electricity company and to wait for
upcoming technical assistance before considering additional measures.

C. Fostering Financial Deepening
22.
The recent credit expansion has been driven by personal loans, largely from public
financial institutions (PFIs). The financial system is

this creates high risks for participants in the system.5 Liquidity in the commercial bank (ANZ) has
been ample after the repayment of public sector overdrafts, which creates room for lending to the
private sector. Facilitating private sector access to credit would therefore be best achieved by
removing structural impediments: improving financial education, land access procedures, dispute
resolution mechanism, recovery processes and financial reporting.
Authorities’ Views
24.
The authorities agreed that some of these plans were risky and noted that Cabinet approval
was required for any substantial change in the activities of public financial institutions.

D. Improving Social Outcomes
25.
Extreme (food) poverty is low in Kiribati (around 5 percent), but basic needs poverty is
relatively widespread. The share of population with income below the cost of acquiring enough
food for adequate nutrition and other essentials such as clothing and shelter is around 22 percent,
with over 24 percent in the main urban center of South Tarawa. About half of all households do not
have access to toilet facilities and access to safe drinking water is available to about 65 percent of
households.
26.
Kiribati also faces challenges in improving health
and education outcomes. Rising population density,
particularly in South Tarawa, increases risks of communicable
diseases. Non-communicable diseases (diabetes in particular)
also represent a significant challenge. On education, about
57 percent of the population reached the secondary level, but
only about 3 percent the tertiary level.6 At the same time,
education and health already represent the two largest items in
the budget. Kiribati is also among the top Pacific Island
countries in terms of health expenditures as a percent of GDP
and ranks twentieth in the world.7

The KPF is a ‘cash balance plan’, which resembles a defined contribution scheme, but members’ balances are
credited with a notional rate of return only loosely linked to the actual return on fund’s investment. As a result of low
investment returns and higher crediting rates on members’ balances, the KPF has accumulated substantial unfunded
liabilities and investing in domestic high-return (but risky) assets has been an attempt to restore its sustainability.
Bringing the rate of return credited to KPF members’ balance in line with the actual rate of return on assets would
ensure sustainability of the system, and a switch to a more passive investment strategy with assets allocated abroad
would allow KPF to better meet its ongoing contractual obligations.

expenditures as a percent of GDP and as a share of the budget is partly a result of high fixed costs
due to the lack of scale, but also suggests that there is room for efficiency gains, particularly in
personnel management (Figure 3).
Authorities’ Views
28.
Education and health will continue to be the highest priorities going forward. While
acknowledging possible efficiency gains, the authorities emphasized challenges remaining in the
health and education sectors, in particular insufficient resources to maintain capital assets and
inadequate supplies in hospitals. Several infrastructure projects are being implemented to improve
water access and sanitation.

STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Economic performance has been strong, buoyed by large donor-financed
infrastructure projects. Staff projects real GDP growth will remain above 3 percent in 2015, while
inflation should stay low.
30.
The fiscal position has improved markedly, but further efforts are needed to ensure
sustainability. We commend the authorities for achieving substantial fiscal surpluses in recent
years, although the improvement was mainly driven by record-high fishing license fees which can be
volatile. Recent increases in recurrent expenditures are partly explained by a more transparent
support to SOEs. Nevertheless, the historical pace of increase in spending is unsustainable over the
long term.
31.
Nominal expenditure growth should be limited to 1½ per year over the next years. In
order to enhance fiscal discipline, budget contingencies should be built in for unexpected
expenditures consistent with this expenditure path. Public sector wages and SOEs’ subsidies should

growth path may be increased over time when the fiscal position has strengthened and become
more sustainable, depending on the fishing license fees outturn.
32.
The introduction of the VAT has overall been successful and revenues are in line with
expectations. Consideration should be given to phase out existing exemptions and replace them
with targeted support of low income households. If exemptions are to be maintained, the list should
be short and narrowly defined.
33.
Strengthening the RERF should remain a key policy goal. Important progress has been
made in reforming RERF financial management. Transfers and withdrawals should be more
transparent and symmetric around the proposed expenditure path: subject to maintaining a cash
buffer equivalent to around two months of budget expenditures, a substantial part of the current
above-average surpluses should be saved to allow for sustainable drawdowns when they fall below
the average. Accordingly, the major part of the 2014 surplus should be transferred to the RERF.
34.
Progress has been made in creating conditions for private sector growth. Going
forward, further lowering telecommunication and transportation costs, streamlining business
registration processes, and facilitating the private usage of land will be critical to improve the
investment climate and lift growth prospects.
35.
There has also been progress on implementing the reform of SOEs to improve their
efficiency and contain the drain on public finances. Going forward, the authorities are
encouraged to further reduce the copra subsidy and speed up the restructuring of the energy sector
through further increasing the efficiency of the two energy companies and rationalizing the
structure of both fuel and electricity prices.
36.
Given fiscal constraints, Kiribati will need continued support from donors and IFIs.
Future donor-supported projects should focus on climate change mitigation measures, and
improving the provision of basic services such as water, electricity, housing, education, and health.
37.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard 12month cycle.

RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTRE (PFTAC)1
(As of 31 May, 2015)
During the current funding cycle (May 2011 to May 2015), PFTAC assistance to Kiribati has included
35 advisory missions. Kiribati also sent 40 officials to regional seminars and workshops.

Tax Administration and Policy
Kiribati implemented VAT on April 1st 2014 with support from PFTAC and the Australian Department
of Foreign Affairs (DFAT). Appropriate steps were taken in the lead up to implementation with a
strong focus on community outreach and education. Although these reforms have been a step in
the right direction the authorities acknowledge that compliance could be further facilitated through
an improved organizational structure, alignment of functions and building internal staff capability.
To support this need PFTAC assisted the Kiribati Taxation Division (KTD) in a review of current
organizational arrangements that were presented to and approved by the Internal Revenue Board.
PFTAC is currently assisting in implementing the new structure and designing new job descriptions
for each function. These changes will provide the KTD with a strong foundation to strengthen overall
compliance management. The next phase of technical assistance will be geared towards developing
a compliance improvement strategy which will be piloted on a few high risk VAT segments.
The implementation of a new IT system (RMS7) funded by Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs
and Trade (DFAT) has played an instrumental role in modernizing operations. The first phase was
implemented in December 2013 and included a VAT component aligned to VAT implementation on
1 April 2014. Training on the system was provided with a good level of involvement by staff. Staff
attended further training in New Zealand in October 2014 for User Acceptance testing of phase 2 of
the project. E-filing will be introduced as part of phase 3 to be implemented during 2015.
DFAT continues to support Kiribati with funding for a resident tax adviser who has played an
important role in implementing VAT through on the ground support and training of staff.

Public Financial Management (PFM)
An August 2011 mission to Kiribati assisted the Ministry of Finance in prioritizing its PFM reform
activities (RBM 1.2), and provided a framework for the current joint AusAid/AsDB long-term TA. Prior
to the inception of that TA, two PFTAC/IMF missions worked with the Ministry of Finance officials to
modify their chart-of-accounts (RBM 1.4) to capture more information on donor-funded projects, to

improve the integration of planning and budgeting (RBM 1.5), and to provide options for better
cash and debt management (RBMs 1.3 & 1.6) . In addition, PFTAC’s PFM Advisors participated in the
August 2012 AsDB/AusAid Technical Assistance inception mission, and a concurrent donor forum.
During 2013 several missions were conducted with multiple focuses including training budget
analysts (RBM 1.5) in the National Economic Planning Office (NEPO), supporting the Team Leader of
the joint Australia/ADB Treasury Reform TA (RBM 1.4), and assisting the authorities to develop an
improved debt/cash management policy (RBMs 1.3 & 1.6) with support from IMF’s APD and MCM
Divisions. PFTAC PFM Advisors have also participated in interview/CV review teams for both
Australian and EU-funded TA.
A PEFA review is tentatively scheduled for late 2015/early 2016.
PFTAC is ready to provide additional technical support on budget preparation, cash/debt
management, and other aspects of budget execution. Officials from Kiribati have regularly
participated in PFTAC’s regional PFM events, including the November 2011 MTB workshop, the July
2012 PEFA Workshop, the Strategic Development Program Workshops (with Australia DOFD &
DFAT), and the PIFMA Heads meetings.

Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
The Resident Technical Advisor is engaged with the Registrar of Credit Unions with the
implementation of the Credit Union Act, which became in force on January 1 2015. A mission was
held in January 2015 aimed at introducing a credit union financial reporting system. A number of
workshops were held on this topic and the Registrar’s staff received training on how to properly
complete the reports. While the credit unions are being registered with the Ministry, the Registrar is
implementing the reporting program. An additional mission is planned in late 2015 to review the
progress of the implementation of the Act and the reporting system. It is anticipated that more
workshops will be held on the subject of financial reporting and analysis.
It was further recommended that Kiribati consider establishing a Banking Commission who could
undertake the oversight of the financial sector. Discussions will be held with the Ministry of Finance
on this approach to sector surveillance.

Economic and Financial Statistics
GDDS metadata was first published on the IMF website in April 2004 and subsequently updated in
March 2013, following assistance by PFTAC. The balance of payments (BOP) compiler benefited from
training provided in regional courses in 2005 and 2010. PFTAC provided TA on balance of payments
in 2008, 2010 and 2012, improving compilation methods and use of source data, as well as
providing training, and helping with the transition to BPM6. Starting from 2012, TA on BOP and
government finance statistics (GFS) has been provided by related IMF JSA projects.
PFTAC has provided regular TA on national accounts since 2008, assisting the authorities in making
significant improvements in methodology and use of source data. Beginning in 2012, PFTAC has

4

KIRIBATI

increased its TA with the development of an expenditure measure of GDP and with the preparation
of statistical procedures for the incorporation of VAT data. However, progress has been slow due to
resource and capacity constraints. The NA compilers benefited from regional courses in 2009, 2012,
2013, and 2014. PFTAC also sponsored a one-month attachment for the BOP compiler with Statistics
New Zealand in May 2009.

Macroeconomic Analysis
Two missions in 2011 provided assistance in building capacity related to basic forecasting
techniques, using the medium-term fiscal framework developed as part of ADB assistance, and
assessing sustainable levels of drawdowns from Kiribati’s Reserve Equalization Reserve Fund.
A regional financial programming workshop held jointly in 2012 by PFTAC and the Singapore
Regional Training Institute provided training in financial programming techniques to two
economists of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. In 2015 an economist from the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Development participated in a PFTAC workshop on incorporating
disaster risk into fiscal planning.

BANK-FUND COLLABORATION
A. World Bank-IMF Collaboration
(As of May 31, 2015)
The Fund and the Bank teams maintain close cooperation in various areas and consult frequently.
During the current cycle, the Bank staff has joined the IMF missions, including IMF staff visits and the
2015 Article IV mission. The IMF staff and the World Bank staff maintained continuing close dialogue
on economic developments and all aspects of the government reform program.
During the current cycle, the teams have produced a Joint DSA. The IMF team provided analysis and
advice on the overall macroeconomic and fiscal framework, including fiscal and RERF sustainability.
The IMF and World Bank have also been engaged in provision of technical assistance and advice in
public financial management and debt management and policy. The Fund also provided technical
assistance on tax administration and policy, budget management, Revenue Equalization Reserve
Fund (RERF), and on statistical issues, including Government Finance Statistics and Balance of
Payments. The Bank has been engaged in various infrastructure projects, including road
rehabilitation, airport improvement, solar energy, and adaptation to climate change. Bank staff
provided technical assistance on government expenditures, reforms of copra subsidy and import
levy fund, liberalization of telecommunication sector, management of RERF assets, and social
protection issues. During this cycle the Bank has continued to work closely with the government on
the comprehensive program of priority economic reforms and building resilience against external
shocks, and supported coordination of donor TA around the reform agenda. Reforms identified
through this process are now being supported under joint donor budget support, coordinated by
the World Bank, with the third operation currently prepared in close consultation with the
Government and donors.
The IMF and World Bank teams will continue close cooperation going forward, in particular in the
context of the government reform program. As agreed earlier, the Fund will continue to lead on
macro issues, in particular overall macroeconomic framework, including in the medium-and-longer
term, and the Bank on macro-critical structural reform issues.1 The Fund and the Bank staff will also
continue to cooperate with regard to follow up TA, including on the RERF management and public
financial and debt management.

B. Relations with the World Bank Group2
Kiribati became a member of the World Bank Group (WBG) in 1986. Since then, the WBG has
provided strong support to Kiribati, including 15 IDA/ IBRD, Global Environment Fund, and
Institutional Development Fund projects in different sectors totaling US $170 million.

KIRIBATI

On March 1, 2011, the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors discussed the first Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Kiribati. Until then, the country had been covered by a Pacific Islands
Regional Engagement Framework. The CAS is structured around two themes: (i) addressing the
existential threat posed by climate change; and, (ii) mitigating the effects of geographic isolation.
The CAS heralded an expanded WBG support for Kiribati. Both IDA and IFC are significantly
increasing engagement. Consistent with Kiribati’s limited repayment capacity highlighted in the DSA,
IDA-financing are being provided on 100 percent grant terms. IFC is playing an important role in
strengthening investment climate in countries across the Pacific, and is similarly scaling up technical
assistance to Kiribati to strengthen the business environment and to support specific PPP
transactions or asset sales as the government moves to rationalize SOEs.
Key components of WBG engagement include:
 Building resilience against external shocks. Since 2003, the World Bank has been supporting
climate change mitigation through the Kiribati Adaptation Program, with activities such as
seawall construction, mangrove planting, and water conservation. Beyond climate change
adaptation, the World Bank has been committed to addressing wider issues of vulnerability in
Kiribati, including supporting renewable energy generation to reduce reliance on volatile
imported diesel, and assisting transport of essential food items to ensure the availability and
affordability of food on the outer islands.
 Mitigating the effects of geographic isolation. To mitigate Kiribati’s geographical disadvantage,
the World Bank has scaled up support for basic infrastructure that connects the people of
Kiribati to the outside world. Infrastructure investments integrating climate change adaptation
planning has started in parallel with efforts to develop coordinated and more comprehensive
multi-donor adaptation interventions. A South Tarawa road improvement investment (US$24
million in IDA and Trust Fund financing) is being undertaken jointly with the Asian Development
Bank. The World Bank has also mobilized significant grant resources with New Zealand and
other development partners to help bring Kiribati airports up to international safety standards.
 Supporting economic reform and regional integration. Through a programmatic budget support
operation, the World Bank has supported the Government’s implementation of the Economic
Reform Plan—a medium-term strategy to restore the country’s fiscal sustainability adopted in
2011. The first and second operations, with disbursements of US$5.2 million and US$3 million,
respectively, have been completed in 2014–15. The third operation is currently being prepared in
close consultation with the Government and other donors. As well as domestic reform, the
World Bank continues to support efforts by Kiribati and other Pacific Island countries to gain
benefits from greater regional integration, including participation in temporary labor migration
schemes in Australia and New Zealand, and improving the governance of marine and fishery
resources.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK4
The Asian Development Bank has approved eight project loans to Kiribati amounting to
US$34.7 million, all from Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources since Kiribati joined the AsDB in
1974. In addition, TA amounting to US$18.4 million has been provided for 40 projects. The latest
AsDB loan to Kiribati, for South Tarawa Sanitation Improvement Sector project, was approved in
October 2011. The AsDB most recently approved an US$0.8 million TA grant for enhancing
economic competitiveness through SOE reform in October 2013.
In line with the broad objective of the Kiribati Development Plan, 2012–15, which focused on
enhancing economic growth for sustainable development, ADB’s program aims to reduce poverty
and promote economic opportunity by improving public financial management and delivering
sustainable infrastructure services. As many of the infrastructure services are provided by stateowned enterprises, improving corporate governance arrangements and the commercial focus of
these enterprises is a key objective of ADB’s support to the government’s structural reform program.
Technical assistance provided through the Economic Management and Public Sector Reform
program helped strengthen state owned enterprise governance. ADB’s support has also helped
Kiribati move toward a number of Millennium Development Goals. In October 2011, ADB approved
a loan for the South Tarawa Sanitation Improvement Sector Project, which aims to improve
sanitation and hygiene practices in South Tarawa and increase access to sanitation from 64 percent
to 80 percent by 2019. The Road Rehabilitation Project, approved in December 2010, will rehabilitate
32.5 kilometers of main roads and about 8 kilometers of feeder roads. Cofinanced by the
Government of Australia, the World Bank and the Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility, the project
will improve socioeconomic conditions for the people of South Tarawa. ADB also provided its first
policy grant of $3m to Kiribati in 2014.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
(As of June 5, 2015)
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Balance of
Payments data are the most affected area.
National Accounts: With PTFAC assistance GDP estimates have improved. Three TA missions took place in
2014 to improve national account data and produce revised estimates. However, further capacity building
would be needed to continue to improve the quality of GDP estimates. So far, estimates are limited to Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) at current and constant 06 prices, using the production approach. Work is ongoing
on the expenditure-based GDP estimates.
Price statistics: The monthly retail price index (1996=100) is produced with a short lag (about a month),
based on a survey in South Tarawa (a national index is not available). There are no producer, wholesale, or
trade price indices.
Government finance statistics: A Government Finance Statistics mission took place in June 2014 to
integrate GFS requirements into the ongoing Chart of Accounts and approaches to extend coverage to
include donor-financed projects. The mission also explored possibilities to reclassify existing GFS data for
consolidated central government to create a historical time series. While a complete review of government
units, statutory extra budgetary units, and state-owned enterprises (SOE) was completed, a gap still remains
regarding donor-financed project funds.
Monetary statistics: The balance sheets of all the financial institutions (Bank of Kiribati, Development Bank
of Kiribati, Kiribati Provident Fund, and Kiribati Insurance Corporation) are available with lags, but the
consolidated balance sheet of the financial sector is not available. Data on interest rates are reported with a
long lag.
Balance of payments: Kiribati is part of the Pacific Region module of the JSA project on Improvement of
External Sector Statistics (ESS) in the Asia and Pacific region. Three ESS missions were undertaken during
2014. Data are compiled quarterly in the BPM6 format. However, the quality of the data is improving
marginally due to capacity constraints, and quality of source data. The shortcomings pertain to adjustments
to trade data, recording of investments income, direct investment and foreign aid data.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1

Approved By
Hoe Ee Khor and Peter
Allum (IMF) and Satu
Kahkonen and Mark
Thomas, (IDA)

Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank

The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that Kiribati remains at high risk of debt distress.
Despite the improvement in the fiscal position in recent years from the high fishing license fees,
containing the risk of debt distress requires continuation of grants to support the country’s large
development needs, and implementation of fiscal and further structural reforms to promote fiscal
sustainability and growth.

BACKGROUND
Kiribati is one of the most remote and geographically dispersed small states in the world. It is
comprised of 33 islands spread over 3.5 million square kilometers of ocean, with a population of
about 100,000. Kiribati has a limited export base and is largely dependent on fishing license fees and
donor support. The export and production bases are narrow and limited to fishing, copra, and
tourism. The revenue base is driven by volatile fishing license fees. Kiribati’s sovereign wealth fund,
the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF), is a stabilization and saving fund that was
established in 1956 from phosphate mining proceeds before phosphate deposits were exhausted
in 1979. The RERF has been used to ensure intergenerational equity and smooth expenditures from
the highly volatile non-tax revenues.
Climate change raises additional significant challenges. The costs of mitigating the effects of
climate change, including drought, loss of potable ground water, and rising sea levels, while

uncertain, are estimated to be equivalent to around 3½ percent of GDP per year (see Box 2 in 2015
Article IV consultation staff report). Some of these costs will be covered in the recurrent budget from
Kiribati’s own resources (without the need for additional borrowing). But capital projects for climatechange adaptation would require additional support from donors. Given these constraints, the
country would continue to rely heavily on external support.

THE BASELINE SCENARIO
The baseline scenario assumes continued implementation of government reform plans and
projections for fishing license fees based on historical averages. The government has made welcome
progress in debt management, with adoption of a formal approval process for government’s
external borrowing and issuance of loan guarantees, the clearance of costly overdraft debt and the
elimination of non-concessional borrowing.
The following are the key macroeconomic assumptions under the baseline scenario:


GDP growth and inflation are in line with historical averages. The economy is expected to
grow at about 3.1 percent in 2015 and moderate to an average of 1.8 percent a year in the
medium term through 2020, reflecting declining donor-financing as infrastructure projects are
completed. In the longer term, growth is assumed to average 1.7 percent, with per capita GDP
growth higher than the historical average, but still very low reflecting current impediments to
growth and the potential impact of climate change. Inflation is projected to return to an average
of about 2 percent per year in the longer term after a spell of lower increases driven by food
price and exchange rate dynamics.



Fishing license fees decline slightly in the long run. In the past three years, record fishing
license fees have boosted government revenues and the current account balance, peaking at
68 percent of GDP in 2014. Fishing license fees are projected to decline from their peak to the
level consistent with the average fish price and catch volumes, but still higher that the historical
average, reflecting a stricter implementation of the regional fishing agreement (‘Nauru
agreement’). They are expected to remain at this level in real terms.



Fiscal balance. The overall fiscal balance improved in recent years, moving to a surplus in 2013–
14, reflecting higher fishing license fees. The balance is projected to return to a small deficit of
about one percent in 2015, and widen in the medium and longer term:



Recurrent deficit: financed by sustainable drawdowns from the RERF. Recurrent expenditure
growth is assumed at 1½ percent per year until 2020, increasing to an average growth of around
3½ percent per year in the long-term. Thus, they initially fall as a percent of GDP before
stabilizing in the long-term. The initial fall allows for an accumulation of RERF balances, which
later translates to higher returns and drawdowns, while maintaining the real per capita value of
the fund. The drawdowns allows for stabilizing the level of recurrent expenditures (as a share of
GDP) despite a gradual fall in the revenue share (fishing license fees remain constant in real
terms, but decline as percent of GDP; tax revenues are projected to initially increase on the back
of gains from the tax reform, but then stabilize as a share of GDP; budget support grants are
expected to stop in 2017). Climate-change-related recurrent spending and new infrastructure

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KIRIBATI

maintenance costs—together equivalent to around 4 percent of GDP—are included in the
expenditure envelope.


Development expenditures: financed partly by loans. High development expenditures,
estimated at about 47 percent of GDP in 2015, are expected to decline to around 23 percent of
GDP in 2020 in line with donors’ commitments, reflecting a completion of infrastructure projects
currently underway. They are projected to return to a historical average of about 30 percent of
GDP in the long-term, reflecting the cost of climate-change adaptation projects. Development
expenditures are assumed to be financed by a combination of loans and grants, with an
increasing share of loans after 2020 compared to the medium term.



Current account. After surpluses in 2013-14 driven by record fishing license fees, the current
account is expected to return to a deficit in 2015 as fishing license fees moderate. In the medium
and longer term the current account deficit is expected to widen, reflecting imports related to
capital projects and financed by capital grants and loans as discussed above.

RESULTS
The results indicate that Kiribati is at high risk of debt distress.


The risk is the most evident for the sustainability of external debt. The present value (PV) of
external debt increases significantly due to loan disbursements. The PV of the debt-to-GDP ratio
threshold (30 percent) is projected to increase from about 10 percent of GDP in 2015 and breach
the threshold around 2028 for the remaining of the projection period. The long run increase in
the external nominal debt is largely driven by continued high imports as a percent of GDP, which
reflect the large dependence on imports—including imports needed to mitigate climatechange-related risks—as well as a low growth potential due to Kiribati’s physical constraints and
remoteness. In the baseline scenario, the PV of the debt-to-exports ratio also breaches the
threshold around 2035.



Stress tests indicate that the external debt path is vulnerable to shocks to financing terms
and to exports. The PV of debt-to-export ratio and the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio thresholds are
breached under the extreme stress test scenario.



Public debt is also close to breach indicative risk thresholds. Under the baseline scenario, the
PV of total public debt is projected to increase from about 14 percent of GDP in 2015 and
breaches the threshold by 2032, driven mainly by external borrowings. Large residuals for 201314 reflect the increase in assets related to high surpluses from windfall fishing revenues (cash
and the purchase of land in Fiji).



Public debt sustainability is vulnerable to shocks. Under the most extreme stress test
scenario the PV of debt-to-GDP breaches the threshold by 2022 and exceeds 65 percent
by 2033. The scenario where the primary balance is fixed at the 2015 level is not representative,
as the positive fiscal balances in 2014–15 were mainly driven by record fishing license fees. The
baseline projects an overall fiscal deficit from 2016 to 2035.

KIRIBATI

CONCLUSION
The debt sustainability analysis indicates that Kiribati’s scope for external borrowing, even on
concessional terms, remains limited. The risk of high debt distress remains despite the availability
of RERF resources, which should be treated like an endowment fund to ensure sustainable financing
for recurrent expenditures in light of limited growth prospects (and also provide a cushion in case of
lower revenues from fishing license fees or higher climate-change-related costs). To limit the risk of
debt distress, the authorities should save the record recent windfalls from fishing license fees,
maintain conservative fiscal stance, and further implement structural reforms to make SOEs more
competitive and limit the cost of SOE subsidies. Development expenditures need to be financed
largely from external grants, and even concessional loan financing should be limited. Baseline
projections in the staff report assume that these principles are followed and the development
budget largely relies on grants, with the exception of already committed loans.
The authorities broadly agree with this assessment. They expressed their commitment to
continue avoiding non-concessional external borrowing, pursuing the SOE reform agenda and
following a prudent fiscal path.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange
rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Memorandum item:
Grant element assumed on residual financing (i.e., financing required above baseline) 6/
Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.
