Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation
with the Republic of Belarus
Approved by Poul M. Thomsen and Martin J. Fetherston

Executive Summary
Discussions were held in Minsk during May 23–June 4, 2007. Staff met with Deputy Prime Minister
Kobyakov, Minister of Economy Zaichenko, Minister of Finance Korbut, National Bank of the Republic of
Belarus (NBRB) Chairman Prokopovich, representatives of the presidential administration, other senior
officials, members of parliament, representatives of the business and academic communities, and the press.
Staff team: Mr. Horváth (head), Mr. Mates (Senior Moscow Resident Representative), Ms. Hassine,
Ms. Koliadina, Mr. Ross (all EUR), assisted by Resident Representative office staff. Mr. Kiekens (Executive
Director for Belarus) joined some meetings.
Background: The economy has expanded rapidly since 2004. However, rising energy import prices from 2007
represent a large permanent income loss, straining Belarus’s centralized economy.
Discussions focused on the appropriate policy response:
•

Staff assessed the real exchange rate as overvalued by some 10 percent. The authorities disagreed and
saw no problem with competitiveness. Staff noted that maintaining the exchange rate peg under the
authorities’ planned policies could entail unsustainably high current account deficits over the medium
term.

•

The NBRB was confident it can maintain the peg and restrain inflation despite rapid credit growth.
The authorities viewed adjustment as feasible within the existing policy framework. They have
tightened fiscal policy so far this year (while envisaging a full-year deficit), moderated wage growth,
partially increased energy prices, strengthened price controls, and secured large-scale foreign
financing. They expected public investment and concessional lending to encourage energy savings, as
well as export-oriented and import-substituting activities.

•

Staff argued that while reliance on foreign financing was possible for some time, adjustment was
unavoidable since the terms-of-trade change was permanent. Thus, early adjustment through a tighter
policy mix commensurate with the economy’s real income loss was needed, including a full energy
price pass-through, no fiscal stimulus given the accommodating policy mix and the exchange rate peg,
and a phase-out of directed lending to contain credit growth. Structural reforms were necessary to
reduce unit labor costs.

•

Financial sector discussions focused on risks stemming from marked credit growth, government
operations through the banking system, and banks’ foreign liabilities.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Benefiting from a favorable energy arrangement with Russia, Belarus’s
centralized economy grew rapidly over the past few years. The state redistributed termsof-trade gains associated with energy trade across the economy, boosting domestic demand,
while a de facto peg anchored inflation expectations. As a result, output expanded rapidly. Of
CIS states, Belarus received the largest energy subsidy from Russia since 2002.
2.
A new multi-year energy agreement, however, has abruptly reversed these
terms-of-trade gains. Belarus now

particularly if additional declines in energy intensity occur.1 Nevertheless, cumulative losses
through 2012 may reach 10–15 percent of GDP.
A. Economic Developments
3.
Economic growth remained strong
through the first half of 2007. Growth accelerated
to 9.9 percent in 2006 as rapid real wage gains
supported consumption, while state-directed credit
boosted investment—up 26 percent in 2006 and
30 percent (y-o-y) in the first quarter of 2007. Fuel
exports, a main driver of industrial production,
have slowed significantly in the first half of 2007,
as production dropped at both refineries owing
primarily to import interruptions in January–
February (Figure 1). As a result, annual real growth
moderated to 8.6 percent in January–June.

Natural gas import prices will reach Europe’s level by 2011; Belarus’s share of Russia’s oil export tax will rise

The current account swung into deficit
in 2006, with a further marked deterioration
in the first quarter of 2007. Net export
volumes fell by 27 percent in 2006 and by
11 percent in the first quarter against the
background of declining export market
penetration to Russia and rising unit labor costs
(Figure 3). Propelled by strong import growth in
non-oil products and muted non-oil export
growth, the current account went from a surplus
of 1.6 percent of GDP in 2005 to a deficit of
4.1 percent in 2006 (Figure 4). This shortfall
from a targeted surplus occurred despite
favorable terms-of-trade developments last year.

Headline inflation declined further in
2006, but use of administrative controls has
increased. Price controls, decelerating money
growth and the exchange rate anchor helped to
slow consumer price inflation to 6.6 percent by
end-2006. With producer prices and import costs
still rising rapidly—and the direct and indirect
effects of higher energy prices now being felt—
underlying cost pressures have increased. While
producer prices jumped by 13.5 percent through
May, annual CPI inflation rose to 7 percent—
limited by additional price caps (Figure 2).

Available indicators point to the economy being close to
full capacity utilization.

However, capacity constraints appear
to be emerging. Supply has responded strongly
during the expansion, supported by high
investment. Rising output also boosted measured
productivity.2 However, simple output gap
analysis and capacity utilization indicators as
well as labor market data signal incipient
capacity constraints. The PPI-based real
exchange rate appreciation—up 55 percent since
2000—and strong import demand also indicate
tightening resource constraints.

Despite strong domestic investment, the recorded capital stock has remained low, suggesting high

The 2007 first quarter deficit reached 1½ percent of annual GDP compared to a small surplus
in Q1 2006 and a 2.3 percent of GDP surplus in Q1 2005. Boosted also by privatization
receipts, external borrowing allowed a rebuilding of NBRB foreign exchange reserves to
around one month of imports by July.
7.
External borrowing increased, and
more was being secured for 2007. External
debt was low at around 19 percent of GDP at
end-2006, but is rising rapidly. Loans and asset
sales receipts expected in 2007–08 exceed the
estimated net impact of the terms-of-trade
decline. Besides having applied for a sovereign
rating, the government is also contemplating
T-bill issues in Russia.

foreign assets, and relative productivity. Several of these variables are likely to
decline over the medium term in the absence of policy adjustment, which could
increase the overvaluation, although the economy’s response to the terms-of-trade
deterioration is uncertain at this stage.

B. Policy Developments
9.

The fiscal stance turned contractionary in 2006 and in the first half of 2007.

•

The general government moved from a deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2005 to a
surplus of 0.5 percent in 2006 (Figure 5). Indeed, higher cyclical revenues and
energy-related gains—a more than doubling of excise rates on oil products, and oneoff receipts4—also allowed the authorities to cut the sales tax rate from 3.9 to
3.0 percent and abolish the Chernobyl tax and the employment insurance
contribution. Moreover, the taxation of financial and nonfinancial enterprises was
harmonized. Expenditures were cut by 1 percent of GDP (¾ percent in goods and
services).

•

During the first five months of 2007, fiscal policy was tighter than budgeted, as
expenditure restraint and a new tax-subsidy system raised the surplus to 1.9 percent of
annual GDP,5 against an annual 2007 budget deficit target of 1.5 percent of GDP.

10.
However, government intervention in the economy continued to provide an
underlying expansionary impulse. This included directed concessional lending—of about
5½ percent of GDP in 2006, up from 4¼ percent in 2005—through state owned banks to

Government-mandated wage increases in
excess of productivity at SOEs constituted a
third channel, prominent through end-2006.
Wage growth has now been scaled back,6
although real wages and unit labor costs
continue to increase. Moreover, real income
growth in the first five months of 2007,
compared to the same period last year,
reached 17.2 percent. Real incomes grew by
17.3 percent in 2006.

Directed lending remained high on the back of rising

The exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar drove monetary policy, with monetary
conditions accommodative. In 2006, monetary conditions were relaxed as the refinance rate
was reduced by 100 basis points and reserve requirements lowered as credit growth was
picking up (Figure 6). Pressure on the peg—owing to concerns over new energy prices and
the immediate availability of foreign financing—forced the NBRB to raise its policy rates
and restrained money growth in early 2007.7 However, monetary conditions eased from April
and the NBRB lowered the refinance rate by 25 basis points in July.

Real wages rose by 10.1 percent in January–June 2007 compared with the same period a year ago, versus
20.1 percent on the basis of the same definition in the first half of 2006. Over the same periods, annualized unit
labor costs rose by 1.6 and 10.5 percent, respectively.

dollar deposits has not reversed—and
growth in longer-term rubel deposits has been non-existent. Thus banks are now financing
the upsurge in credit growth increasingly through rising foreign borrowing and government
deposits.
13.
Financial soundness indicators appear adequate, but significant weaknesses
remain. Banking system net domestic assets—at 20 percent of GDP—remain relatively low
and largely short term, with over 80 percent controlled by four large state banks. Recurrent
recapitalizations of these systemic banks fall short of the long-run costs of directed lending,
imperiling their solvency; moreover, their liquidity depends in part on government deposits.
While increased bank lending and a change in tax laws have increased banking assets and
profitability, state owned banks’ profitability remains relatively low. NPLs are also low, but
there are liquidity concerns at state-owned banks (Figure 8).

The pass-through of higher energy import costs to domestic energy tariffs was
partial. Natural gas prices have risen by up to 89 percent for enterprises, but only 20 percent
for households. Electricity and heating tariffs went up by 40 percent for all users. The new
tariffs represent an average pass-through of approximately 60 percent of the terms-of-trade
shock. This places additional burden on enterprises, possibly requiring higher future
subsidies.
15.
Progress in structural reform
has been limited. Belarus lags behind its
peers in most structural reform indicators
and has attracted a low level of foreign
direct investment. Fixed investment,
while ample, has been mainly directed to
housing construction, agriculture, and
state industrial concerns. Low
profitability of SOEs and commercial
banks as well as high ICOR figures imply
relatively low investment productivity.

II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS

16.
The discussions focused on the outlook and the appropriate policy response to
the terms-of-trade shock. Staff and the authorities agreed that the shift toward world market
energy prices was permanent. Views, however, did not converge on the sustainability of
current policies, and hence on the need for fundamental adjustment, or the components of the
appropriate policy response.
•

The authorities expected a much stronger supply response within existing policy
and institutional frameworks than staff. They considered gradual adjustment with
heavy reliance on external financing as appropriate, expecting government-led
investment to raise productivity and energy efficiency, thus avoiding capacity
constraints going forward. Staff was more skeptical, viewing public investment as
less efficient and spare capacity less abundant. Staff also pointed to low enterprise
profitability, and viewed the past surge in productivity as largely cyclical in nature. It
argued that since sharply higher energy prices made part of the existing capital stock
obsolete, absent structural reforms, the supply response would remain limited.

•

The authorities wished to retain the exchange rate as the key nominal anchor.
They considered this feasible given their expectation of a strong supply response and
assessment that competitiveness was adequate. In staff’s view, the authorities’
planned policies were not sufficient to maintain an exchange rate anchor, potentially
resulting in unsustainable current account deficits over the medium term. Staff was

10
skeptical about the authorities’ ability to generate an adequate supply response to
maintain the peg. The mission argued, therefore, that the authorities would have to
rely more than currently envisaged on demand-management policies, which would
require tighter monetary, fiscal, and incomes policies.

and the ability to attract sustained capital flows,

policies as described in their socio-economic plan was equally uncertain.

Staff noted that the negative impact of the terms-of-trade deterioration created
macroeconomic tensions under planned policies, and advocated reforms. If—as officially
planned8—directed lending continues and the budget runs deficits while real wages rise
further, pressures on the current account and on reserves will escalate, eventually forcing the
authorities off the peg (see Figure 9 and text table for an illustrative scenario denoted
“Officially planned policies” along these lines). Instead, to support the peg under a reform
scenario, the authorities should allow a full energy price pass-through, compress real wage
growth, restrain second-round inflation effects through tighter fiscal and credit policies, and
implement structural reforms to reduce government intervention and liberalize markets. In
such a reform scenario, inflation would temporarily rise and growth would decelerate, but the
underlying external instability problem would be addressed with a much lower debt buildup.
Most importantly, these measures would set the stage for sustainable growth over the
medium term. Staff baseline projections strike a middle ground that staff considers feasible.
They broadly reflect the authorities’ objectives and plans, with fiscal policy adjusted—

1/ Staff scenario that reflects implementation of policies under the authorities' 2006–10 Socio-Economic Plan .
The plan assumes continued high rates of credit growth, directed lending, real wage increases,
and import substitution. Under this scenario, staff assumes the rubel will be forced off the peg, and
devalued by 25 percent in 2009.
2/ Staff scenario which reflects the outcome of broadly implementing the authorities' plans, but with
fiscal policy adjusted in line with the actual fiscal stance in the first half of 2007. With a further assumption of
zero growth in real wages, the overall policy mix is compatible with a financeable current account path.

•

In the short term, higher energy prices, marked credit growth, and seasonal
government spending should raise inflation to double digits. Owing to substantial
carryover effects and continued high investment spending, growth will remain strong,
reaching 7¾ percent in 2007. At the same time, with the nominal peg intact and
further energy import price increases, the real exchange rate will likely appreciate,
keeping the current account deficit around 8 percent in 2007–08.

•

Over the medium term, second-round energy price effects, continued loose credit
policies and binding capacity constraints would keep inflation around 8–9 percent.

12
With a continued neutral fiscal stance, wage moderation, and higher inflation, the
decline in real incomes should scale back consumption. While state-directed
investment spending would support activity, growth should fall over the medium term
to around 4½ percent. Given the lack of structural reforms, progress toward
improving competitiveness would remain limited. With further terms-of-trade losses
and rising debt service costs offset in part by weakening domestic demand, the
current account deficit would hover around 8 percent. The doubling of the external
debt-to-GDP ratio to almost 50 percent and extensive short-term borrowing highlights
growing risks.
19.
The authorities saw staff’s baseline forecast as overly pessimistic and were
confident their economic targets could be met. Despite the changed external environment,
they considered their targets for 2007 and beyond—growth of 8½ percent, inflation under
8 percent, and current account surpluses—achievable with the policies and institutions
underpinning their pro-growth model largely intact. Arguing that there was no
competitiveness problem, the authorities considered they could reach a current account
surplus through concessional lending to export-oriented and import-substituting activities. In
their view, the pause in dedollarization was temporary, the economy’s recent performance
proved the efficiency of public investments, and Belarus’s low debt levels left scope for
large-scale foreign financing for many years. Borrowed funds would be invested to reduce
energy intensity, mitigating the impact of rising energy prices and improving
competitiveness. Finally, offering SOEs in manufacturing, food processing, and
communications for sale would generate new innovation-enhancing FDI.
B. Fiscal Policy

20.
Staff argued for avoiding a fiscal stimulus. Additional terms-of-trade losses
expected in coming years and the need to offset the expansionary stance of other policies
requires fiscal tightness. The large surplus in January–June helped stabilize currency markets
and lower inflationary pressures. Allowing spending to rise during the remainder of the
year—in line with the government’s budget deficit target of 1.5 percent—would raise
liquidity by 3.2 percent of GDP in the second half of 2007. This could be destabilizing given
loose credit conditions. Avoiding a fiscal stimulus would require a surplus of ½ percent of
GDP, still allowing a deficit of about 1.4 percent of GDP during the second half of the year.
21.
With over 20 percent of revenues linked to the energy sector, the impact of the
terms-of-trade deterioration on budgetary performance is likely to be significant.
Revenues would decline by 2.8 percent of GDP, while a discretionary increase in assistance
to refineries, automatic stabilizers and a higher goods and services bill adds another
2.5 percentage points of GDP to expenditures, resulting in an overall budgetary deterioration
of 5.3 percentage points. This gap is partially offset (2.4 percentage points) by higher export
taxes on oil products as required under the agreement with Russia. Given an already high
fiscal burden, staff advocated covering the remaining 2.9 percentage points by cuts in

13
subsidies to enterprises and banks, together with improved targeting of social spending and
reduced investment and net lending.

22.
The authorities indicated that fiscal policy would be geared toward maintaining
macroeconomic stability. They agreed fiscal policy had an important stabilizing role to play
given the peg. Pointing to the lack of financing constraints, they saw no need to deviate from
the fiscal goals identified in their medium-term program, arguing that fiscal policy should
continue to support growth and meet social objectives, including through social transfers and
public investment. However, they stressed that they would adjust policies to ensure
macroeconomic stability, noting that the fiscal stance through May left room for tighter
budget implementation. In this regard, they have not ruled out a moderate surplus in 2007, if
required by economic circumstances.
23.
The authorities felt that it was premature to discuss the 2008 fiscal stance.
Macroeconomic stability will most likely require continued tight fiscal policies, depending
also on monetary conditions and incomes policy. However, significant uncertainty remains.
If growth slows down markedly, inflation pressures subside, and financing constraints are not
binding, some fiscal stimulus might become appropriate.
24.
The government plans to streamline tax and expenditure policy next year. They
plan to abolish the distortive sales tax, various local fees, and lower the local retail trade tax,
planning to partially offset the revenue loss by eliminating exemptions from the real estate
tax and raising the VAT rate, or through spending restraint. The introduction of meanstesting for transportation cost allowances, medicines, and sanatorium treatment will enhance
the targeting of social support. The authorities also envisage phasing in a medium-term fiscal
framework, building on good recent progress with enhanced program budgeting. Staff

14
welcomed these plans, but noted that the estimated 0.8 percent of GDP revenue impact of
tax policy changes should be primarily offset through lower spending.
25.
Ageing, and other longer-term considerations argue for continued fiscal savings.
The UN projects working-age population to decline by 8.4 percent by 2020. Such looming
demographic changes require saving the Social Protection Fund’s surpluses. Rising healthcare costs associated with ageing, the long-term costs of directed credits, and the need to
avoid using one-off privatization receipts on current spending also call for building up net
fiscal assets.
C. Exchange Rate and Monetary Policies
26.
The authorities did not agree that the real exchange rate was overvalued. The
NBRB noted that on a PPP basis, the real exchange rate appeared substantially undervalued.
Given trading patterns, they argued for a larger weight for the real exchange rate vis-à-vis the
Russian ruble, which would imply steady real effective exchange rate depreciation and
improving competitiveness.9 They did not see wages out of line with regional developments,
in fact, they argued that as a percent of GDP, they were comparatively low. Pointing to the
preponderance of the dollar in energy trade and capital flows, staff argued for a higher weight
for the Br/US$ real exchange rate.
27.
The NBRB expressed confidence that it can maintain the peg—and achieve its
inflation objective—even with continued rapid credit growth. Pointing to diverging price
indicators, the hiatus in dedollarization, and the widening current account deficit, staff argued
that the change in the external environment and a loose policy stance had softened rubel
money demand. Thus, more cautious credit policy was called for. The NBRB rejected staff’s
call for slowing credit growth to reign in domestic demand and inflation pressures. It
contended that rapid credit growth—including an undiminished directed component—was
critical for sustaining growth, and would not exacerbate inflation pressures given rising
demand for rubels. The NBRB considered foreign borrowing by state-owned banks desirable,
and argued that these inflows were commercial in nature, and should thus not be limited. The
NBRB agreed with staff that moving government deposits to the central bank by end-2007
would be helpful in tightening liquidity.
28.
Staff argued that the fixed exchange rate regime required policy tightening to be
viable. With limited progress in structural reforms, supply in the economy may not be able to
keep up with buoyant demand given the authorities’ current policy plans. This in turn raises
external financing needs and pressures on the peg. To keep these in check and bolster the
credibility of the exchange rate anchor, policy interest rates should not fall in the near term
and directed lending should be curbed, while wage and fiscal policies must be tightened.
9

Since 2000, the Br/RUR real exchange rate has depreciated by 33 percent while the Br/US$ real exchange rate
has appreciated by 131 percent.

15
Policy tightening is also made necessary by the likely weakening of the authorities’ control
over capital flows. Pervasive state ownership has allowed them to control capital flows up to
now, but privatization, particularly of banks, and the move toward more market-based
financial relations with Russia might erode their ability to guide these flows.
29.
The NBRB also needs to prepare the ground for an alternative monetary policy
regime. It should continue to develop its monetary policy instruments and modeling
capacities for inflation. Once liquidity management becomes more efficient and the depth of
money markets is enhanced, a credible policy mix with liberalized price and wage setting can
provide an alternative nominal anchor, possibly in the form of inflation targeting. This would
pave the way toward greater exchange rate flexibility.
D. Financial Sector Policies

30.
The NBRB recognized that rapid credit growth, government operations through
the banking system, and banks’ surging foreign liabilities had increased risks to the
financial sector. It noted that sharply increasing credit has coincided with an almost
doubling of the share of loss-making enterprises to 8.5 percent in 2006. Coupled with the
worsened external environment, the increase in bank’s net foreign liabilities, and growing
balance sheet mismatches, credit and interest rate risks have increased. Stress test results
indicated that losses could be substantial if these factors undermined borrowers’ repayment
ability, although capital adequacy ratios would remain above prudential norms. Moreover, in
a scenario that encompassed a full pass-through of higher energy prices, several banks would
fall below the minimum capital adequacy standard.
31.
Against this backdrop, the NBRB continues to improve the supervisory and
regulatory framework. In implementing the new Banking Code, it is tightening credit risk
standards, improving bank governance, unifying licensing requirements and strengthening
accounting and credit reporting standards. In progressing toward Basel II standards, it will
move to consolidated risk-based supervision, and introduce new legislation on deposit
insurance, payment operations, mortgages, and credit bureaus by 2008. Together with the
elimination of the golden share rule for banks, such progress has raised foreign interest in the
banking system, with two banks recently sold to Russian investors and the sale of further
banks being discussed with interested foreign parties.10
E. External and Structural Policies

32.
The authorities expressed concern about ongoing trade disputes. Despite recent
progress, unresolved issues remain with Russia, and the European Union has rescinded its
10

A golden share can be declared for any enterprise with current or past government ownership, entitling the
government to take decisions regarding that enterprise.

16
preferential tariffs for about a tenth of Belarusian exports in mid-2007. Staff noted that trade
liberalization, particularly through WTO accession, would best promote exports. In this
context, it welcomed the authorities’ commitment to making the domestic subsidy system
WTO-compliant.
33.
The government has adopted a case-by-case approach to structural reforms,
focusing on asset sales. They have eschewed the golden share rule for Beltransgaz when
they sold Gazprom a 50 percent stake and may drop its applicability in selected future cases.
However, they rejected staff’s view that this rule should be repealed for all enterprises. The
authorities are considering further sales of breweries, pharmaceutical and petrochemical
companies and banks, and have not ruled out liquidating some long-term lossmakers.
34.
Staff argued for wide-ranging structural reforms to raise productivity and
contain macroeconomic risks. In the near term, efficiency gains could stem from a
substantial roll-back of administrative controls to strengthen price signals; and a hardening in
enterprise budget constraints through cuts in enterprise subsidies. Moreover, given the
planned acceleration of external borrowing, a strong system to monitor all external debt
contracted or guaranteed by the public sector is important. Subsequently, a well-sequenced
strategy is needed to attain a functioning market economy, with the following key elements:
•

reducing the size of government by cutting taxes and streamlining expenditure while
protecting the most vulnerable through targeted social assistance;

•

creating a stable, predictable legal and business environment that ensures a level
playing field for all investors; and

•

implementing transparent privatization through open tenders to attract strategic
private investors.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL

35.
Belarus’s macroeconomic performance and social development have so far been
strong. Growth averaged in double digits during 2004–06 and inflation fell below 7 percent
last year. Moreover, Belarus’s social indicators—notably its equal income distribution, high
UN human development index and improving housing conditions—place it at the top of CIS
league tables.
36.
This performance, however, has been colored by strong terms-of-trade gains.
These gains were a key factor behind the rapid expansion in output. Given little change in
employment, productivity increased markedly as well—even though structural reforms
lagged, FDI was low, and the introduction of advanced technologies was limited. High
government-led investment also supported growth. The low profitability of SOEs and
commercial banks however, shows that the efficiency of this investment is questionable.

17
Viewed in this light, the economy’s supply response during the expansion and its overall
performance was less buoyant.
37.
Looking ahead, the increase in energy import prices presents a significant
challenge. Past energy subsidies from Russia have hidden a deterioration in the underlying
current account and a growing overvaluation of the real exchange rate. This suggests that
policies were too expansive—even absent the new energy agreement. With the increase in
energy prices in 2007 and further convergence toward European price levels in the medium
term, a key source of growth and balance of payments support will be markedly reduced.
Notably, the real exchange rate overvaluation might increase.
38.
The authorities have taken important steps in adjusting to the new external
environment. Fiscal policy played a critical role in saving some of the terms-of-trade gains
in 2006 and its further tightening in 2007 was key for maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Steps to lower wage growth, partially raise domestic energy prices, and eliminate the golden
share rule in banking are welcomed. The authorities’ proposed policy package also has
positive elements, notably the commitment to further moderate wage growth and commence
privatization transactions.
39.
However, the assumed supply response is overly optimistic and over-reliance on
foreign financing rather than adjustment entails growing risks. For the most part, the
policy mix remains accommodative, with the current account deficit set to double to
8 percent of GDP in 2007. Credit growth, in particular, has remained strong. Adjustment is
expected primarily through government-led investments aimed at export promotion, import
substitution and energy savings—measures that take time to materialize and whose efficiency
is unknown. The energy price pass-through is incomplete and real wages continue to rise.
Thus the burden of adjustment rests mostly on enterprises through a squeeze on their
profits—which raises the threat of decapitalization. Foreign financing appears to be available
for some time and is a viable short-run response. However, this strategy delays necessary
adjustment and structural reforms, and raises risks. Foreign financing is susceptible to sudden
stops and, given the non-market based nature of some of Belarus’s loans, subject to
geopolitical risk. This strategy will also result in a sizeable buildup in debt—which is, to a
worrisome extent, short term—and in the debt service ratio. Rapid credit growth will also
raise pressure on banks, which cannot be shielded from macroeconomic strains and
government intervention through stricter supervision and regulation.
40.
A balanced policy package is needed to address the changed external
environment. The change is permanent, calling for early adjustment through a tighter policy
mix—especially credit policies—to rein in domestic demand. Curtailing the still-rapid
growth in real incomes is key. Real wages might need to decline to lower unit labor costs,
especially if other elements of the policy mix remain expansionary. A higher energy price
pass-through is also needed to boost energy efficiency. Equally important, structural changes
are needed to strengthen the supply response and improve market flexibility through a

18
substantial roll-back of administrative controls. Financial system development would benefit
from reducing the relative importance of state-owned banks.
41.
Policies as being implemented entail serious risks, which would escalate further
if policies aimed for official targets. The authorities want to maintain the peg as their
nominal anchor. However, in the absence of structural reforms that could generate a strong
supply response, aiming for budget deficits and marked real wage growth would result in
widening current account deficits. These would raise pressures on reserves, and eventually
force Belarus off the peg. Realizing this, the authorities have implemented stricter fiscal and
wage policies than officially targeted in 2007 so far. Maintaining the peg while addressing
the rubel's underlying overvaluation would require sustained tight demand management
policies. These include adopting a neutral fiscal stance, compressing real wages, and phasing
out directed lending. Fiscal consolidation, in particular, is critical—to support the nominal
anchor, avoid excessive declines in national savings, and address looming demographic
pressures as well as other long-term risks. Even with these policies, however, external debt
would rise rapidly, GDP growth would slow markedly and the peg abandoned eventually.
These outcomes, the associated risks, and the inevitable lag with which supply can be
expected to increase point to the need for early implementation of fundamental structural
reforms. They also indicate that the maintenance of the peg requires that real wage growth be
kept well below productivity growth.
42.

It is recommended that the next consultation occur on the standard 12-month cycle.

Debt-stabilizing noninterest current
account 6/

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar
terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and
rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows
in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
GDP deflator in U.S. dollars (change in percent)
Nominal external interest rate (in percent)
Growth of exports (U.S. dollar terms, in percent)
Growth of imports (U.S. dollar terms, in percent)
Current account balance, excluding interest payments

VII.

Safeguards Assessments:

As there is no arrangement in place, under the Fund’s safeguards assessments policy, the
National Bank of Belarus (NBB) is not subject to a full safeguards assessment. However, as a
potential borrower, the NBB requested a voluntary safeguards assessment, and an on-site
assessment was conducted in December 2003. The assessment concluded that significant
vulnerabilities existed in the safeguards framework, especially in the areas of the legal
structure and independence, external and internal audit, and in financial reporting. The
assessment made specific recommendations to correct the identified shortcomings. The
authorities have begun to address some of these issues, and are considering appropriate
measures to address the remaining concerns.

VIII.

Exchange Arrangements:

As of August 20, 1994, the rubel (Br) became the unit of account replacing the Belarusian
ruble, which was formally recognized as the sole legal tender only on May 18, 1994. The
conversion took place at the rate of 10 Belarusian rubles = 1 rubel. The authorities decided to
drop three zeroes from the rubel denomination as of January 1, 2000. The exchange rate for
the U.S. dollar was Br 2,146 on August 10, 2007.
In mid-September 2000, the official exchange rate was unified with the market-determined
rate resulting from daily auctions at the Belarus Currency and Stock Exchange. Since then, the
official rate on any day is equal to the closing rate of the previous trading day. Since 2006, the
exchange rate was set in the framework of horizontal corridors for the Russian ruble and the
U.S. dollar around central parity. In 2007, the width of these corridors were ±4 percent vis-àvis the Russian ruble, and ±2.5 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. On November 5, 2001,
Belarus accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF’s Articles of
Agreement. During the same month, the NBB suspended all ad hoc exemptions from the 30
percent surrender requirement. Based on currently available information, Belarus does not
maintain exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices.
IX.

UFR/Article IV Consultation:

Belarus is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The 13th Article IV consultation was concluded
on May 29, 2006. Subsequently, a staff visit occurred during February 7–14, 2007.

ANNEX II. BELARUS: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
Partnership in Belarus’ development strategy
1.
According to the recent Country Assistance Strategy for Belarus the World Bank
Group aims to advance cooperation in critical areas, help the country open up its economy
and society, minimize social and environmental risks, and address global public good
concerns.
IMF-World Bank collaboration in specific areas
2.
The Bank and Fund teams work closely in Belarus and maintain an extremely good
relationship. The IMF plays a key role at the macro level, while the World Bank focuses on
the structural agenda, energy efficiency, social and environmental issues. The Bank and the
Fund teams carry out joint activities on the key fiscal and structural issues. The joint work on
the Public Expenditure Review (PER), Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and the
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) - are examples of excellent cooperation between
the two institutions.
Areas in which the World Bank leads
3.
Social sphere. The World Bank technical engagement with Belarus has generated a
significant amount of analysis in areas of relevance to the assessment of poverty and living
conditions in the country. In 2004 the Bank presented study “Poverty Assessment. Can
Poverty Reduction and Access to Services Be Sustained?” offering a number of
improvements to the methodology for measuring poverty and living conditions in Belarus
and contributing an in-depth analysis of the multiple dimensions of poverty. Driven by
demographic and socio-economic factors, Belarus faces a need for deep pension system
reform. To analyze current situation and discuss possible reform options the World Bank
team conducted a Pension Policy Dialogue with the Government during FY 2004.
4.
Energy sector. The Social Infrastructure Retrofitting Project (US$22.6 million) aims
to assist in the rehabilitation of the heating system, thermal insulation, and lighting in over
450 public buildings across the country. The project targets schools, hospitals, orphanages
and community homes for the elderly and the disabled. It also includes measures to increase
energy efficiency. In September 2006 the Bank issued a report Belarus: Addressing
Challenges Facing the Energy Sector which reviewed current standings of the electricity and
gas sectors and proposed policy recommendations to mitigate the impact of gas price
increases on the energy sector.

7
5.
Energy Sector Management Assistance Program grant (US$50.0 thousand,
completed in 2005). The project helped the Committee on Energy Efficiency explore market
mechanisms to improve energy efficiency through operation of Energy Servicing Companies
(ESCOs) and options of strengthening the energy efficiency program by learning experience
of neighboring countries that have managed to weather the impact of multi-fold energy prices
increases.
6.
Private-Public Infrastructure Advisory Facility project (US$350.0 thousand) was
approved in 2005. The project will help to advance the transition to market principles and
encourage private sector involvement in the Belarus energy sector by providing regulatory,
institutional and other support to create an environment that is conducive to private
investment. While recognizing that the environment for private investments is not conducive
in Belarus, the government has considered some reform scenarios that draw on experience
gained by neighboring countries, and is seeking technical assistance in the evaluation and
implementation of such scenarios.
7.
Environment. Belarus has made good progress in the protection of environment.
However, the country is still facing many environmental problems, including coping with the
legacy of the Chernobyl accident. The Post-Chernobyl Recovery Project (approved on April
18, 2006) is designed to revitalize selected regions of the country, affected by the Chernobyl
accident, by improving local people’s living conditions, reinforcing the energy efficiency and
environmental safeguards. The project is based on the recommendations of the Chernobyl
Review (2002) and also intended to spearhead greater support of the international community
to the affected regions of the country.
8.
The government welcomes the Bank’s continued support on the implementation of
the Kyoto protocol which was ratified in November 2005. Pending the effectiveness of
amendment to Annex B of the protocol, the country could be eligible to engage in joint
initiatives program or carbon emission trading under the Kyoto Protocol. In the meantime,
the Bank would assist the country in preparing for implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.
Areas of shared responsibility
9.
Economic development. The Bank team cooperated closely with the IMF on the
issues related to the preparation of the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), with one
chapter - “Macroeconomic policies and risks,” prepared jointly. This chapter reviews the
country’s macroeconomic developments since 1996, the sources and structure of growth, and
analyzes the role of macroeconomic policies in Belarus’s growth performance. Special
attention was paid to the risks associated with Belarus’s current macroeconomic position, and
how these risks might be addressed effectively through adjustments in monetary policy,
fiscal policy, and debt management.

8
10.
Private sector development. The most challenging reform agenda for Belarus is in
the area of structural reforms and private business development. The Bank Group seeks to
improve the general environment for the creation and operation of private business in Belarus
through technical assistance, policy dialogue and analytical work. The Bank and the IFC
conducted a number of studies including Improving the Business Environment and Costs of
Doing Business Surveys to track the developments in this area, define impediments to private
business expansion and provide policy recommendations. The Fund focuses on
macroeconomic policies aimed at sustainable growth and encouraging private sector
development. The Fund also provides technical assistance to improve taxation, banking
regulations and supervision of financial institutions.
11.
Public expenditure management. The IMF and the Bank provide continuous
technical assistance to Belarus in the area of public expenditure management. In FY 2006 the
assistance has been provided for preparation of budget programs’ description and other basic
documents required for the introduction of performance-based budgeting (PBB).
12.
The Bank is currently preparing a Public Expenditures Review (FY07) in the form of
short policy notes, focused on two areas: (i) increasing efficiency in public capital
expenditures; and (ii) reforming intergovernmental fiscal relations. Upon completion of the
notes and in consultation with government, the Bank will determine specific areas that need
further attention to produce just-in-time advisory notes.
14.
Financial sector. The FSAP for Belarus (2005) has been centered on assessments of
the banking system, including deposit insurance, securities markets, insurance industry,
payment system and transparency in conducting monetary policy. Regulations, oversight and
governance arrangements has been reviewed also. The Bank and the IMF also carry out joint
responsibility for providing assistance to Belarus in the prevention of money laundering and
combating financing of terrorism.
15.
In the context of the CIS Payments and Securities Settlement Initiative (CISPI), the
World Bank-lead mission visited Minsk in spring 2006 to review the payment and securities
settlement systems of the Republic of Belarus. The CISPI is a cooperative effort lead by the
World Bank. Its objective is to describe and assess the payments systems of the countries of
the CIS with a view to identifying possible improvement measures in their safety, efficiency
and integrity.
16.
Statistical capacity-building. The IMF and the World Bank provide technical
assistance in the area of statistics to the Ministry of Statistics and Analysis, National Bank
and the Ministry of Finance. Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building grant
(US$108.0 thousand, 2005) was designed to assist the government in the design of the
National Strategy for the Development of Statistics.

9
Areas in which the IMF leads
17.
The IMF is actively engaged with the Authorities in discussing the macroeconomic
program providing them with technical assistance and related support, including on economic
and financial statistics, tax policy, monetary operations and fiscal transparency. The IMF is
leading the dialogue on setting the objectives for monetary and exchange rate policies, public
debt management, overall budget envelope and tax policy.
18.
The IMF analysis in these areas serves as an input to the Bank policy advice. The
Bank and the IMF teams have regular consultations and the Bank staff takes part in the IMF
Article IV Consultation missions. This helps to ensure consistency of the policy
recommendations by the two institutions.
The World Bank Group Strategy
18.
The last strategy program covered the period of 2002-2004. The Country Assistance
Review (2004) recommended completing the key elements of latest CAS before initiation of
the new strategy of engagement. This included: completion of ongoing ESW, particularly the
CEM and the FSAP; continuation of the environment initiatives, and finalization of the
Chernobyl Project. The new CAS for Belarus is currently under preparation.
19.
To date, the Bank lending commitments in Belarus total US$243 million, with
US$17.5 million provided as grants. The active portfolio includes two ongoing operations—
the Social Infrastructure Retrofitting Project (US$22.6 million.) and the Post Chernobyl
Recovery Project (US$50 million).
20.
The International Finance Corporation has been actively involved in advisory
work in Belarus since 1993. The work began with the advisory services on privatization of
small businesses. Currently IFC focuses its efforts on small and medium enterprise
development and improvement of the business environment.
21.
IFC has invested a total of US$107 million in six projects, mostly over the course of
the past five years, in the financial, agribusiness and retail sectors. In the financial sector,
IFC has provided long-term funding to Priorbank and Belgazprombank to support their
expansion and SME lending operations. By focusing on SME lending, financial sector
investments have allowed IFC to reach a large number of private companies while
strengthening the country’s financial system.

ANNEX III. BELARUS: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1. The quality and timeliness of statistical data are broadly adequate for surveillance,
although macroeconomic analysis is encumbered in some areas. The authorities have made
significant efforts and improvements over the past years in a number of key areas, with the
support of technical assistance from the Fund. As a subscriber to the SDDS since December
2004, Belarus disseminates regularly prescribed series, an advance release calendar and
maintains a National Statistics Data Page
(http://www.belstat.gov.by/homep/en/specst/np.htm). The provision of data over the last year
has generally been adequate for the analysis of economic developments on a regular basis.
2.
The data ROSC mission that visited Minsk in early 2004 found that all statistical
agencies face the challenge of increasing users’ confidence in the accuracy and reliability of
official statistics.
National Accounts
3.
National accounts are compiled in accordance with the System of National Accounts
of 1993 (SNA 1993). GDP is compiled by the production, the expenditure and the income
approaches, and covers the entire economic territory of the Republic of Belarus. Data on
GDP are disseminated on a quarterly basis (in national currency) in current and constant
market prices (2000=100) expressed as absolute values.
4.
In early 2006, the Ministry of Statistics and Analysis (Minstat) introduced a new
methodology early 2006 for measuring industrial production in constant prices (on the basis
of prices of the previous year). In October 2006, a national account mission reviewed the
methodology. It found that it is remains essentially based on quantity measures and noted the
limitations of such measures for dealing with issues such as the introduction of new products
and improvements in quality. Besides, the methodology relies on a limited number of
deflators to derive intermediate consumption in constant prices, that hamper a proper capture
of volume and price breakdown and may introduce a systematic bias in measuring industrial
output.
5.
In addition, GDP figures are likely to be distorted by the underreporting of newly
emerging sectors—in particular services—and an active informal sector. In addition,
problems remain in calculating holding gains from inventories, and in measuring the capital
stock and consumption of fixed capital. Estimates of GDP by expenditure categories are still
uncertain as the statistical discrepancy has been soaring.
Prices
6.
Data on Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI) are being
reported to the Fund monthly on a timely basis. Both indices were developed with substantial
technical assistance from the Fund. As regards the PPI, in January 1995 a Laspeyres formula
recommended by the Fund was adopted. Other recommendations, such as inclusion of
exports, adequate specification of items, and better selection of representative products and
prices, have either been adopted or are in the process of being adopted. Since January 2001,

11
the PPI has been compiled using the 1999 weights; and beginning with 2003 data, with 2001
production weights.
Government Finance Statistics
7.
Since the 2004 data ROSC mission, the MOF has made progress in different areas of
collection, compilation, and dissemination of fiscal data. The authorities have extended the
coverage of the general government (republican and local government) operations by
including data for innovation funds, included the Social Protection Fund’s operations in the
consolidated budget, increased the number of officials involved in the GFS compilation
work, established a close coordination with the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus
(NBRB) for the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary datasets, and increased provision of
detailed budgetary metadata and methodological descriptions on the MOF’s website. In
addition to these improvements, the MOF has prepared new budgetary classifications codes
for revenue, expenditure, and financing data that will align them to the GFSM 2001
analytical framework.
8.
At the end of April 2005, a GFS technical assistance (TA) mission visited Minsk.
This mission found that the existing fiscal, accounting, and statistical systems have a sound
basis for migrating to the GSFM 2001. Nonetheless, several areas were identified that will
need further work before satisfactory implementation of the GFSM 2001. In order to provide
assistance in this area, the GFS TA mission collaborated with the authorities on the
preparation of a migration plan for a gradual implementation of this analytical framework.
9.
The authorities have reported GFS for 2003 and 2004 under the GFSM 2001
analytical framework for publication in the GFS Yearbook and started disseminating, through
the MOF’s website, fiscal data according to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.
Monetary Statistics
10.
The balance sheet of the NBRB and the monetary survey are usually provided with a
lag of no more than two weeks; the bank monthly balance sheet is available on or about the
fifth of the month following the reference period, while monetary data for publication in IFS
are reported with a lag of about four weeks.
11.
Interest rate data on bank deposits and credits, as well as data on NBRB credit
auctions and the placement of NBRB and government securities, are provided with a onemonth lag. Exchange rate data are readily available on the NBRB’s web site, and periodically
reported to the Fund in electronic file.
12.
Following STA technical assistance mission in October 2005, the NBRB compiles
monetary statistics according to the methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. The NBRB reports monetary data to STA using the Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs) framework. Monetary and financial data for Belarus in the SRF framework are
available from December 2001 and have been published in the December 2006 issue of the
IFS Supplement.

12
Balance of Payments Statistics
13.
The overall quality and timeliness of external sector data is satisfactory. The
International Transactions Reporting System employed by the NBRB has been broadened to
permit a more accurate classification of external transactions, while coverage and reporting
forms for enterprise surveys were also improved. The NBRB publishes quarterly balance of
payments and international investment position statements in the BPM5 format on a timely
basis. Scheduled interest and amortization payments on public sector debt are tracked by the
MoF and reported to the Fund, and timely information is available on arrears on government
and government-guaranteed debt.
14.
Belarus has started to disseminate historical data on the reserves template on the
IMF's website: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/ir/colist.htm. Monthly time series start
with November 2004 data.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF BELARUS
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Michael Deppler and Anthony R. Boote
August 22, 2007
1.
This supplement provides updated information that has become available since
the staff report was finalized. Since Belarus is a 3(b) country under the Decision on
Implementation of the 2007 Decision on Bilateral Surveillance, this supplement also provides
a summary of the authorities’ reaction to staff’s assessment of real exchange rate
misalignment. The new information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent data confirm continued strong growth, inflation pressures, and a
worsening trend in the current account balance. Real GDP grew by 8.8 percent in
January–July 2007 compared with the same period last year. Twelve-month CPI inflation
remained low at 7.2 percent in June, but the PPI surged to 14.1 percent, reflecting energy
price pass-through. Preliminary estimates for the current account deficit in the first half of
2007, at 2.7 percent of annual GDP, point to a marked deterioration from the 0.7 percent of
GDP deficit recorded in the same period of 2006. This is broadly in line with the staff
report’s baseline projection.
3.
General government operations
remained in surplus in January–June
2007. The surplus of 1.9 percent of annual
GDP is about double the average recorded
in the first halves of the previous three
years. It primarily reflects continued
strong revenue performance.

The NBRB has continued to lower the refinance rate toward its end-2007 target.
On August 1, the NBRB cut the refinance rate again by 25 basis points to 10.5 percent,
consistent with reaching its end-year target level of 9 percent. Credit growth continues to be
high at a 12-month rate of 56.5 percent in June.
5.
The forthcoming 2008 Monetary Policy Guidelines envisage a streamlining of
monetary policy targets. The NBRB will no longer peg the Belarusian rubel de jure to the
Russian ruble from January 1, 2008. Formalizing the de facto peg maintained in the past
several years, the NBRB intends to peg the rubel to the U.S. dollar within a corridor of
±2.5 percent around central parity. In addition, it will drop M1 as an intermediate monetary

2
policy target, citing its weak correlation with inflation. Staff supports these moves as
enhancing monetary policy transparency.
6.
On Aug. 21, 2007, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services assigned a 'B+' long-term
foreign currency and a 'BB' long-term local currency sovereign credit rating to Belarus.
Short-term sovereign credits were rated 'B'. The outlook is stable. This first sovereign rating
compares favorably to initial ratings for other CIS countries, being similar to those initially
granted to Kazakhstan and Georgia.
7.
The authorities stressed uncertainties associated with staff’s calculations
regarding real exchange rate misalignment. The authorities argued that owing to their
planned offsetting policy measures, terms-of-trade losses from energy price increases would
be smaller than the cumulative 10–15 percent of GDP estimated by staff for the period to
2012. They also project smaller current account deficits than those in staff’s baseline
scenario; and with higher expected FDI inflows, they project lower debt accumulation in the
coming years. The authorities also point to their plans to ease the tax burden and reduce the
energy and material intensity of production—factors they expect will improve Belarus’s
competitiveness.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 30, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431USA

IMF Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Belarus
On August 24, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Belarus.1
Background
Belarus’s centralized economy grew rapidly over the past few years, enhancing social
development. The state redistributed large and growing terms-of-trade gains stemming
from favorable Russian energy pricing across the economy, boosting domestic demand.
With available spare capacities, output expanded rapidly. Belarus’s social indicators—
notably its equal income distribution, high UN human development index, and improving
housing conditions—place it at the top of the Commonwealth of Independent States
league tables. A de facto exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar anchored inflation
expectations.
A new energy agreement, however, has abruptly reversed terms-of-trade gains. Belarus
now pays Russia twice as much for gas supplies as in 2006 and a fifth more as a share
of world market prices for crude oil. This results in an estimated loss of 5½ percent of
GDP in 2007, of which about 1½ percentage points could be offset by higher export
prices and lower energy intensity of production. Subsequent losses will be smaller,
particularly if additional declines in energy intensity occur, but cumulative losses through
2012 may reach 10–15 percent of GDP.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments
and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN
summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the Executive Board
discussion based on the staff report.
1

2
Growth and inflation performance remained favorable but resource constraints may be
emerging. Growth accelerated to 9.9 percent in 2006 as rapid real wage gains
supported consumption, while state-directed credit boosted investment. However,
capacity utilization indicators, labor market data, and strong import demand signal
incipient capacity constraints. Decelerating money growth, price controls, and the
exchange rate anchor helped slow consumer price inflation to 6.6 percent by end-2006.
Twelve-month inflation measured by Consumer Price Index—limited by tightened price
caps—rose only marginally to 7 percent through May 2007, but producer prices
increased by 13.5 percent.
The current account swung into deficit, raising reliance on foreign financing. Net export
volumes fell sharply, reflecting declining non-oil export market penetration and rising unit
labor costs. This pushed the current account from a surplus of 1.6 percent of GDP in
2005 to a deficit of 4.1 percent in 2006. The Q1 2007 deficit reached 1½ percent of
annual GDP compared to a small surplus in Q1 2006. Foreign borrowing is increasing
rapidly, raising external debt from its low end-2006 level of 19 percent of GDP. The
National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB) has rebuilt its foreign exchange
reserves to around one month of imports by July.
Fiscal prudence was a key component of the policy mix. Monetary conditions were
accommodative in 2006, and again from April 2007. Pressure on the peg—owing to
concerns over new energy prices—forced the NBRB to raise policy rates in early 2007.
But annualized credit growth picked up substantially, exceeding 50 percent in real terms
by end-April, financed increasingly through rising foreign borrowing and government
deposits in 2007. Directed concessional lending through state-owned banks facilitated
by large government deposits, and government-mandated wage increases in excess of
productivity at state-owned enterprises continued to provide an underlying expansionary
impulse to the economy. However, wage growth has been scaled back in 2007,
although not yet commensurately with the economy’s permanent income loss. The fiscal
stance also turned contractionary as the general government moved from a deficit of
0.6 percent of GDP in 2005 to a surplus of 0.5 percent in 2006. During the first five
months of 2007, the surplus reached 1.7 percent of annual GDP. Finally, the
government limited the pass-through of higher energy import costs to domestic prices to
about 60 percent.
Against this background, staff’s assessment is that the real exchange rate has become
overvalued by about 10 percent.
Financial soundness indicators appear adequate in the state-dominated banking
system. The share of nonperforming loans is small. Banking system net domestic
assets—at 20 percent of GDP—remain relatively low and largely short term, with over
80 percent controlled by four large state banks. Their profitability is relatively low, and
their recurrent recapitalizations fall short of the long-run costs of directed lending,
imperiling their solvency.

3
Progress with structural reforms has been limited and the state’s role in the economy
remains dominant. Administrative restrictions on price formation, private sector activity
and the movement of labor hamper market flexibility.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted Belarus’s relatively strong macroeconomic performance in
recent years, with rapid growth and declining inflation. While this performance reflected
broadly prudent fiscal and monetary policies, and strong partner country growth,
Directors stressed that growth through 2006 also owed much to favorable terms for
imported energy.
Most Directors emphasized that the outlook going forward was likely to be less
favorable, with energy costs rising following the new multi-year energy agreement with
Russia and the resulting worsening terms of trade. These Directors stressed that the
resulting permanent real income loss would adversely impact growth, inflation, the
balance of payments, and the fiscal position, especially in the absence of
commensurate policy adjustment and structural reform.
Against this backdrop, Directors welcomed the authorities’ initial policy response to the
terms-of-trade change, but cautioned that heavy reliance on foreign financing should not
substitute for adjustment. They noted that the pass-through of higher energy import
prices, the more moderate increase in wages, and—critically—the strong fiscal restraint
in evidence to date had helped maintain macroeconomic stability. However, most
Directors expressed concern about the incomplete pass-through of energy price
increases, the continued rapid growth of credit, and the insistence on official targets that
call for substantial fiscal and monetary loosening by year-end. These factors, together
with the slow pace of structural reforms, would raise external financing needs, the bulk
of which would be debt-creating, thereby escalating macroeconomic risks. Some other
Directors, however, saw merit in the authorities’ gradual approach to reform, stressing
the importance of long-term social and economic stability.
Directors considered that the permanent terms-of-trade shift and the likely lag in the
supply response called for early adjustment in the policy mix, including a tighter wage
policy. In addition, they urged the authorities to implement market-oriented reforms that
would substantially reduce state intervention in the economy.
Directors stressed the importance of tightening the fiscal stance. In particular, Directors
encouraged the authorities to press ahead with their plans to limit expenditures and
improve the operation of the tax system. Also, subsidies to public enterprises and banks
should be reduced and the targeting of social spending should be improved.
Directors welcomed the clarifications in the monetary policy framework envisaged for
2008, but saw continued rapid credit growth as inconsistent with maintaining the

4
exchange rate peg. Directors welcomed the planned shift to a formal peg to the dollar,
which would eliminate the divergence between the National Bank of the Republic of
Belarus (NBRB)’s de jure and de facto exchange rate targets. They observed, however,
that to maintain the peg, credit growth needed to be slowed, notably through a phaseout of directed lending. In addition, most Directors noted the deteriorating current
account position and the erosion of the economy’s competitiveness, as unit labor costs
had risen substantially, export market shares in the CIS had decreased, and on the
staff's calculations, the real exchange rate had appreciated significantly. Looking ahead,
a number of Directors advised the authorities to consider creating the preconditions for
greater exchange rate flexibility over time.
Directors commended the NBRB on the progress in strengthening the supervisory
framework. However, they emphasized that against the backdrop of continued rapid
credit growth, the NBRB needed to remain vigilant in strictly enforcing prudential
requirements. Directors welcomed recent steps toward attracting strategic foreign
investors to the banking system, stressing the importance of transparent and
competitive privatization procedures.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency

Statement by Mr. Willy Kiekens, Executive Director for the Republic of Belarus and
Mr. Mikhail Nikitsenka, Advisor to the Executive Director
August 24, 2007
On behalf of the Belarus authorities, we thank the staff for the continued productive dialogue,
and their helpful policy recommendations and technical assistance. The authorities welcome
the increasing degree of convergence of views with the staff on the economic performance
and medium term policies. Many of the policy recommendations of the staff have been
reflected in the authorities’ policy decisions, such as the recently adopted program for the
development of the banking sector during 2006-2010.
General Remarks
Notwithstanding the recent deterioration of the external conditions, due to a doubling of the
price of energy imported from Russia, the economy continues to grow briskly. Annualized
GDP growth was 8.8 percent during January-July 2007. The authorities are satisfied with the
staff’s recognition of their efforts and achievements in maintaining steady economic growth
through most of the transition period. Indeed, with 140 percent during 1990-2006, Belarus
recorded the highest GDP growth among CIS countries. The average annual growth during
the last three years exceeded 10 percent. The authorities share the assessment of the Fund
that, to a certain extent, the high growth is explained by the favorable terms of trade which
Belarus enjoyed until the recent drastic increase of the price of imported energy.
Nevertheless, the authorities believe that the growth performance is largely explained by the
stable macroeconomic environment, including prudent fiscal policies, a stability enhancing
exchange rate policy, declining inflation and a strengthening of the financial system. The
authorities also stress the importance of the country’s favorable record in maintaining, during
the last ten years, a high average investment ratio of 25 percent of GDP, which was the
second highest in the CIS region.
Due to the financial constraints caused by this year’s energy price hikes, the investment ratio
dropped to a still high level of 20 percent during the first half of 2007. The constraints of
internal financial resources have been compensated by more available external resources.
The privatization receipts are estimated to increase to 1.5 percent of GDP in 2007.
To mitigate the impact of the higher imported energy prices on the current account the
authorities have adopted and are successfully implementing a comprehensive energy savings
program for the period until 2011. In the first half of 2007, the energy intensity of GDP has
already dropped by 14 percent.
Belarus has the lowest public debt to GDP ratio among the transition countries. The
authorities therefore consider it prudent to borrow limited amounts to smooth the adjustment
of the economy and to finance the energy savings program. In this, Belarus follows the
successful experience of other transition countries that used additional borrowing to finance
growth-promoting programs.

2
Given the magnitude of deterioration in the terms of trade, the drop in enterprise profitability
by 1.5 percentage points to 11.9 percent is seen as moderate. Most of the decline in
profitability is concentrated in the oil processing industry, which recorded a decline in its
profitability from 23.1 percent to 5.3 percent. At the same time, we would like to mention
that the number of loss-making enterprises has dropped from 19.5 percent to 17.5 percent.
One of the main topics during the consultation discussions was the desirable level of the
pass-through to users of the higher energy import prices. The staff concluded that the passthrough of the 114 percent rise in gas import prices was incomplete as tariffs rose by
20 percent for households and by up to 89 percent for enterprises. These new tariffs represent
an average pass-through of about 60 percent. The staff is advocating an immediate full passthrough. However, the authorities consider a more gradual approach more consistent with
long term social and economic stability.
Monetary Policy - Exchange Rate Policy and External Competitiveness - Financial
Sector Policies
Moderate wage growth will be a key factor in preserving the competitiveness of the economy
and in helping to offset the recent terms of trade losses. Thus, the average wage growth in
2007 will be much closer in line with labor productivity increases, as recommended by the
staff. More modest wage increases will weaken consumer demand growth. As a result,
notwithstanding the pressures caused by sharply rising energy prices and by the higher
inflation in two main trade partners, i.e. Russia and Ukraine, consumer prices in Belarus rose
by only 3.6 percent in the first half of 2007, slightly above last year’s indicator of
3.1 percent.
The authorities are committed to further reducing inflation by pursuing prudent monetary
policy. The de facto peg to the U.S. dollar served as a strong stabilizing factor. Along with
tight monetary and fiscal policies, it helped to reduce annual inflation to a comparatively low
level of 7 percent in 2006.
Money growth is slowing significantly. The amount of cash in circulation rose by 7.5 percent
in the first half of the year, compared with 23.3 percent in the same period last year. The
rubel money supply rose by 5 percent in the same period, down from 18.6 percent in the
same period last year. As a result, core inflation was 0.6 percent in June 2007.
Pegging the rubel to the U.S. dollar resulted in a gradual devaluation of the rubel versus the
Euro and the Russian ruble, which was instrumental in maintaining competitiveness of
Belarus in relations with its main trade partners.
Addressing the concerns expressed during last year’s Board meeting, the authorities made an
effort to boost the level of international reserves by 70 percent during the first half of 2007 to
reach $2.4 billion, after the sale of state enterprises to foreign investors.
The growth potential of the financial sector is promising. The authorities intensified efforts to
attract foreign capital for the banking sector and to see reputable foreign banks becoming

3
strategic owners. The new banking code and adhering to best international prudential
standards have triggered increased interest of foreign investors in the banking system. The
participation of foreigners in the capital stock of domestic banks rose from 8 percent last year
to 14.3 percent in June 2007. The recent sale of two medium-sized banks to foreign investors
will contribute to stronger competition and improved business standards. Several other banks
are preparing themselves for a significant participation in their capital by foreign investors.
This year, most of the large banks in Belarus obtained substantial credit lines with foreign
banks without using state guaranties. This shows the improved creditworthiness of Belarus
as confirmed by the recent Standard & Poor’s B+ rating for long-term foreign currency debt.
To stimulate the critically important SME growth, the authorities and the EBRD, with the
support of IFC and bilateral donors, have started the process of creating a special bank for
micro financing. The new institution will support the development of SMEs by providing
credit and other financial services, particularly in regions outside the capital. The project is
expected to have a high transition impact by demonstrating to local banks the viability of
SME lending.
Fiscal Policy
The 0.5 percent of GDP fiscal surplus in 2006 and the 1.9 percent of GDP surplus in the
period January-May 2007 confirm the tradition of prudent fiscal policies with high tax
revenues, strong tax administration, and a disciplined expenditure management. As it is
recognized in the Staff Report, in the first five months of 2007 the authorities have
implemented stricter fiscal policies than budgeted.
To reduce expenditures in response to the higher cost of imported energy, in addition to the
expenditure cuts already undertaken, the authorities are finalizing the reform of the social
security system which will be implemented from January 1, 2008 onwards. The new system
envisages drastic cuts in all kinds of subsidies, resulting in substantial savings for the budget.
The authorities are also committed to make subsidies compliant with WTO rules.
Last year, the taxation of financial and nonfinancial enterprises has been harmonized. The
reform of the tax system is ongoing, and aims at reducing the overall tax burden and further
simplifying taxation, particularly for small businesses.
Structural Reforms
The authorities are stepping up their privatization program which includes the sale of the gas
transportation network “Beltransgas” and several large manufacturing enterprises which will
be offered for sale within the next 6 months.
During the last two years IFC has doubled its activities in supporting private business in
Belarus, increasing its investments from $20 million in 2005 to $40 million.
To create a better business environment for SMEs, last March the authorities amended and
further simplified the tax regulations for SMEs. The government plans to reduce, still this
year, the number of profit taxes for businesses and the frequency of tax reporting. The

4
procedures and formalities for setting up and closing businesses, and for obtaining licenses
are all in the process of being simplified.
