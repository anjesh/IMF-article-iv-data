NIGERIA
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with Nigeria
Approved by Saul Lizondo and Dhaneshwar Ghura
September 24, 2009
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Focus: Articulating a macroeconomic and financial policy framework that could support a return to strong economic
growth and steer the economy through the current unusually uncertain period.
Assessment: Nigeria entered the crisis from a position of strength because of reforms initiated earlier this decade. The crisis
has nonetheless had a significant impact. Lower oil prices have put pressure on the fiscal and external accounts and the
banking system has been pressured by deteriorating asset quality. Reduced financing, lower public spending, and
uncertainty will weigh on economic activity until well into 2010.
Staff views:
 Slower than trend growth argues for accommodative fiscal policy. The scope for this depends on financing and
administrative capacity. Over time, a return to setting fiscal policy within a medium-term framework using the oilprice-based fiscal rule is essential to insulate the economy from the vagaries of the oil market.


Anchoring inflation expectations in line with the single-digit target calls for consistent implementation of the monetary
and exchange rate regime. Competing concerns about inflation, exchange rate, international reserves, and financial
stability have challenged monetary policy and operations. The best way forward is to focus on price stability, leaving
the exchange rate to respond flexibly to external shocks.



A road map to final resolution of problems on some bank balance sheets is needed following the intervention by the
central bank. Beyond this immediate challenge, developing a robust financial stability framework is the next step.



Diversifying the economy away from oil is the theme of Nigeria’s Vision 2020 plan. Effective management of oil
wealth is essential to ensure that fiscal policy contributes to a favorable macroeconomic environment and leaves room
for the private sector to grow. The oil sector will nonetheless remain a key sector. Draft legislation proposing a major
overhaul of the sector needs to assess carefully alternative fiscal regimes.

Authorities’ views: The authorities generally concurred with staff policy views. They identified the global crisis and
political economy considerations as major challenges in recent policy making. Progress in addressing the infrastructure
gap—particularly power—is the priority. Success in that area and the anticipated Vision 2020 plan would offer a credible
foundation on which to reinvigorate economic reform.
Staff: The mission conducted discussions in Abuja and Lagos during July 9-29, 2009 with the official and private sectors.
The team comprised David Nellor (head), Bob Burgess, Gonzalo Salinas (AFR), Brenton Goldsworthy (FAD), and Rob
Gregory (SPR); with a parallel MCM team comprising Steven Swaray, Etienne Yehoue, Carel Oosthuizen, and Daryl King.

I. MANAGING THE GLOBAL CRISIS FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH
Nigeria entered the crisis from a position of strength because of reforms initiated earlier this
decade. The crisis has nonetheless had a significant impact on the economy. Lower oil prices
have put pressure on the fiscal and external accounts. The banking system has been pressured
by deteriorating asset quality.
A. The Payoff From Earlier Reforms
1.
Reforms earlier this decade have left the economy better prepared to deal with
the crisis. Central to this success is the oil-price-based fiscal rule.1 This rule broke the link
between public spending and oil prices and created an oil-savings cushion of $18 billion
(15 percent of non-oil GDP) as well as foreign reserves that peaked in September 2008 at $62
billion (16 months of imports). Similarly, the bank consolidation in 2005–2006, provided the
banking sector with a capital buffer against potential losses during an economic downturn.
2.
Increased confidence in economic prospects was reflected in improved growth
and lower inflation. Non-oil growth averaged over 9 percent from 2004 through 2008, as
agriculture, telecommunications, construction, and financial services expanded. Although
inflation accelerated in 2008 in response to rising global food and fuel prices and the loosening
of monetary conditions, it remains below rates prevailing earlier in the decade.
3.
Real incomes have risen significantly, suggesting that poverty is likely to have
fallen. Official estimates of poverty are based on the Nigerian Living Standard Survey (NLSS),
which was last conducted in 2004, making it difficult to assess the impact of recent
developments. The results of the 2009 NLSS will not be available until 2010. World Bank
analysis of the General Household Surveys suggests that real incomes in the formal and
informal sectors increased significantly between 1999 and 2006.
4.
This positive economic performance underscores the break from past episodes of
the oil price cycle. In previous episodes, fiscal policy was highly pro-cyclical because of both
mounting oil revenues and debt financing. Periods of high oil prices increased access to debt
and pushed up indebtedness. When oil prices turned down the economy went through periods
of severe contraction (Figure 1).

1

The oil-price-based fiscal rule, introduced in 2004, is a political agreement between all tiers of government that
provides for an allocation of oil revenues based on a budget oil price and volume of production. Oil revenues in
excess of the budget price and production are transferred into an “excess crude account” at the central bank in the
names of the various governments. As originally designed, the excess crude account is drawn upon only if actual
oil receipts fall short of budgeted amounts.

The past oil booms are 1974–79, 1979–84, and
1990–95. The figures show the arithmetic average of
the three earlier oil cycles for each variable.
The first year of the episode is shown as year one. In
the case of the current oil cycle, year one
corresponds to 2004 and year six to staff estimates
for 2009.

5
B. Growth Slows and Fiscal and External Balances Move to Deficit
5.
The pace of economic activity has slowed in 2009 (Figure 2). A decline in real
public sector demand of about 2 percent is restricting activity. Moreover, credit to the private
sector has been broadly flat in the first half of 2009. However, with a good harvest in
prospect, agricultural production, which grew by over 6 percent in 2008, may again do well.
Non-oil sector growth is expected to fall from 9 percent in 2008 to 4.5 percent in 2009. Oil
and gas production is constrained by security issues in the Niger Delta and more recently, by
OPEC production quotas. Production has averaged about 2 million barrels a day in recent
months—20 percent below its 2005 peak and well below estimated capacity of 2.8 million
barrels a day.
6.
Inflation is falling albeit after a slow response to declining global food and fuel
price inflation. The acceleration in consumer price inflation in 2008 was broad-based. A
combination of rising global food and fuel prices, transport bottlenecks caused by local fuel
shortages, and the easy monetary conditions prevailing for much of the past year offset the
impact of a good harvest. Inflation has moderated from a peak of 15.1 percent in December
2008 to 11.0 percent in August 2009.
7.
The balance of payments has weakened because of lower oil revenues and
capital outflows.2 Net private capital flows turned negative in 2008: the withdrawal of
foreign equity investors from the Nigerian market was exacerbated by domestic capital flight
as Nigerian banks substantially increased their foreign currency positions. Oil exports, which
account for over 90 percent of exports, declined by about half in the first half of 2009.
International reserves fell from a peak of $62 billion in September 2008 to $43 billion in July
2009.
8.
The naira depreciated in nominal terms but is little changed from pre-crisis
levels in real terms. Before the crisis, the naira appreciated sharply, reflecting high oil prices
and a close link to the strong dollar. With the onset of the crisis, the naira depreciated against
the dollar by 25 percent from December 2008 to January 2009 before the authorities
introduced temporary measures that fixed the rate at the prevailing dollar exchange rate
(Box 1). A sizeable spread between the parallel market and official rates emerged, peaking at
about 25 percent in early May 2009 before falling to 7 percent by July after temporary
exchange restrictions were eased.3 Through the crisis period, the naira depreciated by
21 percent in real effective terms. Nonetheless, the real effective rate of the naira in June
2

This report uses a balance of payments data series that differs from that used in previous staff reports. The
Statistical Issues Appendix details these changes.

Nigeria is not an Article VIII member. As reported at the time of the last Article IV consultation, multiple
prices are a technical characteristic of the central bank’s Dutch auction system and give rise to a multiple
currency practice (MCP). Staff does not recommend approval of this MCP.

6
2009 is only 3 percent below year-ago levels. Staff analysis, while subject to considerable
uncertainty, suggests that the real exchange rate is consistent with external stability as of
mid-2009 (Appendix I).

Driven by falling oil revenues, the fiscal accounts moved from surplus to deficit
(Figure 3). The overall balance of the consolidated government is projected to swing from a
surplus of 3.7 percent of GDP in 2008 to a deficit of 9 percent of GDP in 2009. This
turnaround is entirely due to the drop in oil revenue: the non-oil deficit is expected to narrow
by almost 4 percentage points to 27 percent of non-oil GDP. A modest increase in spending

by the federal government is more than offset by significant spending compression at state
and local government levels where access to borrowing is limited.4

The growth rate of monetary and credit aggregates has slowed sharply
triggered by the economic slowdown and central bank intervention in some banks. The
crisis-induced growth slowdown, falls in equity market indices, a depreciated naira, lower oil
prices, and a period of very rapid credit growth raised questions about bank asset quality.
Signs of stress in the banking system became evident in the interbank market where activity
diminished as the crisis developed. Following special examinations, the central bank
4

The debt sustainability analysis concludes that Nigeria’s debt outlook remains robust. Since the last Article IV,
the authorities have extended until 2010 a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese Government for a
$500m infrastructure loan that, if taken forward, would be on concessional terms. In the event that such a loan is
contracted, it would not modify the assessment of debt sustainability.

9
intervened in some banks by replacing management and injecting funds. It was learned that
governance in some banks had been weak and legal actions are pending. These developments
have contributed to a tightening of lending (see section II C).
11.
The crisis has affected Nigeria somewhat less than many other oil producers
(Figure 4). The decline in revenues has been less than in some other countries, and the
compression in real public expenditure has been more modest. Non-oil growth, though
falling, is set to hold up better than in many other countries. However, Nigeria has seen a
greater reduction in international reserves than many other oil producers because it sought to
contain the decline in the nominal value of the naira.
C. Moderate Growth Outlook and Evenly Balanced Risks
12.
Growth is expected to remain slower than in recent years. Reduced financing
(both foreign and domestic), constraints on public spending, and uncertainty about global and
domestic prospects, will weigh on consumption and investment until well into 2010. Non-oil
growth is projected to slow from 9 percent in 2008 to 4.5 percent in 2009, and to pick up
gradually thereafter as confidence in the banking system is restored and oil prices recover.
The current account surplus, after falling by 13 percentage points of GDP in 2009, should
strengthen as oil prices recover and production picks up.

The medium term growth outlook depends on the success of efforts to realize
the potential of oil and gas reserves and to address the infrastructure gap. Apart from
security related issues holding oil and gas below potential, the policy framework for the oil
and gas sector will be critical (see Section II E). The rapid non-oil growth of recent years was
sustained by increases in agricultural acreage and the take off in sectors such as
telecommunications. Ongoing reliance on these sources of growth is not likely to be
sustainable. The baseline growth rate is assumed to be about 6½ percent over the medium
term consistent with preparatory work for the national plan that projects a growth rate of
6.9 percent in 2010–14.

Risks to the immediate outlook are substantial and evenly balanced.
Uncertainty about the depth and duration of the global recession, and the associated outlook
for oil prices, implies a range of possible outcomes on either side of the baseline projection.
Wide ranging market expectations of oil prices have profound implications for the possible
outcome for Nigeria (Figure 5). The baseline could also change depending on how quickly
domestic issues, concerning hydrocarbon production and the banking sector, are resolved

II. SETTING THE POLICY COURSE FOLLOWING THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS
With signs that macroeconomic and financial conditions may be starting to stabilize,
discussions focused on the importance of articulating a macroeconomic and financial policy
framework that could support a return to strong economic growth and steer the economy
through an unusually uncertain period.
A. Fiscal Policy—Options in a Low Growth Environment
Lower than trend growth argues for an accommodative fiscal policy. The scope for such a
policy depends critically on financing and administrative capacity.
15.
The design of the fiscal policy regime is based on a medium-term framework
using the oil-price-based fiscal rule. The purpose of the regime, developed in 2004, was to
insulate public spending from short-term oil sector developments and ensure that spending is
consistent with inflation goals. Recent experience suggests that a non-oil primary deficit—
the best available measure of how fiscal policy affects the domestic economy—of around
25 percent of non-oil GDP for the consolidated government is the appropriate medium-term
fiscal anchor.
16.
An accommodative fiscal stance relative to the medium term benchmark could
mitigate the impact on growth of the global crisis. With growth expected to be well below
potential in 2009 and 2010, tempering the speed with which the non-oil primary balance is
brought back toward the medium-term benchmark would help support economic activity
without generating inflationary concerns.5
17.
Financing constraints have limited the scope for fiscal support of activity in
2009. Apart from the decline in oil revenues of 20 percent of non-oil GDP, ambitious targets
for non-oil revenues are unlikely to materialize and a planned sovereign bond issue of $500
million (0.5 percent of non-oil GDP) has been shelved because of market conditions. These
shortfalls will be only partially offset by increased domestic borrowing, oil savings, the use
of unspent account balances, and support from multilateral development banks. The
consolidated government non-oil primary deficit is therefore expected to fall from 31 percent
of non-oil GDP in 2008 to about 27 percent in 2009.

5

Staff analysis suggests that this trajectory is consistent with preserving oil wealth for future generations, even
without taking into account the potentially high returns from infrastructure spending and other investments.

18.
Financing constraints on the budget should ease in 2010. Projected oil prices and
production levels should ease financing constraints subject to the level of the budget oil price
in the 2010 budget. It will be important, however, to use some of this additional financing to
scale back domestic borrowing from this year’s peaks. Lower domestic borrowing is needed
to allow room for a recovery in private sector borrowing as activity picks up.
19.
Implementation capacity will limit the pace at which spending can be scaled
up. A consolidated non-oil primary deficit for 2010 similar to the anticipated outturn for this
year, would allow for a real increase in primary spending of about 3 percent. While there is
still a case for a more accommodative stance from a cyclical perspective, it would be difficult
to scale up spending substantially beyond these levels without compromising the quality of
spending projects, including at the state and local governments where administrative capacity
is limited (Box 2).
20.
The authorities emphasized that their priority has been to support economic
activity through better budget execution and public financial management. Federal
capital spending has fallen well short of budgeted levels in recent years, The authorities
indicated that the early start to the 2010 budget preparations, improved integration of
medium-term sector strategies into the budget process, and increased familiarity with new
procurement procedures should pave the way for better selection and execution of capital
projects.

14
Box 2: Public Financial Management Reforms in State and Local Governments 1/
State and local governments account for almost half of public spending. Better public
financial management at the subnational level is essential to achieve spending priorities.
The World Bank has conducted public expenditure reviews and public expenditure and
financial accountability assessments in 7 out of 36 states. These have highlighted a number
of challenges, including:


Limited budget credibility, reflected in large gaps between approved budgets and outturns.



Limited and opaque budget reporting, with significant extra-budgetary operations.



Poor alignment of resource allocation with state development priorities.



Ineffective budget execution, on account of poor revenue forecasts and monitoring, and
weak cash management.



Deficiencies in accounting, recording, and reporting systems. Account reconciliations are
not timely and in-year budget reporting is either irregular or not done. A major problem is
the poor quality and timeliness of annual financial statements.



Relatively good external audit systems, but significant flaws in the scrutiny and follow-up
of audit recommendations.

Since late 2005, the World Bank’s State Governance Capacity Building Project has
provided support to three states to help them improve the management of their financial
and human resources. It has provided assistance with accounting and financial reporting,
external audit, budget preparation, improving the regulatory framework for public financial
management (fiscal responsibility and procurement legislation and reforms), modernization of
tax administration, personnel and payroll management and capacity building.
The main achievements have been: (i) strengthened tax administration to improve internally
generated revenue; (ii) more timely and transparent reporting; and (iii) reforms and audits of
personnel and payroll that have reduced fraud. Remaining priorities include implementation of
integrated financial management systems and promotion of improved budget preparation. The
Bank is planning to provide support to another 4 states in the second phase of the project.

B. Setting Monetary Policy in the Face of Conflicting Goals
Anchoring inflation expectations in line with the single-digit target calls for articulation and
consistent implementation of the monetary and exchange rate regime. Competing concerns
about inflation, exchange rates, international reserves, and financial stability have
challenged monetary policy and operations.

15
21.
Inflation performance was much improved until the second half of 2008.
Nigeria has a history of high inflation; inflation averaged about 15 percent in the first half of
the decade and about 30 percent in the 1990s. In 2006-2007, more effective management of
the monetary aggregates and reform-related increases in money demand kept inflation to its
single-digit target.
22.
The acceleration in inflation in 2008 was broad-based. While supply related food
price developments played a role in the rise in inflation and its more recent retreat,
disaggregated price indices suggest that inflation was a broader phenomenon than supply
related factors. A trimmed-mean measure of core inflation accelerated in 2008, averaging
15 percent in the second half of the year (Figure 6).
23.
The rapid growth of the monetary aggregates likely helped push up inflation in
2008. When oil prices were surging in 2008, monetary policy was geared to preventing
appreciation of the naira against the US dollar by restraining foreign exchange sales. Because
the resulting accumulation of reserves was not sterilized fully, monetary aggregates
accelerated, with broad money and private credit increasing by about 60 percent by the end
of 2008.
24.
Triggered by the crisis, a reversal of monetary expansion is bringing inflation
back to its single-digit target. Broad money growth (quarter-on-quarter) abruptly turned
negative in the second quarter of 2009. The central bank sought to limit pressure on the naira
from lower oil prices and became a net seller of foreign exchange. Banks have reined in their
lending. The slowdown in activity and tight credit conditions should dampen inflationary
pressures considerably and offset the impact of naira depreciation on prices.
25.
Monetary operations were challenged by financial stability considerations and
fiscal developments resulting in high and volatile interest rates. As in other countries,
after the crisis began, concerns about banks’ balance sheet risks led to a breakdown in the
interbank market. This contributed to higher interest rates in the interbank market and
competition for liquidity in the retail market that pushed up deposit and lending interest rates.
Moreover, the mechanism for disbursing government oil revenues leads to large and variable
injections of liquidity that contribute to the volatility of interest rates.
26.
Effective communication of the framework and its implementation will be
critical for anchoring market expectations. A clear published statement of the monetary
policy framework would help market participants to understand the basis for policy
decisions. Similar communication of foreign exchange market policy and publication of
central bank foreign exchange activity would also be desirable.

27.
Monetary policy should focus on price stability with a well-defined nominal
anchor. Staff argued that policy should be based on the relationship between monetary
aggregates and inflation, leaving the exchange rate to respond flexibly to sustained external
shocks. This would be superior to relating interest rates directly to the inflation goal at this
stage of Nigeria’s financial market development. Policy interest rates do not yet fully
influence credit market conditions and tend to play a correspondingly small role in
influencing economic activity. Over time, however, the central bank should move to
inflation-targeting and set interest rates based on expected inflation.
28.
The implementation of the monetary regime faces some challenging issues in
Nigeria. In view of the changes in the economy, especially the rapid growth of the financial
sector, policymakers need to pay close attention to factors that affect the demand for money
for a given rate of inflation. Given the importance of food in domestic consumption, it would
also be important to understand clearly the role of supply shocks, such as weather-related
disruptions of food production.
29.
The foreign exchange regime needs to permit flexibility in the naira rate to
avoid undermining monetary policy. The pivotal role of the central bank, which is often
the only provider of foreign exchange to the market (particularly since the onset of the crisis),
complicates its policy task. The central bank needs to permit the exchange rate to be guided
by fundamentals without being trapped on one side of the market as the sole seller (or buyer)
of foreign exchange. Effective central bank intervention in the foreign exchange market may
be necessary to ensure that market players see a two-way risk to taking foreign exchange
positions.
30.
The authorities intend to publish their monetary policy framework. They agree
on the use of the monetary aggregates as the operating target for monetary policy (Box 3).
They noted, however, that other considerations are important. For instance, they see an
important role for monetary policy in promoting economic development by ensuring that
interest rates are as low as possible consistent with their inflation target. Moreover, they are
concerned about large swings in the exchange rate, noting that the economy is import
dependent, including for basic items that affect the poor. They also observed that, in the
absence of a non-oil export sector, there is intense political opposition to a weaker naira.
31.
Retail interest rates that are relatively high compared to interbank and policy
rates underscore the importance of addressing structural issues in the banking system.
Market participants indicated that these impediments include the high cost base for banks,
weaknesses in commercial bankruptcy law, and the absence of effective credit bureaus. The
absence of a well-functioning corporate bond market leaves banks with a near monopoly in
financing businesses. Corporate bond issuance would be promoted by significantly reducing
regulatory costs in terms of both fees and administrative costs.

18
Box 3: The Monetary Policy Regime
The central bank uses a monetary targeting regime. Under this regime, it uses policy
instruments to influence its targets, the reserve and broad money aggregates; the ultimate goal
of its interventions is to keep inflation in single digits. This goal is consistent with supporting
growth and minimizing the harmful consequences of inflation, particularly for low-income
groups.
A central component of policy is the interest rate corridor around the monetary policy
rate (MPR). The central bank intervenes in the money market through the interest rate
corridor, where the rate on a standing lending facility constitutes the ceiling and the rate on the
standing deposit facility is the floor. The MPR is the midpoint between these rates. By
adjusting this corridor, the central bank seeks to influence interest rates in the interbank market
and thus the willingness of banks to hold naira.
Open market operations and reserve requirements are also used to help manage liquidity.
Each week the central bank auctions treasury bills and, less frequently, federal government
bonds. A repurchase (repo) market complements open market operations. The central bank also
modifies bank reserve requirements to influence liquidity.
In conducting monetary policy, the central bank is also cognizant of other considerations.
To keep interest rates as low as possible to support economic activity, the central bank
promotes reforms in the banking and other sectors. Likewise, while recognizing that the
exchange rate will move according to changes in the global and domestic economy, the central
bank stands ready to dampen abrupt moves in the exchange rate.

C. Financial Stability—Supporting Growth While Managing Risks
Domestic factors and the global crisis have triggered significant problems in the banking
system. The financial stability framework needs to be strengthened.
32.
The banking system has expanded rapidly in recent years. In advance of the
2005–06 consolidation the banking system was chronically weak; of the 89 banks, marginal
or unsound banks accounted for about 20 percent of system assets and the system’s nonperforming loan ratio hovered around 20 percent. Consolidation transformed the system
resulting in the current 24 banks with a substantial increase in capital. Many banks raised
significant further capital following consolidation. Financial intermediation increased
significantly. Bank branches grew from 2,900 in 2005 to almost 5,500 in mid-2009. Banks
participated in a wider range of activities, including financing of infrastructure and the oil
sector, which previously had been out of reach.
33.
The pace of expansion posed challenges for supervisors. While the level of
private credit in Nigeria at 21 percent of non-oil GDP was low before consolidation, its rapid
growth since then to 50 percent of non-oil GDP by the end of 2008 argued for careful
monitoring. Banks were under pressure to deploy and secure a return on their expanded

19
capital. The central bank recognized the need for strengthened supervision and developed a
plan for consolidated and risk-based supervision. But progress in implementation was slow.
34.
The global crisis magnified the challenges facing the banking system. The
immediate impact of global financial turbulence on the banking system was contained. While
offshore funding of the domestic banking system was growing before the crisis, its scale was
manageable and the central bank was able to accommodate commercial bank foreign
exchange demand in the depth of the global crisis. Commercial banks did not have exposure
to complex domestic or foreign financial instruments and foreign bank ownership was low.
However, the large swing in oil prices, the resulting depreciation of the naira, and confidence
effects in domestic capital markets, contributed to growing pressure on the banking system.
35.
Concerns about bank balance sheets intensified as the crisis progressed. Market
speculation about the quality of some bank balance sheets was evident in the breakdown of
the naira interbank market as well as market perceptions, later verified, that some banks were
using the central bank discount window as an ongoing source of funding. Some banks were
involved heavily in margin lending for equity market investments. The equity market
subsequently crashed by 70 percent reflecting both domestic and global market
developments. In addition, some banks had high exposure to the importers of fuel products.
The importers had high foreign currency obligations owing to the high fuel prices of earlier
in 2008 and were then hit when oil prices plus the naira fell sharply thereby cutting their
naira earnings.
Special examinations of bank balance sheets by the central bank and deposit
insurance corporation were launched. The examinations sought to verify asset quality and
examined related party transactions. Independent accounting firms reviewed the
examinations. Some banks had sizable off balance sheet instruments that concealed nonperforming loans and while, in other cases, non-performing loans were rolled over or
otherwise reclassified as performing. The examinations identified serious breaches of
regulations and laws, including cases of connected lending. The central bank has required
banks to bring on to their balance sheets exposures related to the capital market and to
provision fully for any exposures that are deemed non-performing.
36.

37.
On the basis of the first round of examinations, which covered 10 banks, the
central bank intervened in five banks in August 2009. Management of the banks was
replaced and funds were injected into the banks. Capital adequacy and liquidity ratios in the
intervened banks, which account for about one third of bank sector assets, fell short of
regulatory requirements. About 40 percent of their loans were non-performing. The central
bank provided N420 billion (about $2.8 billion), equivalent to about 2½ percent of non-oil
GDP, of liquidity support in the form of loans. The support was defined by determining the

20
amount needed to notionally raise the capital adequacy of the banks to the regulatory
requirement of ten percent plus a margin.6
38.
The central bank plans to seek new capital for the intervened banks. The
central bank has made a public commitment to protect depositors and creditors. The
immediate goals are to stabilize the banks, seek full recapitalization through loan recovery
and new investors, to strengthen the corporate governance practices in the banks, and to
enable the central bank to remove itself from both the management and balance sheets of the
banks.
39.
Looking ahead, there is a pressing need to develop a financial stability
framework to provide a solid foundation for the banking system. The recent experience
has highlighted that there are legal and procedural questions in the current resolution
arrangements. For example, it is not clear whether the central bank is permitted, under the
central bank act, to take equity in a financial institution even as a transitory step in bank
resolution. For the government to take the equity position would require an appropriation bill
approved by the National Assembly. Such an appropriation cannot be secured in a timely
manner. While the Central Bank and Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation legislation
provides the legal framework for resolving banks, the questioning by some bank executives
(and other interested parties) of the legal basis for these actions gives rise to the possibility of
lengthy court involvement that could undermine the timely resolution of banks by the
regulator.
40.
Some elements of the financial stability framework are being introduced. The
four main areas comprising the framework are:


Macro prudential factors. Macroeconomic developments, including asset prices,
need to guide supervisory and regulatory policy. The central bank intends to establish
a macro prudential function in its supervision department.



Prudential rules. The credibility of banks’ balance sheets will be enhanced by the
new requirement that banks move to a common reporting period by the end of 2009
and adopt IFRS accounting standards from the beginning of 2010. Decisions will also
be needed on defining the scope of bank activities such as the pace with which
derivative products can be developed given regulatory and supervisory capacity.



Supervisory framework. The central bank’s framework for risk-based and
consolidated supervision needs to be implemented because a large number of banks

6

The injection of liquidity could not formally be recorded as tier 2 capital in all cases. Tier 2 capital cannot
exceed tier 1 capital. Hence, if the intervened bank had tier 1 capital of less than one half of the regulatory
requirement (the case in two of the intervened banks) they remain below the regulatory capital requirement.

21
have non-bank financial subsidiaries and cross-border activities. The number of
foreign branches of Nigerian banks has expanded rapidly to 70 from only 4 in 2004.
Enhanced monitoring of banks’ risk management practices, lending standards, and
funding situation is warranted.


Resolution framework. Allowing institutions to enter and leave the banking system
based on the consequences of business decisions establishes strong incentives for
banks to assess risks prudently. To enable this to occur without creating systemic
distress, a framework must be established. The framework would make a clear
statement of the conditions under which a troubled bank will be resolved by outlining
principles, policies, and procedures for handling both a systemic crisis and the failure
of an individual financial institution.
D. Promoting Economic Growth and Diversification—Vision 2020

A significant diversification of the economy away from oil and gas is the theme of Nigeria’s
Vision 2020 plan currently being prepared. Macroeconomic policy must create an enabling
environment for private sector-led growth in the non-oil sector.
41.
By 2020, Nigeria wants to become one of the world’s top 20 economies. Vision
2020, now being prepared, sets out the authorities plan to achieve this goal by building a
globally competitive economy that is much less reliant on the oil and gas sector to generate
employment and reduce poverty.
42.
Establishing a macroeconomic policy framework that supports growth and
economic diversification will be essential. This calls for enhancing competitiveness through
structural reforms and investment in critical infrastructure as well as ensuring that the
exchange rate does not become overvalued.7 In this regard, resource producers that have
successfully managed swings in commodity prices have done so by adopting strongly
counter-cyclical fiscal policies. Nigeria’s economic history demonstrates how letting swings
in commodity prices drive fiscal policy can play havoc with development goals.
43.
Fiscal policy needs to neutralize the macroeconomic impact of swings in oil
prices. The oil-price-based fiscal rule has been instrumental in avoiding the boom bust
pattern of earlier cycles. Diversification has begun to take place: non-oil GDP growth has
been higher than in the oil sector and new growth drivers, such as telecommunications and
financial services, have emerged. These reforms need to be sustained and extended through
consistent implementation of the oil-price based fiscal rule. Extraordinary distributions from
7

There is general agreement that an overvalued real exchange rate has a detrimental impact on economic
growth (see, for example, Spence, 2008, The Growth Report: Strategies for Sustained Growth and Inclusive
(Washington: World Bank)).

22
the Excess Crude Account in response to political pressures to spend oil revenue windfalls
have meant that fiscal policy has still been pro-cyclical during the current oil cycle.8
44.
Private sector-led growth calls for a reduction in the size of the public sector.
Despite recent increases in public capital expenditure, there is still a large infrastructure gap,
and the costs of meeting the Millennium Development Goals will also be significant. Both of
these factors will place demands on public resources in the next few years. Over time,
however, the size of the public sector should gradually be scaled back to make room for
private sector led-growth.
45.
To achieve these goals, the difficult issue of institutionalizing practices
concerning the management of oil wealth and revenue flows must be tackled. Some
countries have used special fiscal institutions such as fiscal rules, commodity funds, or fiscal
responsibility legislation to help deliver this outcome (Box 4). Beyond the current use of the
Excess Crude Account and the Fiscal Responsibility Act, the authorities have considered
setting up a national Sovereign Wealth Fund. 9

8

A 2007 memorandum of understanding between the tiers of government sought to formalize extraordinary
allocations (i.e., beyond those to cover shortfalls in budget oil revenue) through the establishment of the 80-20
rule: 80 percent of oil savings accrued in a particular year would be available for additional spending the
following year. This understanding, if implemented, runs counter to the objectives set by Vision 2020.

9

The Fiscal Responsibility Act prescribes procedures for formulating, executing, and publishing the annual
budget and medium-term expenditure framework, and sets out the role of the budget oil price. It also contains a
rule limiting the overall budget deficit to 3 percent of GDP, with only a very restrictive escape clause.

23
Box 4. Experience with Fiscal Rules in Selected Commodity Producing Countries
Some countries have found rule-based frameworks helpful in keeping spending growth
moderate and smooth during commodity price booms:


Chile’s fiscal policy has been based on maintaining a structural central government balance
target over the economic and copper price cycles. A feature is the use of independent
experts to compute the extent to which output lies above or below potential, and to
compute the extent to which the price of copper lies above or below its long-run level.



Botswana’s framework incorporates goals for the overall balance and a “golden rule”
whereby non-mineral revenue should at least cover non-investment recurrent spending.



Norway seeks to limit the central government structural non-oil deficit to no more than the
expected long-run real rate of return on the accumulated financial assets in its oil fund. The
guidelines allow deviations for countercyclical fiscal policy and are seen as a tool to help
set a long-term benchmark for fiscal policy.



Timor-Leste has relatively flexible guidelines. Fiscal policy is based on the non-oil deficit
consistent with the estimated permanent income from oil wealth, but deviations are
allowed so long as the government provides a rationale and information on the impact on
oil wealth in future years.

Critical to success have been good institutions, transparency, and a high degree of
political commitment to fiscal discipline. Lacking these factors, several countries have tried
and failed despite efforts to make the rules as rigid as possible.

46.
Meeting spending priorities while allowing for medium-term fiscal
consolidation calls for efforts on a number of fronts:


Prioritizing spending. The authorities have taken an important first step by proposing
to eliminate subsidies on the remaining two subsidized fuel products; this will generate
savings of about 2–4 percent of non-oil GDP.



Strengthening non-oil tax performance. A draft National Tax Policy proposes reforms
in a range of areas. Caution is warranted in considering proposals for extensive tax
incentives, in terms of both the implications for achieving development goals and
designing such incentives cost-effectively.



Identifying areas for private sector initiatives. Two areas identified are Public Private
Partnerships (PPPs) and corporatization of public sector involvement in upstream oil
sector development, which would reduce the call on the budget for investment in the
oil sector. Both areas require establishing a regulatory and legal framework including
to manage the associated fiscal risks.



Boosting the quality of spending. The increased focus on performance indicators with
a view to the adoption of program-based budgeting is a major initiative. It will also be

24
important to build on steps already taken to improve budget planning by, for example,
increasing the effectiveness of the medium-term sector strategies in evaluating projects.
E. Charting a Course for the Oil and Gas Sector
While the Vision 2020 plans to diversify the economy are important, the oil and gas sector
will remain a critical determinant of macroeconomic performance and the primary source of
exports and government revenue for the foreseeable future. Draft legislation proposes a
major overhaul of the sector.
47.
The authorities are considering a wholesale reform of the petroleum industry.
The draft Petroleum Industry Bill would replace 16 existing laws and a myriad of
administrative instruments into a single omnibus law establishing a new legal and regulatory
framework for the industry. Among the objectives it seeks to achieve are:


Promotion of good governance and transparency, by publishing all procedures,
contracts, and payments. Prospecting licenses and mining leases would be subject to
competitive bidding. The Bill would also be consistent with the Nigerian Extractive
Industries Transparency (NEITI) Act.10



Separation of the government’s commercial and regulatory roles, including the
establishment of a viable and self-financing national oil company. The Bill envisages
a new national oil company to form incorporated joint ventures with international oil
companies that can finance new projects directly from cash flow and borrowing.



Establishing a fiscal framework involving increased emphasis on royalties. Royalty
rates would be adjusted depending on production volumes and prices and would vary
by geographical location (onshore, shallow offshore, deep offshore, and inland basins)
to account for differences in costs and risk.

48.
The review of the oil and gas regime is an opportunity to enhance
arrangements, but care needs to be taken to ensure that the industry remains attractive
to investors. The tax regime needs to both maximize returns to government and promote
investment in the sector; this requires detailed quantitative analysis and careful design of
transitional arrangements. For gas especially, it will be important to identify and address
price, payment, regulatory and other impediments that have held back the development of a
vibrant downstream gas industry, despite a generous tax regime for upstream production.
49.
Current tax arrangements vary according to the type of contract; there may be
scope to increase the return to government in some cases. A preliminary assessment of
10

The first set of NEITI audits for 1999-2004 were published in 2006 and a second audit report for 2005 was
published in 2009. Audits for 2006–08 are being commissioned.

25
current fiscal terms, based on comparisons of the estimated average effective tax rate with
those of other oil producing countries, suggests that the average effective tax rate for onshore
joint venture (JV) arrangements is high by international standards (Figure 7), although the
terms for production sharing contracts (PSCs), which were agreed to in 1993 to encourage
investors to explore offshore, are more generous.11

50.
Policy and administrative considerations will affect the choice of a future fiscal
regime. Among them are the responsiveness of government to oil prices and the costs of
production. Reliance on revenue-based instruments is attractive because they are easier to
administer and so reduce scope for tax avoidance. However, they have the serious drawback
that they are not responsive to the cost structure of different oil and gas projects and so run
the risk of discouraging investment.

11

The average effective tax rate is the ratio of government revenues to the before-tax net cash flow from the
project, both expressed in real net present value terms, calculated over the estimated life of a representative oil
field.

26
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
51.
Though growth has slowed from the impressive rates of recent years, reforms
initiated earlier this decade have done much to soften the impact of the global financial
crisis on Nigeria. The substantial cushion of oil savings and foreign reserves built up when
oil prices were surging, together with bank consolidation and recapitalization, have enabled
policy makers to manage the crisis fallout from a position of strength. However, the outlook
remains challenging and highly dependent on developments in oil prices; growth is likely to
remain weaker than trend.
52.
The growth outlook calls for a supportive fiscal stance, but financing and
administrative capacity constraints limit the scope for this support. The authorities’
emphasis on improved budget execution and enhanced public financial management is
welcome. Faced with a precipitous decline in oil revenues, the availability of oil savings and
room to increase borrowing averted the need for an equally deep fiscal contraction.
Nonetheless, financing constraints and lack of implementation capacity have limited the
scope for fiscal stimulus. The uncertain outlook for oil revenues also warrants the prudent
approach followed by the authorities.
53.
A clearly articulated monetary policy framework would help anchor inflation
expectations. A robust framework would help guide policy through competing concerns
about inflation, external developments, and financial stability, which have been a challenge
for monetary policy and operations in recent years. The authorities’ intention to publish their
monetary policy framework is welcome. Consistent implementation of the framework, based
on the relationship between monetary aggregates and inflation, and its effective
communication will be critical in anchoring market expectations. Over time, the authorities
should pursue their goal of adopting an inflation-targeting framework.
54.
The increased flexibility of the exchange rate in recent months is positive. It
will support the implementation of monetary policy focused on price stability, while allowing
the naira to find its equilibrium level. A more consistent regime will help to reduce
uncertainty and build policy credibility following the recent frequent changes of foreign
exchange regulations. In the staff’s view, the level of the naira is consistent with external
stability.
55.
The authorities are taking welcome measures to resolve problems in bank
balance sheets. The banking system has been transformed in recent years, but sustaining that
success calls for decisive action to address weaknesses in some banks. While the system as a
whole has significant capital, individual banks that pursued high-risk strategies during the
recent period of rapid credit growth are demonstrably vulnerable. The next step is to take the
necessary actions to normalize the banking system consistent with financial stability
considerations.

27
56.
A robust financial stability framework will be important for the sustained
development of the financial sector. Improvements are already in train, including steps to
improve the credibility of information on bank balance sheets and to establish a macro
prudential unit within the central bank. Preparatory steps have also been taken to develop a
framework for risk-based and consolidated supervision: this framework now needs to be
implemented. Beyond this, the rapid expansion of Nigerian banks across borders calls for
stronger cross-border supervisory arrangements. A clear framework for dealing with bank
failures also needs to be spelled out.
57.
Macroeconomic policies are decisive in supporting private sector-led growth,
diversifying the economy, and further reducing poverty. Building on past progress in
managing swings in commodity prices, fiscal policy will need to be more consistently
counter-cyclical—ad hoc or discretionary distributions of oil savings have generally operated
in the opposite direction. This underscores the importance of tackling the difficult issue of
institutionalizing practices concerning the management of oil wealth and revenue flows.
58.
The proposed overhaul of the framework for the oil and gas sector is an
opportunity to improve arrangements in a sector that will remain critical from a
macroeconomic perspective. The authorities’ goals of improving governance, enhancing
transparency, and creating an efficient fiscal regime that remains attractive to investors, are
fully appropriate. Achieving them will require further detailed quantitative analysis and
careful design of transitional arrangements.
59.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

APPENDIX - Assessment of the Exchange Rate Level for Nigeria
Assessment of Nigeria’s exchange rate is based on the IMF’s CGER methodology, adapted for
Nigeria’s circumstances, using data as of mid–2009. One method suggests that the naira was
overvalued by about 7 percent reflecting projected current account surpluses that are below
the norm. Two methods—relating the value of the naira to its fundamental determinants, and
comparing the projected current account surplus with the level needed to stabilize net foreign
assets—suggest that the naira was undervalued by 13 percent and 7 percent. This assessment
is broadly consistent with external stability.

Current Account projection for 2013 includes 75% of errors and omissions.

1. Macroeconomic balance. Using coefficients relating current account balances to
macroeconomic fundamentals, estimated from a sample of 13 oil- and gas-exporting countries
(see IMF Country Report 2008/104), yields a current account norm for Nigeria of 7.4 percent
of GDP. Nigeria’s current account projections need to be adjusted to account for very large
errors and omissions in the balance of payments. Assuming that three-quarters of errors and
omissions reflect current account transactions, Nigeria’s projected current account surplus is
5.8 percent of GDP in 2013, a little below the current account norm, suggesting that the
exchange rate may be overvalued by 7 percent. This result should be treated with caution,
however, given uncertainties about the estimated current account norm. Nigeria is less
developed than most of the oil and gas exporters included in the sample used to construct the
current account norm, so a lower norm may be appropriate for Nigeria given its pressing
investment needs. This would be consistent with a smaller estimate of overvaluation or,
possibly, undervaluation.
2. Equilibrium real effective exchange rate (REER). Estimation of a reduced-form
relationship between the REER and certain macroeconomic fundamentals (relative
productivity, oil price, and trade openness) suggests that the REER was about 13 percent
below its estimated equilibrium level by mid–2009 (Figure A1.1).

3. External sustainability. Based on the medium-term projections for real growth and
inflation, an external current account balance of 4 percent of GDP would stabilize net foreign
assets at current levels over the medium term. This is somewhat lower than staff’s projected
medium-term current account balance of 5.8 percent of GDP which, adjusting for errors and
omissions, suggests that the naira was undervalued by 7 percent. However, determining the
appropriate target level for net foreign assets in Nigeria is not straightforward. As an oil
producer seeking to preserve oil wealth for future generation, Nigeria should be seeking to
accumulate financial assets via a higher current account surplus; as a low-income country with
substantial investment needs, however, there is also a case for using its oil savings.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
NIGERIA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis Under the
Debt Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Saul Lizondo and Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
and Carlos Primo Braga and Kathie Krumm (IDA)
September 24, 2009
Nigeria is at low risk of debt distress based on the joint Bank-IMF low-income country debt
sustainability analysis (DSA)—as it was in the DSA published in February 2008. The debt
outlook is robust both in the baseline scenario and in the case of standardized stress tests.1
For the two customized stress tests, all indicators deteriorate when compared to the baseline
results, but remain within nearly all country-specific thresholds.2 Debt would become
unsustainable if the primary balance remained unchanged from its anticipated 2009 level. The
primary balance is expected to strengthen from this level, however, as oil prices recover. Debt
would also become unsustainable in the event of a permanent shock to GDP growth. Given
Nigeria’s strong financial starting position, there would be time for fiscal policy to adjust to
avoid an unsustainable build up of debt.
A. Background
1.
Nigeria’s external public debt is projected to total $4.5 billion, or 2.2 percent of GDP,
at end-2009. Approximately $4 billion of the external debt stock is multilateral debt, with the
remaining $1 billion owed to bilateral creditors. Domestic public debt is projected to reach
12 percent of GDP at end-2009. The government also has substantial financial assets: deposits
in the Excess Crude Account (ECA) at the central bank exceeded $18 billion at end-2008
(almost 10 percent of GDP). A limitation of this DSA is that it applies only to debt contracted
at the federal level. Data on sub-national borrowing are not available. While sub-national
1

This DSA utilizes the updated Bank-Fund debt template for low-income countries. The previous DSA for
Nigeria was undertaken as part of the 2007 Article IV consultation and published in February 2008.

2

The one exception concerns the threshold for the PV of debt-to-exports in certain years between 2019 and 2027.
This threshold is temporarily breached in a scenario that assigns the errors and omissions.

2
borrowing is limited, there are indications that State Governments are expanding their
exposure to domestic creditors, underscoring the need for improved monitoring of subnational
debt.
B. Assumptions
2.

The assumptions contained in the baseline for 2009–29 are:



Average growth of 5.6 percent over the period 2009–29 (somewhat below the average
of 6 percent for 2006–2008) reflecting non-oil GDP growth of about 6.1 percent and
growth in the oil and gas sector of 1.4 percent.3 The latter assumes a pick up relative to
2008 as security-related disruptions ease and there is a gradual increase in the
utilization of Nigeria’s extensive gas reserves.



Oil prices are assumed to be $60.5 per barrel in 2009, increasing to $80 per barrel by
2012, and then remaining constant in real terms thereafter.4



The consolidated government non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) averages around
25 percent of non-oil GDP over the medium term and declines gradually thereafter.
This is consistent with the government’s medium-term fiscal strategy and gives rise to
an overall surplus and accumulation of deposits from 2012. It is assumed that the oilprice-based fiscal rule is applied, with a budget oil price assumed to be on average $5 a
barrel below the projected oil price.5



Exports decline by 40 percent in 2009 because of lower oil prices. Export growth
resumes in 2010; annual growth of 2 percent is achieved by 2016. The acceleration in
export growth is driven largely by developments in the oil and gas sector. Imports
decline by nearly 12 percent in 2009 before returning to an annual growth rate of
6 percent starting in 2010. After recording a deficit in 2009, the balance of payments
moves into surplus over the medium term but goes back into deficit after 2026 as
import growth, primarily non-oil imports, outstrips that of exports. It is important to
note that there is a break in the balance of payments data series between 2005 and
2006, owing to the adoption of the central bank balance of payments data commencing
at that time. This results in a significant increase in errors and omissions and a much
higher figure for net remittances. The increase in errors and omissions is taken into

3

This is less than the average growth rate assumption of 7.1 percent used in the previous DSA. The projections
used in that DSA proved accurate for 2007 but over-optimistic for 2008 (9 percent vs. an outturn of 6 percent).

4
5

Based on WEO oil price projections as of June 12, 2009

The government is assumed to establish a long-term sustainable fiscal position. This is calculated on the basis of
a constant consumption of oil wealth in real terms and implies a decline in the consumption of oil wealth (the
non-oil deficit) as a percent of non-oil GDP over time. Oil reserves are sufficient to sustain oil production at or
above current levels throughout the projection period.

3
account in a country-specific stress test. The break in the data affects the calculations
of historical averages.


Future official financing flows are small. The only significant disbursements after 2013
are from IDA, which explains the observed increase in the grant element of new
borrowing in figure 1a.
C. External Sustainability6

3.
In the baseline scenario (Table 1a and Figure 1), the nominal external debt burden is
projected to be broadly unchanged throughout the projection period. The debt-service-toexport ratio falls from 1 percent in 2009 to an average of 0.5 percent thereafter. The present
value (PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio and the nominal external-debt-to-GDP ratio average less than
2 percent over the period.
Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
4.
Standardized stress tests (Table 1b and Figure 1) show that the NPV of the debt-toGDP ratio is not likely to exceed 16 percent of GDP over the projection period. In the most
extreme standardized stress test for the PV of debt-to-exports ratio, holding export value
growth at the historical average minus one standard deviation in 2010–2011 causes the PV of
debt to increase to over 40 percent of exports for 2011–2013; this is still below the indicative
debt burden threshold.
5.

Two country-specific scenarios were examined.



The first recognizes the large value for errors and omissions in the balance of payments
and that this may reflect an underestimation of current account debit transactions. The
trade balance was recalculated assuming that three-quarters of the projected errors and
omissions for 2010–2029 are attributed to the trade balance. In this scenario, all
indicators are weaker than in the baseline results. A temporary breach of the threshold
for the PV of debt-to-export ratio occurs in some years between 2019 and 2027. The
scenario assumes no policy response from the authorities and involves an artificial
adjustment of the denominator in the calculation of the debt-to-exports ratio. This does
not change the overall assessment for Nigeria of a robust outlook.



The second scenario illustrates the impact on the external accounts and debt dynamics
of a prolonged oil price shock. The impact of the oil price shock on the external

6

The low-income country debt sustainability framework (DSF) provides a methodology for assessing external
debt sustainability guided by indicative, country-specific, debt burden thresholds based on the relative strength of
a country’s policies and institutions. Given Nigeria’s rating of 3.26 (medium performer), which is the three-year
average of the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), the country-specific thresholds
are an NPV of debt to GDP of 40 percent, an NPV of debt-to-exports of 150 percent, and a debt-service-toexports ratio of 20 percent.

4
accounts is calibrated as one standard deviation of Brent crude prices over the period
1970–2009. This reduces future oil prices by $19 per barrel. All indicators worsen in
this scenario but remain within country-specific thresholds. The PV of the debt-toexport ratio reaches close to 50 percent in 2019─still some way from the debt burden
threshold of 150 percent.
D. Fiscal Sustainability
6.
In the baseline scenario (Table 2a and Figure 2), consolidated government deposits
continue to accumulate at the central bank, reaching almost $70 billion by 2030. The
accumulation of deposits will begin to slow beyond 2030 in line with the eventual decline in
oil production. Recognizing the accumulation of such significant levels of government
deposits, and the low level of gross debt, the fiscal debt sustainability exercise for Nigeria
utilizes a concept of net debt, defined as gross consolidated government debt (external and
domestic) less gross consolidated government assets (specifically, the balance in the ECA).7
With these government assets included, net debt is projected in the baseline scenario to be
negative from 2017.
Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
7.
The standardized stress tests underscore the need for fiscal policy to adjust to the
economic environment. In particular, debt soon becomes unsustainable if the primary balance
is unchanged from the 2009 level—an unusual year, given the sharp drop in oil prices from
2008 and the need to use fiscal policy to cushion the impact on Nigeria of the global recession.
Once oil prices stabilize and economic growth recovers as assumed in the baseline, fiscal
policy will need to adjust accordingly. Similarly, a permanent shock to GDP growth would
necessitate an eventual fiscal policy adjustment, or the debt ratios would escalate beyond 2020
(Table 2b and Figure 2).
E. Conclusion
8.
Nigeria is at low risk of external debt distress. While large negative errors and
omissions in the balance of payments warrant a degree of caution in interpreting the result of
the DSA, in the baseline scenario and in the standardized stress tests, Nigeria’s debt outlook
remains robust throughout the projection period. Fiscal policy would need to adjust in order to
maintain debt sustainability in the event of a sustained reduction in oil prices or a permanent
shock to GDP growth. However, Nigeria’s strong financial starting position would provide
ample time for policy to adjust. As anticipated in the baseline, the primary balance will also
need to strengthen from its 2009 level as oil prices economic growth recover. There also
appears to be a low risk of public debt distress although data at the subnational level is needed
to provide a more thorough assessment.

For illustrative purposes, Figure 1 also traces the evolution of gross debt in the baseline scenario.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution fro m price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage p oints higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sells
foreign exchange to banks and exchange bureaus through twice-weekly wholesale Dutch
auctions (WDAS) and intervenes periodically in the interbank market. The naira also
continues to be traded in two markets for cash transactions—the bureau de change market
and a small curb market. As a result of the stability of the naira against the US dollar, the de
facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as stabilized from April 2008 to December
2008. The naira depreciated by 25 percent against the US dollar from December 2008 to
January 2009, after which the CBN introduced a number of temporary exchange restrictions

3
in an attempt to limit pressure on the naira and safeguard foreign reserves. In January 2009,
the WDAS was replaced with a retail Dutch auction system (RDAS), under which: (i) bids
need to be accompanied by supporting documentation to prove that the funds are for eligible
transactions; and (ii) funds purchased through the auction are ineligible for trading in the
interbank market. In February 2009, the CBN announced its commitment to manage the
exchange rate within a band of +/- 3 percent around the official rate recorded at that date
(N145.85 to US dollar). Exchange restrictions were progressively eased beginning in May
2009, culminating in the restoration of the WDAS on July 13, after which the naira
depreciated by over 2 percent through mid-August 2009. Therefore, the exchange rate
arrangement has been reclassified from a stabilized arrangement to other managed
arrangement, effective January 1, 2009. Multiple prices are a technical characteristic of a
Dutch Auction system and give rise to a multiple currency practice. A comprehensive
assessment by MCM and LEG is needed to identify the extent of remaining restrictions and
multiple currency practices.
VIII. Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) was
subject to a full safeguards assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement, which
expired on October 31, 2001. The assessment, which included an on-site visit, was completed
on November 28, 2001. The assessment concluded that vulnerabilities existed in the areas of
financial reporting and legal structure of the Central Bank.
IX. Article IV Consultation
Nigeria is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The previous Article IV
consultation was concluded on February 13, 2008.

NIGERIA—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of August 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Macroeconomic data are broadly adequate for surveillance; however serious data deficiencies—in
particular a lack of high frequency data on economic activity, inadequate information on subnational public
finances, and large errors and omissions in the balance of payments—continue to hamper policy design and
monitoring. The Statistics Act passed in 2007, which established the National Bureau of Statistics as the main
coordinating agency for data management, has led to a number of improvements, including better information
sharing between data producing and collecting agencies. Nevertheless, a number of problems continue to
prevent the compilation of timely and internally consistent data, in particular lack of good source data, and
insufficient computerization.
National accounts: Statistical methods used to derive production-based GDP have been improved through the
development of more comprehensive estimates for a number of individual industries, although a number of
statistical challenges remain. As reported in IMF Country Report No. 8/64, revisions to the national accounts
published in late-2007 led to some apparent discontinuities in the series for non-oil GDP, and in particular
agricultural output in 2002 and 2004, which complicates analysis of historical economic activity. Work is
ongoing to conduct a new agricultural census, which should lead to improvements in the measurement of
agricultural production—a key sector accounting for over half non-oil GDP—which is currently estimated on
the basis of outdated survey information. The reliance on the consumer price index to construct the constant
price GDP series leads to weaknesses. The introduction of additional indices, such as a producer price index,
would facilitate more accurate estimation of the constant price measure. The base year for the national accounts
(1990) is in urgent need of updating given the significant chances to the structure of the economy since then.
The compilation of GDP using the expenditure approach would facilitate analysis of savings-investment
balances. A lack of good quality high-frequency data on economic activity makes it difficult to assess current
and recent economic performance.
Prices statistics: The official monthly consumer price index (CPI), a composite of urban and rural price data, is
available on a timely basis. The index has been re-referenced to May 2003=100, and there are plans to use the
2003/04 National Consumer Expenditure Survey to update the 1996/97 survey-based expenditure weights.
Government finance statistics: Fiscal data are opaque and complicated not only by the federal structure but
also by a multiplicity of off-budget funds. The most pressing shortcomings are related to inadequate data
coverage, particularly of the subnational governments which comprise almost one-half of total government
expenditure. The federal government has limited information on the subnational fiscal accounts which makes it
difficult for it to play a stabilizing role by targeting a consolidated fiscal balance; efforts to address this issue
have been stymied by constitutional restrictions. To facilitate the timely preparation of a consolidated set of
fiscal accounts, governments at all levels need to use consistent budget classification, chart of accounts, and
accounting systems. There is also a need to formalize the publication of government accounts on a monthly or
quarterly basis and to report on the operations of parastatals.

9

Monetary and financial statistics: There have been significant improvements in the compilation of monetary
statistics. Earlier problems with the CBN accounting framework and IT issues, which had contributed to
significant distortions in reported monetary data, have now been resolved. There is a need for a clearer measure
of commercial banks’ foreign assets and liabilities that captures both their on- and off-balance sheet exposures.
The definition of the other depository corporations (ODCs) sector should also be extended beyond commercial
banks to include all deposit-taking nonbank financial institutions, such as microfinance banks and primary
mortgage institutions.
Financial soundness indicators: A broad range of information on the financial sector, including both core and
a number of non-core financial soundness indicators, is compiled by the CBN. However, weaknesses in
transparency and disclosure practices among banks undermine the reliability of this data. The requirements to
move to a common year-end reporting period by the end of 2009 and adopt IFRS accounting standard from the
beginning of 2010 will be key steps in enhancing the credibility of this information.
Balance of payments: There have been significant efforts to improve the compilation of Nigeria’s balance of
payments data in recent years. Supported by IMF technical assistance, the authorities have expanded the range
and improved the quality of data sources used to compile the balance of payments statistics. The incorporation
of the CBN balance of payments data into staff’s presentation of the balance of payments has resulted in
significant changes, with current transfers (mainly remittances) and errors and omissions significantly higher
than had earlier been estimated by staff (text table).

1/ Previous IMF staff estimates (April 2009 WEO)

Large errors and omissions in the balance of payments complicate the assessment of external sustainability. It
will be important, therefore, to further strengthen the measurement of the balance of payments and the
international investment position. There is a need for improved validation of transactions reported by banks,
measurement of transactions outside the banking system and the possible under invoicing of imports, and
verification of estimates of the external assets and liabilities of the banking sector (which are difficult to
reconcile with other sources, such as data from Bank of International Settlements reporting banks). Nigeria has
recently agreed to participated in the IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey, which should facilitate
improvements in the measurement of the international investment position.
The authorities have not yet initiated compilation of international reserves data in line with the Data Template
on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity.
External debt: Public external debt data are of good quality and available on a timely basis. The Debt
Management Office (DMO) should work to extend the coverage of their database to include private sector
liabilities and foreign investment in domestically issued debt securities.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Nigeria
On October 16, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Nigeria.1
Background
Reforms initiated earlier this decade have averted the boom-bust pattern that
characterized previous oil price cycles and better prepared the economy to deal with the
global financial crisis. Central to this success is the oil-price-based fiscal rule, which broke
the link between public spending and oil prices and created a substantial cushion of oil
savings. Increased confidence in economic prospects was reflected in improved growth
and lower inflation. Non-oil growth averaged 9 percent from 2004 through 2008. Real
incomes have risen significantly, suggesting that poverty is likely to have fallen.
The pace of economic activity has nevertheless slowed in 2009, reflecting weaker
demand from the public sector and decelerating credit extension to the private sector.
However, with a good harvest in prospect, agricultural production, which grew by over
6 percent in 2008, may again do well. Constrained by security issues in the Niger Delta
and, more recently, by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
production quotas, oil production has averaged about 2 million barrels a day in recent
months, about 20 percent below its 2005 peak.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted
to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found
here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Lower oil prices have put pressure on the fiscal and external accounts. The overall fiscal
balance at the consolidated government level is set to move from a surplus of 4 percent
of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008 to a deficit of 9 percent of GDP in 2009 due to
the drop in oil revenue. The non-oil deficit is expected to narrow by about 4 percentage
points to 27 percent of non-oil GDP in 2009 as a modest increase in spending at the
federal government level is more than offset by spending compression at other levels of
government. The balance of payments has also weakened. Net private capital flows
turned negative in 2008 when foreign equity investors withdrew from the Nigerian market
and Nigerian banks substantially increased their foreign currency positions. Oil exports
declined by about half in the first half of 2009. International reserves fell from a peak of
$62 billion in September 2008 to $43 billion in July 2009.
The naira has depreciated in nominal terms but is little changed from pre-crisis levels in
real terms. Before the global crisis, the naira appreciated sharply, reflecting high oil prices
and a close link to the strong dollar. With the onset of the crisis, the naira depreciated
against the dollar by 25 percent from December 2008 to January 2009 before the
authorities introduced temporary measures to manage the exchange rate within a narrow
band around the prevailing dollar exchange rate. A sizeable spread between the parallel
market and official rates emerged, peaking at about 25 percent in early May 2009 before
falling to 7 percent by July after temporary exchange restrictions were eased.
The banking system has been pressured by deteriorating asset quality. Slower economic
growth, falls in equity market indices, a depreciated naira, lower oil prices, and a period of
very rapid credit growth in the period before the crisis raised questions about bank asset
quality. Signs of stress became evident in the interbank market where activity diminished
as the crisis developed. Following special examinations, the central bank intervened in
some banks by replacing management and injecting funds. It was learned that
governance in some banks had been weak and legal actions are pending.
Monetary conditions have tightened and inflation has decelerated. The growth rate of
monetary and credit aggregates has slowed sharply, triggered by the economic slowdown
and central bank intervention in some banks. These developments have contributed to a
tightening of lending. Inflation has started to moderate, declining from a peak of
15.1 percent in December 2009 to 11 percent in August 2009.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that reforms initiated earlier this decade have done much to
soften the impact of the global financial crisis on the Nigerian economy. The substantial
cushion of oil savings and foreign reserves built up when oil prices were surging, together
with bank consolidation and recapitalization, has enabled policy makers to manage the
crisis fallout from a position of strength. The near-term outlook is nevertheless challenging
and highly dependent on developments in oil prices. Directors welcomed the authorities’
commitment to a strong macroeconomic and financial policy framework that can support

3
an early recovery and lay the basis for the successful implementation of Nigeria’s
Vision 2020 development plan.
Directors agreed that the growth outlook warrants a supportive fiscal stance, while
recognizing that financing and administrative capacity constraints limit the scope for such
support. They therefore welcomed the authorities’ prudent approach to fiscal policy, and
its focus on actions to improve budget execution and enhance public financial
management as well as to increase fiscal space. Building on past success with the oilprice-based fiscal rule, fiscal policy over the medium term will need to be more
consistently counter-cyclical in order to neutralize the macroeconomic impact of swings in
oil prices and support private sector-led growth.
Directors emphasized that consistent implementation of a clearly articulated monetary
policy framework, focused on price stability and based on the relationship between
monetary aggregates and inflation, is needed to anchor inflation expectations and
establish credibility. Effective communication of the framework will also be critical, and
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to do so. Directors also welcomed the plans
to move forward cautiously with the adoption of an inflation-targeting framework, with due
attention to the necessary institutional underpinnings for such a regime.
Directors supported the increased flexibility of the exchange rate in recent months, which
will support the implementation of monetary policy focused on price stability. They noted
the staff’s assessment that the level of the naira is consistent with external stability.
Directors welcomed the measures taken to identify and resolve problems in bank balance
sheets. While the system as a whole has significant capital, individual banks that pursued
high-risk strategies and allegedly violated governance and prudential regulations during
the recent period of rapid credit growth are vulnerable. Directors urged the authorities to
press ahead with their efforts to address governance problems and resolve the intervened
banks.
Directors observed that a robust financial stability framework will be important for the
sustained development of the financial sector. They welcomed the improvements already
in train, including steps to improve the credibility of information on bank balance sheets
and to establish a macro prudential unit within the central bank. Directors emphasized the
urgency of implementing the framework for risk-based and consolidated supervision. It
will also be important to develop a clear framework for dealing with bank failures, and to
strengthen cross-border supervisory arrangements in view of the rapid expansion of
Nigerian banks across borders.
Directors welcomed the proposed overhaul of the framework for the oil and gas sector,
noting its critical importance from a macroeconomic perspective. They supported the
authorities’ goals of improving governance, enhancing transparency, and creating an
efficient fiscal regime that remains attractive to investors. Achieving these improvements
will require further detailed quantitative analysis and careful design of transitional

4
arrangements. In parallel with energy reform, Directors welcomed the authorities’
emphasis on structural reforms aimed at diversifying the economy and strengthening
infrastructure.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Nigeria will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Nigeria
October 16, 2009
1.
This statement summarizes economic developments since the issuance of the staff
report on Nigeria’s Article IV consultation (www.imf.org). These developments do not
alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The central bank intervened in four banks in early October based on special
examinations; this is in addition to the five intervened banks listed in the staff
report. The central bank provided N200 billion (about $1.3 billion), equivalent to about
1 percent of non-oil GDP, of liquidity support in the form of loans to these banks. Bank
management was replaced in all but one bank, which recently came under new
ownership. Another bank, found to have insufficient capital but a healthy liquidity
position, is required to recapitalize by end June 2010.
3.
The special examinations of all banks in the system have been concluded with
the ten banks found to have inadequate capital accounting for 38.1 percent of bank
assets. The five banks that were intervened in August 2009 account for 26.5 percentage
points (lower than the preliminary estimate of 31.5 percent reported in the staff report).
The central bank also announced that as of September 25, the five banks that were
intervened in August 2009 have recovered over N110 billion of previously nonperforming loans (about 10 percent of their stock of non-performing loans).
4.
An additional $2 billion (1.7 percent of non-oil GDP) of oil savings will be
disbursed to the three tiers of government to provide additional support to the
economy and help clear outstanding debts to the banking sector. This brings
extraordinary allocations from oil savings (the excess crude account) in 2009 to $5.5
billion (compared with $3.8 billion assumed in the staff report). If these extraordinary
allocations are spent in full in 2009, the non-oil primary deficit of the consolidated
government would be 1.4 percentage points wider than the –27.0 percent of non-oil GDP
projected in the staff report.

Statement by Samuel Itam, Executive Director for Nigeria
October 16, 2009
1.
My Nigerian authorities appreciate the constructive dialogue with the Fund on their
economic, financial and structural reform policies aimed at sustaining macroeconomic and
financial stability. These policies also are expected to spur high growth necessary for poverty
reduction and attainment of the MDGs. The exchange of views with the staff during the 2009
Article IV consultation discussions was candid and my authorities are grateful for the
comprehensive set of papers. There is broad agreement with the thrust of the staff’s analyses
and recommendations.
Economic developments and outlook
2.
The implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and reforms earlier this decade
has left the economy better prepared to deal with the global financial and economic crisis.
The pace of economic activity, like in other parts of the world, has slowed in 2009. The
balance of payments position has weakened due to lower oil receipts and increased capital
outflows, and as a result the exchange rate has depreciated significantly against the US
dollar. Inflation has, however, declined due largely to the lower global food and fuel prices.
3.
On the immediate outlook, the authorities are somewhat optimistic and project 2009
growth at around 5 percent, relative to a growth rate of about 3 percent projected by staff.
The authorities’ optimism is based on expected favorable weather-induced high agricultural
output, expanding telecommunications services, and relatively strong contribution of the
housing and mining sectors following recent substantial investment in these sectors. For the
agricultural sector in particular, both the federal and the state governments have scaled up
budgetary support to broaden extension services, improve the supply of high-yielding
seedlings and fertilizers, and control soil erosion. In addition, the authorities’ commitment to
address security-related vulnerabilities in the Niger Delta, as witnessed by the recent positive
responses of militants taking advantage of the government amnesty, is improving the
environment for strengthening the production potential of oil and gas. Also, the continuous
recovery of the global economy and related increase in commodities prices would have a
positive impact on the economy.
4.
Recently, the authorities proposed to allocate an additional US$2 billion of oil
savings to the three tiers of government to provide further support to the economy and help
with the ongoing restructuring in the banking sector. These allocations, if spent in full,
would increase overall deficit by less than half a percentage point of GDP to about 9.4 percent in 2009.

3

5.
Overall, inflation is expected to fall to single digits as good harvests make food and
other agricultural produce more readily available, and supply bottlenecks related to domestic
fuel shortages ease in line with positive developments in the Niger Delta. In addition, fiscal
prudence, underpinned by the authorities’ oil-price-based fiscal rule, is expected to continue
to play a significant role in achieving and sustaining macroeconomic stability even in the
face of oil price swings. Decisive and swift monetary policy actions, which have been
consistent with support for growth and containment of domestic inflationary pressures, would
continue to be pursued. Furthermore, the banking system consolidation implemented by the
authorities a few years ago, which contributed to the robustness of the banks and increased
outreach in the provision of banking services, is being strengthened with the newly
developed framework for risk-based and consolidated supervision.

The authorities are committed to improving budget execution and public financial
management. The swing from overall fiscal balance of recent years to a deficit in 2009 is
mainly attributed to declining oil revenues. While financing of the deficit would be
challenging without external resources, it would, nevertheless, be feasible through a
combination of uncollected signature bonuses, privatization proceeds, recall of some
accumulated reserves the Nigerian authorities have with the African Development Bank’s
Nigeria Trust Fund, and domestic borrowing. The budget for 2009 is based on a conservative
oil-price assumption of US$45 per barrel. This oil-price-based fiscal rule has enabled the
authorities to neutralize the macroeconomic impact of swings in oil prices. The authorities
have remained committed to this practice despite political pressures to spend. In addition, the
authorities are aware that weak implementation capacity is likely to limit the pace at which
spending can be scaled up in 2010, even though financing constraints are expected to ease in
line with the recovery of oil prices. They are also of the view that substantial scaling up of
expenditures, in the face of the constrained implementation capacity, would compromise the
quality of spending.
7.
The authorities are making significant progress through a number of measures they
have taken to increase fiscal space to help them achieve their priorities. These include:


The liberalization of petroleum and kerosene prices which is expected to free up
significant resources and generate fiscal space ( about 2 percent of non-oil GDP) for
higher priority spending.



The authorities’ commitment to improve budget preparation to facilitate integration of
medium-term sector strategies into the budget process for 2010. Also, it is expected
that increased familiarity with new procurement procedures would pave the way for
improved capital project selection and implementation.



Efforts underway to reform non-oil taxation policy and administration. In this regard,
several measures are being taken, including appointment of a Presidential Task Force
on customs to improve the efficiency and collection of customs revenue across the
nation.

Monetary and exchange rate policies
8.
Monetary and exchange rate policies have returned to a more normal footing.
Exceptional measures taken to limit pressure on the exchange rate have been unwound. The
Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) policy framework is based on monetary targeting. There is,
however, ongoing discussion to review the current framework to make it more responsive
and supportive of growth and the maintenance of price stability. In this regard, the authorities
consider that improved understanding of the monetary policy transmission mechanism to the
rest of the economy is critical. Efforts to complete preparatory arrangements for a move to
an inflation targeting regime are ongoing, with actual transition being a medium-term
objective.
9.
The interbank foreign exchange has been liberalized with Wholesale Dutch Auction
System (wDAS) recently re-introduced to replace the Retail Dutch Auction System (rDAS).
The authorities are determined to let the exchange rate continue to float and only intervene to
reduce excessive volatility. They consider such flexibility necessary to help support the
monetary policy objectives. In this context, the CBN would announce in advance the
calendar of its operations for each week so that market expectations are formed in a manner
that is conducive to the realization of the policy objectives. The authorities consider the
current level of the Naira to be consistent with external and domestic stability.
10.
Regarding the financial sector, the direct impact of the global financial crisis has been
well contained, and there is no direct exposure to toxic assets legacy. Foreign ownership in
the financial sector is very low, and reliance on foreign funding has been limited. However,
the large swing in oil prices, the resulting depreciation of the Naira, and reduced confidence
in domestic capital markets mounted pressures on the banking system. In this regard, the
CBN has responded swiftly and decisively to safeguard the financial system by providing
liquidity support. While there are some vulnerabilities with few banks in terms of high levels
of non-performing loans, banks overall are well-capitalized, liquid and profitable. The
authorities believe that the measures being taken by the CBN to enhance transparency and
disclosure on the part of the banks, including a framework for risk-based and consolidated
supervision, will improve assessment of potential risks and vulnerabilities in the financial
system.

Structural reforms
11.
The authorities are committed to maintaining ongoing structural reforms, including
improving governance, enhancing transparency, and creating an efficient fiscal regime to
maintain the growth momentum and reduce poverty. As part of the overall management of
oil wealth and revenue flows, the authorities are working on the necessary legislation to set
up a national Sovereign Wealth Fund in the medium-term. They are aware of the role of the
private sector in growing the economy, and in this regard measures to scale up the private
sector role are being phased in. They have set a goal for Nigeria to become one of the
world’s top 20 economies by the year 2020, and to raise per capita income to at least
US$4,000. In this regard, the authorities are in the process of developing, via a participatory
process, a comprehensive plan and strategies to achieve the Vision 2020 goals and to guide
the government’s medium-term development plans. Among others, this development plan is
expected to guide the country to reduce its dependence on oil and diversify the economy to
other key sectors, including modernizing agriculture and improving manufacturing
infrastructure. The Vision 2020 is expected to be finalized before the end of this year.
Conclusion
12.
Despite the difficult global economic and financial environment, Nigeria’s economy
has shown its resilience. Nigeria entered the global crisis from a position of strength. The
reforms undertaken over recent years have helped the economy, with oil savings, high
international reserves, and a well-capitalized banking system preventing the type of
economic crises Nigeria witnessed at the end of earlier oil price cycles. The authorities are
committed to continue with strong implementation of sound macroeconomic and structural
reform policies embarked upon since 2005, and which contributed to robust economic
performance. They, therefore, request continuous support of the Fund, other international
financial institutions, and development partners in their effort to strengthen macroeconomic
stability, restore high growth rates with low inflation for poverty reduction and attainment of
the MDGs.
