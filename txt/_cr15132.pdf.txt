KEY ISSUES
Switzerland has once again had to contend with capital flow volatility. Following the
exit from the exchange rate floor in mid-January 2015 and the subsequent appreciation
of the franc, the Swiss economy faces exchange rate overvaluation, slower near-term
growth, and deflation. Both growth and inflation are expected to recover gradually over
the medium term—to around 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively—as the economy
adjusts to the shock. However, this relatively benign scenario is subject to important
risks, most notably that operating in a low inflation environment may prove more
difficult than assumed in the central scenario.
Monetary and fiscal policies can support faster adjustment and reduce risks. Further
monetary easing via purchases of (mainly foreign) assets would help limit the near-term
growth slowdown, reduce risks related to low inflation, and lessen franc overvaluation.
Central bank communication should also be geared toward building an understanding
of policy objectives and ensuring that inflation expectations do not become entrenched
at low levels. Scope for fiscal policy to support aggregate demand is limited by
Switzerland’s fiscal rule and the small, open nature of Switzerland’s economy. That said,
fiscal policy can still support recovery by allowing automatic stabilizers to operate freely,
as allowed under the rule. The rule’s escape clause should be triggered in the event of a
severe downturn to allow discretionary fiscal stimulus, as monetary policy would likely be
overburdened in such a scenario.
The financial sector reform agenda should also be completed. The Swiss authorities
have made important progress in this regard, and further steps are planned. Specific
priorities, as laid out in last year’s Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update,
include raising the leverage ratios of the two large international banks, increasing public
disclosure of information on risk weights, reforming FINMA’s use of external auditors,
overhauling deposit insurance, and containing housing- and mortgage-related risks.
Over the medium term, Switzerland faces a number of structural challenges; the
authorities’ ongoing efforts to address them are welcome and should continue.
Priorities include adopting proposed pension reforms to ensure the sustainability of the
system for future generations; completing ongoing reforms of corporate taxation and
financial controls in ways that ensure full compliance with international initiatives aimed
at limiting money laundering and cross-border tax evasion and avoidance; and reducing
uncertainties related to future immigration policies and relations with the European
Union.

MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT
Switzerland has once again had to contend with capital flow volatility. Following the exit from the
exchange rate floor and the subsequent appreciation of the franc, the Swiss economy faces exchange
rate overvaluation, slower near-term growth, and deflation. Both growth and inflation are expected to
recover gradually over the medium term, to around 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively. However,
this relatively benign scenario is subject to important risks, most notably that operating in a low
inflation environment may prove more difficult than assumed in the central scenario.

A. Recent Developments
1.
The Swiss economy grew steadily in 2014. Output expanded by 2.0 percent, driven by
strong external demand and private consumption (Table 1, Figures 1–2). Solid growth narrowed the
output gap to around -0.3 percent, with capacity utilization nearing its historic average. The
unemployment rate stabilized at 3.2 percent.
2.

In 2015, the outlook shifted following the exit from the exchange rate floor.



The floor of 1.2 francs per euro, which had been in place since 2011, faced little pressure for
most of 2013–14. However, in late 2014 the Swiss National Bank (SNB) started intervening
heavily to defend the floor in response to increased capital inflows arising from a combination of
events, including anticipation of the European Central Bank’s quantitative easing program and
geopolitical turmoil in Europe. In response, in December 2014 the SNB announced a cut in the
interest rate on SNB deposits from zero to -0.25 percent (effective January 22, 2015), but
significant interventions were still required to maintain the exchange rate floor.



At the same time, the franc’s depreciation against the dollar since mid-2014 had reduced the
likelihood of franc overvaluation, raising risks that further intervention would ultimately result in
losses on the SNB’s balance sheet, which was approaching 90 percent of GDP. In addition, the
SNB was concerned that, once the magnitude of its interventions became public, speculation
about exit from the floor would mount, fueling a vicious cycle of rising inflows and a rapidly
growing balance sheet.



In this context, the SNB decided that the costs of maintaining the floor were no longer worth its
benefits. The SNB thus exited from the floor on January 15, 2015. It also announced a cut in its
effective policy rate from -0.25 percent to -0.75 percent (effective January 22, 2015). The policy
rate applies on deposits at the SNB that exceed a high threshold (for domestic banks, the
threshold is 20 times a bank’s required reserves as of the reporting period ending November 19,
2014; minus (plus) any increase (decrease) in cash held). In this way, the effect of negative
interest rates on bank profits is limited, while still creating incentives at the margin for agents to
shift out of franc deposits and thereby depreciate the franc.



Following significant intervention (purchases of roughly CHF 40 billion,1 or 6 percent of GDP)
during the subsequent two weeks, the franc has since hovered between 1.00 and 1.10 per euro,
with limited intervention since end-January.

Following the appreciation, nearterm growth indicators have weakened.
After exhibiting modest growth during 2012–
14, KOF survey indexes of the current and
future business climate have declined sharply
following the exit from the exchange rate
floor, as has manufacturing PMI. The current
climate index has sunk to its lowest level
since the 2009 recession.

CPI inflation down to -0.9 percent in March
2015, with positive inflation for domestically produced goods (0.3 percent) being more than offset
by sharply negative inflation for foreign goods (-4.3 percent). Measures of underlying inflationary
pressures were similarly contained at end-March—core inflation was -0.2 percent, and unit labor
cost growth remained muted near zero (Figure 3).
5.
The initial effects from negative interest rates and the exit from the exchange rate
floor on the financial sector appear to have been fairly limited. The stock market and stock
prices for major banks have returned to levels similar to those before the immediate sharp drop
following the exchange rate floor exit (Figures 4-5). Similarly, CDS spreads for the major banks have
not moved much. However, it is too early to

6.

The most affected parts of the financial sector are likely life insurers and private banks.



Life insurers have been under pressure due to a low-yield environment for several years now,
forcing them to make significant adjustments. As a result, they actually recorded stronger
positions, on average, in FINMA’s latest Solvency Stress Test (based on end-2013 data) relative
to two years earlier. Still, the recent drop in yields will create further challenges for life insurers,
and the authorities should remain vigilant and support consolidation as needed.



The same applies to private banks, which have significant revenue in foreign currency, but most
of their costs in Swiss franc. Moreover, private banks were already facing pressure from
international initiatives aimed at increasing transparency (e.g., the automatic exchange of tax
information and AML/CFT-related initiatives). So far, the fallout on smaller Swiss private banks
from the policy changes in 2015 appears to have been more limited than initially feared, but the
situation must be continuously monitored.

7.

The appreciation of the franc also had outward spillovers.



Franc appreciation affected several economies in Eastern Europe with a sizeable stock of francdenominated housing loans, notably Croatia and Poland, where such loans accounted for 6.3
and 7.7 percent of GDP, respectively. In general, the immediate macroeconomic impact of the
franc’s appreciation appears somewhat limited and is partly offset by lower franc interest rates;
however, the Croatian government temporarily prevented pass-through to borrowers by fixing
the applicable exchange rate at the pre-appreciation parity while a permanent solution is being
negotiated between banks and borrowers. The contained effect is also partly due to actions by
supervisors in some Eastern European countries to halt the provision of new franc-denominated
mortgages in recent years and to manage related risks. Hungary mandated the conversion of all
FX mortgages into domestic currency in November 2014.



The exit from the exchange rate floor might also have modest effects on aggregate demand in
other countries. In particular, the appreciation of the franc might increase external demand in
trading partners, though such effects are likely to be modest given the relatively small size of the
Swiss economy (only 0.5 percent of global GDP on a PPP basis). Any positive effects on
aggregate demand in trading partners may also be at least partially mitigated by higher interest
rates in these countries due to lessened SNB intervention to defend the floor.

B. External Assessment
8.
Switzerland has long run high current account surpluses. Over the last 15 years,
Switzerland’s current account surplus has averaged around 10 percent of GDP (Table 2 and Figure 6).
However, these surpluses are in some ways misleadingly high because they are driven by nontraditional flows, such as merchanting activities, commodity trading, financial and insurance services,
and net FDI earnings (Annex 1), that are highly affected by the operations of large multinationals,
financial firms, and wealthy foreigners for whom Switzerland is a desirable destination to centralize
income and assets—reflecting Switzerland’s economic stability and tax competitiveness, among
other factors—but whose savings may not be fundamentally Swiss. For example, Swiss multinational
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

SWITZERLAND

firms are often partly owned by foreigners through portfolio shares. Thus, a part of these companies’
retained earnings really belong to foreign shareholders, generating an upward statistical bias to the
current account of about 3 percent of GDP. Similarly, Switzerland, like other low-tax economies that
host large multinational corporations and their affiliates, is susceptible to attempts by those firms to
minimize their taxes by booking profits in the country, thereby inflating net exports and net
investment income, though such effects are difficult to quantify.
9.
Staff views Switzerland’s external position as having been broadly in line with
fundamentals in 2014, though this assessment is subject to high uncertainty.


The External Balance Assessment’s (EBA) current account regression methodology suggests a
current account norm for Switzerland of about 6¾ percent of GDP, reflecting Switzerland’s
financial center structure, demographics, and high per capita income. This norm is slightly below
preliminary estimates of Switzerland’s cyclically-adjusted current account surplus in 2014
(7½ percent of GDP), implying a slightly strong current account and slight undervaluation of the
exchange rate.



However, the EBA methodology does not

based on EBA methodologies (text table)
suggest a moderate degree of overvaluation,
not undervaluation. The lack of a trend in Switzerland’s net international investment position
(NIIP) to GDP ratio over the last 10 years (Table 2) also suggests that Switzerland’s large current
account surpluses do not result in explosive dynamics for the NIIP, whose large size is partly
explained by the volatility of capital flows.2



Adjusting for these considerations, staff assesses a current account gap for 2014 centered close
to zero. However, the uncertainty band is wide, with the estimated gap ranging
from -3½ percent of GDP to 2½ percent of GDP, reflecting the significant uncertainty
introduced by the various idiosyncrasies of Switzerland’s external statistics (Annex 1). Similarly,
staff assesses the franc to have been broadly in line with fundamentals in 2014, with this
assessment also subject to significant uncertainty.

Switzerland: EBA REER Analysis, 2014

2

The increase in Switzerland’s NIIP is less than its current account surplus in part because of the statistical bias noted
in paragraph 8. In particular, the retained earnings of Swiss multinational corporations boost Switzerland’s current
account, but not its NIIP because the foreign portfolio investment (FPI) claims of non-Swiss shareholders on the firm
rise in value to reflect the retained earnings.

C. Outlook and Risks
11.
The appreciated franc will weigh on growth during 2015–16, but the economy is
expected to recover over the medium term. Staff and consensus forecasts expect real GDP
growth to slow to around ¾ percent and 1¼ percent in 2015 and 2016, respectively, mainly due to
weaker net exports (Table 1). Unemployment is expected to rise only modestly (peaking at
3½ percent in 2015), as widespread use of short-time working arrangements in Switzerland lessens
the adverse impact of weaker demand on unemployment. The output gap, almost closed at end2014, is projected to widen in 2015. Over the medium term, this gap is expected to close and growth
is expected to rise gradually as the economy adjusts to the shock and as increasing divergence
between Switzerland’s monetary policy stance and that of some other major advanced economies
(due to a gradual increase in policy rates in the latter) helps ease appreciation pressure on the franc,
supporting recovery of external demand.
12.
Inflation is projected to trough in late 2015 before becoming slightly positive over the
medium term.


Headline inflation is projected to fall near -1½ percent by late 2015, as the gradual pass-through
from franc appreciation and lower commodity prices reaches peak effects. As these one-off
effects dissipate, inflation is projected to gradually rise back into positive territory by early 2017.



Assessing where exactly inflation will stabilize in the medium term is difficult, in part due to the
lack of market-based measures of inflation expectations. However, if one assumes that real
yields are similar to those in other safe havens (Germany, UK), then Switzerland’s nominal
government bond yields—which have recently set world-record lows (Figure 4)—imply that
markets expect inflation to be roughly 1 percent 3–4 years from now.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWITZERLAND



Similarly, an analysis of the recent
relationship between core inflation and
the output gap shows that the Phillips
curve crosses the vertical axis at around
½ percent, implying that steady-state
inflation expectations are anchored
around that level.

outcome consistent with the SNB’s definition of price stability of “less than 2 percent” inflation.

13.
However, this central scenario is subject to important risks (see Annex 2 for further
discussion of key risks).


Risks related to low inflation. One key risk is that operating in an environment of very low
inflation may prove more challenging than assumed in the central scenario. In particular, low
levels of inflation may make it difficult for monetary policy to reduce the real interest rate as
needed to ensure full employment, given constraints on further significant reductions in nominal
interest rates (i.e., “a liquidity trap”). Moreover, this risk may be higher than in previous periods
due to the global drop in equilibrium real interest rates over the last decade. Such difficulties
arising from low inflation may become especially acute if various risks to external demand (see
below and Annex 1) are realized. Low equilibrium rates of inflation also imply low equilibrium
nominal interest rates, posing challenges for some sectors such as defined-benefit pension plans
and life insurers, and may make relative wage and price adjustments more difficult due to
resistance to nominal wage and price cuts.



Uncertainty about EU relations and immigration. Last year’s vote to move away from the free
movement of labor with the EU has created substantial uncertainty about medium-term growth
prospects, as such a move may reduce labor force growth, restrict firms’ ability to recruit
personnel, increase the fiscal challenges of population aging, and reduce Swiss firms’ access to
EU markets if existing cooperation agreements with the EU are revised. This uncertainty may also
weigh on investment (see later section for further discussion of this issue).



Global economic environment. This risk goes in both directions. On one hand, downside
surprises to global growth and further bouts of market risk aversion (e.g., due to a protracted
period of turmoil in Greece or geopolitical events) could fuel franc appreciation and deflationary
pressures and reduce growth. On the other hand, growth in Europe and other advanced
economies could also surprise on the upside (e.g., due to a larger-than-expected boost from
lower oil prices), supporting a more competitive franc, faster Swiss growth, and a quicker exit
from deflation.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

SWITZERLAND



Financial Sector. The banking sector is highly globally interconnected; the largest banks (UBS
and Credit Suisse) remain highly leveraged in comparison with most other global systemically
important banks and still have large investment banking operations. Consequently, they could
be a source of outward spillovers and remain vulnerable to inward spillovers from instability in
global financial markets.



Housing Market. Though it has cooled recently, Switzerland’s house prices have had a rapid
run-up over the last decade, and mortgage debt is high as percent of GDP (see later section for
more details). The economy could thus be vulnerable to a sharp decline in house prices, which
would weaken household balance sheets and impede growth. Such a decline would also
adversely affect the banking and insurance industries, with their large respective exposures to
the mortgage market and real estate.

Authorities’ views
14.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of macroeconomic
developments and risks. They agreed that the franc was now overvalued. They also agreed that the
sharp appreciation of the franc has depressed growth prospects in the short run and presents a
challenge for the export sector, especially in those industries where the market power of Swiss firms
is limited. On the low-inflation environment, they noted that domestic inflation was still positive and
viewed the current deflation as a transitory phenomenon, driven by lower energy prices and
currency appreciation, and projected inflation to move back into positive territory over the medium
term. On spillovers to Eastern Europe from the franc’s appreciation, the SNB noted that the
authorities in Eastern Europe had been aware of risks related to franc-denominated mortgages for
some time.

MACROECONOMIC POLICIES: SUPPORTING
SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
Further monetary easing via purchases of (mainly foreign) assets and strong communication of the
SNB’s objective to boost inflation over the medium term could help lessen the near-term growth
slowdown, reduce risks of entrenching low inflation, and limit franc overvaluation. Scope for fiscal
policy to support aggregate demand is limited by Switzerland’s fiscal rule and the small, open nature
of its economy. That said, fiscal automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate freely, as allowed
under the rule, and the rule’s escape clause should be triggered in the event of a severe downturn to
allow discretionary fiscal stimulus. Pension and corporate tax reforms are key priorities for fiscal
structural reforms.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWITZERLAND

A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
15.
Further monetary easing would support
economic adjustment and reduce risks. The
output gap is expected to widen in the near term,
and the negative rates for both core inflation and
10-year bond yields suggest significant risks of a
protracted period of low inflation. In this context,
monetary easing would helpfully limit the growth
slowdown, reduce risks of inflation expectations
becoming anchored at low levels, and lessen
exchange rate overvaluation.
16.
However, with the policy rate already at
-0.75 percent, room for further conventional
easing appears limited. The policy rate should
remain at its current negative level for now, as this
helps ease franc appreciation pressures and
encourages domestic consumption and investment.
However, additional deep policy rate cuts could risk
adverse nonlinear effects, such as increased cash
hoarding. This in turn could reduce financial
intermediation and weaken monetary transmission
mechanisms. In this regard, the SNB has
appropriately intensified the monitoring of
depositors’ behavior. So far there are few signs of
significant cash hoarding.

17.
Monetary easing could instead be achieved via a pre-announced program of asset
purchases.


Purchases of foreign assets could help directly address deflationary pressures arising from the
overvalued exchange rate. The amount of foreign-asset purchases could be preannounced (e.g.,
X billion per month, to be continued until further notice) and adjusted as necessary to achieve
inflation objectives. Compared to the previous approach of setting the exchange rate floor,
fixing the quantity of foreign-asset purchases would not unduly suppress exchange rate
volatility, thereby reducing the risk of a “one-way bet” in the market. Fixing the quantity also
avoids an unlimited commitment of the SNB’s balance sheet. Compared to the current approach
of ad hoc interventions, pre-announced interventions might help signal monetary dovishness,
thereby raising inflation expectations, spurring franc depreciation, and further supporting higher
inflation.



Purchases of domestic assets could also be considered. However, the scope for such purchases
is more limited, given that domestic yields are already very low (yields are negative out to 12-

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

SWITZERLAND

year maturities as of late April) and given the limited supply of domestic assets. In particular, the
outstanding stock of federal government bonds is only 12 percent of GDP.
18.
The SNB could also further enhance communication and the articulation of its
monetary policy framework. The SNB’s decision to abandon the floor has created some
uncertainty about its monetary policy framework going forward. The SNB could therefore helpfully
elaborate on its medium-term monetary policy objectives. More specifically, it may be useful to
indicate a preference for moving inflation back near the upper end of the target range (i.e., closer to
2 percent) over the medium term, given the benefits to re-anchoring inflation expectations at higher
levels to avoid the complications of operating monetary policy at low levels of inflation.
19.
The SNB’s capital buffers should be kept in line with risks. The SNB’s balance sheet is
likely to remain large for a prolonged period, with large fluctuations in mark-to-market profits
(Table 3). Although a central bank’s main objective is to achieve price stability, not maximize profits,
the SNB could nonetheless encounter reputational problems if it incurred a large capital deficiency.
To reduce related risks to the SNB’s operations and independence, the SNB should continue to
prioritize provisioning over transfers to its distribution reserve and maintain a prudent profit
distribution policy.
Authorities’ views
20.
The SNB agreed with much of staff’s analysis, but preferred to see how the outlook
develops before taking further monetary policy action. The SNB agreed that monetary
conditions were too tight, the franc was overvalued, and preannounced purchases of foreign assets
was one option for further monetary easing. However, the SNB wanted to allow more time to see
how the outlook develops in both Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe before taking further
monetary policy action. On the communication strategy, the SNB did not see a strong case for
announcing a preference for moving inflation back near the upper end of the target range (i.e.,
closer to 2 percent) over the medium term. The SNB considers inflation in the range of 0–1 percent
to be consistent with its monetary policy framework and, therefore, does not share staff’s risk
assessment.

B. Fiscal Policy
21.
Switzerland’s fiscal rule has helped it maintain low deficits and debt. In place since
2003, Switzerland’s “debt brake” rule requires that the federal government budget be in structural
balance ex ante and that any ex post overruns be made up by running structural surpluses in
subsequent years. Parliament can temporarily suspend the debt-brake rule in cases of “exceptional
financial requirements” (e.g., war, severe recession) by a simple majority vote in both houses, but
this option has rarely been invoked. The federal rule and similar rules for cantons have helped keep
the budget in balance and helped limit general government gross debt to 46 percent of GDP at
end-2014 (Tables 4–5, Annex 3).
22.
The mission recommended continued compliance with the rule in the central scenario.
Suspending the rule in response to the mild growth slowdown envisaged in the central scenario
would set a precedent that could undermine the rule’s ability to restrict fiscal irresponsibility over

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWITZERLAND

the longer run. In addition, exchange rate overvaluation suggests that relying more heavily on
monetary, rather than fiscal, easing to boost demand should lead to better external balance. Fiscal
multipliers may also be small in Switzerland given its openness.
23.
However, fiscal policy should do what it can to support demand. In the central scenario,
fiscal automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully, as allowed by the rule. The authorities
should also avoid budgeting overperformance against the rule in 2016, as this would add an
unnecessary contractionary impulse. If a deep or prolonged recession materializes, discretionary
fiscal easing should be employed to support growth and inflation and avoid overburdening
monetary policy. Such easing could be achieved by temporarily suspending the rule under
established procedures.
24.
Pension reforms will help address longer-term fiscal challenges. Population aging is
projected to substantially increase fiscal costs related to pensions over the longer run. To help
address this challenge, the government has submitted a comprehensive reform proposal to
parliament. The reform includes measures to equalize retirement ages for men and women and to
reduce the rate at which pension savings are converted into pension annuities by reducing this
conversion rate from 6.8 to 6.0 percent per annum. In addition, the government has proposed to
increase VAT rates by 2 percentage points by 2029 to ensure more stable funding for the pension
system. Such reforms will help ensure the sustainability of the social safety net and its continued
availability for future generations. In relation to the second pillar, staff recommended reducing the
minimum guaranteed return on invested assets, as such returns have become more difficult to
achieve in the low interest-rate environment (Box 1).
25.
Switzerland has prepared a comprehensive corporate tax reform (Corporate Tax
Reform III). Switzerland has faced international pressure in recent years to reduce the favorable tax
treatment provided to multinational corporations in many cantons. In this context, the authorities
have developed a corporate tax reform, expected to be submitted to parliament this summer and
implemented by 2019, that intends to reform special tax regimes that give more favorable treatment
to income from foreign operations than income from domestic operations. As this will in some cases
result in a net revenue loss, the federal government has proposed to provide fiscal support to
cantons to assist the reform—the current estimate of the needed transfer is approximately
¼ percent of GDP. Staff welcomed efforts to reduce distortions in the corporate tax code and
encouraged the authorities to finalize the reform in ways that are consistent with ongoing
international initiatives to counter base erosion and profit shifting.
Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities emphasized the value of the fiscal rule and the importance of pension
and corporate taxation reforms. The authorities agreed that automatic fiscal stabilizers should
operate freely and saw no need for discretionary fiscal stimulus, including because the expected
growth slowdown was expected to be limited. The authorities also indicated that they did not expect
budgetary overperformance to occur either this year or next. They instead emphasized the
importance of structural fiscal reforms, especially those related to pensions and corporate taxation.
On the minimum guaranteed rate of return, the authorities noted that it is reviewed each year on a
regular schedule and the next review will be undertaken in the autumn of 2015.

Box 1. Guaranteed Rate of Return in Swiss Pension Funds
The Swiss pension system consists of three pillars. The first pillar is universal old age, survivors,
and disability insurance. Currently, the age of retirement is 65 years for men and 64 years for
women. It is a pay-as-you-go system, financed by contributions from employees and employers
(both pay 4.2 percent of the employee’s income). The second pillar consists of fully funded,
occupation-based pension plans. These are compulsory for employees and financed by both
employees and employers. Contributions depend on the rules of the individual pension fund, but
the contribution of the employer must be at least as large as the contribution of the employee.
The third pillar includes private voluntary pension schemes.
Guaranteed nominal rate of return.
Swiss pension funds that operate in the
5
second pillar are required to provide their
4
members with a guaranteed rate of return
on members’ invested assets. The rate of
3
return is not constant and is determined
2
administratively each year. During 2003–
09, the average nominal required rate
1
broadly matched the average yield on 100
year Swiss government bonds. However,
-1
after 2010, the required rate has not
declined in line with declines in headline
-2
inflation, resulting in a large increase in
required real returns. In 2015, the real
guaranteed return stands around
3 percent—by far the highest in the last decade.

Consequences of the high required rate of return. A too-high guaranteed rate of return risks
the insolvency of pension funds and may also encourage them to take excessive risks. It could also
lead to refunding, in which both employers and employees are required to pay additional funds
and/or pension benefits are reduced to restore solvency.
Policy advice. In the short run, consideration should be given to lowering the nominal
guaranteed rate of return when it next comes up for review later this year to bring it more into
line with market yields. Eventually, consideration could also be given to linking the nominal
guaranteed rate of return more closely and automatically to market-based measures of achievable
returns.

COMPLETING FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM
The financial sector reform agenda, as laid out in last year’s FSAP, should also be completed. Priorities
include raising the leverage ratios of the two large international banks to safer levels, increasing public
disclosure of information on risk weights, reforming FINMA’s use of external auditors, overhauling
deposit insurance, and ensuring that risks related to housing and mortgage markets are contained.

A. The Big Banks
27.
Switzerland’s two global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) have continued their
strategic adjustments, and their balance sheets appear strong by many metrics. Both banks
have met the 10 percent minimum CET1 capital ratio required under Swiss Too-Big-To-Fail
legislation well in advance of the 2019 deadline and are in line with or comfortably above the
average ratio for other G-SIBs. Both banks are above the Liquidity Coverage Ratio minimum of
100 percent, effective in 2015 in Switzerland, and had, based on a not-yet-final methodology,
estimated Net Stable Funding Ratios above 100 percent as of spring 2014. The NSFR is not yet part
of Swiss regulation but planned to be introduced in 2016. Both banks have remained profitable in
2014, though substantial provisions for litigation and regulatory issues (e.g., those related to
foreign-exchange market manipulation, U.S. and other cross-border tax matters, and legacy issues
related to the sale of residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. mortgage crisis fines and
penalties) weighed on the results.
28.
However, there are still important areas for further improvement, as identified by last
year’s FSAP (Annex 4).


These banks’ leverage ratios are above current regulatory minima. However, their ratios remain
low by international standards (Table 6, Figure
G-SIB Basel III Tier 1 Leverage Ratios, 2014Q4
5, and text chart). Given the risks to the Swiss
(Median, Percent)
economy posed by the large size of these
6
banks, the authorities should tighten
5
minimum leverage ratio requirements for GSIBs to ensure that they are more ambitious
4
than international minima and that the quality
3
of capital is aligned with or more demanding
3
than international standards. In addition, the
2
authorities should encourage the large banks
1
to further strengthen their capitalization,
including multi-year plans to increase their
0
leverage ratios, and promote conservative
CHE
Europe
US
dividend policies to bolster the capital base.4
Sources: Bank Reports; and IMF staff calculations.

3

The current Swiss Too-Big-To-Fail framework was to a large extent formulated before many of details of Basel III
had been worked out; consequently, some capital definitions are not aligned.
4

Dividend plans compared to earnings per share are fairly high for the Swiss G-SIBs compared to other G-SIBs,
although part of the dividends will be scrip dividends (dividends paid in shares, which does not deplete capital).



The authorities should also vigilantly challenge risk weights from internal ratings-based models
and increase banks’ disclosure requirements regarding capital-weights to enhance transparency
and bolster understanding of, and credibility in, banks’ soundness and business strategies.



Continued action is needed to improve the resolvability of the G-SIBs through strengthened
cross-border coordination and further restructuring. Given the global reach of these banks,
reaching agreements with partner supervisors is critical. While both banks have made structural
changes, including by organizing through holding companies, and have updated their global
recovery and resolution plans in 2014 to improve their resolvability, this process needs to
continue to further improve resolvability.



The authorities must also continue to proactively address operational risks by intense
supervision of risk management practices and provisioning, to avoid and mitigate effects from
negative surprises related to, for example, trading activities and investigations of tax evasion or
money laundering.

29.

Encouragingly, the authorities are moving to address these concerns.



One important element is the follow-up to recommendations related to Too-Big-To-Fail (TBTF)
in the December 2014 report of the “Group of Experts on the Further Development of the
Financial Market Strategy,” or the “Brunetti Report”.5 Recommendations included recalibration of
capital requirements and adjustments to capital quality, and the Federal Council has instructed
the Federal Department of Finance (FDF) to formulate concrete legislative proposals in this area.
The details are yet to be worked out, but it is generally expected that that requirements on
capital ratios, including leverage, will be set high, and that capital quality will be adjusted to be
at least as stringent as international standards.



The authorities are adopting international standards related to increased disclosure regarding
risk weights and are involved in international initiatives to strengthen standards further. This is
welcome, but in the possible absence of significant progress internationally, the Swiss authorities
should stand ready to take the lead and heighten disclosure requirements.



Regarding resolution, the authorities are cooperating with foreign supervisors and expect to
conclude cooperation agreements on crisis management with the Crisis Management Group
members for the Swiss G-SIBs. This would be an important step, but the details remain to be
seen and assessed.

Authorities’ views
30.
The authorities generally agreed with staff’s assessment and recommendations, but
stressed caveats on several issues. Support appeared broad among the authorities for raising the
leverage ratio to more ambitious levels and for increasing public disclosure requirements for risk
weights in internal risk models. FINMA also emphasized that it is closely monitoring the calculation
of risk weights and has taken action when shortcomings have been observed, including by
introducing multipliers and a moratorium on capital-reducing model changes. FINMA agreed with
the need for banks to continue building capital, but cautioned that an overly conservative dividend
policy might hinder banks’ ability to attract equity capital. On resolvability, the authorities fully
recognize that the work to make the G-SIBs resolvable is not finished, but stressed that progress in
recent years has been substantial. On conduct risks, FINMA explained that related supervision and
enforcement efforts are being stepped up, which in combination with large investments in these
banks to control these risks could help reduce adverse events going forward.

B. Broader FSAP Recommendations
31.
Switzerland continues to take measures to strengthen its financial sector more
generally, including with respect to key FSAP update recommendations (Annex 4). Such efforts
are important not only for Switzerland, but also to promote global financial stability, given the
prominent role of the Swiss banking and insurance sectors. Still, the FSAP update was concluded
only a year ago, and many of the reforms are work in progress. Thus, continued efforts are needed
to further strengthen the post-crisis transition to a safer financial sector.
32.
The authorities are therefore encouraged to complete the financial sector reform
agenda, as laid out in last year’s FSAP update. The TBTF policies (discussed above) and policies to
contain the potential build-up of risks in the domestic real estate and mortgage markets (discussed
below) are important policy areas in this regard. Other priority measures going forward include the
following.


Continue to refine FINMA’s use of external auditors. FINMA has taken regulatory measures to
strengthen its guidance to external auditors. This is encouraging, and implementation must be
forceful to validate the work of the auditors and ensure supervisory harmonization across
entities. FINMA also reports that it has intensified its direct supervisory activities, including onsite inspections, and resources will be redirected to further strengthen these supervisory
activities. However, more resources for FINMA may still be needed, as pointed out by the FSAP
and for which there are no plans. The use of external auditors could also be strengthened by
paying auditors from a FINMA-managed, bank-financed fund rather than by the bank that is
being audited to avoid conflicts of interest, and by periodically rotating auditing firms.



Overhaul deposit insurance. The governance of the deposit insurance scheme should be
reformed to make it more independent by substantially limiting the influence of the banking
industry in its board. Dedicated ex ante funding with a back-up line of support should also be
built up to strengthen access to funds and confidence in case of bank failures. The Brunetti

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

SWITZERLAND

Report has encouraging recommendations in this direction, and the authorities should take
steps to reform the scheme accordingly. In addition, deposit insurance funds should be made
available to finance resolution measures on a least-cost basis.
Authorities’ views
33.
The authorities emphasized that they are taking many steps for financial sector reform
and that many of the FSAP update recommendations would be implemented. Regarding
banking supervision, FINMA explained that they are working hard to further strengthen the
management of the use of external auditors. They do not see a need for a substantial increase in the
overall resource envelope unless new statutory tasks are assigned to FINMA. Rather, further
reallocation within FINMA would be sufficient. FINMA agreed that reforming how external auditors
are being paid to reduce conflicts of interest could be helpful, but was more skeptical about the
benefit from mandatory rotation of auditors, as it is an oligopoly market with few firms available. On
deposit insurance, the Federal Council has taken note of the Brunetti Report and will decide on how
to proceed with the expert group's recommendations at a later date.

C. Housing Market

35.
These measures appear to have had
some effect, as housing and mortgage markets
show some signs of cooling. The growth rate of
residential real estate prices has eased both for
owner-occupied apartments and single family
houses, including in areas, such as Lake Geneva,
that previously saw rapid house price growth
(Figure 7). Mortgage growth has also decelerated,
although this effect is less pronounced (text
chart). Similarly, price-to-rent and price-to-income

The Swiss authorities have
undertaken various prudential measures
over the last three years aimed at reducing
housing-related risks. Swiss household debt
(mainly mortgages) is high by international
standards, and mortgage debt has been rising
steadily since 2008, in tandem with a buoyant
housing market (Figure 7). To reduce related
financial stability risks, the authorities have
undertaken a number of prudential measures,
including strengthened bank “self-regulation”
standards approved by FINMA, effective
September 2014 (Box 2).

ratios have started to stabilize (Figure 7). The percent of new mortgages for owner-occupied real
estate with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 80 percent have also been on a declining trend. As the
authorities have taken a range of measures to address the risk of a build-up of imbalances in the
housing and mortgage markets, it is difficult to clearly disentangle which have been the most
effective. However, the consensus view among the authorities and banks was that the required
down payment from the borrower's own funds (not funded by using pension savings) has perhaps
been the most important measure.
Box 2. Measures to Reduce Housing- and Mortgage-Related Risks
Revised minimum requirements for mortgages, drawn up by the Swiss Bankers Association and
approved by FINMA, effective mid-2012:



Mortgages must entail a down payment of at least 10 percent of the lending value of the property
from the borrower's own funds, which may not be obtained by pledging or early withdrawal of
Pillar 2 pension assets.



Mortgages must be paid down to two-thirds of the lending value of the mortgage within a
maximum of 20 years.

FINMA tightened rules for risk-weighting new and renewed mortgages for banks applying an
internal ratings-based approach, effective 2013.
Federal Council measures, effective 2013:



Mortgages that do not comply with the new minimum standards are allowed, but subject to a risk
weight of 100 percent.



Mortgages exceeding 80 percent of the property value will have a risk weight of 100 percent
applied to the part of the loan exceeding the 80 percent threshold.

On the SNB’s proposal, the Federal Council activated the countercyclical capital buffer (CCB). The
CCB applies to risk-weighted positions associated to residential property mortgages in Switzerland.
The CCB was activated to a level of 1 percent (to be met in the form of CET1) capital by end–
September 2013 and raised to 2 percent in January 2014, to be fulfilled by end-June 2014.
Amended minimum standards for mortgage financing issued by the Swiss Bankers Association
and approved by FINMA, effective September 1, 2014:



The amortization period for repayment down to two-thirds of the lending value of the mortgage
was shortened from 20 years to 15 years. Moreover, the loan must now be repaid in regular
tranches of an equal amount from the start.



Stricter use of second incomes when assessing financial sustainability.



For future lending, real estate values must now be based on the market value or the purchase
price, whichever is lower.

36.
However, the cooling of mortgage-related risks is still tentative and partial. Mortgage
debt is high and still rising as a percent of GDP, and loan-to-income ratios on new mortgages have
not yet declined. It is thus important to continue monitoring housing and mortgage-related risks
closely and to fully enforce existing regulations and minimum standards, especially given recent
interest rate cuts for SNB sight deposits, which could re-ignite mortgage demand. If risks are not
reduced or re-accelerate, tighter and more binding prudential measures, such as explicit limits on
the percent of new mortgages that can exceed a given debt-service-to-income and/or debt-toincome ratio should be adopted. Likewise, efforts to address concentration and interest-rate risks, as
identified by the SNB in its most recent Financial Stability Report, may need to be stepped up via
Pillar 2 measures, including, if necessary, additional capital charges.

Authorities’ views
37.
The authorities believe their measures have had some effect, but are still concerned, as
imbalances are still large and have not fallen substantially. Consequently, they agree that further
policy action may be warranted, in particular to target affordability and the income-producing real
estate sector. However, they also emphasized that the effects of measures are lagged, as can be
seen from the experience in recent years, and it is therefore appropriate to let the measures
announced in mid-2014 work through the system first. The SNB, furthermore, explained that, if
imbalances appear set to increase further, an upward adjustment of the CCB could be proposed.
FINMA also emphasized that they carefully analyze interest rate and concentration risks of banks
and that they in several instances have taken action to reduce risks in individual institutions.

STRUCTURAL ISSUES
38.
A referendum in February 2014 obliges the government to set unspecified limits on
immigration from the EU by 2017. Tight limits could hurt Switzerland’s growth potential by
restricting the availability of highly-skilled foreign labor. Limits on immigration are also incompatible
with agreements with the EU, which would have the right to respond by terminating Swiss-EU
bilateral agreements. Such actions would severely constrain Swiss companies’ access to EU markets,
which account for over half of Switzerland’s exports and three-quarters of its imports. A constructive
resolution to this uncertainty would help underpin near-term economic recovery and support longterm growth.
39.
Switzerland continues progress toward implementation of international standards for
AML/CFT and the transparency and exchange of information on tax matters. In December
2014, parliament approved a bill aimed at implementing the 2012 Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
Recommendations. The FATF is now in the process of assessing these measures, and it will be
important for the Swiss authorities to ensure full compliance, particularly with regard to
transparency of legal persons and arrangements, tax crimes, and politically exposed persons. In
January 2015, the Federal Council embarked on consultations on the ratification of the Multilateral
Convention and on the legal framework for the implementation of the reporting standard on
automatic exchange of information. The parliamentary process in this regard is expected to begin in
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

SWITZERLAND

mid-2015, possibly followed by a referendum, with the relevant laws expected to be in place by
2017. Staff welcomes this progress and encourages the authorities to forcefully implement the FATF
and Global Forum standards in order to protect the integrity of Switzerland as an international
financial center.
40.
Structural reforms should continue to ensure long-run sustainable growth. OECD and
World Bank Doing Business reports indicate scope for further improvement in areas such as
facilitating full-time labor participation of women (e.g., reducing child care costs and marginal tax
rates on second earners) and improving access and equity in education, both of which could help
boost growth.

The authorities broadly shared staff’s views on structural issues. The authorities agreed
that uncertainty over the immigration reform and EU relationships would not encourage investor
sentiments. The policy goal is to preserve bilateral agreements with the EU, while building a
sustainable immigration policy that would contribute to balanced growth. The implementation of
OECD and FATF recommendations is underway, and the authorities are committed to launching
automatic exchange of information with partner states starting in 2018. The authorities also agreed
with staff’s view that there remains scope to enhance women’s full-time labor participation.

STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
Economic growth in Switzerland is likely to slow in the near term while inflation
becomes more negative. Switzerland’s economy has performed relatively well in the aftermath of
the global financial crisis. However, exchange rate appreciation in early 2015 has likely left the Swiss
franc overvalued and weakened the near-term outlook. In particular, GDP growth is expected to
ease to around ¾ percent in 2015, mainly due to weaker net exports. The strong franc, together
with lower oil prices, is also likely to drive inflation down to well past -1 percent by late 2015.

43.
Over the medium term, the economy is expected to recover gradually, but uncertainty
around this central scenario is wide. As the economy adjusts to the exchange rate appreciation,
growth is projected to rise gradually back to around 2 percent over the medium term while inflation
increases to around 1 percent. However, this scenario is subject to important risks, including risks
related to very low inflation, uncertainty about EU relations and immigration, global and regional
economic developments, the effects of ongoing changes in the international financial regulatory
landscape, and the potential for price reversals in the housing market.
44.
Further monetary easing would support adjustment and reduce risks. Easing would help
limit the near-term growth slowdown and lessen exchange rate overvaluation. Boosting inflation
closer to 2 percent over the medium term would also reduce risks associated with operating in a
low-inflation environment.
45.
Monetary easing could perhaps be achieved via a program of pre-announced asset
purchases. Such purchases could consist of foreign-currency assets—and perhaps some domestic
assets, though scope for this is more limited—with the pace of purchases adjusted as necessary in
response to developments. In addition, the policy rate should be maintained at its current negative
level for now, as this has been helpful in reducing franc appreciation and deflationary pressures.
Central bank communication should also be geared toward building an understanding of policy
objectives and ensuring that inflation expectations do not become entrenched at low levels. In
particular, it may be useful to indicate a preference for moving inflation back near the upper end of
the target range (i.e., closer to 2 percent) over the medium term. The SNB should also prioritize
provisioning over transfers to its distribution reserve to ensure that its capital remains in line with
risks.
46.
Fiscal policy can also support recovery. In the central scenario, automatic stabilizers
should be allowed to operate fully, as allowed under Switzerland’s debt-brake rule, which has served
Switzerland well. Overperformance against the rule should also be avoided, as this would add an
unnecessary contractionary impulse. If the economic slowdown is significantly more severe or
protracted than envisaged, discretionary fiscal stimulus could also be employed by triggering the
rule’s temporary escape clause to help boost growth and inflation and avoid overburdening
monetary policy.
47.
Pension reforms will help address longer-term fiscal challenges. Population aging is
projected to substantially increase fiscal costs related to pensions and healthcare over the longer
run. The government’s pension reform proposals will help address this challenge and help ensure
the sustainability of the social safety net and its continued availability for future generations.
48.
Continued structural reforms will help support medium-term growth potential. A top
priority in this regard is to achieve a constructive resolution to the uncertainty about EU relations
and immigration. Efforts to reform corporate taxation and implement AML/CFT reforms and

countermeasures. Reforms to boost full-time female labor force participation, such as lowering
marginal tax rates on second incomes, could also boost potential growth over the medium term.

Continuing the financial sector reform agenda will strengthen the system’s soundness
and resilience. Important progress has been made over the last year, including measures to tighten
lending standards for mortgages, which appear to have supported some reduction in mortgagerelated risks. However, additional financial sector reforms can be undertaken to further strengthen
financial sector regulation and supervision. In this regard, the authorities’ plans to adopt further
measures along the lines of those recommended in the Brunetti Report are encouraging. In this
context and in line with FSAP update recommendations, the authorities are encouraged to:


Continue to monitor closely financial stability risks related to Switzerland’s housing market and
its high levels of mortgage debt. If risks do not decline, consider tighter and more binding
prudential measures, such as explicit limits on the percent of new mortgages that can exceed a
given debt-service-to-income or debt-to-income ratio.



Press the largest banks to continue rapidly bringing their leverage ratios into line with other
large international banks and raise minimum leverage ratio requirements to more ambitious
levels.



Continue to refine FINMA’s use of external auditors, including by periodically rotating auditing
firms; providing more guidance on their supervisory focus; paying auditors from a FINMAmanaged, bank-financed fund rather than by the bank that is being audited to avoid conflicts of
interest; and intensifying FINMA’s own onsite inspections, including by increasing the number of
deep dives.



Increase banks’ disclosure requirements regarding capital-weights to enhance transparency and
bolster understanding of, and credibility in, banks’ soundness and business strategies.



Continue to monitor closely the possible effects on the financial sector of the recent exchange
rate appreciation and low interest-rate environment. The second factor is particularly important
for life insurers and defined-benefit pension plans. To ensure the sustainability of the latter, the
minimum guaranteed rate of return that applies to some plans and that is established by the
government should be reduced to bring it into line with market rates.



Overhaul the deposit insurance scheme to bring it into line with emerging international best
practices, including by building up dedicated ex-ante funding with a back-up credit line from the
authorities, reforming the scheme’s governance so that a majority of board members are
independent of the banking industry, and allowing the scheme to finance resolution measures.



Continue discussions with international counterparts to reach agreement on measures to make
the largest banks resolvable without public-sector support.

Annex I. Switzerland: External Sector Assessment1
Much of Switzerland’s current account surplus is accounted for by nontraditional factors, such as
merchanting profits, net exports of financial/insurance services, and a statistical bias due to the
treatment of retained earnings of multinationals with large foreign ownership. These factors reflect
Switzerland’s role as a global hub for commodity trading, wealth management, and multinational
corporations (MNCs), which in turn boosts reported Swiss income and savings, even though some of
this saving may not be fundamentally Swiss. In addition, the SNB reported significant earnings on its
large foreign exchange reserves built up in response to post-crisis safe-haven inflows. Stripping away
these nontraditional factors reveals a much more modest “underlying” current account balance that is
consistent with evidence on the overvaluation of the Swiss franc. The sharp decline in the current
account in 2014 (linked to a decline in net income from abroad) highlights the importance of adjusting
for these nontraditional factors for purposes of Swiss external assessments.

A.

Stylized Facts about the Swiss Current Account

1.
At 9.2 percent of GDP in 2012–14,
Switzerland’s current account surplus
appears high by international standards,
but not by its own. As can be seen, the Swiss
current account surplus averaged just over
10 percent of GDP during 2000–14 and
reached or exceeded 14 percent of GDP in
2004, 2006, and 2010.
2.
The structure of the Swiss current
account is complex, with “nontraditional”
items accounting for a large fraction of the
surplus (Annex Table 1).



The statistical treatment of retained earnings of MNCs with substantial foreign ownership
generates an upward bias in the current account. In particular, under balance of payments
accounting rules, all retained earnings of Swiss MNCs are reported as net FDI income for
Switzerland, even if foreign shareholders have a claim on those earnings. Because Swiss MNCs
distribute less of their earnings to their foreign shareholders than foreign MNCs distribute to
their Swiss shareholders, this biases the Swiss current account upwards. In Switzerland, the bias
is estimated at approximately 3 percent of GDP in 2014. The attraction of Switzerland as a base
for MNCs also partly explains Switzerland’s high NIIP (Annex Figure 1) .



The 2012–14 goods balance of +7.2 percent of GDP mostly reflects net exports of goods under
merchanting, i.e. profit made on goods bought and sold offshore by Swiss merchanting firms.

SWITZERLAND



The 2012–14 services balance of +3.2 percent of GDP was more than fully accounted for by
financial and insurance services, reflecting Switzerland’s role as one of the world’s leading wealth
management centers.



Although the 2012–14 income balance was -1.3 percent of GDP, it masks large positive net
investment earnings of 4¾ percent of GDP, which are offset by even larger negative labor and
secondary income balances. Much of large positive net investment earnings are due to the
statistical bias explained in the first bullet above.

3.
This complexity sets apart the Swiss current account from those of many other major
economies with large surpluses. Factors such as merchanting, financial and insurance services, net
FDI earnings, and income on FX reserves only play a marginal role in the current account dynamics
of other major economies with large surpluses, e.g. Germany (Annex Figure 2). The same factors
seem to play a larger role in some smaller economies that—like Switzerland—offer competitive tax
regimes and host important financial centers.
4.
The Swiss current account exhibits large volatility that is largely unrelated to
movements in the real exchange rate and global demand. The standard deviation of the Swiss
surplus, computed over the last decade, is 4 percentage points of GDP, one of the highest among
advanced economies (Annex Figure 3). Some of this volatility comes from fluctuations in net exports
of nonmonetary gold and merchanting (which are strongly correlated with international gold and
commodity price movements), and some from financial and insurance services (which respond
strongly to global financial shocks). As shown in Annex Table 1, most of the volatility comes from
net investment income, in particular net FDI receipts. The latter, which are an outcome of the
complex activities of MNCs based out of Switzerland (and motivated sometimes by tax optimization
objectives), are difficult to estimate, with official revisions between first estimates and final accounts
averaging 3 percentage points of GDP in the last four years. An example of the current account’s
high volatility is the decline in its surplus from 10.7 percent of GDP in 2013 to 7.0 percent of GDP in
2014, which can be accounted for by the nontraditional factors. The decline in the current account
balance occurred despite a stable REER and relatively stable domestic and foreign demand.
5.
The association between the Swiss REER and the current account surplus is mild.
Movements in the exchange rate are likely to have some effects on export/import volumes of some
traditional goods and on cross-border trade. Consequently, the appreciation in 2015 is likely to
adversely affect near-term growth, as noted in the main text. However, the dominance of
nontraditional items in the current account and their volatility mean that the year-to-year
relationship between the REER and the current account is mild, as the nontraditional items
dominating the Swiss current account are unlikely to be highly exchange-rate sensitive. In addition,
even many of the “traditional” items in the trade balances may be less exchange rate-sensitive in
Switzerland than in other economies due to tax optimization strategies contaminating intra-MNC
cross-border trade. Annex Figure 4 confirms the mild association between movements in the Swiss
REER (CPI basis) in a given year and current account-to-GDP changes in the following year.

Assessment of the Swiss Current Account and Real Exchange Rate

6.
Staff views Switzerland’s external position as having been broadly in line with
fundamentals in 2014, though this assessment is subject to high uncertainty. This judgment
reflects a balance of a number of factors, including the EBA current account norm estimates, EBA
REER overvaluation estimates, and special Swiss-specific factors, as elaborated upon in the main text
(paragraphs 8–10), this previous section of this annex, and the draft country page for the 2015
External Sustainability Report (see below). Consistent with this view, staff assesses the franc to have
been broadly in line with fundamentals in 2014, with this assessment also subject to significant
uncertainty.
7.
The appreciation in early 2015 is likely to weaken the external position and to have
left the franc overvalued. As of April 2015, the REER has appreciated by about 10 percent relative
to its average 2014 value. This appreciation is likely to reduce net exports due to lessened
competiveness and has likely left the franc overvalued. This overvaluation partly reflects a policy gap
of insufficiently easy monetary policy—simple Taylor rules suggest an optimal policy rate well below
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWITZERLAND

current levels—which in turn reflects various operational challenges associated with unconventional
monetary policy (see monetary policy discussion in main text).
8.
Further insights for the Swiss external sector assessment can be obtained by stripping
nontraditional components from the Swiss surplus and focusing on an “underlying” measure
of the current account. Note that we are adopting a slightly different approach here than used in
the EBA, in that the EBA assumes that all economies’ current accounts are comparable, while making
a 2½ percent of GDP adjustment for three financial center economies. This approach is somewhat
unsatisfactory, given that, in the Swiss case, net exports of merchanting and finance/insurance
services alone add up to 7 percent of GDP in 2014. In our approach, therefore, we adjust the Swiss
current account for nontraditional items in a consistent manner over time, producing three
definitions of “core current account” (bottom 3 rows of Annex Table 1):


The narrow definition sums the (i) goods balance less merchanting and nonmonetary gold net
exports; (ii) services balance less finance and insurance services and patents/license fees; and
(iii) income balance less all net investment income. As can be seen, during 2000-14 this balance
averaged -1.4 percent of GDP, with a low volatility of 1.2 percentage points of GDP.



The medium definition adds to the narrow definition the excluded services net exports (finance,
insurance, and patent/license fees), as it could be argued that this income accrues to Swiss
residents as remuneration for providing services that the Swiss economy has built a comparative
advantage in over a period of decades. This balance averaged 3.9 percent of GDP over 2000–14,
with a volatility of 1.8 percentage points of GDP.



The broad definition adds to the medium definition one-half of X, where X is net investment
income excluding income earned on the SNB’s foreign exchange reserves. This definition treats
half of the foreign assets owned by Swiss corporate and individual citizens as reliably Swiss, with
the other half seen as representing decisions by globally mobile firms and individuals to invest
their wealth via Switzerland for security and stability, tax optimization, or other reasons. This
balance averaged 6.5 percent of GDP over 2000–14, with a volatility of 2.6 percentage points of
GDP.

9.
These smaller and relatively stable “core balances” lend further support to the
overvaluation of the REER. The sizes of the core surpluses are small; in fact, the cleanest measure
(“narrow” definition) shows an average deficit of 1.4 percent of GDP over 2000–14 and a consistent
widening of this deficit since 2008 (cumulatively 4.2 percentage points of GDP). The medium and
broad definitions of the core surplus also undershoot the estimated EBA norm.
10.
Switzerland’s central bank reserves are large by most metrics, but partly reflect the
high volatility of its capital flows. As a percent of GDP, Switzerland’s reserves are some of the
highest among advanced economies, but similar to those of other financial centers (Hong Kong SAR,
Singapore). However, relative to bank debt, Switzerland’s reserves are not as high as in some other
small, open economies.

Annex Table 1. The Structure of the Swiss Current Account Balance (2000–14)

Switzerland: Draft Page for the 2015 External Sustainability Report
Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Current account

Background. Switzerland is a financial center with a positive NIIP of about 120 percent of GDP and large gross foreign
asset and liability positions of 624 and 504 percent of GDP, respectively. The NIIP to GDP ratio has been volatile with no
significant trend over the last 10 years, despite large current account surpluses. The ratio is projected to rise moderately in
the medium term as recent exchange rate appreciation contributes to a wider output gap and significant inflation
undershooting, both of which will temporarily depress nominal GDP growth. Over the longer run, the ratio is expected to
stabilize and then decline modestly.
Assessment. Switzerland’s large gross liabilities and the volatility of its capital flows present risks, but these are mitigated
by Switzerland’s large net asset position and foreign reserves.
Background. Switzerland has a moderate to large CA surplus, dominated by net investment income and goods balance.
Preliminary estimates from the authorities indicate a surplus of 7 percent of GDP in 2014, down from 11 percent in 2013,
reflecting mainly a decline in primary income. Correcting for net foreign ownership of FDI retained earnings and other
factors (e.g., merchanting exports) that have a tangential relation to the real Swiss economy would further reduce the
“true” CA surplus.1/
Assessment. The EBA CA regression approach estimates a CA gap of around 0.7 percent of GDP, reflecting a cyclicallyadjusted current account surplus of 7.5 percent of GDP and an EBA CA regression-estimated norm of 6.8 percent of GDP.
However, Switzerland’s current account surplus is misleadingly high because it is driven by non-traditional flows—such as
merchanting activities, commodity trading, financial and insurance services, and net FDI earnings—that are highly affected
by the operations of large multinationals, financial firms, and wealthy foreigners, whose savings may not be fundamentally
Swiss. The CA assessment is subject to unusually high uncertainty, given these anomalies, the high volatility of income
flows, and the potential for large revisions to the preliminary 2014 CA estimate. Taking these considerations into account,
staff assesses a CA gap for 2014 ranging from -3.5 to 2.5 percent of GDP. The CA gap is expected to become more
negative in the near term due to REER appreciation so in far in 2015, which will adversely affect competiveness.
Background. The REER (CPI basis) appreciated by 26 percent from 2007 to 2011. In September 2011, the SNB established
a floor of 1.20 for the CHF/EUR exchange rate, and the REER depreciated by 4 percent during 2011–14. The SNB exited
from the floor on January 15, 2015. As of April 2015, the REER has appreciated by about 10 percent from its average 2014
level.
Assessment. The EBA REER index and level regression-based estimates suggest that the average REER in 2014 was
overvalued by 11 and 13 percent, respectively, relative to its fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Taking into
consideration these estimates, the somewhat smaller estimates implied by staff’s CA assessment, and staff’s broader
analysis, staff assesses that the franc was broadly in line with fundamentals in 2014 (overvalued by 0–10 percent).
Overvaluation likely increased in 2015 due to the appreciation so far this year.

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and policy
measures

Background. Significant net outward FDI (mostly reinvested earnings) has been a consistent feature of the financial
account in recent years, although bank lending flows have become critical since the crisis. The SNB absorbed very large
safe-haven inflows (intermediated by the banking system) during 2009–12 through reserve accumulation.
Assessment. Safe-haven capital inflows may return in the event of a re-emergence of euro area stress, an intensification
of emerging market turmoil (including due to a disorderly UMP exit by major central banks), or political risks.

Overall Assessment:
In 2014, the underlying external
position was broadly consistent
with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable
policy settings.
This assessment takes into
account measurement
anomalies in the Swiss balance
of payments. After the
significant REER appreciation in
early 2015, the external position
will likely weaken.
Potential policy responses:
Monetary easing, perhaps via a
schedule of FX purchases (given
limited options for other
methods of monetary easing),
would help limit the near-term
growth slowdown, reduce risks
of inflation expectations
becoming anchored at low
levels, and lessen franc
overvaluation.

rate

Overall Assessment

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FX intervention
and reserves
level

Background. The SNB accumulated foreign exchange reserves of about 70 percent of GDP during 2009–14 in various
rounds of intervention, including to defend the CHF/EUR floor. At end-2014 the SNB’s balance sheet was approaching
90 percent of GDP. The SNB exited from the floor on January 15, 2015. The franc has since floated between 1.00–1.10
CHF/EUR, with the SNB intervening occasionally (mainly in the immediate aftermath of the exit from the floor).
Assessment. Reserves are large relative to GDP but more moderate relative to external liabilities. Substantial reserves are
explained in part by the volatility of capital flows. In recent years, interventions have been monetary policy operations
aimed at avoiding persistent inflation undershooting and given the limited supply of domestic assets available for
purchase. Interventions have also helped limit exchange rate overvaluation.

Technical
Background
Notes

1/ Swiss multinational firms are often partly owned by foreigners through portfolio shares. Thus, a part of the retained
earnings of these companies, which form a large component of Swiss current account receipts, should be attributed to
foreign shareholders, rather than counted as domestic income. See T. Mancini-Griffoli and N. Stoffels, “Adjusting the
Current Account to Better Capture Wealth Accumulation,” mimeo, SNB, August 2012. See also the discussion elsewhere in
this annex.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between
10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of
risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may
interact and materialize jointly.

Annex III. Switzerland: Debt Sustainability Analysis
Summary: Public debt sustainability risks remain subdued due to the strict implementation of fiscal
rules and the low stock of public debt.1
Baseline Scenario: The two main assumptions underlying the baseline scenario are a gradual but
steady recovery of economic growth and the continued adherence to federal and sub-federal fiscal
rules. Under the baseline scenario, public debt is projected to decline from 46 percent of GDP in
2015 to 41 percent of GDP in 2020. Gross financing needs are expected to remain around 10 percent
of GDP during the medium term.
Stress Tests: The main risk to debt dynamics is a negative growth shock. Other risks—for example,
an adverse interest rate shock or a shock to financing needs—affect the public debt trajectory only
to a minor extent.


Real GDP growth shock. Real GDP growth rates are assumed to be one standard deviation
(1.8 percent) below the baseline during 2015–16. Under this scenario, the debt-to GDP ratio
approaches 48 percent in 2017 (3 percentage points higher than the baseline).



Primary balance shock. The primary balance in 2015–16 is hit by a negative shock of
0.4 percent of GDP. This shock results in a debt-to-GDP ratio that is only slightly above the
baseline during 2015–20.



Real interest rate shock. The nominal interest rate increases by 200 basis points during
2015–20. The debt-to-GDP ratio increases only marginally in 2016 and continues declining
afterwards.



Real exchange rate shock. This scenario assumes that the nominal CHF/USD exchange rate
increases by 14 percent in 2016 relative to its 2015 level. As with other non-growth related
shocks, the impact of this shock on the trajectory of public debt is minor.



Combined shock. A simultaneous combination of the previous three shocks would result in
an increasing debt-to-GDP ratio that approached 48 percent in 2017 (approximately
3 percentage points higher than the baseline). However, after 2017, the debt would start
declining on a trajectory that is parallel to the one under the baseline scenario.

For the purpose of this analysis, the general government includes the federal government, cantonal governments,
municipal governments, and the social security fund.

Annex IV. Switzerland: FSAP Update—Status of Key
Recommendations
Recommendation

Actions taken by the authorities

Short term
Impose a leverage ratio on banks
that is tougher than international
minima.

In December, 2014, the final report of the “Group of Experts on the Further
Development of the Financial Market Strategy,” appointed by the Federal
Council and led by Professor Aymo Brunetti, was released. It has
recommendations for modifying the current Swiss Too-Big-To-Fail
framework, including that Switzerland should be among the leading
countries in terms of going-concern capital requirements based on both
risk-weighted requirements and the leverage ratio. In February 2015, the
Federal Council expressed its support for the recommendations and has
instructed the FDF to submit proposals for necessary legal adjustments by
end-2015.

Remain alert to the build-up of
risks in domestic real estate and
mortgage markets. Fully enforce
self-regulation, and consider
further raising the countercyclical
capital buffer and introducing
additional tools (e.g., debt-toincome (DTI) and loan-to-value
(LTV) limits).

FINMA and the SNB closely monitor real estate and mortgage market
developments and are still concerned about imbalances, notwithstanding a
slowdown in both real-estate price and mortgage growth. The authorities
are enforcing self-regulations and have taken the following new measures,
implemented since September 2014: stricter (i) amortization requirements;
(ii) use of second incomes for financial sustainability evaluation; and
(iii) valuation of properties for mortgages. There are currently no plans to
introduce new macroprudential tools.

Bring Financial Market
Infrastructures (FMIs) into
compliance with new international
principles and establish crisis
management arrangements
between the authorities of FMIs.

The CPMI-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs)
have been transferred into national law for central counterparties, payment
systems and central securities depositories as well as securities settlement
systems by revising the requirements for such FMIs in the National Bank
Ordinance (NBO).
For trade repositories, the international principles will be transferred into
national law in the new Financial Market Infrastructures Act, which is
currently in Parliament and is expected to enter into force at the earliest at
the beginning of 2016.
Crisis management will also be strengthened as the new Financial Market
Infrastructure Act is completed and implemented by the Financial Market
Infrastructure Ordinance. FINMA and the SNB intend to identify and
implement the arrangements needed to ensure effective coordination and
cooperation between the authorities and with FMIs for FMI-specific crisis
scenarios.

Establish transparency in the
financial sector as a core element
of the Swiss “brand,” in particular
through heightening banks’
disclosure requirements, including
as regards capital weighting and
providing data for adequate risk
analysis.

A FINMA circular (2008/22) is being revised to reflect the revised pillar 3
disclosure requirements. This circular has previously been updated to
comply with Basel Committee on Banking Supervision requirements
regarding: a) composition of capital disclosure, b) leverage ratio framework
and disclosure; and c) liquidity coverage ratio disclosure standards.
The two Swiss big banks have increased transparency related to modelbased RWA in line with the recommendations of the Enhanced Disclosure
Task Force (a private sector initiative). For example, both institutions

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

SWITZERLAND
recently started to disclose changes in their RWA, broken down by cause,
including reductions attributable to model adjustments. There is no
information for the period between 2009 and 2012, during which large
decreases in the big banks’ RWA occurred.
In addition, Swiss accounting rules for banks were revised in 2014,
providing the authorities with the opportunity to require more information,
especially in the notes to the financial statements.
Overhaul the deposit insurance
scheme: make its provisions more
transparent; reform its
governance; and build-up
dedicated ex ante funding with a
back-up line of support. Make
deposit insurance funds available
to finance resolution measures on
a least-cost basis.

On December 5, 2014, the Federal Council took due note of the final
Brunetti Report, which includes several recommendations largely in keeping
with the FSAP recommendations, including transparency, governance
reform in line with international standards, shorter payout period (20 to 7
working days), and ex ante funding.

Issue guidance on the cantonal
banks’ governance, based on their
best practice, including reducing
political interconnectedness. Issue
guidance on guarantees for
cantonal banks, to enhance
transparency and create a level
playing field both across the
cantonal banks and with the rest
of the banking sector.

A full revision of the primary reference for governance issues (FINMA
Circular 2008/24 “Supervision and Internal Control—Banks”) is planned for
2015, with particular focus on the latest international developments in this
area. More concise formulation of qualification criteria for board members
and a bank’s risk governance framework will also be considered.

The Federal Council will decide on how to proceed with the expert group's
recommendations at a later date.
There is no proposal to make deposit insurance funds available to finance
resolution measures on a least-cost basis, however.

FINMA reports that governance issues are given considerable weight in its
ongoing supervision of big and middle-sized banks, including cantonal
banks. Qualification and composition of the supreme governing body as a
whole are periodically challenged at the regular supervisory dialogue with
the banks.
All the cantonal banks, except one, now have a majority of independent
board members as set out in FINMA Circular 08/24.
No explicit guidance on guarantees for cantonal banks is planned or likely
to occur in the near future.

Ensure that the likely consolidation
among the private banks in
response to U.S. tax pressures
proceeds smoothly.

In 2014, the consolidation process for private banks continued. Five private
banks ceased their business and were released from FINMA’s supervision.
One private bank was merged with another firm. One private bank was
liquidated and another one is still in the process of liquidation. These
transactions proceeded smoothly, except in one case unrelated to U.S. tax
pressures. So far, the extent of problems in smaller Swiss private banks
appears to have been more limited than feared.

Issue guidance to auditors to
ensure consistency of supervision,
and undertake more “deep dives”
into particular areas of concern.
Increase the intensity of onsite
supervision, including of middlesized and smaller banks.

In 2013, FINMA established Circular 2013/3 focusing on prudential audits
performed by external auditors. This text is being implemented and
supplemented by templates and instructions concerning risk analysis, audit
strategy and form and content of long-form audit reports. FINMA has
furthermore decided to issue detailed guidance describing how to audit
each regulatory audit field. The circular provides the possibility to mandate
experts or audit firms that are not in charge of the ordinary audit to
investigate a special field, and FINMA uses this option.
FINMA has intensified its direct supervisory activities over recent years, in
particular through internal analytical work and on-site inspections. FINMA
is currently examining the possibility to redirect some resources in order to

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWITZERLAND
further strengthen these supervisory activities.
The Federal Council adopted a report on December 20, 2014, which
concludes that there is no fundamental need for institutional reform.
However, it identified certain areas for improvement, including (i) FINMA to
further develop their own monitoring activities, notably by enhancing their
analytical work and increased on-site inspections; (ii) FINMA to ensure that
institutions with comparable activities and risks are supervised consistently;
(iii) FINMA to use their human resources according to the importance of
the individual areas of supervision.
The Federal Council will decide on how to proceed with the expert group's
recommendations at a later date.

Short to medium term
Increase FINMA’s resources so it
can carry out its agenda for
supervisory enhancement. The
resource pool for highly qualified
staff could be expanded.

There are no plans to increase FINMA’s resources, as the authorities do not
share the view that additional resources are needed.

Medium term
Reach agreement with partner
supervisors as to the resolution of
the country’s G-SIFIs.

FINMA reports that it has reached a consensus on the resolution strategy of
its G-SIBs with the Crisis Management Group (CMG) of both G-SIBs and is
currently concluding cooperation agreements on crisis management of the
Swiss G-SIBs between the CMG members. Detailed implementation of the
agreements still needs to be defined and agreed upon.

Make available the full range of
best practice resolution powers to
handle any bank deemed systemic
at the time.

No changes made to directly address the FSAP recommendation. The
authorities plan to amend the banking act to provide a statutory basis for
FINMA bail-in powers and grant it resolution powers for holding companies
and non-operational entities.

Monitor closely the condition of
the life insurance firms in advance
of the prospective elimination of
the palliative measures protecting
the companies from the effects of
low interest rates, and enhance
public understanding of the Swiss
Solvency Test.

Life insurers are monitored closely. For 2014, FINMA expects that the
effects of the palliative measures have been smaller compared to previous
years. FINMA engages in the exchange of information on Swiss Solvency
Test-related topics with regulators and supervisors in other jurisdictions
(e.g., EIOPA, BaFin). In addition, FINMA representatives give presentations
about the Swiss Solvency Test, both in Switzerland and abroad.

Prioritize regulatory reform of
securities markets, to bring
arrangements up to international
standards. Enhance focus on
conduct of business supervision of
banks and securities dealers.

The Federal Council has taken note of the results of the consultation on the
Financial Services Act (FinSA) and the Financial Institutions Act (FinIA) and
instructed the FDF to carry out various adjustments. The aim is to upgrade
the quality of the services provided by Swiss financial institutions and to
improve client protection, while at the same time, bring regulations in line
with international standards and equivalent to EU regulation. The FinSA,
inter alia, governs financial institutions’ relationship with their clients with
regard to the most important financial products, and harmonizes the
associated code of conduct. The FinIA brings together various existing laws

management business in any form in a new piece of legislation.
The new Financial Market Infrastructure Act, currently in parliament,

governs the organization and operation of financial market infrastructure.
The provisions that are currently dispersed in various federal acts will be
combined in a single law aligned with market developments and
international requirements.
Pursue legislation to improve
policyholder protection, enhance
brokers’ supervision, and increase
the level of public disclosure.

In March 2015, a revision of the Insurance Supervisory Ordinance went into
force. This includes improvements of policyholder protection, increased
public disclosure of insurance companies, and the supervision of insurance
brokers.
Policyholder protection is intended to be enhanced by: (i) applying the
Swiss Solvency Test also to reinsurance captives and (ii) increasing the
qualitative requirements, such as additional requirements on organization
and corporate governance. In particular, insurers are required to have
independent risk management and compliance functions. In addition, the
Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) has been assembled in a
dedicated section. Parts of these requirements existed until now as a
collection of individual items. For liquidity of insurers, existing qualitative
requirements are complemented with quantitative requirements, which
FINMA has been tasked to further specify.
Public reporting requirements of insurers are increased by requiring
insurers to publicly report on their activities, profits, risk management, risk
profile, methods for technical provisions, capital management, and
solvability. This obligation will be synchronized with the application of the
public disclosure requirements in the European Union. FINMA is to further
elaborate the specifications.
The supervision of insurance brokers is enhanced by the obligation to
report to FINMA items from criminal records, if they are related to certain
criminal actions.

Annex V. Switzerland: Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy
Recommendations
IMF 2014 Article IV Recommendations

Authorities’ Response

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
Monetary conditions should remain expansionary and
the exchange rate floor should remain in place.

The SNB has maintained an expansionary monetary
policy stance with the policy rate reduced to
-0.75 percent. However, in early 2015, the SNB had to
intervene heavily to maintain the exchange rate floor
against the euro. At the same time, depreciation
against the dollar reduced the likelihood of franc
overvaluation. In this context, the SNB judged that the
franc needed more flexibility and that, with this change
in conditions, the costs of maintaining the floor were
no longer worth the benefits, resulting in an exit from
the floor on January 15, 2015.

Negative interest rates on banks’ excess reserves may
need to be introduced in case of renewed strong
pressures on the franc.

Implemented.

Provisions need to be strengthened to bring SNB
capital in line with risks.

The SNB built up provisions for currency reserves in
2014.

Housing Market Policies

 Discourage vulnerable households from taking on
too much mortgage debt.

 Existing self-regulation measures should be
tightened, for example to speed up loan
amortization.

 Curb mortgage growth in the buy-to let segment.
 Stricter direct regulation may be necessary, including
mandatory affordability caps and maximum loan-to
value ratios.

The authorities are enforcing self-regulations and have
taken new measures, implemented since September
2014: (i) stricter amortization requirements; (ii) stricter
use of second income for financial sustainability
evaluation; and (iii) stricter valuation requirements for
residential real estate. There are currently no
immediate plans to introduce new macroprudential
tools, though the authorities are continuously
assessing whether further action is needed.

 Phase out tax incentives that encourage borrowing to
finance home buying.

Structural and Fiscal Policies
Address the challenges of an aging population.

The government submitted the Pension 2020 reform
package to the parliament.

A rapid resolution of uncertainty related to future
immigration policy.

In progress.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWITZERLAND

Financial Sector Policies
Press the large banks to continue efforts to rapidly
bring their leverage ratios into line with those of other
major international banks, ensure an ambitious
minimum leverage ratio requirement, and improve
transparency as regards risk weights.

The Federal Council expressed its support for the
recommendations of the Brunetti Report, which
includes that Switzerland should be among the leading
countries in terms of going-concern capital
requirements based on both risk-weighted
requirements and the leverage ratio, and instructed the
FDF to submit proposals for necessary legal
adjustments by end-2015. The authorities are adopting
international standards related to increased disclosure
of risk weights and involved in international initiatives
to strengthen standards further.

Continue discussions with international counterparts to
reach agreement on measures to make the large banks
resolvable without public sector support.

FINMA reports that it has reached a consensus on the
resolution strategy of its G-SIBs with the Crisis
Management Group (CMG) of both G-SIBs and is
currently concluding cooperation agreements on crisis
management of the Swiss G-SIBs between the CMG
members.

Increase resources available to FINMA for banking
supervision, in particular so it can extend its intensive
supervision in the sector beyond the largest banks.

FINMA reports that it has intensified its direct
supervisory activities, including on-site inspections, and
resources will be redirected to further strengthen these
supervisory activities. They do not see a need for
substantially increased resources.

Refine FINMA’s use of external auditors for onsite
supervision of the banks, including through periodic
rotation of auditing firms, ensuring auditors are paid
from a FINMA-managed bank-financed fund, and
providing more guidance on their supervisory focus.

In 2013, FINMA established Circular 2013/3 focusing
on prudential audits performed by external auditors.
This text is being implemented and supplemented by
templates and instructions concerning risk analysis,
audit strategy, and form and content of long-form
audit reports. FINMA has furthermore decided to issue
detailed guidance describing how to audit each
regulatory audit field.

Overhaul the deposit insurance scheme to bring it into
line with emerging international best practices and the
schemes being established in the region. This involves
greater transparency to depositors on coverage
conditions, commitment to faster payouts, ex ante
financing in a dedicated fund, and the fund to have
powers to take action other than bank closure when
there is a cheaper alternative.

The Federal Council took note of the recommendations
of the Brunetti Report on this issue, which includes
several recommendations largely in keeping with the
FSAP recommendations, including transparency,
governance reform in line with international standards,
shorter payout period, and ex ante funding. The
Federal Council will decide on how to proceed with the
recommendations at a later date. There is no proposal
to make deposit insurance funds available to finance
resolution measures on a least-cost basis.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the Swiss franc is
determined by market forces in the foreign exchange market, and all settlements are made at free
market rates. On January 15, 2015, the SNB ended the exchange rate floor of CHF 1.20 per euro, and
the franc has since been floating. However, the SNB may intervene in the foreign exchange market.
The SNB publishes information regarding its foreign exchange transactions in its annual
accountability report. The 2014 IMF Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange
Restrictions (AREAER) classifies the de facto exchange rate regime as a crawl-like arrangement. This

classification does not take into account the exit from the exchange rate floor in January 2015; the
implications of this move for the de facto classification will be assessed in the context of the 2015
AREAR.
Switzerland has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains a system
free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions
except for restrictions in place for security reasons notified to the Fund pursuant to Decision No.

On April 30, 2014, Switzerland notified the IMF of the exchange restrictions that have been imposed

resolutions and EU regulations.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Switzerland’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes.
Switzerland publishes timely economic statistics and posts most of the data and the underlying
documentation on the internet. In June 1996, Switzerland subscribed to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board. Switzerland is in full observance of SDDS requirements, and it is availing itself of the
SDDS’s flexibility options on dissemination of production index data (for periodicity and timeliness)
and of wages and earnings data (for periodicity). The Swiss Federal Council has come out in favor of
Switzerland participating in the IMF’s new, extended statistical standard SDDS Plus. Implementing
the requirements of SDDS Plus in Switzerland—a task in which an interagency working group (SIF,
SNB, FSO, FFA, FSIO, SECO, and FINMA) plays an active role—will take several years. A number of
statistical gaps and deficiencies remain, mainly reflecting a lack of resources and the limited
authority of the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) to request information. More specifically:


general government finance statistics are finalized with considerable lags, mainly due to delays
in compiling fiscal accounts at the level of cantons and communes;



pension statistics are published with a long lag;



GDP by industry are published with a considerable lag.

To address deficiencies, the authorities are taking or intend to take the following steps:
Progress has been made in the area of balance of payments (BOP) statistics. In 2013, the
content-related revision of surveys in connection with financial flows (investment BOP) was
completed. Reporting institutions have reported data according to the new concept for the first time
for 2014 Q3. The new surveys aim, among other things, to meet the requirements of the bilateral
statistical agreement between Switzerland and the EU. This means in particular that more details on
the breakdown of financial flows by country will be collected. Since 2014, the BOP and international
investment position data have been published based on the sixth edition of the IMF’s Balance of
Payments Manual (BPM6). To ensure that new and old data are comparable and to ensure that data
users have long data series at their disposal, the SNB formally reclassified the old data series in line
with BPM6.
Switzerland has continued to provide data on Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) and
participated in the 2009 Coordinated Direct Investment Survey. The data and metadata have
been posted on the IMF website. Both the SNB and FINMA have continued to transmit FSB Data
Gaps related data to the central data hub hosted by the BIS and have continued their preparatory
work for phase 3 of the project. In the area of cashless payment transactions, the various surveys
have been thoroughly revised. The prime aim of the revision was to enable a full reflection of the
technological innovations of the past few years in the area of cashless payment transactions.
Reporting institutions have reported data according to the revised surveys for the first time as of
December 31, 2014 (reference date).

The FSO has taken various steps in 2014 to improve core business statistics. In September 2014,
national accounts results were published for the first time according to the 2008 version of the
System of National Accounts (SNA 2008). This enabled users to have internationally comparable
data with a timing that was tightly coordinated with Switzerland’s European partners. Given the
importance of R&D in Switzerland, the impact was quite high in terms of GDP level, but moderate in
terms of dynamics. For 2015, the FSO plans to publish new data on jobs, which will be in line with
the concepts of the business census introduced in the last quarter of 2012. In addition, a project was
initiated to produce prices on real estate transactions. First results are expected in 2017 and will
assist monitoring of the housing market.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Switzerland
On May 18, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Switzerland.
Switzerland’s economy has performed relatively well in the aftermath of the global financial
crisis, with growth reaching 2 percent in 2014. However, the economic environment became
more complicated in late 2014, as increased capital inflows forced the Swiss National Bank
(SNB) to start intervening heavily to defend its exchange rate floor of 1.20 francs per euro. The
SNB eventually exited the floor on January 15, 2015, while also cutting its policy rate (the
interest rate on deposits at the SNB exceeding 20 times required reserves) to -0.75 percent.
Following these moves, the exchange rate appreciated substantially before stabilizing at around
1.05 francs per euro.
In the near term, economic growth in Switzerland is likely to slow, as the strong franc, which is
now likely overvalued, reduces net exports. Consistent with this view, leading economic
indicators have declined so far in 2015. For the full year, GDP growth is projected to slow to
about 0.75 percent and to about 1.25 percent in 2016. This growth slowdown is expected to
increase unemployment, but only modestly, in part due to the cushioning effects of short-time
work arrangements. Inflation, which is already very low at -1.1 percent as of April 2015, is
expected to fall further in 2015, as the effects from exchange rate appreciation and the recent
decline in oil prices continue to pass through into final prices.
Over the medium term, the economy is expected to recover gradually. As the economy adjusts to
the exchange rate appreciation, growth is projected to rise gradually back to around 2 percent
over the medium term while inflation increases to around 1 percent. Switzerland’s fiscal rules are
expected to keep the structural fiscal deficit near zero and government debt low.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
However, this central scenario is subject to important risks. One key risk is that very low levels
of inflation may complicate the operation of monetary policy by making it more difficult to
reduce real interest rates as necessary in response to shocks. Indeed, yields on 10-year
government bonds are negative and the lowest in the world, indicating significant risks of a
protracted period of very low inflation and sluggish growth. Other important risks include
uncertainty about future immigration policy and its effects on EU relations, global and regional
economic developments, the effects of ongoing changes in the international financial regulatory
landscape, and the potential for price reversals in the housing market, which has been buoyant in
recent years.
To help address risks and medium-term challenges, the authorities have recently undertaken or
proposed a numbers of reforms. These include various financial sector reforms (e.g., adoption of
tighter lending standards for mortgages), proposed reforms to bolster the sustainability of the
pension system, and proposed reforms of corporate taxation and financial controls to help
comply with international initiatives aimed at limiting money laundering and cross-border tax
evasion and avoidance.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended Switzerland's continued strong economic fundamentals
underpinned by sound policy management. Directors noted, however, that following the exit
from the exchange rate floor earlier this year and the subsequent appreciation of the franc, the
economy faces currency overvaluation and weakened near-term growth and low inflation
prospects.
Directors agreed that further monetary easing would support growth and reduce exchange rate
overvaluation. In addition, they noted that moving inflation closer to the upper end of the target
range over the medium term could mitigate risks associated with low inflation. However, a
number of Directors considered that controlling inflation to this extent may not be feasible for
the small and open Swiss economy.
Given the limited room for conventional monetary easing, Directors saw need to explore various
options. In this regard a pre-announced program for asset purchases could be an option, although
many Directors were not convinced about the effectiveness of such a program at this juncture.
Looking ahead, Directors agreed that the policy rate should be maintained at its current level for
now, as this has been helpful in reducing deflationary pressures. More broadly, they encouraged
the central bank to further enhance communication of its monetary policy framework and to

Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

continue to prioritize provisioning over transfers to its distribution reserve to ensure that its
capital remains in line with risks.
Directors commended Switzerland’s fiscal rule which has helped maintain low deficits and debt.
They concurred that for fiscal policy to support growth, automatic stabilizers should be allowed
to operate fully, as permitted under Switzerland’s debt-brake rule, while avoiding budgeting
over-performance against the rule. Directors generally agreed that in the event of a severe or
protracted recession, discretionary fiscal stimulus could be employed by triggering the rule’s
temporary escape clause to help boost growth and inflation and avoid overburdening monetary
policy.
Directors welcomed the progress made in financial sector reforms and encouraged further action
in line with the Brunetti Report and the FSAP update. They highlighted the need to closely
monitor financial stability risks in the housing market and adopt further prudential measures as
needed. These could include raising minimum leverage ratio requirements of the two large
international banks and improving their resolvability, increasing banks’ disclosure of information
of risk weights, further refining FINMA’s use of external auditors, and overhauling deposit
insurance. Directors also called for continued monitoring of the effects of the low-interest rate
environment, especially for life insurers and defined-benefit pension plans.
Directors underscored the need to sustain structural reforms to support medium-term growth and
address challenges. In this regard, they called for action to reduce uncertainty related to future
immigration policy and its effect on relations with the European Union. Directors looked forward
to the timely completion of the corporate tax reforms and financial controls, consistent with
international initiatives aimed at limiting money laundering and cross-border tax evasion and
avoidance. Reforms to boost full-time female labor force participation, such as lowering
marginal tax rates on second incomes, could also enhance potential growth. Directors welcomed
the proposed pension reforms, which would help ensure the sustainability of the social safety net
and its continued availability for future generations.

Statement by Messers. Daniel Heller, Executive Director for Switzerland, and
Marco Cavaliere, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
May 18, 2015

General
On behalf of the Swiss authorities, we would like to thank staff for presenting a helpful
report and for their candid policy recommendations. The report includes a thorough and
insightful analysis of the macroeconomic situation. Moreover, it adds considerable value to
the domestic policy discussions in Switzerland. In most aspects, we share staff's opinion on
the challenges going forward.
Outlook
Staff's outlook for the Swiss economy is well in line with our authorities’ latest forecast,
which was done in March 2015. We are slightly more optimistic than the Fund regarding
growth prospects for 2016, as our forecast relies on a firming recovery in export sectors. We
fully share staff’s risk assessment.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
The Swiss National Bank (SNB) shares staff’s view that monetary conditions are too tight,
given the overvaluation of the Swiss Franc. The SNB will therefore remain active in the
foreign exchange market, as necessary, in order to influence monetary conditions. Regarding
a preannounced program of foreign purchases, this might be one of the policy options.
However, the effectiveness of such a policy should not be overestimated. As the recent
experience suggests, the quantity of foreign assets to be purchased would presumably need to
be fairly high to have a meaningful effect on the exchange rate. Moreover, this would expand
the balance sheet at a pace that might limit the flexibility of monetary policy in the future. As
it regards moving inflation back near the upper end of the target range (i.e., closer to 2
percent) over the medium term, the SNB’s view is that it is not possible, in a small open
economy like Switzerland, to fine-tune inflation to such an extent. Announcing a narrow
target would suggest that the SNB has better control of inflation than it actually does.
Fiscal policy
We agree with staff that both the debt brake rule at the federal level as well as the different
fiscal rules at the cantonal level have largely contributed to the success of fiscal policy in
recent years. According to our latest estimates, the general government should record a small
deficit amounting to 0.1 percent of GDP in 2014. This nearly balanced result, which was
reached in an increasingly difficult environment, underscores the decisive efforts at all
government levels to keep fiscal policy on a sustainable path. In moving forward, we remain
committed to the fiscal strategy of (i) complying with the requirements of the debt brake rule
in the short and medium-term and (ii) maintaining expenditure growth at a sustainable level.
At the same time, we are aware that economic indicators for Switzerland have recently
worsened, pointing to a slowdown in growth. We share staff's opinion that in this situation
allowing automatic stabilizers to operate freely is the best way forward. Discretionary
stabilization measures should remain an option only in case of a severe recession.

2
External assessment
We welcome the very helpful analysis of the factors underlying Switzerland's large current
account surplus. As rightly noted by staff, several special factors, such as (i) the treatment of
retained earnings of multinational corporations, (ii) merchanting activities, and (iii) financial
services, are important to understand the level and movement of the Swiss current account. It
should be also noted that merchanting activities are not the only key driver of the goods
balance surplus. In fact, the pharmaceutical and chemical export industry, which is not
mentioned in the report, makes an even larger contribution, by accounting for more than 40
percent of total exports in goods.
Pension reform
We welcome staff's recommendation to go forward with the comprehensive pension reform
package prepared by the government. We also take note of the recommendation to reduce the
minimum guaranteed interest rate on invested assets for second pillar pension funds. In this
regard, we would like to note that our authorities review this minimum interest rate every
year and acts, on the recommendation of a commission of external experts, to ensure an
adequate level of objectivity, reliability, and transparency. The criteria considered include,
among others, movements in equities, bonds, and real estate. Thus, the average yield of 10year Swiss government bonds is not the key reference for setting the aforementioned
minimum interest rate, as the staff’s report might suggest. The last review of the rate in
October 2014 did not give grounds for a rate reduction. In fact, while the yield on Swiss
government bonds remained low, other asset classes including real estate posted good
performances. The next review will take place in autumn 2015.
Financial sector policies
We generally agree with staff’s assessment and recommendations on Swiss financial sector
policies. We would like to provide comments in these three key areas.
Large banks
We welcome staff’s support for the recommendations in the “Brunetti Report,” especially
regarding the need to raise leverage ratio requirements for large banks to levels that are
internationally leading. We agree that while these banks are well capitalized relative to peers
in terms of risk weighted capital ratios, their leverage ratios are below the average of other
major banks. We also share staff’s view that improvements in risk weighted assets (RWA)
transparency are needed. To address these and other issues, a working group led by the
Federal Department of Finance is reviewing the Too-Big-To-Fail framework and will make
concrete proposals by end-2015, taking into account the finalization of an international
standard on Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) for global systemic banks. This group
has a mandate, in particular, to recalibrate risk weighted and leverage ratio requirements so
that they are internationally leading and to review the method of calculating RWA and
propose adjustments, if necessary. Finally, we share staff’s view that, while the large banks
have announced important steps to adapt their legal structure, continued action, including at
international level, is needed to further improve their resolvability.
Housing and mortgage sector
We share staff’s assessment that, despite a partial slowing of dynamics in the housing and
mortgage sectors, risks remain high. Various prudential measures have been undertaken

3
between 2012 and 2014 to address these risks. While the measures appear to have had some
positive effect, large imbalances remain. As noted in the report, measures implemented
recently require more time to take full effect. Our authorities will continue to (i) closely
monitor developments in the housing and mortgage markets and (ii) reassess on a regular
basis the need for an adjustment to the countercyclical capital buffer. Moreover, they agree
that further policy action may be warranted, in particular, to target affordability and the
income-producing real estate sector.
FINMA's supervisory approach
Regarding staff’s recommendation to improve the system of external audit firms used for
regulatory audits, we understand that directly mandating audit firms and paying them through
a FINMA-managed and bank-financed fund may reduce conflicts of interests. Switching to
such a system would, however, require legislative changes. Furthermore, effective measures
are already in place to ensure FINMA’s control over the work conducted by audit firms and
to prevent banks from influencing their auditors. Our authorities are also of the opinion that
periodic rotation of audit firms, as recommended by staff, would not be an effective measure
to enhance the Swiss supervisory approach, owing to the oligopolistic structure of the audit
market. Finally, after a recent significant expansion in staffing, FINMA considers its current
resource to be adequate.
