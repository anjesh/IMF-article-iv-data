Two missions visited Nairobi during May 13–June 2 and September 12–24, 2004. The staff team
comprised Messrs. Kalinga (head), McIntyre, Cheng (all AFR), Ms. Aylward (PDR), Ms. Brenner,
Mr. Podpiera (MFD), and Mr. Tchaidze (FAD). Mr. Reitmaier, the Senior Resident Representative in
Nairobi, also participated in the discussions. The staff team met with the Minister of Finance, the
Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, the Permanent Secretary for Finance, other senior officials,
and members of the Finance Committee of Parliament, the diplomatic community, and civil society
and trade union representatives.

•

Kenya has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange rate system that is free
of restrictions on current transactions.

•

At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation on May 2, 2003, Directors commended Kenya
for maintaining a measure of financial stability during recent years in difficult circumstances and for
the progress made in the governance area. Directors emphasized that key priorities for the PRGFsupported program should include actions to continue to improve governance and fiscal transparency;
fiscal consolidation to address the domestic debt problem, and ensure fiscal sustainability over the
medium term; a credible strategy to reform tax administration and enhance revenues; measures to
restructure public outlays in favor of poverty-related spending and improve the delivery of basic
social spending; a clear strategy for restructuring and strengthening the banking system; and
privatization of public banks and other public enterprises.

•

Conclusion of the first review was delayed because the development of the new wage setting
mechanism for public employees took longer than anticipated. Agreement on a fiscal framework for
2004/05 (July/June) was reached in September 2004. The authorities request five waivers for
nonobservance of five performance clauses (Attachment).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Political and economic setting
•

As Kenya proceeds into its second year of reforms under the PRGF arrangement, notable
progress has been made in implementing the program. While five performance criteria
were not met, the new government that took office in December 2002 has begun to
address issues that have been, for some time, at the center of Fund policy advice (Box 1).

•

Program execution has been adversely affected by the protracted and contentious
deliberations on constitutional reform and by capacity constraints in key ministries.

•

Some macroeconomic gains were made in 2003/04 (July/June), notably a moderate
rebound in economic activity and the drop in domestic debt (in percent of GDP).
However, inflation has risen markedly.

•

The medium-term outlook is promising if structural reforms are deepened, capacity
constraints are addressed, and strong donor support is restored.

•

However, there are risks to the macroeconomic outlook. An intensification of political
tensions or delays in concluding the constitution review process would raise uncertainty,
postpone the resumption of strong budgetary support, and complicate macroeconomic
management.

•

The authorities are requesting an SDR 50 million (18.4 percent of quota) augmentation
of the access under the PRGF arrangement to help address balance of payment pressures
resulting from the oil price increase and drought-related food imports.

Policy issues
Kenya faces several policy challenges:
•

Entrenching fiscal discipline. A significant reduction of domestic borrowing is
essential for fiscal sustainability.

•

Reorienting the budget toward pro-poor spending and improving expenditure
management. Putting the economy on a sustainable path of rapid and poverty-reducing
growth will require a reorientation of expenditure priorities and modern public
expenditure management.

•

Restoring price stability. There is a need to better understand the monetary
transmission mechanism, to provide a clear commitment to price stability as the main
focus of monetary policy, and to use monetary instruments efficiently.

•

Enhancing the effectiveness of key governance institutions. Improving capacities and
budgetary resources top the agenda.

•

Strengthening Kenya’s external competitiveness. Reforming labor markets, upgrading
infrastructure, and deepening the structural reform agenda are key.

Some progress has been made in these areas and agreement has been reached on the way ahead.
The staff recommends completion of the first review and augmentation of access.

Box 1. Kenya: Past Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Before 2003, pervasive governance problems and weak political commitment to economic reforms did
not provide a favorable environment for the implementation of Fund policy advice. Despite the
challenges detailed in this report, implementation of Kenya’s economic policies has improved
substantially since 2003, when the coalition government led by President Kibaki took office. This box
considers recent experience with the implementation of Fund policy in four areas: governance, fiscal
sustainability, financial sector, and poverty reduction.
Governance: The Fund has emphasized governance as key to improving Kenya’s economic
performance; failure to implement reforms in this area led to the interruption of several previous Fund
programs. Since December 2002, Kenya has implemented an ambitious and multifaceted program of
reforms, including passing key anticorruption and public ethics legislation, strengthening the judiciary,
and reforming the policy, as well as the public audit system. Additional steps to strengthen governance
are discussed in this report.
Fiscal sustainability: The Fund has urged Kenya to address fiscal sustainability by, among other steps,
strengthening revenue performance, lowering the wage bill as a proportion of revenue, and decisively
tackling contingent fiscal liabilities. Noting the concern about fiscal sustainability, the government has
already taken various measures to this end, including strengthening tax administration, initiating public
expenditure management (PEM) reforms, continuing civil service rationalization, and establishing a new
wage-setting mechanism for public employees. The government has also stressed the need to increase
poverty reduction spending. For this reason, the reorientation of public expenditure in favor of essential
social and economic outlays is a key priority of the government
Financial sector: Over the recent past, Kenya has taken important steps to strengthen financial sector
supervision in response to Fund advice. It has been less successful in responding to the recommendations
of the Fund and the Bank to reduce public sector ownership of banks. The government has indicated that
the slow progress in this area reflects primarily fears that privatization may adversely affect financial
intermediation in rural areas.
Poverty Reduction: Kenya has produced an ambitious poverty reduction strategy paper. Fund policy
advice has emphasized the links from improved PEM, fiscal sustainability, and financial sector stability
to enhanced poverty reduction strategies and pro-poor spending. The government has made strides in
these areas by addressing budget rigidity through the new wage-setting mechanism for public
employees, but it has also indicated that its intentions to restructure expenditure toward poverty
reduction have been hampered by uncertain donor support.

I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
A narrowly based rebound in economic activity has begun. Although real GDP
growth at an estimated 2.1 percent in 2003/04 was above the program assumption of
1.9 percent, growth has depended primarily on a recovery of the tertiary sectors (Figure 1).
Primary sector output has been adversely affected by a drought, and gross investment
(in percent of GDP) has remained at prereform levels (Table 1). Kenya’s growth has been
driven primarily by factor accumulation, with efficiency gains, as measured by total factor
productivity, declining (Box 2).

6

2.
The loosening of monetary policy has led to an increase in inflation and a
depreciation of the shilling. In response to the lowering of banks’ required reserves from
10 percent to 6 percent in July 2003, the money multiplier rose precipitously, resulting in a
13 percent expansion of broad money in 2003/04 and negative real interest rates (Table 2).
Headline inflation rose to 19 percent in September 2004 from 8 percent a year earlier
(Figure 1). Kenya’s inflation has also been driven by increases in energy prices, and a
weakening of the Kenyan shilling (Box 3).
3.
Recent economic developments may have worsened poverty indicators. With real
GDP growth broadly in line with the increase in population and the economy suffering from
the effects of major negative shocks—the drought and the oil price increase—the poverty
rate may have increased in the recent past. Moreover, progress on poverty alleviation has
been hampered by delays in initiating major poverty reduction programs in the social and
economic sectors. AIDS remains a major challenge (Box 4).
Box 2. Kenya: Sources of Economic Growth
Kenya’s economic performance since 1990 has been lackluster, with growth averaging 1.6 percent a
year. A simple growth accounting exercise has shown that, like most sub-Saharan African countries,
much of the economic growth in Kenya has been driven by factor accumulation, notably physical capital
formation and employment growth. Total factor productivity (TFP) broadly declined during the past two
decades. However, TFP growth is projected to be positive in 2004. A simple econometric study shows
that TFP growth is strongly and positively associated with governance and significantly and negatively
associated with inflation.1

Box 3. Kenya: Inflation Dynamics and Its Determinants
Kenya’s inflation has recently risen sharply. Annual overall inflation was 19 percent in
September 2004, with underlying inflation (overall inflation excluding food, fuel, and energy)
reaching 7 percent. These rates have exceeded the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)’s target of
5 percent for underlying inflation.
Potential factors that may have contributed to Kenya’s recent high inflation include an
expansionary monetary policy and, on the supply side, a poor harvest and high energy prices.
A simple econometric study shows that the recent high overall inflation has been driven
primarily by a high growth rate of broad money, a weakening of Kenya’s nominal exchange
rate, high energy prices, and low agricultural output.1

paper.

Box 4. Kenya: Economic and Social Impact of HIV/AIDS
HIV/AIDS is a serious problem in Kenya, with the infection rate estimated at 14 percent of
the adult population. The number of AIDS-related deaths is estimated at 150,000 in 2002.
Economic consequences
•

The high death rates among the working-age population imply that AIDS deaths may
directly reduce potential annual economic growth by 1.0–1.2 percentage points a year.

•

Poor health of workers weakens labor productivity.

•

High medical costs take resources away from other, more economically productive
areas.

AIDS and poverty
•

Family income falls when adults fall victim to AIDS or when they reduce work hours
to care for sick family members.

•

High medical costs push the infected and their families into poverty.

4.
Overall fiscal performance strengthened during the fiscal year 2003/04.Central
government fiscal imbalances were much lower than expected under the program, leading to
a marked drop in the ratio of domestic debt to GDP from 24.3 percent at end-June 2003 to
22.2 percent at end-June 2004 (Table 3 and Figure 3). While this performance reflected the

8

positive effects of strong revenue collection and the steps taken to tighten the management of
recurrent expenditure, fears that the planned large domestic borrowing might crowd out
private activity also induced the authorities to curtail some spending programs. In addition,
there were delays in implementing some programs, such as the recapitalization of the
National Bank of Kenya.
5.
The current account deficit (excluding official transfers), at 2.0 percent of GDP
in 2003/04, was narrower than projected (Table 4). The expected strong growth in
investment-related imports that was conditioned on strong economic reforms and positive
private sector sentiment did not fully materialize. Higher oil (US$1,048 million) and droughtrelated food imports (US$83 million) partially offset the lower-than-expected investmentrelated imports. Export volumes grew by 7 percent in 2003/04, as the tea, horticultural, and
African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)-related garment sectors performed well. In the
face of the smaller current account gap, foreign exchange reserves exceeded the program
target.
6.
Financial sector performance has improved but major concerns remain. The
ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to total loans fell and but decisive action is needed to
address the problems of distressed state banks to tackle the NPL problem effectively. Key
macroprudential indicators are presented in Table 5.
7.

Implementation of structural reforms has been mixed:

•

The liberalization of the telecommunications sector is on course, with the licensing of
a third mobile operator.

•

Although in the past years little progress was made in implementing fundamental
changes in Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) operations, significant steps have
recently been taken to improve domestic tax administration consistent with previous
FAD recommendations.

•

The restructuring of expenditures to social sectors, notably education, commenced.

•

As outlined in the MEFP (para. 17), promising initial steps have been made in moving
toward a modern PEM system.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS

8.
Against the backdrop of a challenging political and economic environment, the
discussions focused on the policy requirements for restoring strong economic growth
over the medium term. There was agreement on an urgent need for an acceleration of
structural reforms, as well as on how Kenya should respond to the slower resumption of
donor assistance now foreseen and the risks to the program. For the near term, the
discussions concentrated on the appropriate response to the significant shortfalls in donor
budgetary support, the reemergence of inflation, and the need for an augmentation of access
under the PRGF arrangement of SDR 50 million to ameliorate, in part, the adverse impact of
oil prices and the drought on the balance of payments. For the first review of the PRGF
arrangement, understandings were reached on performance criteria for end-March 2005 and

9

indicative targets for end-September 2005 that are presented in the attached MEFP, and a
rephasing of disbursements under the PRGF arrangement (Table 6).
A. Outlook and Risks
9.
The authorities explained that the economic recovery was projected to continue
in 2004/05, with real GDP expected to grow by 2.7 percent, because the tourism and
construction sectors were expected to perform strongly. However, they pointed out that
growth would fall below the original program forecast of 3.1 percent, reflecting in part a
significant cut in the projected level of investment. The authorities expected a decline in
inflation, excluding food and oil, to 3.5 percent by June 2005 in response to the tightening of
monetary policy under the program.
10.
Kenya’s medium-term prospects depend critically on the pace of reforms, fiscal
consolidation, and the resumption of strong donor support. The baseline scenario has
growth reaching 4.0 percent in 2007/08—a rate the staff believes is achievable with a modest
reform effort. This scenario, however, assumes much lower amounts of donor assistance than
envisaged in the original program because governance concerns have negatively affected
donor support to Kenya. For the same reason, the overall deficits (before grants) and the
domestic financing requirements, over the medium term, would be higher than envisaged
earlier, and the targets for domestic debt are above earlier projections. Nevertheless, the
authorities were concerned that although the medium-term growth rates appeared reasonable
when seen against Kenya’s recent performance, they fall far short of the Economic Recovery
Strategy (ERS) target of 6 percent, which implies a significant delay in the achievement of
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (Appendix V).
11.
The baseline scenario would leave the fiscal position in a fragile position. The
authorities indicated that several factors accounted for this. First, the realization of the fiscal
objectives depended upon the restoration of strong donor support; sudden slowdowns or
stops in such assistance would greatly complicate the attainment of overall fiscal objectives.
Second, enhancing fiscal flexibility requires addressing the problems that gave rise to the
large budget transfers, which would take time to complete. Third, the coming into force of a
new constitution could necessitate a reexamination of the entire medium-term fiscal strategy
if new fiscal mandates are created. Fourth, most fiscal variables were procyclical and
volatile.
12.
The mission also discussed alternative medium-term scenarios on the downside
(Table 7). If political tensions increased and the reform momentum slowed significantly,
donor budgetary support would likely be suspended and domestic financing would rise
substantially. In this scenario, government domestic debt would exceed 25 percent of GDP,
economic growth would stall, and there would be little progress on poverty reduction.
Government representatives observed that the intention was to avoid this outcome. They
pointed out that the commitment of the cabinet to the economic reforms under the program
was strong and that the emerging consensus on constitutional reform boded well for the
sustained implementation of the program. In contrast, an alternative high-case scenario
(Table 7) shows that strong fiscal consolidation and accelerated structural reforms that are

10

supported by strong donor support could trigger a virtuous cycle of higher growth and
improved public finances.
13.
Notwithstanding projected strong export performance, the external current
account deficit, excluding grants, is expected to widen considerably in 2004/05. This
would reflect primarily a drop in gross national savings because the increase in oil and food
prices would lower the proportion of income saved. Over the medium term, the current
account deficit is forecast to widen through 2005/06 as imports remain robust in response to
a pickup in growth and private-sector-led capital spending, but would begin to decline
thereafter in response to a strengthening of the national savings effort. Exports are also
projected to perform strongly as economic reforms begin to enhance Kenya’s
competitiveness.
14.
The November 2003 staff report projected large financing gaps to be filled by
donor support. These gaps reflected large public investment projects and a buildup of
international reserves to lower the economy’s external vulnerabilities. The authorities
observed that as donor disbursements had been smaller and slower than expected, the current
base case scenario projects external financing requirements to average about US$1.3 billion a
year over 2004/05 to 2006/07, well below earlier projections. They expected these
requirements to be filled by a combination of donor budgetary support, project support,
private financing, debt service relief from the January 2004 Paris Club rescheduling, and
Fund disbursements.
15.
Kenya has requested an augmentation of the PRGF arrangement to help
mitigate the adverse effects of the world oil price increase and the drought on the
balance of payments. The sharp rise in oil prices and drought-related food imports is
projected to raise total imports by up to US$500 million (3.0 percent of GDP). In response to
these developments, the authorities have allowed oil and food prices to adjust fully to the
increase in import prices, but with appropriate safety nets to protect the poor. Moreover,
several donors, including the World Bank, AfDB, and the European Union, have been
approached for financial support to help offset the higher external payments now foreseen.
The authorities have also requested an SDR 50 million augmentation of the access under the
PRGF arrangement, with SDR 25 million to be disbursed at the completion of the first review
and the remaining SDR 25 million at the completion of the second review. The augmentation
would bring total access under the program to SDR 225 million or 82.9 percent of quota.
While this access is higher than the norm of access for fourth-time users of the PRGF of
45 percent of quota, it is well below the maximum limit for access under the PRGF
arrangement of 140 percent. The amount of augmentation does not materially worsen
Kenya’s debt profile or its ability to repay the Fund.
16.
In discussions of Kenya’s vulnerability to external crisis, the staff noted that
Kenya’s import cover, while adequate, had declined from 3.5 months in 2001/02 to
3.0 months in 2003/04. It pointed out that a combination of weak growth, large fiscal
imbalances and financial sector weakness in an environment of relatively free capital
movements, could set the stage for a buildup of vulnerabilities that could eventually become
severe in the event of exogenous shocks. The authorities explained that concerns about the
fall in foreign reserve cover, when set against the intended lowering of external tariffs from

11

January 2005 and the uncertain prices for oil and maize, had convinced them of the need for
additional external support, including an augmentation of the access under the PRGF
arrangement.
17.
Further to terms of trade and weather-related shocks, the authorities recognized
that the main risks to the macroeconomic outlook are political. An intensification of
political tensions within the ruling coalition or other security-related shocks could hold back
private investment. On the upside, the economy would respond much faster to a speedy
resolution of constitutional reform and an acceleration of reforms, particularly in the
financial and parastatal sectors.
B. Fiscal Policy
18.
The authorities stressed that, over the medium term, fiscal policy would continue
to balance the commitment to debt sustainability with the need to support the poverty
reduction strategy. They pointed out that the slow resumption of donor budgetary assistance
necessitated a near-term adjustment of the fiscal strategy (Box 5). The program for 2004/05
therefore emphasizes revenue improvements (see below), a more modest expansion in
spending on poverty reduction outlays, and domestic borrowing of 2.5 percent of GDP,
(Table A and Figure 3).1 Against the background of a projected increase in interest rates and,
thus, lower growth in private credit, absorption of the government borrowing requirement—
about 50 percent of projected financial savings—would be consistent with the targeted
decline in underlying inflation.

The staff agreed that the emphasis on strengthening revenue collection was an
appropriate response to shortfalls in donor budget support.2 Current efforts to improve
revenue collection aim at partially offsetting the lower budgetary resources in 2004/05
stemming from shortfalls in donor assistance. With extensive FAD technical assistance, the

Revenue performance would be equivalent to the 2003/04 outcome, when account is taken of the 0.3 percent
of GDP revenue loss from the introduction of the East African Community (EAC) common external tariff
(CET) in January 2005. Revenue would, however, fall short of the original program projection because of the
negative revenue effects of lower investment. In addition, the composition of output would differ significantly
from the structure envisaged last year.

13

authorities are implementing measures aimed at a further rationalization and computerization
of key departments, as well as an upgrading of tax payments systems (MEFP para. 15).
20.
The Kenyan representatives explained that uncertain donor support
underscored the urgency of expenditure restructuring in favor of poverty outlays. First,
the program reverses recent trends toward increased current spending by raising capital
outlays from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2003/04 to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2004/05, with
allocations for roads, health, and agriculture—priority poverty and growth-oriented outlays—
accounting for the bulk of the increase. Second, new transitional procurement rules that have
institutionalized competition for government supplies are expected to lower supply costs.
Third, several new initiatives discussed in the MEFP (para. 16) will, over the medium term,
lower spending on noncore activities. These include the rationalization of diplomatic
representation and the reform of the tertiary education funding system. Finally, the problem
of budget rigidity is being addressed partly through the new wage-setting mechanism for
public employees (see below) and through the targeted lowering of domestic debt.
21.
The modernization of the PEM system that has recently been initiated is
essential to put the economy on a sustainable, rapid, and poverty-reducing growth path.
With the assistance of the World Bank and the Fund, the government is taking the steps in
this area that are outlined in the MEFP (para. 17).
22.
The government considers the upgrading of the civil service and capacity
building of key organizations as important for poverty reduction and public sector
modernization. Central government administrative staff was cut from 272,000 in 1993/94 to
about 190,000 in 2003/04, while the number of teachers rose from 210,724 to 236,000 (see
accompanying Selected Issues Paper).The authorities intend to continue the general hiring
freeze for the civil service, but will apply it flexibly, with half of the vacancies created
through natural attrition to be filled primarily by poverty reduction priority sectors. They
explained that, in addition to the hiring freeze, the government intended were to reduce the
wage bill as a proportion of total revenue, by explicitly linking future wage awards to
revenue growth, and to lower executive compensation by aligning it to comparable pay in
other African countries and the private sector. For the professional cadre, the plan was to
move gradually to an incentive-based wage.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
23.
Discussions on monetary policy focused on an exit strategy from the negative
real interest and high inflation environment. The staff pressed the authorities for a speedy
tightening of monetary policy to reduce inflation. In response, the authorities explained that
they had thus far tightened policy gradually because of concerns about a possible loss of
control over monetary aggregates if banks responded to potential capital losses from sharp
interest rate rises by rediscounting their large holdings of government bonds. However, after
a November 2004 MFD technical assistance mission suggested that the risks of a significant
flight from bonds was small, the central bank accelerated monetary tightening in the context
of a reserve money program designed to reduce broad money growth to 7.5 percent in

14

2004/05 (MEFP para.19).3 The authorities also noted that the use of reserve money
performance targets would make it easier to control monetary aggregates.
D. Competitiveness Issues
24.
Accelerating the pace of growth to reduce unemployment and poverty requires a
strengthening of Kenya’s competitive position. Discussions with the business community
revealed that this required concerted action in a range of areas to improve the business
climate.4 A number of indicators, including high labor costs (see below), point to a marked
decline in Kenya’s competitiveness in recent years. Moreover, a review of Kenya’s real
effective exchange rate (REER) indicates that the REER may be more appreciated than
suggested by its economic fundamentals, such as productivity changes and commodity
prices. Accordingly, the staff suggested more flexibility in the management of the floating
exchange rate system. In response, the authorities noted that the shilling would continue to be
allowed to respond to market forces and that interventions would be solely for the purpose of
smoothing short-run fluctuations that are not related to changes in fundamentals.
25.
The government has initiated actions to streamline the regulatory framework,
which should promote investment. The authorities explained that the Investment Promotion
Bill that is now before Parliament aims to reduce business costs in Kenya by eliminating
unnecessary bureaucratic procedures and rationalizing the regulatory system (Table B
provides information on comparative indicators of doing business in Kenya).
26.
A change in the wage-setting system could help restore competitiveness.
Available data indicate that average nominal dollar wages for unskilled workers in Kenya are
above those in other EAC member countries and competitor countries, such as India and
China. In addition, annual average real wage increases in the manufacturing sector have
averaged 8 percent during the past five years while labor productivity has reportedly fallen.
The real minimum wage has also been raised markedly in the past five years, at a time of
declining per capita real GDP. These developments have raised concerns that the wagesetting system may be a major contributor to the erosion of Kenya’s competitiveness. The
authorities attributed the recent inflation in wages to the use of headline consumer price
inflation as the primary criterion for determining wage awards. They agreed that the intended
reversion to productivity-based awards should greatly help to dampen awards.
E. Governance
27.
The government has continued to implement a broad-based strategy to enhance
governance amid an intensive debate on some important gaps in the anticorruption

November.

15

agenda. In the recent public debate, some of Kenya’s main donors have identified important
gaps in the governance agenda, including (a) inadequate funding of governance institutions;
(b) shortcomings in the prosecution branches; and (c) weaknesses in the management of
security procurements. Nevertheless, the appointment of the top management of the KACC
and recent strengthening of the police and Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General
have bolstered the investigative branches of Kenya’s governance system. Translation of these
efforts into a corresponding increase in successful prosecutions of corruption cases hinges on
the effectiveness of the Attorney General’s office. Modification of the Public Office Ethics
Act to provide for the regular review of the asset declarations of prominent officials would
close a major loophole in the governance strategy (MEFE para. 19). The governance agenda
includes also a comprehensive set of actions designed to improve the transparency of the
budget and financial management systems.
28.
The authorities acknowledged that more steps were needed to address
corruption and considered ongoing reforms to produce, disseminate, and audit public
accounts to be critical in this regard. They noted that first, the capacity-building program
in the Ministry of Finance would facilitate the production, on a timely basis, of more
comprehensive and better articulated annual and medium-term budgets and, hence. a more
transparent budget-management process. Second, the ongoing strengthening of public sector
accounting capacity and systems and the requirement that the government produce final
accounts within four months and accounts audited by the Auditor General within nine
months of the end of the fiscal year would greatly facilitate parliamentary scrutiny of public
operations. Moreover, the Auditor General’s report will be a key reference point for the
investigative work of the KACC. Third, the recent restructuring of the Auditor General’s
office had enabled it to begin to conduct more timely audits of the accounts of state bodies,
including parastatals and local governments, and to play a more proactive role in
investigations of potential misuse of public funds, as borne out in the Anglo-Leasing case5
and the recent review of the improper contracting by government officials of commercial
debt. Staff agreed that these steps, with other measures outlined in para. 20 of the MEFP,
would represent important progress toward closing the remaining governance gaps.
29.
The authorities confirmed that their anticorruption strategy also emphasized the
building of sound governance institutions. They noted that, at the political level, the draft
constitution includes many provisions designed to enhance inclusiveness and transparency in
the conduct of public business, including by devolving more authority to local governments.
The draft constitution also enshrines the independence of the judiciary and the public
prosecution office. The authorities confirmed that they were taking steps to address
weaknesses in the prosecution branch by hiring more and better-qualified staff. With regard
to the Anglo-Leasing scandal, they explained that the actions they had taken to address the
issues raised by the scandal were consistent with the law and, in their view, considerably
5

This scandal involved the purchase of equipment at prices well above market, and without following proper
procurement procedures.

stronger than the recent responses of many other African countries to similar events. In this
regard, all the senior officers involved in the scandal have been suspended; the KACC was
asked to initiate detailed investigations, which are still underway and a parliamentary inquiry
was also conducted. While the authorities argued that their efforts were securing important
further progress on governance, they were nevertheless concerned that, as with other priority
programs, the difficult budgetary situation constrained their ability to fund key anticorruption
agencies adequately. They were optimistic that donor assistance would help alleviate the
problem.
F. Public Enterprise Restructuring and Privatization
30.
Delays in forging a consensus to restructure and privatize parastatals have
slowed reforms in this area. The government believes that, in the past, political and rentseeking considerations played a central role in privatization decisions. It has reaffirmed its
strong commitment to privatization and enterprise reform, but wants to build broad
parliamentary support for the reforms. The authorities therefore intend to rely on the
Parliament’s planned consideration, in the near future, the policy paper “Privatization of
State Corporations” to present the rationale for the planned reforms before they resubmit the
Privatization Bill to Parliament. Pending the enactment of the Privatization Bill, the focus
will be on preparing enterprises for privatization, including by conducting detailed reviews of
the financial position of key parastatals.
G. Financial Sector
31.
The authorities agreed that major efforts were needed to strengthen the
financial sector. They indicated their intention to tighten loan classification and provisioning
in January 2005, in line with the recommendations of the recently concluded FSAP (Box 6),
and to strengthen the CBK’s Banking Supervision Department (BSD). While welcoming
these actions, the staff stressed the need for prompt follow-up actions on future
recommendations of the BSD in order to address banking sector problems more decisively
and promptly. The staff also welcomes the proposed amendments to the CBK and Banking
Acts currently before Parliament, which seek to transfer bank regulatory functions from the
Ministry of Finance to the CBK and to remove the provisions that give the Minister of
Finance authority to control interest rates (MEFP para. 22).
32.
The authorities pointed out that large interest rate spreads inhibited bank
lending and economic growth. They explained that while the lowering in mid-2003 of
required banks’ reserves had helped reduce interest rates and interest rate spreads, financial
intermediation, particularly to small and medium-sized firms, continued to be hindered by
relatively large interest rate spreads. Banks have attributed the high spreads to low business
volumes, legal and administrative impediments to the enforcement of contracts, and
inefficiencies in the labor market that had contributed to significant increases in labor costs.
While stressing the importance of addressing these structural problems, the staff pointed out
that interest rate spreads in Kenya were not significantly different from those prevailing in
countries at a similar stage of development.

18

33.
While welcoming the recent decline in the NPLs, the staff stressed that decisive
steps to address the problem of public sector banks were needed to resolve the NPL
problem. The authorities noted that most of the NPLs of public banks were on account of old
government-intermediated credits, as well as from banks’ failure to enforce contracts under
the old regime because of legal, political, and judicial hurdles. They therefore felt that under
the new political order, policies needed to focus on the restructuring of public banks. With
regard to the privatization of public banks, they indicated that caution was needed, as
Box 6. Main Conclusions of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
The FSAP found that although the major elements of a well-developed financial system
are in place, financial intermediation is weak. The main findings are presented below:
•

The legal and judicial framework needs to be strengthened to promote financial sector
development.

•

The banking system has high levels of nonperforming loans and low capitalization and
is vulnerable to shocks that could endanger its stability.

•

To reduce the vulnerabilities, supervisors need to intervene rapidly to deal with problem
financial institutions.

•

Highest priority should be given to restructuring banks and divesting government stakes
in the banking sector; also, the government should reevaluate its role in the
development finance sector.

•

The government is appropriately seeking to bolster the microfinance sector and,
thereby, access to financial services for underserved segments of the population.

•

The authorities are urged to move ahead with reforms of the payments and settlements
systems.

A program of technical assistance is under way to assist the authorities in their financial sector
reform efforts.

experiences in Kenya and other African countries indicated that sales of banks to
multinationals reduced bank penetration to rural areas, and lowered further access to credit of
small and medium-sized firms. The authorities therefore favored a bank privatization
program that would be explicitly linked to the realization of predetermined thresholds of
banking service penetration to rural communities and disadvantaged groups. In line with the
findings of the recent FSAP, the staff noted that, with over 40 commercial banks, Kenya was
well served with banking services and that current efforts to foster microfinance institutions
nationally would help support the rural sector. In addition, the staff supported the World
Bank’s call for a comprehensive financial sector strategy paper to better elaborate the issues
in the sector, including the role of development banks.

19

H. External Trade and Regional Integration
34.
The EAC common external tariff, taking effect in January 2005, is at the center
of government initiatives to promote external trade. The EAC customs union will lower
the number of Kenya’s tariff bands from five to three, the maximum tariff rate from 35 to
25 percent, and the average tariff from 17.2 percent to 10.9 percent. Data on average tariff
and other tax rates among the EAC members and prospective members are provided in
Table C.6 The fiscal and trade impact of the CET for Kenya will, in part, depend on the
effects of the temporary protection that has been accorded to Tanzanian and Ugandan
producers for a specified list of commodities for five years,7 as well as on how potential
conflicts with other regional trade agreements (COMESA in the case of Kenya) are resolved.
The members of the EAC have agreed to maintain, beyond January 2005, existing legal
obligations until these potential conflicts are settled. The authorities indicated that they
expected Kenya to suffer some near-term losses from the implementation of the CET as
domestic production is replaced by cheaper imports. Over the medium term, as economic
reforms are deepened, they expected the economy to benefit from the lowering of tariffs,
which would help foster a more competitive environment and an expansion in exports.

6

Kenya’s nontariff barriers to trade (NTBs) include suspended duties on petroleum products that can be levied
and removed on an ad hoc basis identified in business surveys as trade barriers. Current efforts at improving
customs administration and simplifying import procedures; will facilitate trade.

7

Tanzania and Uganda will eliminate tariffs on all imports except those on an agreed number of commodities—
Tanzania 906, and Uganda 426 tariff lines—for which the tariff will be gradually reduced to zero within up to
five years.

I. External Financing Requirements
35.
Kenya’s projected external financing requirements are high but appear
achievable, based on the experiences of other low-income countries that have
implemented strong policy reforms (Table 8). The World Bank has committed
US$870 million in its Country Assistance Strategy base case for Kenya for FY 2004–07. The
African Development Bank and the European Union are expected to provide significant
budget support under the base case scenario, with other donors also contributing some budget
support. The next Consultative Group meeting for Kenya is scheduled for early 2005.
Reflecting the scaling down of concessional financing since the last staff report, Kenya’s
external debt (in percent of GDP) remains on a declining trend (Table 9) and well below the
thresholds under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. Updated debt sustainability analysis
(Appendix IV) confirms that, under the revised program framework, external debt
sustainability improves compared to the assessment undertaken in November 2003. The
projected increase in domestic borrowing over the near term would only marginally increase
the NPV of central government debt relative to GDP.
36.
As a result of an audit of its external commercial contracts undertaken for
governance reasons, Kenya has recently begun to accumulate some arrears on these
obligations. The government is establishing an escrow account into which the debt service
due on commercial credits will be placed, to be used to settle fully all legitimate debts. In
accordance with the Fund’s policy on lending into arrears, financing assurances reviews will
be conducted under the PRGF arrangement for each disbursement as long as arrears to
private creditors exist. Reflecting that total external obligations to private creditors are low
(an estimated US$296 million at end-2004, or 5.6 percent of Kenya's total external debt
stock), the amount of the arrears expected to be accumulated while the audit is being

21

conducted would be relatively small. The government has expressed its intention to complete
the audit in a timely fashion, and, as noted above, has established an escrow account for the
unpaid amount under those contracts. In light of these considerations, the staff is of the view
that the Kenyan authorities have shown good-faith intentions to resolve the problem.
37.
Details of Kenya’s Paris Club rescheduling for January 2004 are provided in
Box 7. To date, Kenya has signed bilateral agreements with five Paris Club creditors. The
authorities report only one nonParis Club creditor with pre-cut-offdate debt; little progress
has been made in normalizing debt with this creditor. As discussed below, a modest amount
of nonrescheduled arrears to Paris Club creditors were settled by November 2004 rather than
by the due date of July 1, 2004. Table 9 indicates the impact of the Paris Club rescheduling
on Kenya’s debt service ratios over the consolidation period of 2004–07.
III. FIRST REVIEW OF THE ARRANGEMENT
38.
As indicated in the attached MEFP, with regard to the end-December 2003 and
end-March 2004 performance criteria (PC) under the program, Kenya met all of the
structural PC, albeit some with delays, and all but two of the quantitative PC (MEFP
Tables 1 and 2).8 The structural PC on the completion by end-December 2003 of an audit of
the financial position of the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) was observed in February
2004, and that on the submission to Parliament by end-March 2004 of the Banking Act
Amendment Bill was met in June 2004. With regard to the PC on the completion of an audit
of the stock of pending bills and the adoption of measures to provide for their clearing, a
financial audit was completed by December 2004, but the authorities are awaiting the results
of a legal audit of the pending bills before finalizing the clearance plan. The quantitative
continuous PC limiting the contracting of nonconcessional external long-term debt was
breached when financing contracts for two security-related procurements were signed in
December 2003. Subsequently, the authorities cancelled the contracts, thus correcting the
breach. The continuous quantitative PC on the nonaccumulation of external arrears was
breached for June 30, 2004, on two categories of arrears. There was a late payment of the
nonrescheduled component of Paris Club arrears existing at the time of the January 2004
rescheduling, which was required to be settled by July 1, 2004, but was not fully cleared until
November 2004. Some late payments and arrears have also resulted from the suspension of
payments while an audit of all central government commercial credits is conducted.
39.
The MEFP spells out the structural and quantitative performance criteria and
benchmarks (MEFP Tables 3 and 4) to be used in monitoring performance under the
2004/05 program, with target dates of end-March and end-September 2005.9 Targets for
the latter are indicative and will be firmed up in discussions for the second review of the

It also met all but two of the indicative target/performance criteria for end-June 2004.

Previously, the program had end-December and end-June targets.

PRGF arrangement, when the fiscal framework for 2005/06 will be agreed. The government
is taking a number of actions prior to the issuance of the staff report on the first review of the
PRGF arrangement.
IV. OTHER ISSUES
The quality and timeliness of Kenya’s reporting of economic and financial data are
adequate for surveillance and program-monitoring purposes, notwithstanding the need
for improvement in several areas. The staff expressed concerns about the problems
involved in monitoring fiscal performance, in particular domestic arrears. The authorities
indicated that they were addressing these shortcomings with assistance from AFRITAC.
Kenya is a participant in the GDDS.
40.
Anti-money-laundering legislation is being drafted; it is expected to be presented
to parliament by mid-2005.
41.
The CBK has made progress in implementing the recommendations of the 2003
Safeguards Assessment. The authorities are committed to implementing all the
recommendations of the staff (MEFP, para. 27).

23

Box 7. Kenya’s Paris Club Rescheduling
The Paris Club met on January 14-15, 2004, to consider Kenya’s request for debt relief in
the context of the country’s PRGF arrangement. Kenya requested and received Houston
rescheduling terms, despite its IDA-only country status. The agreement rescheduled
US$350 million arrears and maturities falling due in the consolidation period of January 1,
2004, to December 31, 2006, on a total debt service of US$484 million due to Paris Club
creditors during this period. Assuming an additionalUS$52 million in comparable treatment
from other creditors, the relief would total US$402 million. The cutoff date remained
December 31, 1991, as it did for Kenya’s last Paris Club rescheduling in November 2000.
Under the agreement, official development assistance (ODA) credits are to be repaid over
20 years with 10 years grace, at interest rates at least as favorable as the concessional
rates applying to those loans, and commercial credits are to be repaid over 15 years,
including 5 years of grace, with progressive repayments at an appropriate market
interest rate. One hundred percent of service on not-previously rescheduled debt was
rescheduled, while debt service on previously rescheduled debt was treated less generously.1
Sixty percent of arrears to the Paris Club as of end-2003 that had not previously been
rescheduled were rescheduled.
The Paris Club creditors and the Kenyan authorities considered that this rescheduling,
the first under the Evian Approach, should allow Kenya to graduate from future Paris
Club treatments. The deadline for signing bilateral agreements has been extended until
December 31, 2004.
___________________
1

For previously rescheduled debt, 100 percent of total debt service (principal and interest) due in 2004
and 100 percent of principal and 50 percent of interest due in 2005 was rescheduled, while no debt
service on previously rescheduled debt due in 2006 was treated.

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
Kenya has made significant gains during the past year. Broad agreement has been
reached on most of the constituent elements of the new constitution, and a consensus appears
to be emerging on the remaining contentious issues; a rebound in economic activity is under
way; the recent sharp growth in Kenya’s domestic debt has been arrested; the governance
architecture and key institutions have been upgraded and enforcement of elements of the
apparatus strengthened; and revenue administration has been enhanced.
43.
However, major challenges remain. The political outlook is uncertain; inflationary
pressures have increased with monetary policy responding too slowly; the restructuring of the
fiscal position necessary for the realization of the MDGs has barely begun; some important
gaps in the governance architecture have yet to be filled; implementation of key structural
reforms has been slow, constrained, in part, by weak international support; and concerted
actions are needed to address the recent erosion in Kenya’s international competitiveness.

24

Medium-term growth hinges on deepening reforms and addressing capacity constraints, and
the resumption of strong donor support if the authorities are to fulfill their appropriately
ambitious vision for Kenya.
44.
Decisive actions are needed to reduce inflation, which requires an early
tightening of monetary policy. The continued tightening of monetary policy envisaged
under the program should bring real interest rates back to positive levels. Otherwise, the
persistence of inflationary pressures could affect expectations and complicate the authorities’
ability to resist wage pressures and the restoration of a competitive economic environment.
The staff supports the authorities’ decision to maintain the current managed floating
exchange rate system that has served Kenya well in responding to external shocks.
45.
Fiscal policy faces the challenge of balancing the commitment to fiscal
consolidation with the support for poverty reduction programs. In particular, managing
the near-term temporary increase in domestic borrowing and domestic debt will be a major
challenge. The increase in domestic borrowing planned for 2004/05 appears reasonable in
view of the large shortfalls in donor inflows and likely contractionary effects of the expected
rise in interest rates. For the following year and over the medium term, the budget should
begin the consolidation. In this regard, the wide range of measures taken by the authorities to
strengthen revenue collection is a welcome development. This will need to be supported by
decisive efforts to control and prioritize expenditure programs, determined steps to cut
nonessential outlays, and the resumption of strong donor support.
46.
Improved expenditure management is essential to achieving rapid poverty
reduction and economic growth. The authorities’ program outlines promising steps in this
direction, including the strengthening of the expenditure commitment control system, an
early start and lengthening of the budget preparation period, enhanced the links between the
annual budget and the MTEF, a strengthening of the MTEF as a budget management tool,
and consolidation of the budget management organizational structures. These measures, if
effectively implemented, should hasten the trend toward pro-poor spending and enhance
budget transparency and accountability.
47.
The authorities’ increased attention to actions to improve Kenya’s
competitiveness is welcome. To help address this issue, they have adopted a multifaceted
strategy that includes streamlining the regulatory framework, improving essential
infrastructure, reforming the labor market, and liberalizing trade. Each of these initiatives
represents an important step in the right direction. However, there remains scope for further
progress. The intended change in the private sector wage-setting mechanism to arrest the
recent inflation in wage demands is welcome and should not be delayed.
48.
The government is making progress in liberalizing external trade. The lowering
of the average external tariff, in the context of the EAC, is a step in the right direction in that
it will foster a more competitive domestic environment and expand exports over the medium
term.

25

49.
The authorities are pursuing a broad-based strategy to promote good
governance, but closing gaps in the anticorruption agenda remains a priority. The
restructuring, during the past year, of the police, the judiciary, the Office of the Ombudsman,
and the Auditor General are noteworthy steps. In addition, the recent establishment of the
KACC is an important milestone. The authorities’ program also includes other steps that
would go a long way toward filling important gaps in the present governance framework,
including the regular verification of asset declarations of senior officials and the production
of budget outlook papers, which should make parliamentary oversight of fiscal operations
more effective. Long overdue steps have now been taken to strengthen prosecution capacity,
which should help restitution and deterrence efforts, and to increase oversight over military
procurement. Steadfast implementation, including enforcement, will be key to the success of
the fight against corruption, and donors have an important role to play in supporting key
governance institutions.
50.
Public enterprise restructuring and privatization are essential to promoting
strong economic growth. The delay in the enactment of the Privatization Bill has helped
foster inefficient enterprises and slowed economic growth. The authorities need to redouble
their efforts to secure parliamentary support for the bill. Establishing the Privatization
Commission is important to managing privatization transparently; transparency is a key
ingredient in building and maintaining public support for the reforms. The decision to begin a
detailed systematic assessment of the financial position of key parastatals is welcome. In
addition to establishing the magnitude of government contingent liabilities, the assessments
should help expedite the retrenchment process.
51.
The ongoing reform of the financial system should help enhance financial
intermediation. The program of transferring the regulatory framework from the government
to the CBK, revising banking legislation to remove the restrictive provisions for banks’
pricing decisions, tightening prudential regulations, and restructuring state-owned banks is
essential to strengthening financial sector performance and increasing financial
intermediation. The recent improvement in indicators of banking sector performance,

supports the authorities’ focus on promoting financial intermediation in rural areas, as well as

resources. This will require both a broadening of the scope and outreach of microfinance
institutions and a more coherent and targeted strategy for promoting development finance
institutions.

nonobservance of quantitative PC,10 as well as the authorities’ request for a rephasing of

the PRGF arrangement of SDR 50 million.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Kenya be held in
accordance with the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on
July 15, 2002.

Sources: Kenyan authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ This table assumes that Kenya's PRGF program is augmented by SDR 50 million, as requested by the authorities.
Without the augmentation, there would be a financing gap of US$ 74 million in FY 2004/05.
2/ This entry is believed to include underrecorded tourism earnings.
3/ Projections under the first-year program for fiscal year 2004/05 are not available because a switch from
a calendar year to a fiscal year BOP took place since the November 2003 staff report, which provided only a calendar year BOP.

1/ The table assumes that the remaining amount of the PRGF arrangement of SDR 175 million agreed in November 2003 (which is SDR 150 million as of 10/31/04) will be disbursed,
along with an augmentation of SDR 50 milllion requested by the authorities, to be disbursed in two equal installements of SDR 25 million at the time of the completion of the first and second
reviews, in addition to the SDR 25 million disbursments at the completion of each of those reviews expected under the original program.
Debt service to the Fund was estimated by the Kenya mission staff since FIN projections do not reflect the requested augmentation.
2/ Projections are based on current rates of charge, including burden-sharing charges where applicable, for purchases in the General Resources Account,
and on current interest rates for Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), and Trust Fund. The current SDR interest rate is assumed for net use of SDRs.

Letter of Intent
Nairobi, December 6, 2004
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D. C. 24031
Dear Mr. Rato:
1.
The annexed Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) describes
our performance to date under the program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement and outlines the policies we plan to implement during the
remainder of 2004/05 (July/June). Our goal remains that of reducing poverty by creating an
environment conducive to the promotion of strong economic and employment growth as
outlined in the Investment Program for the Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and
Employment Creation (ERS).
2.
Considerable progress has been made under the program. A rebound in economic
growth has begun. The increase in domestic debt has been arrested. However, major
challenges remain, which we are addressing in the context of the program for 2004/05. In this
regard, to mitigate the negative effect on the balance of payments resulting from the recent
sharp rise in oil prices and drought, induced food imports, we would like to request an
SDR 50 million augmentation of the access under the PRGF arrangement.
3.
All the quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2003 were met, except for
the continuous performance criteria on the contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional
external long-term debt and on the accumulation of external payments arrears. With regard to
the former, the nonconcessional external long-term debts that were contracted in
contravention of the program understandings have been cancelled. The continuous
quantitative performance criterion on the nonaccumulation of external arrears was breached
after June 30, 2004 with regard to two categories of arrears. There was a late payment of the
nonrescheduled share of Paris Club arrears existing at the time of the January 2004
rescheduling, which was required to be settled by July 1, 2004, but was not fully settled until
November 2004. An accumulation of additional external arrears may result from a
suspension of payments due to an audit of all central government contracts of commercial
external debt that we are undertaking to enhance public expenditure management and good
governance. While the audit is on-going, the debt-service due on these loans will be placed in
an escrow account. We will use this account to resolve any arrears promptly and fully, once
the underlying debt obligation is found by the audit to be legitimate.
4.
All but one of the structural performance criteria related to the second disbursement
have been completed, albeit two were completed with delays. The structural performance
criterion on the completion of an audit on the financial position of the National Social

42

ATTACHMENT

Security Fund (NSSF) by end-December 2003 was completed in February 2004, and that on
the submission to parliament of a Banking Act Amendment Bill by end-March 2004 was
done in June 2004. Regarding the end-December 2003 structural performance criterion
concerning the completion of an audit of the stock of pending bills and the adoption of
measures to provide for their clearing, we completed the financial audit, but are awaiting the
results of a legal audit of the pending bills before finalizing the clearance plan.
5.
We request waivers for the nonobservance of the five performance criteria detailed
above. We also request a rephasing of the remaining disbursements under the arrangement.
This latter request reflects the delay in completing the first review under the program.
6.
The MEFP spells out the quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks, as well as
the structural performance criteria and benchmarks to be used in monitoring performance
under the 2004/05 program. The end-September 2005 targets are indicative. These
performance clauses will be firmed up once a more comprehensive macroeconomic
framework, as well as the budget for 2005/06, is developed. The government is taking a
number of prior actions to the issuance of the staff report on the first review of the PRGF
arrangements.
7.
The government believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate
to achieve the objectives of its program, but it will take any further measures that may
become appropriate for this purpose. Kenya will consult with the Fund on the adoption of
these measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in
accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultation. In particular, the government will
consult with the Fund if it decides to proceed to implement any program that would result in
a modification of the fiscal targets under the program. Kenya will continue to provide the
Fund with all the information in a timely manner as required to monitor progress in
implementing policies and achieving the objectives of the PRGF arrangement. We expect to
complete the first progress report of our ERS by June 2005.
Sincerely yours,
_______/s/______

ANNEX I

KENYA
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies for 2004/05
Under the PRGF Arrangement
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
In 2003/04 (July/June), Kenya began to build the foundation for a new liberal
democratic order, as well as for lasting economic prosperity. In the political arena,
considerable effort was devoted to constitutional reform. The government is committed to
completing the constitutional review as soon as possible because as a new constitution is
essential to laying the legal basis for strengthening Kenya’s governance structures and for
sustained peace and stability—key ingredients for promoting strong economic growth and
prosperity. On the economic front, an important beginning has been made to tackling
Kenya’s major macroeconomic vulnerabilities and addressing impediments to strong
economic growth and poverty reduction. However, progress in implementing some key
economic reforms has been impeded by the large amount of time devoted to constitutional
reform, capacity constraints in key ministries, and the slow resumption of donor budgetary
assistance.
2.
The government is committed to strong reforms, but the approach has been
modified to take account of lower budgetary support and capacity constraints. The
government remains committed to implementing policies aimed at promoting strong
economic growth and poverty reduction, as well as to fostering an environment conducive to
private-sector-led growth and the expansion of employment opportunities. The government’s
approach is spelled out in the Investment Program for the Economic Recovery Strategy for
Wealth and Employment Creation (ERS)—Kenya’s PRSP, which was considered by the
Executive Boards of the Fund and the World Bank (WB) in May 2004. The diagnosis of the
main economic challenges facing Kenya, as well as the broad economic reform strategy,
remains as outlined in the ERS and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
(MEFP) for 2003/04. This memorandum explains how the government reform agenda and
the macroeconomic framework underpinning the PRGF-supported program have been
modified to cope with the lower donor budgetary assistance now foreseen and the steps that
will be taken to address capacity problems.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRESS UNDER THE PROGRAM
3.
Most of the performance criteria (PC) under the PRGF arrangement were met.
All quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2003 were met; the continuous
quantitative PC on the contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional external long-term
debt was breached when two security-related clauses were concluded in December 2003, but
these were cancelled shortly thereafter. The continuous PC on external payments arrears was
breached after June 30, 2004, on to two classes of arrears. There was a late payment of the
nonrescheduled share of Paris Club arrears existing at the time of the January 2004
rescheduling, which had to be settled by July 1, 2004, but was not fully paid until

44

ATTACHMENT
ANNEX I

November 2004. Arrears also arose through an audit of all central government contracts of
commercial external debt, which the government is conducting for governance and public
expenditure management reasons; while the audit is proceeding these loans are not being
serviced, resulting in relatively modest external arrears. The structural PC on the completion
of an audit on the financial position of the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) by
end-December 2003 was completed in February 2004, and that on the submission to
Parliament of the Banking Act Amendment Bill by end-March 2004 was done in June 2004.
Regarding the PC on the completion of an audit of the stock of pending bills and the adoption
of measures to provide for their clearing, the financial audit was completed, but finalizing the
clearance plan is awaiting the results of a legal audit of the pending bills that is expected to
be completed by June, 2005.

The Letter of Intent (LOI) to which this MEFP is annexed requests waivers for the
nonobservance of the five performance criteria detailed above and a rephasing of
disbursements under the PRGF arrangement.
5.
Economic developments in 2003/04 were mixed. Real GDP growth at 2.1 percent
was moderately above program expectations, despite the sharp increase in oil prices and the
emergence of a drought late in the fiscal year. For the same reasons, overall consumer price
inflation was well above projections. Excluding food and oil, inflation, at 4 percent at
end-June 2004, was also higher than programmed, reflecting an easing of monetary policy.
These outcomes together with only moderate donor inflows and higher oil prices, contributed
to the depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate of the shilling.
6.
The easing of monetary policy in 2003/04 to support economic recovery resulted
in declining interest rates and rising inflation. Following the reduction in the legal reserve
requirement from 10 percent to 6 percent in July 2003, the reserve money multiplier rose
from 4.9 to 5.3, resulting in a 13 percent expansion of broad money in 2003/04 against the
7 percent projected under the program. The consequent rise in liquidity led to negative real
yields on money market instruments. In response to the decline in interest rates, bank credit
to the private sector grew substantially.
7.
Net domestic borrowing and the NPV of total central government debt (in
percent of GDP) were well within the program targets for 2003/04.This outcome
reflected a number of developments:
•

Stronger than budgeted revenue performance, which benefited, in part, from the
aggressive collection of tax arrears and the implementation of new administrative
measures;

•

Tightened management of the recurrent budget, in the face of persistent wage
pressures;

•

Delays in the recapitalization of the National Bank of Kenya, which had been
programmed to cost about Ksh 12 billion.

45

8.
Reflecting the slight decline in gross investment and a marked fall in the national
savings ratio that was partly attributable to drought-related shifts in expenditure
toward increased consumption, the external current account deficit (before grants)
expanded relative to 2002/03, but was lower than programmed in 2003/04. The modest
fall in gross investment was partly the result of lower public investment, because the pace of
execution of the development budget was well below the budgeted level; problems in
applying the transitional procurement system introduced early in the year; and lower than
expected donor inflows that was partly the result of weaknesses in accounting for
donor-funded development projects. A sharper than anticipated decline of private savings
was partially offset by a significant increase in public savings. The buildup of foreign
reserves was, in dollar terms, lower than the program target; however, it exceeded the target
after an adjustment for the shortfall in external donor support.
9.
Progress in implementing structural reforms has been mixed. There were some
delays in implementing reforms in the public expenditure, financial sector, and parastatal
areas. The lack of progress in moving toward a comprehensive medium-term expenditure
framework, consistent with PRSP priorities, as well as in instituting a more robust
expenditure management system, is largely attributable to organizational and capacity
constraints at the Ministry of Finance. Financial sector and parastatal reforms suffered from
capacity constraints and a lack of consensus on the objectives and modalities for conducting
the reforms that has also delayed the enactment of the Privatization Bill. New wage-setting
mechanisms for public employees have now been developed. Significant progress was made
in building a robust governance architecture and in enforcing elements of the anticorruption
regulations. Notable actions included the enactment of the Anti-Corruption and Economic
Crimes and Public Officer Ethics Acts in May 2003, completion of asset declarations by all
public officers in November 2003, major restructurings of the judiciary and the police over
2003/04, and the establishment of the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission (KACC) in
May 2004.
III. MEDIUM-TERM FRAMEWORK AND POLICIES
10.
The medium-term macroeconomic framework underpinning the reform agenda
has been modified to take account of the more difficult environment now foreseen for
the medium term. In particular, (a) the terms of trade are now projected to deteriorate
moderately instead of the modest gains envisaged earlier; (b) donor assistance would fall
significantly short of earlier expectation; (c) capacity constraints in key areas are more severe
than assumed under the program; and (d) some key reforms in the financial and parastatal
sectors have taken longer to complete, partly because of the crowding out of the legislative
agenda, in the recent past, by constitutional reform deliberations.
11.
In response to these developments, the government has modified its reform
strategy in several respects. The domestic revenue effort has been strengthened and
expenditure restructuring and management reforms accelerated. In addition, the domestic
borrowing targets have been relaxed somewhat. Although these changes will result in a
moderate increase in domestic budgetary resources and in an improvement in the

46

ATTACHMENT
ANNEX I

productivity of public spending, public investment will be scaled down over the medium
term when compared to the original program assumptions. Partly for this reason, the
realization of the economic and employment growth and poverty reduction objectives set out
in the MEFP for 2003/04 would take longer to achieve.
12.
Notwithstanding the adverse effects of the more difficult foreign environment,
the external current account deficit would be lower than projected earlier as investment
would be markedly lower than envisaged in the MEFP. On the other hand, the ratio of
savings to GDP would be broadly as assumed earlier. The outlook for donor inflows would
continue to dominate public investment activity, which is a key factor in promoting private
sector activity. Partly for this reason and the slow response of private investment to the
reforms, private investment would be significantly below program expectation. Reflecting
the above developments, the net foreign reserve targets and the medium term would be
somewhat less ambitious than foreseen in the original three-year program. The medium-term
inflation objectives would remain as spelled out in last year’s Economic Memorandum,
although monetary policy will be tightened to correct for some overshooting in 2003/04.
IV. ECONOMIC POLICIES FOR 2004/05
A. Macroeconomic Outlook
13.
A moderate pickup in economic activity is foreseen. Projected real GDP growth at
2.7 percent in 2004/05 would be lower than the 3.1 percent expected in the original program,
reflecting in part the negative effects of a more difficult external environment – high oil
prices and depressed prices for some traditional exports, as well as the impact of the drought
on agricultural production. However, the tourism sector is projected to perform strongly as it
recovers from the adverse effects of last year’s travel ban. The drought and high oil prices are
expected to contribute to a pickup in overall consumer price inflation to well above earlier
projections.
B. Fiscal Policy
14.
The eventual lowering of the domestic debt ratio to GDP remains the key focus
of the program. The budget for 2004/05 that is before parliament targeted an overall deficit
(before grants) of 7.2 percent of GDP and implied domestic borrowing of 4.7 percent of GDP
(in the event that the envisaged budgetary support was not forthcoming). A revision to the
budget announced on June 12, 2004 will be presented to parliament during the first quarter of
2005. Pending this revision, the new fiscal framework will be implemented through quarterly
releases of expenditures. The revised budget assumes that domestic borrowing would amount
to the equivalent of 2.5 percent of GDP. The fiscal framework envisages a marked decline in
both the overall and primary deficits relative to ERS targets, wholly on account of the
significant shortfall of donor budgetary support. For the same reason and the need to preserve
some essential social and economic programs, domestic borrowing would exceed ERS
expectations. Some crowding out of private activity is expected, as the public sector would
absorb a sizable proportion of projected financial savings. Reflecting the projected domestic

47

ATTACHMENT
ANNEX I

borrowing, domestic debt would remain broadly unchanged at 22 percent of GDP compared
with the original program target of 24.7 percent of GDP. The domestic debt-ratio is expected
to decline thereafter.
15.
New administrative measures are projected to raise revenue collection. The
coming into effect on January 1, 2005 of the East African Community (EAC) Customs
Protocol involving a lowering of the top tariff rate from 35 percent to 25 percent and the
reduction in tariff bands from 5 to 3 is projected to result in revenue losses of 0.3 percent of
GDP. The program includes several measures aimed at raising compliance and expanding the
tax base. These include:
•

Creation of one-stop shops that bring together business licensing and tax payments
operations;

•

Full integration of the VAT and Income Tax Departments in a single function-based
Domestic Tax Department (DTD);

•

strengthening and rationalizing the Large Taxpayer Office (LTO);

•

Introduction of computerized audits for LTO and DTD;

•

Implementation, on a pilot basis, of simplified customs procedures; and

•

Modernization of customs computer systems.

These measures, together with the ones implemented in 2003/04, are expected to strengthen
revenue performance, significantly raise the efficiency of the tax system over the medium
term, and lay the basis for a further reform of the tax system, beginning later this fiscal year.
The medium-term goal is to broaden the tax base, as well as simplify and improve the
neutrality and revenue-yielding capacity of the system.
16.
Government remains firmly committed to the reorientation of public
expenditures in favor of growth and poverty-related outlays. In line with this approach,
government employment for critical social and economic sectors (including teachers,
healthcare, and security personnel) will rise moderately but overall civil service positions
would fall by about 2,000 through retrenchments and attrition. Several developments are
expected to raise the inflexibility of the budget and thus limit the scope for a more aggressive
reallocation of spending to priority areas. These include the projected rise in interest
payments; the continuing sharp increase in pension payments that is partly attributable to the
recent retrenchment of public servants; and the impact of persistent wage pressures on the
wage bill; and the lower-than-expected external budget support. To stay on course with the
expenditure restructuring program and move toward fiscal sustainability, the government has
initiated several actions that should, over time, result in a significant reduction in noncore
outlays. These include developing new wage-setting mechanisms for public employees,
rationalizing diplomatic missions with a view to reducing the number of staff, and privatizing

48

ATTACHMENT
ANNEX I

parastatals. In addition, the role of the state in the provision and funding of university
education is under review. The budget includes a Ksh 2 billion provision for the payment of
pending bills in 2004/05 following the completion of a legal audit in December 2004.
However, if creditors contest the outcome of the audit, the process could take longer. The
remaining bills will be paid off over a two-year period. The budget also includes a provision
of Ksh 1 billion for the rehabilitation of stalled projects. Government’s objective is to sell
most of these projects and to rehabilitate the remaining ones in priority areas in the context of
the regular development budget operations. As a result of the ongoing audit of all central
government contracts of commercial external debt, some external payments arrears are
accumulating. In managing the fiscal program, all the debt-service on these obligations will
be paid on the due dates into an escrow account to facilitate prompt payment once the
underlying obligations are found to be legitimate.
17.
A robust public expenditure management system is essential to putting the
economy on a sustainable, rapid, and poverty-reducing growth path and to increasing
the transparency of public operations. Government has therefore initiated steps designed
to build a sound expenditure management system, including:
•

Completing the budget outlook paper for 2005/06 by November 2004 that would
provide a link between the budget and ERS priorities;

•

Expanding the comprehensiveness of the three-year medium-term expenditure
framework (MTEF), as well as the coverage of the programs included in the protected
social programs;

•

Strengthening the links between the MTEF and the annual budget system;

•

Improving budget transparency by adopting the classification system proposed in the
Government Financial Statistics Manual for all budget votes;

•

Broadening the consultative mechanisms used in the preparation of sectoral programs
and medium-term budgets;

•

Creating over time, an Integrated Financial Management System, while strengthening
the expenditure commitment control system (ECCS) in the interim. Full application of
the ECCS will help to prevent a build up of new arrears; and

•

Strengthening procurement systems and accounting capacity and practices in line
ministries, as well as procedures. The government is doing its utmost to facilitate the
enactment of the Procurement Bill by March 2005.

18.
Public service reforms have been stepped up. This will help to re-establish control
over the wage bill, address capacity constraints in key ministries, and promote the creation of
a more efficient public service. To this end, the government has introduced new wage-setting
guidelines for public employees, consistent with reducing, over the medium term, the wage

49

ATTACHMENT
ANNEX I

bill as a proportion of revenue over the medium term. The terms and conditions of service for
top management in the government and state bodies will also be streamlined. Finally, new
regulations emphasizing merit as a key determinant for promotion have been established.
Capacity building is being emphasized at all levels of government, particularly in ministries
essential to the realization of the ERS. In this connection, several steps have been taken to
strengthen capacity and streamline the Ministry of Finance, including consolidation of the
planning and budget functions within the Ministry, the setting up of a robust debt
management unit, and enhancing capacity and mechanisms for managing and monitoring
macroeconomic and structural reforms. With the assistance of private consultants, the
Ministries of Education, Health, and Agriculture are also being restructured.
C. Monetary Policy
19.
The monetary program for 2004/05 is designed to reduce underlying inflation to
3.5 percent. The inflation objective would be sought largely through reserve money
targeting, with broad money (M3X) as the intermediate target and open market (repurchase
and reverse) operations as the main instrument. Assuming that the money multiplier
increases moderately in response to the expected pickup in interest rates, the program is
consistent with targeting a growth rate of reserve money of 3.8 percent. To implement the
monetary program, the CBK will sterilize, on a timely basis, any excess liquidity, thereby
leaving interest rates to be determined by market forces in line with the monetary program.
With Fund technical assistance, the auction system for government bonds will be improved.
The government will continue to implement a flexible exchange rate system, which has
served the economy well in absorbing fluctuations in external conditions. CBK’s intervention
in the foreign exchange market will be limited to meeting the net foreign assets target under
the program and to smoothing disruptive short-term fluctuations.
D. Structural Reforms
20.
The measures under the program will reinforce government efforts to promote good
governance. The following are the main elements of the strategy:
•

Continued strengthening of the governance architecture and enforcement of key
anticorruption laws and regulations. This includes full enforcement of the
provisions of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes and Public Officer Ethics
Acts 2003, as well as implementation of the United Nations Convention against
Corruption and Ratification of the African Union Convention on Corruption.

•

Enhancing the effectiveness of key anticorruption investigative agencies. These
include the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission, the government’s principal
investigative body whose capacity has been greatly improved since the swearing in of
senior officials in September 2004. An additional step entails the hiring of key
personnel, targeted for completion by July 2005.

50

ATTACHMENT
ANNEX I

•

Continuing efforts to build adequate prosecution capacity for handling the
expected expansion in corruption-related case-loads. The primary focus is on the
Department of Public Prosecution, the government’s principal prosecuting authority,
which has recently established separate units to address corruption, serious crime,
fraud, and asset forfeiture. Completion of the capacity-building program is targeted for
early 2005.

•

Developing systems for annual declaration and verification of wealth, assets, and
liabilities of ministers and other senior public officials as provided for under the
Public Officers Ethics Act 2003. The strategy includes computerization of wealth
declaration forms which has already been initiated; the submission to Parliament by
April 2005 of an amendment to the Act to provide for the annual verification of asset
declarations by the KACC; and follow-up on the commitment by the Cabinet
Committee against Corruption in November 2004 to the voluntary publication of
assets.

•

Developing a robust program of asset recovery and restitution. The Kenyan
restitution strategy is designed to follow the standard three distinct phases, namely,
international freezing of assets; restitution and vesting in the aggrieved country; and
domestic recovery of returned assets, if nonmonetary. A restitution advisory group
comprising the Department of Governance and Ethics, the Kenya Anti-Corruption
Commission, and the Department of Public Prosecutions has been established.

•

Deepening transparency in the conduct of public operations. Elements of the
program include strengthening the public sector budget and financial management
system through timely production of accounts by all public institutions, auditing and
presentation to Parliament of the accounts, and production of comprehensive annual
and medium-term expenditure frameworks, consistent with ERS priorities.

•

Improving the procurement system, including those for security-related
operations. Key aspects of the program are enactment by Parliament of the Public
Procurement and Disposal Bill 2004, which would also provide for the establishment
of the Public Procurement Oversight Authority (PPOA), with autonomy on matters of
Public Procurement; formulation of new Public Procurement and Disposal regulations
to implement the Act; development of a public procurement Directorate/Oversight
Authority Strategic Plan 2005–10; preparation of the Training and Capacity-Building
Program for procurement personnel in the public sector and an action plan for the
proposed public procurement reforms activities, in consultation with stakeholders; and
a deepening of the transparency of the procurement process by expanding the
participation of stakeholders in the oversight of the public procurement process, and
establishing an appeals body to deal with complaints; periodic media publication of
the awarding of contracts in the media; and the development of IT capacity to
facilitate dissemination of public procurement information to the public.

51

ATTACHMENT

•

Addressing the outcomes of recent initiatives to address past economic crimes.
Major areas of focus are the Goldenberg Commission of Inquiry, which has begun to
throw light on the single most debilitating series of corrupt transactions in Kenyan
history, and the Presidential Commission on Illegal and Irregular Allocations of Public
Land.

•

Further upgrading key public agencies. The strategy includes the implementation of
the recommendations of the task force on reform of the police beginning
December 2004, addressing issues of retraining, strengthening oversight mechanisms,
and corruption; corruption prevention in the civil service initiated under the auspices
of the Public Service Integrity Programme (PSIP) of the Directorate of Personnel
Management of the Office of the President in conjunction with the KACC and
strengthening the Governance Justice Law and Order Sector Reform Program, a
sectorwide development strategy based on recognition of the need for
contemporaneous reforms within the sector as a whole.

•

Enhancing public interaction with the government on governance. This will
involve a Public Complaints Unit (PCU) to serve as a central referral and monitoring
and evaluation unit under the aegis of the Department of Governance and Ethics, in
conjunction with the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs.

21.
The program will set the stage for an acceleration of parastatal reforms once the
Privatization Bill is enacted. The government considers parastatal restructuring and
privatization as an important element of its ERS. Pending parliamentary consideration and
ratification of the bill—now foreseen by April 2005—that will institutionalize a more
transparent mechanism for privatizing public enterprises, the government will initiate by
December 2004 a comprehensive review of the financial position of key parastatals. In
addition to identifying the contingent liabilities of the government, the information produced
by the review will be essential in developing privatization options. Moreover, following the
recent setting up of a Bank Restructuring and Privatization Unit in the Ministry of Finance,
the restructuring of the National Bank of Kenya has begun. As part of this process, at the
next Annual General Meeting of the NBK board around, April 2005, all state nominated
Board members of the bank will be replaced by independent professional directors; and
pending completion of the restructuring process. NBK will desist from disposing assets, and
raising its liabilities with CBK from the end-June 2004 position. In addition, its outstanding
loans and advances will not exceed the end-June 2004 level. Moreover, the government will
prepare by March 2005 a time-bound plan for divesting public ownership and control of
other public banks.
22.
The government is implementing measures designed to strengthen the financial
system. Amendments to the CBK and Banking Acts, which are before parliament, provide
for the transfer of virtually all banking sector regulatory and supervisory authority from the
Ministry of Finance to the Central Bank; the removal of a section of the Banking Act
requiring prior approval of the Minister of Finance when setting banks’ fees and charges; and
changes in the definition of a significant shareholder, as well as in the fit—and—proper

52

ATTACHMENT
ANNEX I

criteria for managers and significant shareholders. New regulations tightening loan
provisioning and classification will be introduced in January 2005. In addition, a review of
the management and financial position of the NSSF will be completed by March 2005 that
will set the stage for the restructuring of the Fund.
23.
Several actions are under consideration to enhance Kenya’s competitiveness
position. The current practice of raising the minimum wage on a yearly basis will be
discontinued. Henceforth, the minimum wage will be reviewed once every two-year period,
on the basis of wage trends in the informal sector and formal sector productivity gains for
unskilled labor. In addition, new guidelines for wage arbitration by the Industrial Court will
be issued by March 2005 that will emphasize productivity change as the key criterion for
wage adjustments.
24.
The government will continue to emphasize trade reform and regional
integration. In the context of the EAC, the external tariff and number of tariff bands will be
reduced, which will result in a fall in the average tariff rate from 16.2 percent to 10.9 percent.
As a result, and after taking account of the absence of non-tariff-barriers, Kenya’s rating
under the IMF’s trade restrictiveness index is expected to fall significantly, resulting in a
more open trade regime. This will also help to foster a more competitive environment.
Furthermore, the government will, by December 2004, complete a trade policy strategy that
will spell out the reforms needed to enhance efficiency and international competitiveness,
including additional trade reforms in the context of the East African Community. Many of
the measures covered above are also part of a broad package of reforms that the government
is taking to improve the investment climate in Kenya. Capacity building in the government
will result in better quality public services. Improved governance and better fiscal
management will translate into improved private sector confidence in the Kenyan economy.
Many priority projects under the ERS, such as the upgrading of the road network, the
concessioning of railway operations, and streamlining of port operations, will feed directly
into an improved business environment by lowering the costs of production.
E. Poverty and Social Impact Analysis
25.
Poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) of key policy reforms will be
conducted. Terms of reference for a PSIA of the EAC tariff reform and a possible
further lowering of the tariff rates within the context of the EAC, is under
consideration. The study will assess the likely impact of the trade reforms on the cost of
living of the poor, the main economic sectors, employment, and the regions likely to suffer
the most. This will help to fine tune the reforms and the development of appropriate
mitigating measures.
F. External Financing
26.
While lower than projected in the November 2003 MFEP because of the scaling
down in projected investment, the external financing requirements for 2004/05 of
US$ 1,245 million incorporates the effects of higher import payments stemming from

53

ATTACHMENT
ANNEX I

the increase in oil prices and drought-related food imports. The economic reform agenda
and the government’s commitments under the program that is supported by the PRGF
arrangement are expected to assist in mobilizing donor financial support. The World Bank
has indicated in its May 2004 Country Assistance Strategy for Kenya a base-case
commitment of US$140 million of budgetary support under the Programmatic Structural
Adjustment Credit (PSAC) and Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC) facilities, with a
disbursement of US$75 million expected in late FY2004/05, and of US$65 million in early
FY2005/06. The AfDB has indicated that it plans to disburse US$21 million of program
support in 2004/05, and the European Union is projected to disburse US$60 million of
program support in early 2005. Disbursement of these resources, as well as the envisaged
project support and private financing in FY2004/05, under the PRGF arrangement and the
debt relief of about US$130 million from Paris Club creditors, will cover the estimated
financing need of about US$ 1.2 billion in 2004/05.
G. Safeguards and Statistics Issues
27.
The government remains committed to protecting the financial soundness of the
CBK, and to adhering to the principles of good governance and best practices,
including those encapsulated in the IMF’s safeguards policy. A safeguards assessment of
the CBK conducted in September 2003, found that the Bank had made notable progress in
strengthening its safeguards since the December 2000 on-site assessment. The bank is
committed to implementing measures to address the remaining vulnerabilities, and to further
strengthening the CBK’s operations.
28.
On statistical issues, the government has released a revised set of national
accounts data. The government is also taking steps to improve the monitoring of fiscal data,
in particular, the preparation, on a regular basis, of summary statistics on domestic arrears
and pending bills. Moreover, the government intends to develop a framework for
systematically monitoring productivity changes in the economy, and to produce, on a regular
basis, trade data. Kenya participates in the General Data Dissemination System project for
Anglophone Africa. A statistics ROSC will be conducted in early 2005.
H. Program Monitoring for 2004/05
29.
Technical memorandum of understanding (TMU). The program will be monitored
using the definitions, data sources, and frequency of monitoring set out in the accompanying
TMU. The government will make available to Fund staff all data appropriately reconciled
and on a timely basis, as specified in the TMU.
30.
Prior actions. The government is taking a number of actions prior to the issuance of
the staff report on the first review of the PRGF arrangement. The prior actions are described
in this memorandum (Table 3).
31.
Performance criteria and benchmarks. Table 4 shows the quantitative performance
criteria and benchmarks to be used in monitoring performance in 2004/05. Structural
performance criteria and benchmarks, with corresponding dates, are identified in Table 3.

Program review. The second review under the PRGF arrangement will be completed
no later than end-June 2005. This review will focus on the restructuring of expenditure in
favor of social and economic spending; actions to enhance competitiveness; progress in
rationalizing the financial system; progress in improving the auction system for government
debt-instruments taking into account the recommendations of the November 2004 MFD
technical assistance mission; and the fiscal implications of restructuring the National Social
Security Fund. The third review under the PRGF arrangement is expected to be completed no
later than end-December 2005.

KENYA
Technical Memorandum of Understanding
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Kenyan authorities and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of the quantitative and
structural performance criteria and benchmarks for the second annual program (for 2004/05,
July to June) under the three-year arrangement supported by the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF), as well as the related reporting requirements.
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND BENCHMARKS
A.

Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)

2.
Definition. The NFA of the CBK are defined as the average over the calendar month
of the test dates of the difference between the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) holdings of
gross official reserves (excluding crown agents and reserve tranche, pledged, swapped, or
any encumbered reserves assets, including but not limited to reserve assets used as collateral
or guarantees for third-party external liabilities) and its foreign liabilities (including IMF
loans and other short- and long-term liabilities) of the CBK. Exchange rates prevailing on
September 28, 2001 will be used to convert the NFA into Kenya shillings at the end of each
test period. Table 4 in Annex I of the Letter of Intent, dated December 6, 2004, shows the
floors on NFA, specified in Kenya shillings, for December 31, 2004, March 31 and
June 30, 2005, as well as indicative targets for September 30, 2005.
3.
Adjustment clauses. The NFA floors will be adjusted upward (or downward) by the
sum of (i) excess (shortfall) in non-project-related external budgetary support relative to the
programmed amount; and (ii) excess (shortfall) in privatization proceeds from external
sources. Excess or shortfall proceeds are defined as the difference between actual and
programmed proceeds. The downward adjustment is capped at the equivalent of
US$280 million, converted to Kenya shillings at the program exchange rate prevailing on
September 28, 2001. All targets are cumulative from July 1, 2004 onward.
4.
Reporting requirements. Data on gross international reserves, encumbered reserves,
and foreign liabilities of the CBK will be transmitted to the Fund on a weekly basis within
five working days of the end of each week. Detailed data on external project-related and nonproject-related budgetary support (by donor/creditor and by currency of denomination) will
be transmitted on a monthly basis within five working days of the end of each week.
B.

Reserve Money (RM) of the Central Bank of Kenya

5.
Definition. RM is defined as the average over the calendar month of the test dates of
reserve money, defined as total currency outside banks and bank reserves including till cash

59

with the CBK. Table 4 in Annex I of the Letter of Intent shows the ceilings on RM for
September 30, and December 31, 2004, and for March 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005, as well as
indicative targets for September 2005. The authorities will consult with the Managing
Director of the Fund on any changes in the ratio of reserve requirements.
6.
Reporting requirement. The daily balance sheets of the CBK will be transmitted on
a weekly basis within five working days of the end of each week.
C.

Net Domestic Financing (NDF) of the Central Government

7.
Definition. NDF includes financing by the banking system (the CBK and commercial
banks), non-bank financial institutions, and the nonbank public of the budget of the central
government of Kenya; where the central government is defined as in the Appropriation
Accounts and in the parliament approved budget estimates for 2004/05.11 NDF consists of
treasury bills, government stocks and bonds, promissory notes and other domestic debt
instruments issued by the government, and loans and advances net of government deposits
with the CBK and the banks. For the purposes of the program, NDF excludes privatization
proceeds not included in the budget, and government debt issued for any bank restructuring.
NDF is calculated as the cumulative change from July 1, 2004 onward in the sum of (i) loans
and advances to the government by the CBK, including any interest arrears, minus all
government deposits with the CBK, from the balance sheet of the CBK; (ii) loans and
advances to the government by the commercial banks, including any interest arrears, minus
all government deposits held with the banks, from the balance sheet of the commercial
banks; and (iii) the changes in the outstanding stock of treasury bills, government stocks and
bonds, promissory notes and other domestic debt instruments issued by the government,
including any interest arrears. Table 4 in Annex I of the letter of intent shows the ceilings on
NDF for September 30, and December 31, 2004, March 31 and June 30, 2005, as well as
indicative targets for September 2005.
8.
Adjustment clauses. The ceiling on NDF will be adjusted upward (downward) by
the shortfall (excess) in non-project-related external budgetary support; The value of the
cumulative excess or shortfall in external non-project-related budgetary support will be
converted into Kenya shillings at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of disbursement.
The externally caused part of any upward adjustment in NDF is capped at the equivalent of
US$ 280 million less any shortfall in external privatization receipt, converted to Kenya
shillings at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of disbursement.
9.
Reporting requirements. Data on NDF of the central government will be submitted
to Fund staff on a monthly basis within four weeks of the end of each month.

Safeguards Assessments

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) is subject
to a full safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF Arrangement approved on
November 21, 2003. The assessment was completed on October 21, 2003 and proposed
specific measures to address a number of weaknesses, as reported in EVS/03/151 (paragraph
31). These measures are being monitored by staff under the present PRGF program
VIII. Exchange Arrangements
The currency of Kenya is the Kenya shilling. Kenya has adopted a unitary exchange rate
structure in which the exchange rate is determined in the interbank market. The official
exchange rate, which is set at the previous day’s average market rate, applies only to
government and government-guaranteed external debt-service payments and to government
imports for which there is a specific budget allocation. The exchange rate regime is a
managed float, in which the U.S. dollar is the principal intervention currency. Kenya
maintains an exchange arrangement that is free of exchange restrictions and multiple
currency practices. On November 3, 2004, the exchange rate was K Sh 81.2=US$1.

APPENDIX II

Kenya: IMF-World Bank Relations
(As of November 11, 2004)
A. Partnership in Kenya’s Development Strategy
1.
Kenya’s development strategy is set forth in the Investment Program for the
Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation (IP-ERS), considered by
the Boards of the IMF and the World Bank in May 2004. The IP-ERS draws upon the draft
poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), prepared by the previous government following
large-scale consultations with stakeholders. Key themes of the strategy are:
•
•
•
•
•

Accelerating economic growth in an environment of macroeconomic stability;
Strengthening institutions for governance, including implementation of the recently
enacted Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act and the Public Officer Ethics Act;
strengthening security and law and order;
Rehabilitating and expanding physical infrastructure, specifically the road network,
including rural access roads and the energy infrastructure;
Improving access to, and quality of, education and health services; and
Improving the investment climate particularly for micro, small, and medium
enterprises, and reforming the financial sector.

2.
The IP-ERS is providing the framework for Bank-IMF support to Kenya’s
development efforts in the medium term. The government intends to use the IP-ERS to
coordinate donor support in general, and has taken several steps towards strengthening
coordination. It held a Consultative Group meeting in November 2003 for the first time since
1996. It has also established the Kenya Coordination Group, which meets once every two
months and acts as a forum for engagement on issues of mutual interest. It created in October
2004 the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) within the Office of the President to
oversee the implementation of the IP-ERS and advise the president on policies to increase
growth and reduce poverty. The NESC comprises key ministers, international experts on
development, and representatives of the private sector, the media, research institutes, and
civil society.
3.
In supporting Kenya’s development strategy, the IMF leads the dialogue on monetary
and exchange rate policy. The Fund coordinates with the Bank on fiscal policy and structural
reforms in the areas of public expenditure management, governance, financial sector, revenue
administration, trade, and the public wage bill. The Bank takes the lead on monitoring
implementation of the IP-ERS, dialogue in the areas of infrastructure, human development,
private sector development, rural development, and reforms of public enterprises and the
civil service. In analytic work, the Bank takes the lead on growth and poverty analysis while
the two coordinate on trade, labor markets, and poverty and social impact analysis.

69

APPENDIX II

B. Bank Group Strategy
4.
A new country assistance strategy (CAS) of reengagement for fiscal 2004–07 was
approved by the World Bank Board on June 17, 2004. The CAS is closely aligned with the
development priorities set forth in the IP-ERS. A key challenge will be to build on the IPERS as the basis for much greater harmonization of donor programs, while shifting
assistance away from projects and toward sectorwide programs and budget support.
Increasing levels of budget support will require the development of a positive record of
reform through the implementation of Bank and IMF-supported reform programs,
specifically:
•

Improvements in the public accountability framework, specifically in the areas of
public expenditure management and procurement.

•

Development of a strong participatory monitoring and evaluation system to track
implementation progress and impact of the IP-ERS objectives.

•

Pro-poor shifts in public expenditure patterns.

•

Undertaking of necessary analytical work, such as the poverty and social impact
analysis of planned policy reforms.

The Bank’s new strategy has been formulated to promote in a carefully sequenced way
growth and poverty reduction. Project lending in sectors with sound policies and strategies
(for example transport and energy) will help to further strengthen institutions and financing
mechanisms that deepen and nurture good governance. Policy-based lending will support
critical reforms in public sector management and the financial sector. Technical assistance
projects will develop, and assist in implementing, public sector reforms, privatization, and
legal and financial sector reforms. In line with the Bank’s commitment to donor
harmonization, subsequent interventions will support sectorwide approaches in health and
education, and budget support for implementation of the IP-ERS through a series of annual
poverty reduction support credits (PRSCs).
5.
Economic and public sector management. The IP-ERS gives high priority to
budgetary and public expenditure reforms. The Bank is preparing an Economic Recovery
Strategy Support Credit (ERSSC) to support government actions to strengthen budgetary and
public financial management, improve governance, enhance agricultural productivity, and to
improve the climate for private investment. The goal of the ERSSC is to lay the foundation
of a medium-term development program that could be supported through annual budget
support. The Bank is also providing technical assistance to the government for its annual
PER process with a view to strengthening budget management and strategic resource
allocation and fostering greater openness and participation in budget matters. A Public Sector
Management Technical Assistance Project (PSMTAP) for US$15 million approved in July
2001 and due to close on June 30, 2005 is providing support for civil service reform and
capacity building, internal auditing, annual medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF)

70

APPENDIX II

process, implementation of the integrated financial management information system
(IFMIS), and development of improved procurement practices. A follow-on to the PSMTAP
is planned for fiscal 2006 to further build capacity for budget and financial management, tax
administration, and support reforms of parastatals. To strengthen governance, this project
will also support training on regulatory and other issues, assist with the preparation of plans
for corporate restructuring and privatization, strengthen the capacity and design of regulatory
bodies, and improve consultative mechanisms between public and private actors.
6.
To enhance the capacity of the Central Bureau of Statistics and other agencies, the
Bank has prepared a Statistical Capacity-Building Project (StatCap) scheduled for Board
presentation during fiscal 2005. The Bank is helping to build capacity for monitoring and
evaluation through a grant from the Institutional Development Fund. The Bank is also
supporting government efforts to analyze policy and spending choices through the grantsupported Poverty and Data Initiative and related analytical work on poverty.
7.
Financial sector development. The IP-ERS identifies the urgent need to reform the
financial sector in Kenya, which is beset with a high level of nonperforming loans and wide
interest rate spreads, and operates within a weak legal and judicial system. The government is
considering divesting the state’s stake in two of the biggest banks. To support the
government’s reform agenda, the Bank and the IMF have recently concluded a joint
Financial Sector Assessment Program that significantly deepened knowledge of the issues
facing the financial sector. To support reforms, the Bank prepared a Financial and Legal
Sector Technical Assistance Credit that was approved by the Board in October 2004. This
will support the development of financial and legal sector strategies, the strengthening of
financial and legal sector regulations and institutions, and the establishment of a bank
restructuring and privatization project within the Ministry of Finance that will guide the
process of privatizing banks. This will lay the foundation for a Financial Sector Adjustment
Credit (FSAC), a budget support operation planned for fiscal 2005, that will support policy
and institutional reforms, including divestiture of the state’s remaining ownership stakes in
the banks, enhanced banking supervision, and design of a policy to expand access to financial
services, including in rural areas.
8.
Privatization and private sector participation. Bank activity in this area has aimed
at providing technical advice toward developing and implementing strategies for private
sector participation in major public utilities. With the help of grants from the Public-Private
Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), the government has completed a study on options
for concessioning of trunk roads and a study on the legal and regulatory framework for the
transport sector. The Northern Corridor Transport Improvement Project, which became
effective in September 2004, will facilitate private sector participation in the financing,
construction and management of the road. The IFC is the transaction adviser for
concessioning the Kenya Railways jointly with Uganda Railways. Public-private partnerships
are also being considered to provide water and energy services.
9.
Private sector development. A joint Bank and IFC supported Micro, Small and
Medium Enterprise Project aimed at facilitating the creation and growth of MSMEs was

71

APPENDIX II

approved by the Board in July 2004. A three-year pilot Small and Medium Enterprises
Solutions Center is planned for fiscal 2005. In addition, the IFC is supporting the multidonor
Africa Project Development Facility that facilitates firms’ access to financial and other
services, and the African Management Services Company that provides management
expertise. Two recently completed studies―the investment climate assessment and the
administrative barriers study conducted by the Bank Group’s Foreign Investment Advisory
Service (a joint IFC and Bank program)―have provided a greater understanding of the
obstacles to private sector development in Kenya and the policies needed to address them.
The ERSSC planned for Board approval in fiscal 2006 will support implementation of the
recommendations of the study.
10.
Infrastructure development. The IP-ERS recognizes the lack of adequate physical
infrastructure as a major impediment to private sector development in Kenya. The Bank is
supporting the government’s program through its Northern Corridor Transport Improvement
Project, which will finance the reconstruction of the road network that links Kenya with
Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The project will also
help to upgrade Nairobi’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to address the threat of
terrorism. The IFC is serving as the transactions advisor for the joint concessioning of
Kenya’s and Uganda’s national railways, expected to be completed by summer 2005.
Improving management of the railways is expected to be a major catalyst to regional
integration and growth. The grant-financed Nairobi Water and Sewerage Institutional
Restructuring Project, which became effective in September 2004, aims at building a strong
institutional and governance framework that will promote efficient and sustainable delivery
of water and sewerage services in Nairobi. The Energy Sector Recovery Project, effective in
November 2004, will help to improve the efficiency of production and distribution of
electricity, to promote private sector participation in the sector, and to improve power sector
management and corporate governance.
11.
Agriculture and environment. The Bank is supporting measures to increase
agricultural productivity and competitiveness in several ways. Through an analysis of
agricultural markets and rural service delivery, an analysis of the linkages between poverty
and agricultural growth, and studies on cotton, coffee, sugar, pyrethrum, and horticulture, the
Bank along with other partners is contributing to knowledge that will add in a substantial
way to the policy dialogue with government. The ERSSC and the subsequent PRSCs will
support implementation of the reforms. The Agricultural Productivity Project, which became
effective in October 2004, is supporting the transformation of Kenya’s research and
extension system to a more demand driven, farmer-led and pluralistic system, while
supporting associated policy reforms. The Arid Lands Resource Management Project Phase
Two, effective in September 2003, is using a multisectoral, district based, community driven
development approach to reduce poverty in the arid and semiarid districts of Kenya. The
multicountry Lake Victoria Environmental Project is helping to establish institutions for the
sustainable management of the lake and its catchment area. The GEF-supported Western
Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project, to be presented to the Board in January
2005, will seek to improve management of soils, water, and biodiversity, while raising the
productivity of agriculture. A GEF-supported Agriculture Productivity and Sustainable Land

72

APPENDIX II

Management Project, scheduled for Board presentation in May 2005 will promote improved
soil and water management of key water catchments. A Bank water resources sector
memorandum is preparing the ground for a future project focused on improving management
of water resources.
12.
Education and health. In education, the Bank is supporting the government’s
strategy through the Free Primary Education Project (US$50 million grant) (effective in July
2003), through recently completed analytical work on primary and secondary education, and
through support to the ministerial PER. It is now preparing a sectorwide (SWAp) education
program for approval in fiscal 2006 to support both primary and secondary education. This
will lay the groundwork for future support to the sector through a PRSC by strengthening
monitoring and evaluation, financial management, and the planning and allocation of
expenditures. The evolution in the sector will also require expanded, more detailed sectoral
expenditure reviews, as alignment of expenditures with the strategy will be a key determinant
of partner support for the sector. The grant-financed Global Development Learning Network
project effective in February 2004 is helping to develop enhanced mechanisms of learning
and knowledge-sharing among policy makers. In health, the Bank is supporting the
government’s strategy through analytical work focusing on a pharmaceutical sector review
(fiscal 2005), and on a comprehensive health sector PER. The ongoing Decentralized AIDS
and Reproductive Health Project seeks to improve mother and child health through more
integrated delivery of child survival, reproductive health, and HIV/AIDS services. This
operation is preparing the ground for the Bank’s support to the health sector through a SWAp
in fiscal 2006 that will be developed in partnership with all major stakeholders in the sector.
13.
HIV/AIDS. The Bank is vigorously supporting the government’s program to control
HIV/AIDS. Kenya was the first country to access funds under the Africa Region’s MultiCountry AIDS Program (MAP). A follow-on MAP is planned for fiscal 2006 that will focus
on prevention while also supporting new initiatives to reach the vulnerable groups and to
increase access by those already infected to comprehensive care and treatment. The Bank
supports the National AIDS Control Council and its provincial, district, and local-level
bodies and line ministries in the mainstreaming of HIV/AIDS-related activities.
14.
Nonlending activities. The Bank completed a Strategic Gender Assessment in fiscal
2003 that reveals the high poverty and vulnerability of many Kenyan women and describes
the discrimination that girls and women face in gaining access to health and education
services, and ultimately to employment opportunities. Analytical work planned for the next
two or so fiscal years is designed to: (a) support efficient public allocation of funds to priority
development areas, (b) expand on the analytical work already initiated in fiscal 2003 on
poverty analysis, particularly rural poverty; (c) expand on the findings of the 2003 country
economic memorandum to better understand the sources of growth and competitiveness,
(d) support growth in agricultural and livestock production, (e) better understand barriers to
trade, and (g) deepen knowledge of labor markets. In preparation for the budget support
credits, core diagnostic economic and sector work is planned for fiscal 2005, including a
country procurement assessment report, an updated country financial accountability
assessment, and a poverty analysis.

C. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
15.
The IMF and World Bank staffs maintain a close collaborative relationship in
supporting structural reforms in Kenya through lending, analytic work, and technical
assistance.
16.
Joint assessment of the government’s IP-ERS. The staffs of the Bank and the IMF
jointly assessed Kenya’s IP-ERS in April 2004. These documents were discussed by the
Bank Board on May 6, 2004 and by the IMF Board on May 10, 2004.
17.
Macroeconomic framework. The IMF leads the analysis and dialogue on monetary
policy, which serves as input into the Bank program. The monetary policy dialogue focuses
on issues related to quantitative monetary targets, such as money supply and inflation,
exchange rate changes, and central bank operations. The Bank collaborates with the IMF on
fiscal policy dialogue, which broadly covers issues related to fiscal sustainability and size of
the public sector. Currently, the dialogue focuses on the size of overall fiscal deficit, fiscal
risks, public service wage bill, pay reform, revenue performance, including tax

74

APPENDIX II

administration and adjustment to tax policy, and domestic debt financing of the deficit. The
Bank takes the lead on the analysis of issues related to economic growth and poverty. The
Bank and the IMF are also collaborating on trade reform.
18.
Budgetary and public expenditure reforms. The Bank and IMF work closely to
support government efforts in budgetary and public expenditure reforms. The Bank leads the
dialogue on planning, the preparation of the MTEF, strategic resource allocation (particularly
aligning budgetary allocations with priorities laid out in the IP-ERS), expenditure
restructuring, enhanced stakeholder participation, and issues related to efficiency of public
spending, such as expenditure tracking. A joint Bank-IMF Public Expenditure Management
Assessment and Action Plan (PEM-AAP) was completed in April 2004. A technical working
group that includes Bank and IMF representatives, along with other donors and stakeholders,
monitors the PER process and implementation of the reform program. The Bank and IMF
collaborate on issues related to internal audit reform and on the IFMIS. The Bank and the
IMF are members of the high-level Budget Support Donor Coordination Group and the
technical-level Joint Technical Working Group that are helping the government to prepare
for budget support. The Bank and the IMF are coordinating closely on the ERSSC
conditionality and that under the PRGF arrangement.
19.
Strengthening revenue collection and administration. The Bank and the Fund
jointly have recently carried out detailed assessments of tax administration and customs
operations. The Fund has been providing technical assistance to the Kenya Revenue
Authority. The Bank has been assisting the customs department carry out a study of the
length of time it takes to clear a container through customs. The Fund (through AFRITAC)
and the Bank have been collaborating closely in supporting the Kenya Revenue Authority to
prepare a reform and modernization plan for funding under the follow-on PSMTAP planned
for fiscal 2006.
20.
Debt management and debt sustainability analysis. The IMF has recently updated
its external debt sustainability analysis. In the context of the Financial Sector Assessment
Program, a joint World Bank/IMF initiative is being undertaken to support capacity-building
in the area of sovereign debt management and domestic debt market development.
21.
Governance reforms. High levels of public corruption and a poor security situation
contributed to Kenya’s poor economic performance in the last decade, and governance
reforms are a key element of the government’s strategy to promote economic growth and
reduce poverty. The new PRGF arrangement itself will support a deepening of anticorruption
measures. The Bank is supporting the strengthening of legal and judicial institutions through
the Financial and Legal Sector Technical Assistance Project (see paragraph 7). The Bank in
2005 will prepare a country procurement assessment report in fiscal 2005 jointly with the
government.
22.
Financial sector reforms. The IMF and Bank are collaborating on financial sector
reforms in several ways. They have conducted a joint in-depth assessment of the financial
sector (banking, insurance, and capital markets) through the Financial Sector Assessment

75

APPENDIX II

Program being led by the IMF (see paragraph 7). The Financial Sector Assessment Program
has produced technical notes on selected topics, detailed assessments of standards and codes,
the IMF’s Financial System Stability Assessment, and the Bank’s Financial Sector
Assessment. The Bank and the IMF are expected to coordinate closely on the prior actions
and conditionality of the FSAC.
23.
Privatization and private sector development. The dialogue on privatization and
regulatory reforms is led by the Bank, and the IMF is a partner in this policy dialogue,
particularly on issues of the fiscal burden. The Bank is supporting growth of private sector
participation through regulatory reform and through assistance for privatization or
restructuring of public enterprises in power, railways (IFC), and urban water. MIGA is
supporting private sector development through international comparisons of competitiveness,
through the provision of technical assistance and capacity building services to the country’s
investment promotion intermediaries, and through the offer of political risk guarantees to
foreign investors going into the country.
24.
Trade reforms and regional integration. Trade issues and regional integration are
prominent within the government’s policymaking priorities. Kenya is expected to form a
customs union with Tanzania and Uganda in 2005 in the context of the East African
Community (EAC). Kenya is also actively involved in negotiations and activities of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). The IMF and the Bank both
assist with reform of the tariff regime, and the Bank is providing technical advice on regional
integration issues. The Bank recently produced a technical note on the implications of an
EAC customs union for revenue and trade flows. The note is currently being updated to
account for the latest agreement on the common external tariff. The IMF served as a peer
reviewer for the note. The Bank is undertaking a diagnostic trade integration study, to be
completed in fiscal 2005. The Bank is undertaking an assessment of nonfiscal investment
incentives in each of the three states of the EAC. This work is complemented by a recently
completed IMF assessment of fiscal investment incentives. Both assessments will be used to
harmonize such incentives in the context of the planned customs union. The Bank is
implementing a Regional Trade Facilitation Project (US$25 million) aimed at improving
access to finance for cross-border trade between participating countries. A follow-on project
is planned for fiscal 2006. The Bank is also preparing an EAC Regional Transport and Trade
Facilitation Project for fiscal 2006. The project includes support for implementation of the
customs union and for institutional and investment support to facilitate transport in the
region.

APPENDIX III

Kenya: Statistical Issues
1.
Weaknesses in key macroeconomic statistics hamper economic analysis and
surveillance. Kenya's macroeconomic statistics have deteriorated significantly over the past
decade, reflecting primarily managerial and organizational weaknesses, and inadequate
resources provided to the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). During the 2003 Article IV
consultation discussions, the staff emphasized the need to improve the timeliness and quality
of these statistics, and encouraged the authorities to promptly implement STA
recommendations from previous technical assistance..
2.
The authorities are taking actions, with donor assistance, to improve the quality and
timeliness of economic and financial statistics. Kenya participates in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) and the GDDS project for Anglophone Africa; metadata and
detailed plans for improving the data over the short and medium term have been posted on
the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). Kenya received Fund technical
assistance in the context of this project, and further assessment of capacity building
requirements has been undertaken by the AFRITAC East Statistical Advisor. Furthermore,
the authorities are preparing a statistical development plan and a new statistical act to
strengthen the independence of the CBS.
3.
A STA multitopic mission to Kenya in 1998 undertook a comprehensive review of
the major statistical areas and prepared a work program for implementation of its principal
recommendations, to address most of the problems discussed below. A peripatetic STA
advisor assisted the authorities in improving the balance of payments statistics and the
national accounts data.
4.
Monetary, exchange rate, and some external data are published on a monthly and
biannual basis by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) in its Monthly Economic Review. Core
financial data are also made available to the Fund on a regular basis. A detailed account of
various sectoral activities and the corresponding statistical data are published annually by the
CBS in its Economic Survey.
National accounts
5.
Data quality, which was previously reported as good, has deteriorated significantly
because of budgetary and staff constraints at the CBS. GDP is believed to be significantly
underestimated, as important and increasing parts of the economy, such as the informal
sector, nonagriculture subsistence, horticulture, and self-employed professionals are not
properly covered.. The STA peripatetic advisor assisted the authorities to rebase the national
accounts estimates at constant 2001 prices and compile institutional accounts for the general
government sector. In May 2004, revised national accounts estimates following the 1993
SNA (at constant 2001 prices) for the years 1996–2003 were released.

77

APPENDIX III

Prices and production
6.
The CBS commenced publication in early 2002 of a new national CPI (covering
12 urban areas), with a base year of 1997 and weights derived from the 1992–93 HBS. The
index is compiled and published on a timely basis. There is no producer price index, or any
short-term export and import price indices produced.
Government finance statistics
7.
The 1998 multisector statistics mission found several statistical problems with the
cumulative year-to-date monthly and quarterly fiscal data that the Ministry of Finance (MoF)
compile and report to the AFR for budget-monitoring purposes. These data, which do not
conform to the Fund’s government finance statistics (GFS) methodology, do not adequately
facilitate economic analysis, mainly because of inappropriate classification of expenditure
data. The MoF has not developed a system to adequately monitor expenditure commitments,
or domestic arrears, and relies mainly on monitoring cash movements in government
accounts at the CBK. The recording of external financing and expenditure directly financed
from abroad also remains an area for improvement. The 1998 mission made several
recommendations for improving the data, most of which have not been implemented.
8.
The CBS compiles and reports to the STA aggregate annual GFS revenue and
expenditure data for budgetary central government based on detailed data in the reports of the
Controller and Auditor General, using a methodology established by a 1999 STA GFS
mission. Lack of proper computerization prevents the CBS from compiling more detailed
GFS data. Considerable differences exist between these data and the data compiled by the
MoF and reported to AFR for surveillance and program monitoring purposes.
9.
If implemented, the recommendations of the February 2004 technical assistance
mission in GFS will significantly improve the quality and availability of fiscal data.
Monetary statistics
10.
Monetary statistics are compiled from a bank reporting system and are broadly
adequate for policy, analytical, and supervisory purposes. A STA technical assistance
mission in January 2000 observed that the authorities had implemented virtually all
recommendations of the previous STA missions, which had led to a number of improvements
in Kenya’s monetary statistics. However, the mission identified and made recommendations
to address further problems in monetary data, in particular (a) asymmetrical interbank
positions, (b) the statistical implications on the data of numerous bank closures, and (c) the
coverage of international reserves. Since then, the authorities have initiated revisions to
monetary statistics in line with the recommendations of the mission.
Balance of payments statistics
11.

The CBS compiles and reports balance of payments data in Kenya shillings annually

78

APPENDIX III

on a regular basis to STA, although with a considerable lag. In addition, the CBK compiles a
complete set of annual balance of payments statistics in U.S. dollars, which are reported to
AFR and used for programming and surveillance purposes. The two datasets are not entirely
consistent, and Fund staff has been strongly encouraging the authorities to reconcile them.
More recently, the CBK also started to compile and publish discrete quarterly balance of
payments estimates.
12.
The quality of the balance of payments data has deteriorated. Although the overall
quality of trade data may be reasonably good, data for other current account and many
financial account transactions are rather weak. Following the liberalization of the exchange
system in 1993-94, gaps have emerged in the coverage of balance of payments source
statistics. The compilation system (other than that used for compiling customs statistics),
used since 1994, relies on reports from domestic banks and may result in a substantial
underrecording of current earnings, including tourism receipts, as well as a failure to capture
transactions that are settled via accounts held abroad.
13.
Present estimates of direct and portfolio investment are believed to be substantially
understated. The large positive errors and omissions in the central bank data that have
emerged in the balance of payments since 1994 raise concerns as to the potential size of
external obligations. The MoF compiles data covering Kenya’s public and publicly
guaranteed external obligations to official and commercial creditors. This database does not
take account of nonresident purchases of the government’s domestic currency-denominated
debt securities.
External debt statistics
14.
In developing the loan-by-loan debt sustainability analysis (DSA) in 2002, Fund and
World Bank staff identified several significant debt data problems that have since been
addressed by the authorities. Nevertheless, significant debt data management problems
remain, along with more general issues in the area of external debt management and its
integration in the budget formulation and expenditure management systems.

APPENDIX IV

Kenya: Debt Sustainability Analysis Update
This annex updates the debt sustainability analysis conducted as part of the last staff report
for Kenya IMF Country Report No. 03/400, January 8, 2004 and IMF Country Report
No. 03/399, January 8, 2004. The broad conclusions of the previous exercise, that the debt is
sustainable (taking into account the impact of a Paris Club rescheduling on external debt),
remain valid; under the revised program framework, external and central government debt
sustainability improves.
Central Government Debt Sustainability
The updated DSA for central government debt continues to show a steady decline in central
government debt (Table 1). In 2004 and 2005, the ratio is actually lower under the present
scenario than under the baseline presented in November 2003, reflecting the
underperformance of domestic borrowing and of donor inflows in 2003/04, as well as
expectations that donor inflows will be lower throughout the program period than projected
in the earlier DSA. The fact that in the medium/long-term (2007 to 2015), the ratio is not
even one full percentage point higher under the updated analysis compared to the earlier
DSA indicates that the projected increase in domestic borrowing in the revised program
scenario does not materially jeopardize debt sustainability. Kenya’s central government debt
profile appears relatively robust to various shocks. The most serious stress would come from
a sharp real depreciation; under this alternative scenario, the NPV debt to GDP ratio
increases to around 71 percent during the program period.
External Debt Sustainability
Under the revised program scenario, the NPV of debt to exports ratio is lower than under the
original DSA, averaging 104 percent over the period 2004–07 versus 120 percent over the
same period in the November 2003 analysis. This lower debt profile reflects several factors.
One is that the expectations of donor inflows did not materialize in the first year of the
program (as detailed in the staff report) and projections of expected inflows have been
lowered. A second factor is that since the last DSA, Kenya secured a rescheduling with the
Paris Club in January 2004, and while the Houston terms rescheduling does not lower the
debt stock, it will reduce debt service paid during the 2004–2007 consolidation period. A
technical factor to be kept in mind is that the DSA is carried out for official debt only, due to
the unavailability of data on the private sector external debt stock; under the macroeconomic
framework in the staff report, it is expected that as the country reaps the benefits of reforms
in terms of growth and an improved investment climate, external loans to the private sector
would increase, and would add to the relatively moderate ratio of NPV of debt to GDP that is
projected in this analysis. Finally, the debt data weaknesses that Kenya has continued to
experience mean that DSA results must be interpreted with caution. An on-going project
supported by, inter alia, a World Bank Financial Sector and Legal Technical Assistance
credit, is expected to produce significantly strengthened debt data, and an updated DSA will
be conducted when these data are available.

81

APPENDIX IV

A combined real GDP growth and net non-debt creating low shock has the largest impact on
the NPV debt to exports ratio, pushing the indicator to 173 percent in 2005; however, the
ratio declines relatively quickly to below 150 percent.
The debt service due ratio averages 8 percent during the program period, and declines further
over the long-term. Alternative scenarios indicate that the indicator would increase
significantly, albeit generally not to levels of concern, in response to most of the stresses
tested in the sensitivity analyses. The debt service ratio is most affected by a fall in export
value growth and the combined GDP growth and non-debt creating flow shock.
Conclusions
Kenya’s debt appears sustainable under the current scenario, but the fact that certain shocks
have the potential to push debt indicators to higher levels means that the authorities must
remain vigilant. The authorities have stated that fiscal and external debt management policies
will continue to balance the commitment to debt sustainability with the need to support the
poverty reduction strategy.

1/ Foreign-currency denominated debt is equal to the total external debt in Table 2 of this Annex. Besides central government debt, government guaranteed debt and the CBK debt to
the IMF are included.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service.
3/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest, amortization of medium and long-term debt, and the stock of short-debt at the end of the previous period.
4/ Historical averages are calculated based on numbers for 1998-2002 because data for some of the key variables were not available prior to that period. The historical average for
the real GDP growth is 1.0 percent (compared with 3.1 percent in the basel

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels). A three-year historical average and standard deviation is used for the export stress test.
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Kenya
December 20, 2004
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff report was issued.
The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.

1.
We have received confirmation from the Ministry of Finance in Nairobi that the four
prior actions for the issuance of the staff report have been met.
•

First, the departments responsible for budget monitoring and the medium-term
expenditure framework were transferred from the Ministry of Planning and National
Development to the Ministry of Finance in September 2004. In addition, new and
stronger management teams have been installed in the Debt Management and Fiscal
and Monetary Analysis Units of the Ministry of Finance. With these actions, the
authorities have fulfilled the prior action relating to the restructuring and
strengthening of the capacity of the Ministry of Finance to manage macroeconomic
and fiscal policies.

•

Second, expenditure releases are now managed in the context of the program’s fiscal
framework, which limits domestic borrowing in 2004/05 to Ksh 32 billion (2.5 percent of
GDP). Domestic borrowing would likely be lower than the agreed target as the increase
in revenue collection, at about 25 percent during the first five months of 2004/05, is well
above the assumed increase of 7 percent under the program.

•

Third, the government has agreed on a system of annual declarations and verifications of
the assets of ministers, permanent secretaries, and heads of state corporations.

•

Finally, the government completed in November 2004 the Budget Outlook Paper for
2005/06-2007/08.

With regard to the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) (Amendment) and the Banking
2.
(Amendment) Bills that are alluded to in both the Financial System Stability Assessment
and staff report, Parliament passed the two bills last week. However, while the CBK
(Amendment) Bill was passed as presented, the Banking (Amendment) Bill was modified, with
the retention of Section 44 of the Act, which requires the prior approval of the Minister of
Finance when setting banks’ fees and charges.

3.

The main implications of these changes are:

•

Virtually all banking sector regulatory and supervisory authority have been transferred
from the Ministry of Finance to CBK; and

2

•

The provisions of the CBK (Amendment) Act that provided for the control of interest
rates have been removed.

4.
Presentation to parliament of an amendment to the Banking Act to provide for the
transfer of all financial sector regulatory functions from the Ministry of Finance to the
CBK was a structural performance criteria under the program for end-March 2004. With
regard to Section 44 of the Banking Act, the Minister of Finance has confirmed that the
government will continue to desist from applying the regulation.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 12, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with
Kenya
On December 20, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Kenya.12
Background
During 2003/04, notable progress has been made in reversing the lackluster
performance of the previous decade. A moderate rebound in economic growth has
begun and the recent sharp growth in domestic debt has been arrested. However,
inflationary pressures have increased.
The moderate recovery in economic growth that began in 2003/04 is expected to
continue, with the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth projected at 2.7 percent in
2004/05 after an estimated 2.1 percent in the previous year. Both the tourism and
construction sectors are projected to register strong growth. Reflecting the adverse
effects of the drought on food prices and the recent sharp increase in oil prices, headline
consumer price inflation has accelerated sharply in recent months and reached
16.6 percent in October 2004.
Monetary policy has been expansionary since 2003/04 to promote economic growth.
This has, however, contributed to the recent rise in inflation, and ex post real interest
rates were negative over much of the past year. In response to the significant pick up in
12

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and
policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing
Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

2

both headline and underlying inflation, the Central Bank began to tighten monetary
policy in September 2004, and three-month Treasury bill rates have increased from
2.75 percent in September to 7.2 percent in late November 2004.
Recent economic developments may have worsened poverty indicators. With real GDP
growth broadly in line with the increase in population and the economy suffering from
the effects of major negative shocks—the drought and the oil price increase—the
poverty rate may have increased in the recent past. Moreover, progress in poverty
alleviation has been hampered by AIDS and delays in initiating major poverty reduction
programs.
Overall fiscal performance strengthened during 2003/04 mainly on account of strong
revenue collection and the steps taken to control recurrent expenditure. Some capital
spending was also curtailed on fears that the resulting large domestic borrowing would
raise interest rate pressures. As a result, domestic borrowing was much lower than
budgeted and the ratio of domestic debt to GDP fell from 24.3 percent at end-June 2003
to 22.2 percent of GDP at end-June 2004.
The current account balance turned from a surplus of 1.2 percent of GDP in 2002/03 to
a deficit of 2.0 percent in 2003/04, reflecting primarily a drop in private savings. Private
savings were negatively affected by negative real interest rates, but also by the drought
and the increase in oil prices. Export volumes grew by 7 percent in 2003/04, as tea,
horticultural, and garment exports performed well. With a strong capital account position,
foreign reserves rose by about U.S. $140 million, but declined moderately in percent of
imports.
Progress in implementing structural reforms has been mixed. Some progress was made
in strengthening governance, and there were some delays in implementing reforms in
the public expenditure, financial sector, and parastatal areas. New wage-setting
mechanisms for public employees have been developed.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors observed the progress that has been made under the PRGFsupported program, which has contributed to a rebound in economic growth and
arrested the rise in domestic debt. However, Directors noted that Kenya faces serious
challenges. In particular, growth remains too slow for making inroads into poverty,
inflation has picked up, and governance remains a critical concern.
Directors emphasized that Kenya’s medium-term economic prospects depended
critically on the prompt and effective implementation of broad-based structural reforms
as outlined in the authorities’ Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). They stressed
the importance of promoting strong economic growth and ensuring that its benefits are
translated into poverty reduction and improved living standards for the rural population.
Implementation of strong policies and a faster pace of reforms would help achieve
increased donor budgetary support, and Kenya would be in a position to begin to make
progress toward the Millennium Development Goals.

3

Directors recognized the efforts that have been made to strengthen governance. They
welcomed efforts to build a more robust public financial management system, the
establishment of the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission, and the ongoing strengthening
of prosecutorial capacity. Directors observed, however, that important gaps remained in
implementing the governance agenda, and they stressed the need for more determined
actions. In this connection, Directors emphasized the importance of adequate funding of
key anticorruption agencies; full investigation, disclosure, and punishment of those
involved in corruption cases; and improved rules for the management of security
procurements. There were also calls for continued efforts in the area of asset
declarations by senior officials, including ministers, permanent secretaries, and heads of
state bodies.
Directors expressed concern with the recent upturn in inflation. They urged the
authorities to maintain firm control over monetary aggregates as several factors, such as
high oil prices, the uncertain food supply situation, and exchange rate developments
point to a risk of persistent price pressures. Progress in containing wage costs would be
important for reducing inflation and, in turn, for promoting financial intermediation.
Directors agreed that the current managed floating exchange rate system has served
Kenya well in responding to external shocks, and should be maintained. A few Directors
saw scope for increased flexibility in this regard.
Directors supported the authorities’ effort to balance their commitment to fiscal
consolidation with the need to support the poverty reduction strategy. They welcomed
the lower-than-programmed deficit in 2003/04. However, Directors noted that significant
fiscal risks remained, as deficits were projected to remain high and the magnitude of
donor support uncertain. Some Directors pointed to the fiscal risks associated with weak
public enterprises and the costs of addressing HIV/AIDS. In this connection, Directors
welcomed the authorities’ efforts to mobilize increased domestic resources through
ongoing reforms of tax administration and steps to improve customs services.
Directors also noted that meeting the fiscal objectives will require effective expenditure
monitoring and control. They stressed the importance of building a robust public
expenditure management (PEM) system. Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to
modernize the PEM system, including strengthening the links between the medium-term
expenditure framework and the annual budget system, with the support of the World
Bank and the Fund. They urged the authorities to strengthen further existing institutions
and procedures, with a view to enhancing the poverty orientation of public outlays. In
addition, Directors recommended close monitoring of the debt situation, and advised
against contracting any new nonconcessional debt.
Directors underscored the importance of accelerating the public enterprise restructuring
and privatization program. They urged the authorities to make a strong effort to secure
parliamentary enactment of the Privatization Bill and to follow up quickly with its
implementation. In this context, they welcomed the authorities’ decision to start, in the
near future, a detailed assessment of the financial position of key parastatals.

4

Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ increased attention to improving
competitiveness. They supported the authorities’ broad-based strategy that includes
streamlining the regulatory framework, upgrading essential infrastructure, reforming the
wage-setting system, and liberalizing trade. However, Directors noted the deteriorating
trend in total factor productivity in Kenya, and urged stronger efforts to promote privatesector led growth, including through further trade liberalization, regional integration, and
improved governance.
Directors welcomed the actions taken by the authorities to strengthen the financial
system, including the recent approval of the amendments to the Central Bank of Kenya
and Banking Acts, which transfer bank regulatory functions from the Ministry of Finance
to the central bank and remove the provisions for official controls of interest rates.
Directors looked forward to the removal of government control over bank charges and
fees. Directors observed, however, that the financial system remains fragile. While
banking soundness indicators have generally improved, the large nonperforming loans
(NPLs) remain a problem. They therefore urged the authorities to address the problem
of distressed banks, particularly public banks, which held most of the large NPLs, and to
move forward promptly with bank privatizations. Directors pointed to the need to move
forward with a strengthening of the framework for Anti-Money Laundering/Combating
the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT).
Directors took note of the challenges posed by capacity constraints for policy
implementation. They observed that shortages of skilled personnel and weaknesses in
public administration, particularly in key ministries, constrained the implementation of
essential poverty programs and the absorption of donor-project support. Directors,
therefore, welcomed the restructuring efforts that have been initiated to rebuild capacity
in the Ministry of Finance and key line ministries. They also welcomed ongoing efforts to
restructure the civil service and develop new wage setting mechanisms for public
employees, noting that the realization of the poverty reduction objective depended upon
improved delivery of public services.
Directors generally welcomed the steps underway to improve the quality of economic
and social statistics. They noted that the government has released a revised set of
national accounts data, was taking steps to improve the monitoring of fiscal data and
intended to develop a framework for the systematic monitoring and evaluation of
productivity changes. However, the quality of statistics for surveillance and program
monitoring remains weak, and Directors urged further efforts to improve statistics, with
the support of the African Technical Assistance Center (AFRITAC), as appropriate.

IMF Executive Board Completes First Review Under Kenya's PRGF Arrangement and
Approves US$76.9 Million Disbursement Kenya

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the first review of
Kenya's economic performance under a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement, which was approved on November 21, 2003 (see Press Release No. 03/201). The
Board also approved waivers for the nonobservance of continuous and structural performance
criteria.
The Executive Board approved augmented access under the PRGF arrangement by SDR 50 million
(about US$ 76.9 million), which will bring the total amount drawn under the arrangement to about
SDR 75 million (about US$115.4 million).
Following the Executive Board discussion, Mr. Rodrigo de Rato, Managing Director and Chair,
said:
"Progress has been made in implementing policy reforms under the three-year program supported
by the Fund. A rebound in economic growth has begun, the recent sharp increase in domestic debt
has been arrested, and implementation of key structural reforms is underway. In addition, the
authorities have begun to address capacity constraints and to strengthen key policy implementing
institutions.
"The main challenge is to accelerate broad-based growth to help reduce poverty and improve the
delivery of essential social services, while also securing fiscal consolidation and low inflation. In
the near term this will require prudent fiscal management and firm control over monetary
aggregates to bring down inflation. Over the medium term, tight fiscal policy will need to be
supported by a broadening and acceleration of structural reforms to enhance economic efficiency,
expand the role of the private sector in the economy, and promote increased donor support.

2

"Consistent with these objectives, the authorities' program for 2004/05 emphasizes policies to bring
down inflation and strengthen budget management. It focuses on measures that aim at improving
the efficiency of public expenditure and increasing revenue collection. The program also envisages
significant advances in the governance and anti-corruption area, where some progress has been
made, but much remains to be done. To strengthen Kenya's external competitiveness, a multifaceted
strategy is being implemented that includes streamlining the regulatory framework, reforming the
wage-setting system and liberalizing trade. Moreover, a strengthening of the financial system is
envisaged through a variety of reforms, including actions to address the problems of distressed
state-owned banks, reduce the large number of nonperforming loans, and promote privatization.
"The government's reform program is well tailored to meet the pressing economic challenges facing
Kenya. Strengthened implementation of the reform agenda, particularly in the area of governance, is
essential for achieving enhanced donor support, sustainable growth, and poverty reduction,"
Mr. de Rato said.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported programs
are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process
involving civil society and development partners and articulated in a Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are consistent with a
comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural and social policies to foster growth and
reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are repayable over
10 years with a 5½ year grace period on principal payment.

Statement by Peter Ngumbullu, Executive Director for Kenya and Peter Gakunu,
Alternate Executive Director
December 20, 2004
Introduction and Background
1.
The Kenyan authorities are grateful to staff for the high quality set of papers and for the
candid exchange of views during the recent Article IV consultation discussions and first review
under the PRGF arrangement. The authorities agree with the thrust of the staff assessment, and view
the reports as fair and balanced in addressing economic development issues and the challenges
facing the country. They request the support of the Executive Board for the completion of the First
Review under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, Augmentation of Access, Rephasing of
the Arrangement and Waiver of Performance Criteria.
2.
Kenya has made significant progress in its second year of implementing reforms under the
PRGF arrangement to consolidate its economic gains, as well as develop a realistic and ambitious
medium term framework to guide economic policy-making. The authorities are actively pursuing
prudent macroeconomic policy measures, including implementation of wide-ranging reforms.
Expenditures have been prioritized in the context of the Economic Recovery Strategy (ERS)
objectives with a gradual reorientation towards pro-poor expenditure and investments. Better coordination procedures have been put in place with donors, to ensure efficient fiscal management and
mobilization of increased resources for poverty reduction. There is strong political will by the
authorities to pursue policies of enhancing the investment climate, strengthening governance
institutions, as well as deepening of the financial sector. The authorities have succeeded in
solidifying the consensus required for successful enactment of a new constitution.
3.
Notwithstanding these positive developments, the country faces enormous developmental
challenges in a number of areas, including achieving fiscal sustainability, improving capacities and
budgetary resources to enhance effectiveness of key governance institutions, reforming the labor
market, upgrading infrastructure, and deepening the structural reform agenda. The authorities are
aware of these, and have incorporated the necessary corrective measures under its Economic
Recovery Strategy (ERS). They would like to use this opportunity to reiterate their continued
commitment to sound macroeconomic management and the reform agenda.
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
4.
Despite high oil prices and a severe drought, the Kenyan economy is estimated to have
grown by 2.1 percent in 2004, reflecting a recovery of the tertiary sectors. Looking ahead, real GDP
is projected at 2.7 percent in 2004/05, lower than the 3.1 percent expected in the original program,
reflecting in part the negative effects of high oil prices and depressed prices for some traditional
exports, as well as the impact of drought on agricultural production. The medium-term macroeconomic prospects depend mostly on the pace of reforms, fiscal consolidation, and resumption of
strong donor support. This notwithstanding, our authorities are concerned that although the

2

medium–term growth rates appear reasonable when seen against Kenya’s recent performance, they
fall far short of the ERS target of 6 percent, which implies a significant delay in the achievement of
the MDGs. The authorities have consequently strengthened domestic revenue effort, restructured
expenditure and have accelerated management reforms, among other initiatives.
Structural Reforms
5.
Since December 2003, the authorities have implemented an ambitious and multi-faceted
program of reforms aimed at improving governance, including passing key anti-corruption and
public ethics legislation, strengthening the judiciary and the public audit system, as well as
implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and Ratification of the
African Union Convention on Corruption. Other reforms include: measures to enhance the
effectiveness of key anti-corruption investigative agencies, such as the swearing in of senior
personnel in the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission in September 2004, and the hiring of
additional personnel targeted for completion by July 2005; and the implementation of a Public
Officer Ethics Act under which all public officials, including the executive and legislative arms of
government and the military have completed the first round of declaration of their assets and those
of their families and are in the process of completing the second round.
6.
Additional measures that have been undertaken by the authorities include: strengthening of
the judiciary under a newly appointed Chief Justice; completion of pro-poor expenditures for both
recurrent and development expenditures; preparation of comprehensive program of public finance
reforms; strengthening of Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) operations; deepening transparency in the
conduct of public operations; improving the procurement system; addressing the outcomes of recent
initiatives to address past economic crimes; strengthening of public agencies, through
implementation of the recommendation of the task force on reform of the police beginning
December 2004; enhancing public interaction with the government on governance, by establishing a
Public Complaints Unit (PCU) to serve as a central referral and monitoring and evaluation unit
under the aegis of the Department of Governance and Ethics, in conjunction with the Ministry of
Justice and Constitutional Affairs; and initiation of comprehensive land reforms including forming
various committees and a commission which has currently completed its initial work and its report
published.
7.
The slow progress in moving toward a comprehensive medium-term expenditure
framework, consistent with PRSP priorities, as well as in instituting a more robust expenditure
management system, is largely attributable to organizational and capacity constraints at the Ministry
of Finance, that are now being addressed. Financial sector and parastatal reforms suffered from
capacity constraint, but also lack of consensus on the objectives and modalities for conducting the
reforms that have delayed the enactment of the Privatization Bill. New wage-setting mechanisms
for public employees have now been developed. Significant progress has been made in building a
robust governance architecture and in enforcing elements of the anti-corruption regulations. The
authorities have taken decisive steps to strengthen the prosecution branch. The budget for Kenya
Anti-Corruption Commission (KACC) has been increased significantly. Legal investigations on the

3

Anglo-Leasing scandal are proceeding well. All the senior officials involved in the scandal have
been suspended and the authorities have confirmed that once the investigations are completed
prosecution of those involved will commence. On the Kenya Urban Transport Infrastructure
Projects (KUTIB), the culprits are in the courts after being dismissed from their jobs. Furthermore,
an external forensic audit, supported by the World Bank was completed two months ago, the finding
presented to the Minister of Finance, and the Government is taking action based on the results of the
audit. The Minister has approached the World Bank to conduct further forensic audits on a number
of projects with a view to taking appropriate action.
Fiscal Policy
8.
The monetary policy pursued by the authorities aims at supporting non-inflationary
economic recovery. However, following the reduction in the legal reserve requirement in July 2003,
the reserve money multiplier rose putting downward pressure on yields on money market
instruments. In response to the decline in interest rates, bank credit to the private sector grew
substantially resulting in inflationary pressure. The inflation objective is to be achieved through
reserve money targeting, with broad money as the intermediate target and open market operations as
the main instruments. In this connection, the recently enhanced open market operations and treasury
bill auctions have resulted in increased real interest rates that should help stem the threat to
resurgence in inflation. The CBK will continue to use a broad set of indicators to monitor future
inflationary pressures and to gauge the appropriateness of the monetary policy stance. The
authorities will continue to implement a flexible exchange rate system, which has served the
economy well in absorbing fluctuations in external conditions. The CBK’s intervention in the
foreign exchange market will be limited to meeting the net foreign assets target under the program
and to smoothen the disruptive short-term fluctuations.
Fiscal Policy
9.
The overall fiscal performance was better than anticipated by the program with central
government fiscal imbalances being much lower than expected, reflecting the strong commitment of
the authorities to stamp out corruption and the improved capacity and governance of the institutions
involved in revenue collection, as well as the steps taken by the authorities to strengthen the
management of recurrent expenditure. The authorities’ fiscal policy stance aims at continuing
support of macroeconomic stability and addressing fiscal sustainability among other steps. This
would be achieved by strengthening revenue performance, lowering the wage bill as a proportion of
GDP, including establishing a new wage setting mechanism for public employees, further tackling
contingent fiscal liabilities, strengthening tax administration, implementing public expenditure
management (PEM) reforms, continuing civil service rationalization, and increasing the poverty
reduction spending. Another key component of the fiscal programme is domestic debt reduction
aimed at debt sustainability in which the government does not crowd-out the private sector without
compromising the provision of increased resources for priority poverty reduction spending.

4

A revision to the budget announced on June 12, 2004, will be presented to Parliament during the
first quarter of 2005. Pending this revision, the new fiscal framework will be implemented through
quarterly releases of expenditures. The revised budget assumes that domestic borrowing would
amount to the equivalent of 2.5 percent of GDP. The fiscal framework envisages a marked decline
in both the overall and primary deficits relative to ERS targets, wholly because of the significant
shortfall of donor budgetary support. For the same reason and the need to preserve some essential
social and economic programs, domestic borrowing would exceed ERS expectations. Some
crowding out of private activity is expected, as the public sector would absorb a sizable proportion
of projected financial savings. Reflecting the projected domestic borrowing, total domestic debt
would remain broadly unchanged at 22 percent of GDP compared with the original program target
of 24.7 percent of GDP. The authorities aim at reversing the recent trend towards increased current
spending by raising capital outlays from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2003/04 to 4.4 percent of GDP in
2004/05 with allocations for roads, health and agriculture accounting for the bulk of the increase.
10.
The authorities have in their unwavering fight against corruption, requested for a
comprehensive audit of external commercial contracts which has necessitated a relatively small
accumulation of arrears. In recognition of this, the authorities have established an escrow account
for settling fully all legitimate debt once the audit is completed and they are looking for ways of
managing the near-term temporary increase in domestic borrowing and domestic debt, which will
be a major challenge for them. In this connection, they plan to strengthen the revenue performance
by maintaining revenue as a proportion of GDP of at least 21.5 percent, broadening the tax base by
removing most exemptions, taxing a larger share of informal transactions and simplifying and
rationalizing the tax system. Looking ahead, the wide-range of measures taken by the authorities to
strengthen revenue collection will be supported by controlling and prioritizing expenditure
programs, cutting non-essential outlays as well as the resumption of strong donor support.
Financial Sector Issues
11.
The Kenyan authorities are actively pursuing reforms of the financial system to enhance
financial intermediation. They have already started to implement the reforms proposed by the recent
FSAP recommendations drawing among others on support by the World Bank in preparation for a
Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC). The measures that are being implemented are designed
to strengthening the financial system, including passing of amendments to the CBK and Banking
Acts by Parliament, new regulations, and tightening loan provisioning and classification, which will
be introduced in 2005. Recently there has been a notable improvement in banking sector
performance indicators, including fall in the non-performing loans. Central features of the
authorities financial sector development plan include focusing on promoting financial
intermediation in rural areas, as well as increasing the access of small and medium -sized firms to
formal sector financial resources. In this connection, they will work hard to broaden the scope and
outreach of micro finance institutions and for a more coherent and targeted policy for promoting
development finance institutions.

Trade Reforms and Regional Integration Efforts
12.
The authorities plan to address international competitiveness through reforms in the utility
and telecommunications sectors, in external trade and the labor market, as well as upgrading of
infrastructure. Kenya is expected to form a customs union with Tanzania and Uganda in 2005, in
the context of the East African Community (EAC). Kenya is also a member of the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), which aims at the establishment of a customs union
through the removal of all trade barriers, and a common external tariff and rules of origin. The IMF
and the Bank are providing assistance with reform of the tariff regime, and the Bank is providing
technical advice on the regional integration issues.
Poverty Reduction Strategy Process
13.
The development strategy as outlined in the ERS is part of a broader economic agenda that
is supported by donors and development agencies, including the World Bank. The programme
contains a package of policy measures aimed at addressing the identified economic problems of low
growth, low savings and investment, poor public service, large domestic debt, distortions in the
financial system, unemployment, and poverty. Embedded in the programme are core poverty
expenditures, which are derived from specific development targets that include, among other
measures, improving access to primary education, health care and providing other safety nets. Since
most of the poor live in rural areas, the priority is to reform the agricultural sector and encourage
growth of medium and small-scale enterprises, while plans are underway to upgrade micro finance
institutions. In addition, there are measures to tackle the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in rural
areas, including the rehabilitation of rural health facilities to positively affect agricultural
productivity and rural incomes.
14.
Our authorities are aware of the challenges they face in implementing the programme, and
they have noted staff’s comments and recommendations for addressing them. In this regard, in
addition to the reforms already undertaken and those that are ongoing, they have identified and
incorporated into the ERS programme, other policy measures that will be needed to pre-empt many
of the risks and vulnerabilities, including initiation of a new anti-money laundering legislation that
will reflect all relevant recommendations from the Bank-Fund FSAP assessment report for Kenya;
and improving the quality and timeliness of data in the areas of the budget, foreign trade and
national accounts. With respect to the latter, a data ROSC mission has been invited and will be
undertaken in early 2005.
Need for Donor Support
15.
Medium-term projections indicate that there will be external account gaps in implementing
the new programme arising from an envisaged pickup in government outlays on social and
economic infrastructure and other public investment programmes. These outlays will put substantial
pressure on the external current account. The deficit on the external current account is estimated to
widen to 4.9 per cent of GDP in 2003/04, with the prospects of rising further to 11.0 per cent of

6

GDP by 2005/006. Consequently, the programme will require a marked increase in donor assistance
from 6.5 per cent of GDP to 9.9 per cent in 2005/06 to support its implementation. Total financing
needs are projected to average about $1.3 billion per year through 2005/06. Program support and
Paris Club rescheduling are expected to fill the financing gap during the period. The authorities
have indicated their intention to seek a rescheduling from the Paris Club and are currently
discussing with their key creditors and donors on possible Paris Club rescheduling terms.
Conclusion
16.
In conclusion, our Kenyan authorities wish to reiterate their strong political will and
commitment to revive the Kenyan economy and put it on the path of sustainable and job creating
growth and poverty reduction. They have made the fight against corruption a priority, and have
achieved significant progress in the implementation of the reform agenda. Fiscal performance was
better than anticipated in the program and monetary policy has been tightened appropriately to
support the objective of price stability, necessary for long-run growth. Overall, the economy is in a
much better state than when the new coalition government took office two years ago. However, in
consolidating the gains of macro-economic stabilization, the authorities hope that they can continue
to count on the sustained understanding and support of the Fund and the rest of the international
community in the form of timely and adequate financial support, advice and technical assistance in
the relevant areas to achieve these objectives. They are taking measures to implement reforms under
the PRGF arrangement to consolidate the economic gains achieved in the reform agenda to sustain
poverty reduction, economic growth, meet the MDGs, and improve the living standards of the
Kenyan people.
