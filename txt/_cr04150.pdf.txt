Slovenia is well poised to
enter the euro area in many
respects. Real convergence in per
capita income and productivity is
comparable to that of some noncore
euro countries. Slovenia stacks up
well on optimal currency area
properties, particularly with regard
to business cycle correlation,
similarities in production structure
and share of intra-industry trade,
and strong trade links. In addition,
Slovenia already meets the
Maastricht criteria for long-term
interest rates and the fiscal deficit
and debt ratios.

weaker macroeconomic situation in these countries. With imports being boosted by the
pickup in domestic demand, the external current account position receded from a sizeable
surplus in 2002 to approximate balance in 2003 (Figure 1 and Table 1).

Progress with disinflation was more
than envisaged by either staff or the Bank
of Slovenia (BoS). Year-on-year headline
inflation declined from 7.2 percent in
December 2002 to 4.6 percent in December
2003, and fell further to 3.5 percent in March
2004. Core inflation fell to below historical
lows at end-2003. Staff analysis suggests that
the widening of the output gap associated with
the economic slowdown was the dominant
driving force behind disinflation in 2003.
Other contributory factors, albeit to a small
degree, were a moderation of the pace of
depreciation of the tolar, lower increases in
regulated prices and indirect taxes, and excise
tax adjustments to offset increases in
international oil prices. Wage developments
contributed little to disinflation. While the
economy-wide real wage increase in 2003 was
broadly similar to that in 2002, the gap

-5-

between wage and productivity growth
narrowed, to below the threshold norm of
1 percent specified in the Social
Agreement (Figure 2).

disinflation effort. The general
government deficit––1.4 percent of
GDP—was slightly smaller than that envisaged in the mid-year supplementary budget and
broadly similar to the outturn in the past three years. Collections in most tax categories
surpassed expectations despite slower-than-expected growth. However, expenditure on goods
and services and use of contingency reserves (a one-off payment to compensate farmers for
drought) exceeded the budgeted levels, and were partly offset by a cutback in investment
spending plans (Table 2).
7.
Monetary conditions at the policy level remained broadly stable. The BoS
continued with its monetary and exchange rate policy framework in which interest rates are
adjusted in response to inflation dynamics and inflation expectations, while the exchange rate
is also managed to avoid widening the uncovered interest parity with the aim of discouraging
interest-sensitive capital inflows. Prompted by the deceleration in inflation, European Central
Bank (ECB) rate cuts, and a perception of falling country-risk premium, the BoS lowered its
key policy rate (on 60-day bills) steadily by a total of 3½ percentage points since December
2002 to 4¾ percent in April 2004. Meanwhile, the pace of depreciation of the tolar vis-à-vis
the euro slowed from an annualized rate of 3.3 percent in December 2002 to 2 percent in
March 2004, equivalent to a virtually unchanged bilateral real exchange rate (Figures 3
and 4).
8.
Lending rates of banks fell in real terms in 2003, and private credit demand and
interest-sensitive capital inflows picked up. With the elimination of indexation of financial
instruments, lending rates of banks became more sensitive to competition and movements in
the interest rate on foreign-currency denominated loans. It would appear that for a large
segment of blue-chip corporate customers, aggressive pricing by foreign-owned banks has
already resulted in convergence with nominal interest rates abroad. These banks are typically
charging EURIBOR plus a margin of 60–80 basis points on foreign-currency denominated
loans; tolar loans are priced equivalently after adjusting for expected depreciation. About
two-thirds of the expansion of credit to enterprises in 2003 was foreign currency denominated
(primarily in euros), and financed by rising bank borrowing from abroad. Overall, foreign

-6-

currency-denominated lending to households was minimal, though such transactions jumped
in the fourth quarter following the liberalization of regulations (Figure 5 and Table 3).2

II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
10.
The discussions focused on the vulnerabilities during the run-up to euro
adoption, and on the policy requirements for achieving a successful transition and
strong performance in monetary union. The main challenges are to implement policies that
will lower average inflation to a rate that meets the Maastricht criterion (estimated at
2¾ percent during the assessment period3) and that thereafter avoids loss of competitiveness
once the central parity is fixed; and to maintain exchange rate stability within “the normal
fluctuation margins” of ERM2 for at least two years. The authorities’ policy strategy centers

around keeping the current monetary and exchange rate framework until ERM2 entry,
continue addressing the cost-push factors that have contributed to inflation inertia over the
past years, enhancing wage flexibility, and maintaining fiscal discipline and modifying the
indexation mechanisms for social transfers. The authorities’ strategy paper considers the risks
inherent in the euro adoption process to be manageable and the macroeconomic scenario
underlying the budget for 2004–05 does not anticipate a domestic demand boom. The staff
viewed this scenario as overly benign, and placed a higher likelihood on a credit-financed
demand boom, with implications for the achievement of the Maastricht inflation criterion.
Thus, while generally supportive of the authorities’ overall policy framework, the staff
advised a more deliberate role for monetary policy in the period up to ERM2 entry, faster
progress in enhancing wage and fiscal policy flexibility, and further strengthening of bank
supervision.
11.
Over a number of years, the authorities have generally heeded the Fund’s policy
advice, though with differences persisting on how monetary policy could best contribute to
disinflation. During the past year, the authorities made progress in implementing structural
and fiscal policies emphasized by Executive Directors at the conclusion of the last
consultation on April 16, 2003 (Box 1).

Box 1. Policy Recommendations and Implementation
In concluding the last Article IV consultation discussions with Slovenia, Executive Directors focused on
policies to address two main challenges: lowering inflation sharply before entering ERM2, and returning in
2004 to the previously planned path of fiscal adjustment
(http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2003/cr03108.pdf).
During the past year, in line with Fund advice, the authorities enhanced policy coordination on
administered prices, eliminated indexation of financial contracts, and initiated steps to weaken wage
indexation. However, the BoS did not adopt a more aggressive disinflation effort through accepting a
stronger tolar, as advised by the Fund, out of concerns that this would trigger capital inflows, and kept
monetary conditions broadly unchanged. Nevertheless, for reasons explained in ¶5, progress in disinflation
was better than expected.
On the fiscal front, the time horizon for achieving the medium-term goal of structural balance has
lengthened, because of fiscal pressures connected with EU accession. Still, as per Fund advice, the
authorities have focused on restraining increases in the wage bill and social transfers. Furthermore, they
sought and obtained technical assistance from the Fund in November 2003 to identify further means of
expenditure rationalization.
On financial structural issues, the authorities have implemented most of the recommendations of the 2001
FSAP. A FSSA update was undertaken in November 2003 (Box 4).

-8-

A. Macroeconomic Outlook
12.
The staff pointed to various factors that suggested a high likelihood of a creditfinanced demand boom in the offing, similar to that experienced by noncore euro-area
countries in the late 1990s prior to euro adoption. The strong upturn in domestic demand
in Slovenia in 2003 likely represents the early stages of a demand boom. In the period ahead,
further demand-side impetus to external borrowing and bank credit is likely to come from
favorable business and consumer expectations triggered by EU accession and prospective
euro adoption, and from a convergence-related decline in interest rates. Domestic demand is
also likely to be fueled by the release of funds from the housing savings scheme beginning in
mid-2004. Dynamic simulations for Slovenia carried out by Fund staff, applying the
parameters of a model of credit growth in the euro area, also suggest a potentially rapid
acceleration in credit in the next few years.4 Senior policy makers conceded that a demand
boom was a potential risk, but did not consider it as their baseline scenario.
13.
There was consensus that the contribution of net foreign demand to growth
would likely remain negative in the foreseeable future. Exports should pick up in line with
the anticipated recovery in the EU, though imports, driven by strong domestic demand, are
expected to increase at a faster pace. Accordingly, the staff projects real GDP growth
rebounding to 3½ percent in 2004 and rising above the potential rate subsequently to
4½ percent in 2006. The external current account is expected to swing into a deficit in 2004
that would widen progressively to a peak of about 2 percent of GDP in 2007 (Tables 5 and 6).
Under this scenario, which assumes that credit-financed domestic demand pressures will be
self-correcting and that foreign direct investment inflows will recover upon euro adoption,
the external debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase by about 10 percentage points over the
medium term and stabilize at about 63 percent in 2008–09. Sustainability is not an imminent
concern, but developments merit monitoring (Appendix III).
14.
Notwithstanding the notable decline in inflation during the past year, staff saw a
need for additional policy measures to achieve the Maastricht inflation criterion. The
BoS projects that inflation would remain around 3½ percent during Q2–Q3, 2004 and fall to
below 3 percent by the start of the assessment period (i.e., mid-2005), predicated on the
assumption that GDP growth would remain below the growth rate of potential output.
However, BoS officials acknowledged that lowering inflation below 3½ percent in a
sustainable manner would be difficult, and generally agreed with the findings of the staff’s
inflation model (Box 2). A principal conclusion of the staff’s analysis is that real GDP
4

See Adopting the Euro in Central Europe—Challenges of the Next Step in European
Integration (forthcoming IMF Occasional Paper), Figures V.14–V.16. Projections based on
this methodology suffer from upward bias. Thus, the credit paths—with growth rates possibly
reaching 20–40 percent during 2004–05 and returning quickly to fairly low levels
thereafter—coming from the simulations should be seen as extreme scenarios.

Box 2. Inflation in Slovenia 1
The staff estimated the following open-economy model of quarterly inflation for 1997–2003:

s .e. = 0.44.

The first equation captures the long-term pricing relationships on the markets of tradable and nontradable goods
and services. The second equation models the short-term behavior of inflation.
The variables are as follows: PPItEuro, euro-area producer prices; NERt, nominal exchange rate of the tolar per
euro; WtNT, market services wage adjusted for labor productivity VAtNT/LtNT; EC t, the residual series reflecting
short-term deviations of prices from the long-term equilibrium; πt, year-on-year growth in the CPI index;
∆lnNERt, the year-on-year change in the exchange rate; ytavg the average output gap over the past four quarters;
IRt, the year-on-year change in the long-term nominal lending rate to enterprises; and taxt, the contribution of
indirect tax changes to headline inflation.
The baseline scenario forecasts inflation of 3.25 percent during the assessment period Q3/2005–Q2/2006.
With a recovery in Europe and declining interest rates, the Slovene economy is projected to rebound, leading to
slower disinflation. The projection assumes that the pace of nominal depreciation will slow down gradually and
the exchange rate stabilize in Q4/2004 with ERM2 entry, and that real wages in the nontradable sector will grow
at about the same rate relative to productivity as in the past year.
Sensitivity tests indicate that the Maastricht inflation criterion could be achieved if the rebound of growth
is slower, or wage growth in the nontradable sector is moderated. Predictions of the model have been
confirmed by an alternative econometric specification but are subject to a sizeable statistical error. The
95 percent confidence band is approximately ±1.5 percentage points around the forecasts.

growth above the potential growth rate and a consequent narrowing of the output gap will
impede the disinflation process. The baseline scenario indicates that the BoS’s inflation goal
for 2004 may be feasible, but that average inflation during the assessment period would likely
exceed the BoS projection.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
15.
The monetary and exchange rate policy orientation envisaged by the authorities
is as follows:
•

In the run-up to ERM2 entry, the BoS’s operations would focus on progressively
reducing the rate of depreciation of the tolar vis-à-vis the euro to zero by the fourth
quarter of 2004, and on gradually lowering nominal interest rates. These measures
would be undertaken in a manner that was consistent with the reduction in inflation
and inflationary expectations and that did not open up the interest parity with abroad.

•

In line with the staff’s assessment, BoS officials considered the current level of the
real exchange rate to be close to the equilibrium exchange rate, and thought it highly
probable that the central parity under ERM2 would be set at the then prevailing
market exchange rate.

•

Under ERM2, the BoS was inclined toward adopting a narrow band around the
central parity. In this set up, the BoS would let domestic interest rates be determined
by interest rates in the euro area and the risk premium, and put the burden of
absorbing shocks on wage and fiscal policies.

•

To have the maximum scope for limiting exchange rate volatility through sterilized
intervention, the BoS would continue with the current contractual cooperation with
commercial banks on exchange rate policy operations (Box 3).

•

Mindful that ERM2 will place a high premium on consistency of policies, the
authorities intend to give priority to close policy coordination between the BoS and
the government, and build on the progress achieved in 2003.

16.
The staff called for a more pro-active role for monetary policy in lowering
inflation in the coming months. In particular, the staff recommended that the BoS restrain
monetary conditions in the run-up to ERM2 entry by reducing nominal interest rates
cautiously and slowing the pace of depreciation deliberately. Early monetary restraint was
advisable also to avoid a possible worst-case scenario of intense demand pressures under
ERM2, when monetary tightening within a narrow exchange rate band could create a oneway bet, with the authorities facing either large sterilization costs or the need to let the
exchange rate appreciate. If more than one round of appreciation proved necessary,
competitiveness could take an appreciable hit.

- 12 -

Box 3. Foreign Exchange Rate Policy Operations
There are three main features in the BoS’s exchange rate policy operations:
•

A formal agreement between the BoS and individual banks under which the BoS sets the
exchange rate and banks have access to central bank financing through a standing facility.

•

Temporary (seven-day) swaps rather than outright purchases of foreign currency by the BoS.
The banks pay a swap fee to the BoS, which is set in relation to the desired pace of depreciation,
the refinancing rate of the ECB, and the interest rate on BoS bills.

•

Sterilization of excess tolar liquidity through the issuance of central bank bills. Prudential
considerations regarding maturity transformation constrain banks from extending long-term
credits on the basis of short-term liquidity acquired by currency swaps, even though a large
fraction of swaps is regularly renewed.

Under normal conditions, the BoS seeks to ensure the following relationship:
Rate on BoS bills + Risk premium = ECB refinancing rate + Depreciation rate + Swap rate.
In February 2004, the BoS and the commercial banks agreed to maintain the modalities of the current
framework for foreign exchange market operations under ERM2. The BoS intends to purchase outright
one-half of outstanding stock of swaps by the time of ERM2 entry to increase the attractiveness of the
contractual agreement. By reducing the stocks of swaps while retaining the swap fee, the BoS would
lower the cost imposed on banks.

17.
While acknowledging the importance of not forcing down real interest rates
prematurely, BoS officials were concerned that restraining monetary conditions would
open up the interest parity with abroad and trigger capital inflows. They noted that key
policy rates remained sufficiently positive in real terms. Nonetheless, they agreed that the
BoS should lag rather than lead the market in lowering nominal interest rates during the
convergence process. In the event of a credit boom, the BoS was in favor of tightening
prudential requirements rather than relying on monetary policy instruments or controls on
credit and capital inflows. BoS officials also argued that there was scope for lowering
inflation through further flexibility in wage-setting procedures, with which the staff agreed.
In response to staff’s questions, they felt there would not be a need for, nor were they
contemplating, a nominal step appreciation of the tolar on the eve of ERM2 entry to bring
down inflation.
18.
The staff supported the BoS’s plan to adopt a narrow exchange rate band under
ERM2, and expressed understanding for the continuation of a contractual agreement
with banks on exchange rate policy operations. Ensuring unequivocal compliance with
ERM2 requirements called for primacy being given to limiting exchange rate variability. BoS
officials explained that the current managed foreign exchange intervention arrangement had

- 13 -

proved effective in avoiding exchange rate volatility. Shifting operating procedures would
likely entail teething problems that could lengthen the euro adoption process. BoS officials
recognized that euro system monetary instruments would need to be developed prior to euro
adoption, and indicated that this task would be undertaken in a gradual manner.
19.
Several factors may mitigate exchange rate volatility under ERM2—though
risks remain. The staff agreed that a managed foreign exchange intervention arrangement,
complete subordination of domestic interest rate decisions to those in the euro area, the small
size of the projected fiscal deficit, a relatively thin government securities market, and
enhanced policy coordination between the BoS and the government should reduce the scope
for speculative capital flows and appreciation pressures. BoS officials further noted that it
should be possible to accommodate Balassa-Samuelson effects (estimated at around
1–1½ percent per year) without creating tensions between meeting the inflation criterion and
staying within a narrow exchange rate band. They did not expect a widening of the external
current account deficit under ERM2 to cause market sentiment to swing toward depreciation,
unless the deterioration was extremely large and persisted for a prolonged period.
C. Price and Wage Policies
20.
The authorities’ disinflation strategy will continue to entail limiting increases in
administrative and regulated prices to no more than the projected inflation rate. In line
with the Fund’s recommendation during the

prices reflected monopoly pricing and

bodies, and that capping price increases would not result in losses for service providers and
would induce efficiency gains. They indicated that government representatives on the
regulatory bodies and supervisory boards of public enterprises would push for greater cost
efficiency and savings.

- 14 -

21.
In the public sector, significant progress has been made in weakening wage
indexation and slowing wage drift, but risks remain from the negotiations on a new
wage structure. Average real wages in the general government are projected to decline in
2004–05. Agreement has been reached to shift to a wage indexation formula that takes into
account inflation in the EU, expected domestic inflation, and changes in the tolar/euro
exchange rate. However, only one-half of the budgetary funds earmarked for wage bill
indexation would be used for individual-level wage indexation, and the other half would be
applied toward implementation of a new wage structure aimed at reducing wage dispersion.6
The Ministry of Finance officials expected negotiations on job grading under a new wage
structure to be concluded around mid-2004, and acknowledged that there was a risk of cost
overrun. However, they emphasized that, if the demand for additional resources seemed
excessive, the Ministry would press the government to give primacy to remaining within the
budgeted wage bill envelope.
22.
Wage negotiations in the private sector for 2004–05 also have focused on
promoting the interest of lower-paid workers and reducing wage dispersion. In early
March, the social partners agreed under government mediation on a uniform lump-sum
nominal wage increase for all workers, and to negotiate additional increases in the various
industry branches. During the mission, the staff had expressed concern about this then
pending proposal, as it would likely impair the viability of enterprises that have a large
proportion of employees in the lower-wage brackets. However, the concern is mitigated by
the government’s decision to offset the negative effect through a corresponding cut in the
payroll tax.
23.
In the short term, a special wage policy effort may be required, if achievement of
the Maastricht inflation criterion were to come under threat. Analysis carried out by the
staff suggests that wage policy could contribute importantly to disinflation through a
reduction of real wage increases relative to productivity growth. Given the claim of trade
union representatives that the gap between real wage and productivity growth was influenced
mainly by developments at the enterprise level, the staff expressed the view that national
considerations for meeting the Maastricht criterion might warrant a temporary wage pact at
the national and enterprise levels between social partners under the guidance of the
government. This view was well received by the Finance Minister, and not rejected by trade
union representatives. Beyond that, the staff noted that, in preparation for euro adoption,
Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, and Spain had changed their wage-setting procedures—
including the elimination of indexation in some cases—and achieved moderation of wage
increases. The staff encouraged social partners to eliminate wage indexation completely, and

6

The aim is to lower dispersion gradually from 1:12.3 in 2004 to 1:10 in 2008. Over the past
several years, in both the public and private sectors, the current wage-setting mechanisms had
yielded larger wage increases for the higher-paid workers and increased wage dispersion.

- 15 -

to craft a new collective bargaining system that enhanced wage flexibility and was cognizant
of competitiveness considerations.
D. Fiscal Policy
24.
The authorities remain committed to maintaining tight fiscal discipline, despite
having to cope with fiscal pressures connected with EU accession. While Slovenia will be
a net recipient of EU funds during 2004–06, the authorities estimate that EU entry would
worsen the overall fiscal position by

that is not very transparent from the budget
figures. The authorities noted that there was a risk of employment exceeding the budgeted
level in 2005, as adaptation to EU rules and requirements was likely to create additional
staffing needs. The changes to direct taxes entail lowering the tax burden on the lowerincome groups, raising the minimum threshold for payment of payroll tax, broadening the
coverage of taxable income, and better targeting tax incentives for enterprises.

- 16 -

26.
The authorities agreed that further expenditure saving measures would be
crucial to enhance the flexibility of fiscal policy and achieve the medium-term goal of
structural balance. A recent technical assistance mission from the Fund’s Fiscal Affairs
Department (FAD) determined that there was scope for rationalizing spending in health and
education and aligning social benefits to prevailing international standards. However, the
authorities felt that, owing to political constraints, the scope for savings was likely smaller
than that estimated by the FAD mission and that implementation might take time. There was
an ongoing debate within the government on the realignment and de-indexation of social
transfers and modalities of health care reform. The staff supported the Finance Ministry’s
position that social transfers that were not targeted to the most vulnerable groups should be
de-indexed in order to reduce expenditure rigidities, and that health care reform should first
address the existing inefficiencies in the system. In this context, the staff encouraged the
authorities to reconsider a proposal to merge private health care premiums with the public
sector in 2005. Such a move would weaken the role of the private sector and put upward
pressure on labor costs with potential spillover risks for inflation.
27.
The staff encouraged the authorities to give consideration to the appropriate
fiscal policy response in the event of a demand boom. The staff emphasized that, at a
minimum, the government should save any revenue overperformance and ensure an improved
fiscal outturn. The authorities recognized that fiscal policy was the main remaining tool for
mitigating a private sector demand boom under ERM2 and monetary union. However, they
wondered whether revenue overperformance should be applied toward further lowering of
payroll taxes in order to strengthen the competitiveness of Slovene enterprises, as had been
proposed in the Social Agreement. The staff advised against it, on the ground that it would
negate the operation of automatic fiscal stabilizers and translate a cyclical factor into a
structural change in the fiscal balance. Furthermore, under the current wage-setting
mechanisms there was a high likelihood of enterprises using the extra resources to grant wage
increases.
28.
The government’s debt management strategy is oriented toward reducing the
debt ratio and facilitating the development of the domestic market for government
securities. Since 2002, the government has increasingly issued securities at nominal interest
rates and shifted to borrowing in the domestic market. The authorities noted that recent issues
of long-term nominal fixed-rate instruments were oversubscribed, and that currently
borrowing costs of the government were lower in the domestic market than abroad. The
government planned to extend the maturity structure of public debt; one-half of new longterm borrowing would entail 10-year bonds. The authorities’ central scenario projects a
decline in the general government debt-to-GDP ratio from 27 percent in 2003 to about

- 17 -

25 percent in 2008. The staff’s assessment of Slovenia’s debt sustainability remains
materially unchanged from that in the last Article IV consultation report.7

are squeezed further. BoS officials noted that
current Slovene banking regulations with
respect to risk classification of borrowers and provisioning (which is based on potential
rather than realized loss) restrain banks from making high-risk loans. However, banks
considered these regulations more stringent than the international standard and lately have
been putting pressure on the BoS to ease them. Given the potential for a credit boom and
related risks in the run-up to euro adoption, the staff cautioned the BoS against any loosening
of the existing prudential regulations. In the new competitive environment, BoS officials
expected consolidation of the banking system in the period ahead.

30.
The staff encouraged the BoS to speedily implement measures recommended by
the Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) update to strengthen supervisory and
prudential oversight (Box 4). BoS officials indicated that, in parallel with adopting a riskbased supervisory approach, they were planning to introduce dynamic “general” provisioning
as a means to counter banks’ otherwise rather procyclical behavior. They were studying
Spain’s dynamic provisioning system with the aim of tailoring it to the Slovene situation. In
this context, the staff noted that as dynamic provisioning was not a tool that could be
introduced quickly, other tools (such as reserve requirements) might have to be considered to
control surges in credit growth in the short term.

7

Country Report No. 03/108.

- 18 -

Box 4. FSSA Update
The main findings and recommendations of the November 2003 FSSA Update are as follows:
•

The Slovene financial system remains sound, but is likely to face stresses arising from increased
competition and potential rapid credit growth during the transition to euro adoption. Stress tests
show that the financial system is vulnerable to interest rate spread compression and a
deterioration in asset quality.

•

The current supervisory approach complies well with the Basel core principles. However, in
view of the changing operating environment for the financial system, banking supervision needs
to strengthen its risk focus and ensure that pricing of risk and loan-specific provisioning by
banks are appropriate. Consideration could be also given to introducing dynamic provisioning
as a prudential tool.

•

The insurance sector lacks transparency, and needs to develop the capacity to set pricing,
provisioning, and capital at appropriate levels.

•

Supervision of connected lending and financial conglomerates has improved, consistent with the
recommendations of the 2001 FSAP. However, consolidated supervision still needs
strengthening. Before proceeding with their plan to create a unified supervisory agency, the
authorities need to ensure that the necessary preconditions for successful implementation are in
place.

•

Reform of the liquidity management framework recommended in the 2001 FSAP has been
limited, in part because its scope was reduced by the need to manage large capital inflows. The
current managed foreign exchange intervention arrangement should promote exchange rate
stability under ERM2, but it will reduce incentives for banks to develop market risk
management and operations capacity. The BoS needs to develop euro system monetary
instruments prior to euro adoption.

31.
BoS officials were not unduly concerned about the increase in foreign currency
denominated loans, with a majority of these loans being to exporters who were hedging
their balance sheets. However, they acknowledged that several large public sector
enterprises were not hedged against currency risk, and agreed that their supervisory boards
should discourage unhedged foreign borrowing. There was consensus that foreign currency
denominated lending to households was likely to increase in the period ahead. The staff
encouraged the BoS to ensure that banks offered hedging instruments to their clients and
strengthened individual-level credit risk analysis of households. The staff considered the
transfer of credit risk on household loans from banks to insurance companies as a potential
vulnerability for the financial sector, and recommended that supervision of insurance
companies be enhanced.

- 19 -

F. Other Structural Issues
32.
Progress continued in liberalizing utilities and transport services. The
telecommunications sector has been largely liberalized, and competition has been established
in all segments of the market with the exception of the fixed network for inland calls. In the
electricity sector, production and distribution have been unbundled, and the largest customers
have been permitted to purchase electricity from abroad. Liberalization has brought about
lower prices in the mobile telephone services and for the larger consumers of electricity.8 The
authorities are making preparations for the liberalization of the natural gas sector, road
transport, and railways in line with EU directives.
33.
In the authorities’ view, unemployment in Slovenia—around 6½–7 percent for
the past several years—was mainly structural in nature. Over one-half of the unemployed
had low education and were jobless for more than one year. The inflows into the
unemployment pool during the past year were mainly persons whose fixed-term contracts had
expired. The government has adopted employment policy programs based on the EU’s
common employment policy guidelines. The authorities noted that they would increase
incentives for employing the long-term unemployed and unemployed women. More
generally, to facilitate employment creation, they planned to take steps to eliminate the
administrative barriers to the establishment and operation of enterprises.
34.
Upon EU accession, Slovenia will fully adopt the EU’s trade policy and
agreements. All existing preferential trade agreements of Slovenia will be terminated. The
harmonization of the tariff structure with the EU will lead to a lower average tariff on
nonagricultural imports and a slightly higher average tariff on agricultural imports. The
termination of free-trade agreements with the former Yugoslav republics is expected to have
a potential negative impact on Slovene exports to those countries. However, the authorities
considered this cost to be small compared with the benefits of joining the EU.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
With EU membership secured, policy makers now have to focus on laying the
ground for a smooth transition to ERM2 entry and euro adoption. The authorities’
strategy to move expeditiously toward these goals appears feasible, but it is not risk-free.
Slovenia is well positioned to enter the euro area with regard to optimal currency area
properties, real convergence, and levels of fiscal deficit and public debt that already meet the
Maastricht criteria. Competitiveness also appears adequate and stable. Several factors may
mitigate exchange rate volatility under ERM2, though risks remain. However, a main
immediate challenge is to lower inflation to a level that, in addition to meeting the Maastricht
8

The impact on prices for other consumers of electricity has not yet been determined by the
authorities because of data gaps.

- 20 -

criterion, will prevent any loss of competitiveness. Maintaining low inflation and
competitiveness thereafter will be a continuing challenge. In addition, alternative adjustment
mechanisms to monetary policy––specifically, fiscal policy and wage flexibility––will need
to be enhanced to absorb shocks. An environment of a credit-financed demand boom and
related potential banking sector stresses would complicate addressing these challenges.
36.
Monetary policy will need to play a deliberate role in lowering inflation in the
run-up to ERM2 entry by restraining monetary conditions. While the BoS’s concern
about monetary restraint triggering capital inflows is understandable, it will be important to
avoid reducing real interest rates prematurely.
37.
Fiscal policy should be oriented to mitigating budgetary pressures associated
with EU accession and coping with the risks of a possible private sector demand boom.
Expenditure saving measures in the rolling two-year budget for 2004–05, aimed at easing the
fiscal pressures connected with EU accession, are commendable and should be carefully
safeguarded in an election year. However, further expenditure rationalization—especially in
the areas of health care, education, and social transfers as identified by the November 2003
FAD mission—is key to securing sustained flexibility in the public finances as well as
achieving the authorities’ medium-term goal of structural balance. De-indexation of social
transfers that do not target the most vulnerable groups also will help reduce expenditure
rigidities. Health care reform should avoid measures that have the potential for fueling
inflation. In the event of a demand boom, at a minimum, it is essential that the government
save any revenue overperformance and ensure an improved fiscal outturn. Applying revenue
overperformance toward further lowering of payroll taxes should be avoided.
38.
Wage policy needs to play a critical role in disinflation and safeguarding
competitiveness. In the public sector, wage indexation has been weakened, and wage drift
reduced. To consolidate these gains, it would be important to restrict the cost of the new
wage structure, under negotiation, within the budgeted wage bill. Wage policy can support
disinflation by reducing wage growth relative to productivity growth, especially in the
nontradable sector. If achieving the Maastricht inflation criterion appears to be under threat,
national considerations might warrant, for a temporary period, a wage pact at the national and
enterprise levels between the social partners under the guidance of the government. Both the
government and social partners are encouraged to eliminate wage indexation and move to a
wage-setting system that ensures greater productivity-based wage differentiation.
39.
A strengthening of supervisory and prudential oversight of financial institutions
will be critical to guard against the risks of rapid credit growth and stresses on the
financial sector. Incipient signs have emerged of domestically owned banks shifting to more
risky borrowers, and this tendency is likely to intensify as profit margins are squeezed further.
Pressures from banks to ease existing prudential practices should be resisted. The BoS is also
encouraged to speedily move the supervisory framework to a more risk-based approach, as
recommended by the FSSA Update. The BoS’s intention to introduce dynamic provisioning,
in parallel with the risk-based approach, is appropriate. However, other tools, such as reserve

- 21 -

requirements, might have to be considered to control surges in credit growth in the short
term.
40.
The momentum behind structural reforms in other areas should be maintained.
The introduction of competition should result in lower prices, as experienced in the
telecommunications sector. The authorities’ decision to ask government representatives on
the regulatory bodies and supervisory boards of public companies to push for efficiency
gains, with a view to reducing the pressure on prices, is a step in the right direction.
41.
It is recommended that the Article IV consultation with Slovenia remain on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Revenues and deficit figures have been adjusted for the shift of budget accounting to a pure cash basis. Without the adjustment, the general government
deficit would have reached SIT 156 bn, or 3.0 percent of GDP, as the unadjusted figures contained only 11 months of VAT and excise tax.
2/ Pre-accession aid of the EU was until 2003 classified as grants.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The currency of Slovenia is the tolar (SIT). The external value of the tolar is determined in
the interbank exchange market, in which the Bank of Slovenia (BoS) participates. On April 6,
2004, the middle rate for spot transactions in the interbank market was SIT 196.96 = US$1.
The BoS influences the movements of the exchange rate through active intervention in the
foreign exchange market without specifying, or precommitting to, a pre-announced path for
the exchange rate. In this regard, the Slovene exchange arrangement is de jure managed
floating with no pre-announced path for the exchange rate. However, as the value of the
currency is maintained within a certain fluctuation margins around a depreciating path, the de
facto exchange arrangement is an unannounced crawling band.

APPENDIX II

SLOVENIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Special Data Dissemination Standard: Slovenia has subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS), meets the SDDS specifications, and its metadata are posted
on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on the Internet.
Real Sector Statistics: The Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia (SORS) follows the
System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA) and the European System of Accounts 1995
(ESA95). Quarterly GDP estimates by industry and expenditure categories are published
within 80 days after the reference quarter.
In 2003, the SORS revised the expenditure side of its national accounts for 1995–2002.
However, the SORS still considers data for 1995–99 preliminary and will publish final data
based on the expenditure, value added and income approach during spring 2004.
The indices of consumer and producer prices are compiled in accordance with international
standards. The SORS also compiles a retail price index (RPI), which differs from the
consumer price index in weights only.
Government Finance Statistics: Slovenian fiscal statistics are timely and of a high quality.
The ministry of finance publishes a comprehensive monthly Bulletin of Government Finance,
which presents monthly data on the operations of the “state budget” (Budgetary Central
Government), local governments, social security (Pension and Health funds), and the
consolidated general government. The coverage of general government excludes the
operations of extrabudgetary funds and own revenues of general government agencies
(zavods), which are small. However, 2002 data reported for publication in the 2003 GFS
Yearbook now include the operations of the twelve extrabudgetary funds. Monthly fiscal
indicators are reported for publication in IFS on a timely basis.
Money and Banking Statistics: Monetary statistics are timely and of good quality.
Balance of Payments Statistics: Balance of payments data are comprehensive and of high
quality. These data have been published in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook
since 1993 (with estimates of the international investment position published since 1994). In
2002, the Bank of Slovenia revised the balance of payments statistics going back to 1994; the
most significant revisions were related to the income component of the current account and to
the other investment component of the financial account. In 2003, the data on incoming
foreign direct investment from 2001 onward were revised to include permanent debt from
foreign banks to their affiliated financial leasing companies resident in Slovenia.
External Debt Statistics: External debt statistics were revised and brought in line with the
IMF’s external debt dissemination standards in August 2003. The main change comprised of
inclusion of trade credits in debt data. However, debt service statistics that would be
consistent with the new external debt data are not yet available.

APPENDIX III

SLOVENIA: EXTERNAL SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
Slovenia’s external outlook is less favorable than the assessment during the last
Article IV consultation. While sustainability is not an imminent concern, developments
merit monitoring. Under the baseline scenario, the external debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to
increase by about 10 percentage points in the next few years and stabilize at about 63 percent
in 2008–09. External debt service, as ratio to exports of goods and services, is projected to
reach 18 percent in 2007 and remain around that level thereafter. The underlying reasons for
the increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio are as follows: (i) a widening of the current account
deficit resulting from strong domestic demand fueled by the convergence related decline in
interest rates in the run-up to euro adoption. As the experience of noncore euro area countries
shows, domestic demand pressures are likely to be self-correcting, and the current account
deficit should eventually narrow; (ii) increased reliance by all domestic entities on foreign
financing as access becomes easier upon EU accession; and (iii) a temporary slowdown of the
government’s privatization program and the associated foreign inflows, reflecting the
authorities’ desire to minimize exchange rate pressures under ERM2. Foreign direct
investment inflows are expected to recover upon euro adoption.
2.
The stress tests suggest that the baseline scenario is subject to some risk, in
particular with regard to sizeable depreciation of the currency. While Slovenia seems
relatively resilient to shocks to nominal interest rates and GDP growth, a one-time depreciation
of the currency would have a considerable impact on the external debt ratio. A 30-percent
decline in the tolar exchange rate against the euro in 2004 would result in an immediate
increase of the debt-to-GDP ratio to 78 percent, which would reach 81½ percent by 2008.
However, given a possibility of sizeable capital inflows in a run-up to euro adoption, Slovenia
is more likely to face an upward pressure on its currency, thus limiting the likelihood of this
scenario. A combination of one-standard error shocks (scenario 6) would have a considerably
smaller effect on external indebtedness, with the debt-to-GDP ratio reaching about 67½
percent in 2009. Finally, if GDP growth, nominal interest rate, euro deflator, noninterest
current account, and nondebt inflows would remain at their historical averages in 2004–09, the
projected increase in the external debt-to-GDP ratio would be less pronounced than in the
baseline scenario. Substantial nondebt capital inflows and higher GDP deflator growth account
for the more favorable outlook in this scenario. Neither of these factors are expected to
contribute to external debt developments to a similar extent in the baseline scenario as the
government is likely to proceed more gradually with its privatization plans and inflation is
projected to slow down.

APPENDIX III

Statement by Willy Kiekens, Executive Director for Republic of Slovenia
and Ksenija Maver, Advisor to Executive Director
May 7, 2004

The authorities wish to thank the staff for constructive discussions and their balanced, wellstructured report, and for their valuable insights that helped shape the Slovenia's policy
strategy during its crucial preparations for entering the ERM-2 and adopting the euro.
I. Recent Economic Developments
In the first quarter of 2004, the economy's rebound continued, and inflation has
declined faster than planned...
In April 2004, annual headline inflation was at 3.5 percent, down from 5.3 percent in April
2003 and 8.4 percent in April 2002. Core inflation was around 3.0 percent. This implies that
the targets for the end of 2004 have already been met in April. The steep disinflation
acquired momentum with the adoption of the program for ERM-2 entry and euro adoption
launched last November by the Bank of Slovenia and the Slovenian Government. The
program was paralleled by improved coordination of economic policies, a substantial disindexation of interests and wages, firm fiscal policies, a determined wage policy, better
control of administered prices, and lowered excise duties in response to sharp oil price
increases. These actions were complemented by a monetary policy that prevented capital
inflows from generating inflationary pressures. Weak economic activity, at a level below
potential, gave additional support. In addition, a large share of increasing domestic demand
was satisfied by imports, which eased the pressure on domestic prices.
It is most important that inflation is declining in a sustainable way, with the external and
internal accounts kept in balance. Slovenia's economic policy actions were coordinated to
avoid possible disruptions in the real economy.
Concerning the factors contributing to disinflation, the views of the authorities and the staff
differ only in nuances. The staff concludes that the main force behind the disinflation was
the widening of the output gap during the economic slowdown. The authorities believe that
other factors, primarily policy coordination, wage de-indexation, fiscal prudence and wage
restraint were also important and should be cited.
.... and the fiscal account remained close to balance.
The fiscal position during the first quarter of 2004 remained strong. Strong tax collection has
kept revenues buoyant, exceeding the projections. Expenditures were strictly monitored and
stayed below the budgeted limits. As a result the 2004 fiscal deficit target of 1.7 percent is
within reach.

-2-

The monetary policy framework was kept unchanged.
Monetary policy remains focused on disinflation, keeping a close eye on parity with foreign
interest rates to head off inflationary pressures caused by capital inflows. Backed by the
strong deflationary trend and Slovenia's declining country risk premium, the Bank of
Slovenia has continued lowering policy interest rates and moderating the pace of the nominal
depreciation of the tolar against the euro. Operational activities concentrated on aligning
Slovenia's monetary policy operations with the standards of the European Central Bank.
II. The Outlook for the Rest of 2004 and Beyond
Economic activity is picking up and the prospects over the next two years are positive.
Slovenian growth will be driven mostly by private consumption and investments. Private
consumption will be encouraged by lower interest rates and the launching of a housing
scheme, and will be restrained by the moderation of wage growth and uncertainties in the
labor market stemming from competitive pressures within the EU. The prospects for both
private and public investment are positive: conditions in the financial markets are favorable,
and there are ambitious plans for infrastructure investments. The Bank of Slovenia foresees
growth rebounding from the low of 2.3 percent recorded in 2003 to 3.1 percent in 2004, 3.6
percent in 2005, and 3.9 percent in 2006.
It is expected that the external current account position will weaken. Imports will be
stimulated by domestic demand, but exports, while they will increase, will be restrained by
the continuing uncertainty of the euro zone’s recovery. The current account, which was
virtually in balance in 2003, is expected to register a deficit of about 1.0 percent of GDP in
2004. This deficit could rise to 2.0 percent in the years 2005 and 2006.
The inflation outlook is better than expected.
Given the strong momentum of disinflation, and the balanced macroeconomic situation, the
Bank of Slovenia has revised its inflation forecasts for the end of 2004 from 3.5 percent to
3.2 percent, and for the end of 2005 from 2.9 percent to 2.8 percent. Inflation is expected to
remain at 2.8 percent in 2006. These outcomes would ensure compliance with the Maastricht
inflation target.
The authorities and the staff broadly agree on the growth and inflation projections. The
authorities consider that the low demand scenario is the more likely. Accordingly their
growth and inflation projections are also more modest than those of the staff.
The Government aspires to an early entry into ERM-2 and euro adoption at the
beginning of 2007.
The milestones marking the path to ERM-2 and euro adoption, set last November by the
Government and the Bank of Slovenia, are considered feasible, the more so because the

-3-

general government deficit was 1.4 percent of GDP in 2003, the public debt is currently 27
percent of GDP, and the long-term interest rate was 4.99 percent in April 2004--all
comfortably within the Maastricht limits. The exchange rate is stable, and the disinflation
record is encouraging.
During the run up to ERM-2 entry, monetary policy will remain focused on disinflation and
exchange rate stability. After ERM-2 entry, exchange rate stability will be the only
remaining objective, with interest rate policy subordinated to the stability of the exchange
rate. The central parity at the time of ERM-2 entry will be jointly established by the
Slovenian Government, the Bank of Slovenia, the European Central Bank, the Euro group,
and the European Commission. It is expected to be near the market rate prevailing at the
time of Slovenia's ERM-2 entry. It is also expected that Slovenia will accept the ERM-2's
standard fluctuation band. During the ERM-2 period, Slovenia's monetary policy
instruments will remain unchanged, since they are well tailored to the local environment and
can serve as a powerful tool for efficient market interventions that may be required under the
ERM-2 arrangement.
The ERM-2 period will entail risks endangering the inflation target and exchange rate
stability. Excessive private consumption and wage growth could undermine the inflation and
exchange rate objectives. The macroeconomic environment should remain stable to avoid
that the financial markets would be tempted to test the sustainability of the central parity.
Preserving fiscal stability is the key to preserving the credibility of the central parity and
avoiding a prolonged stay in the ERM-2. Wage discipline and fiscal prudence will be
important tools for avoiding developments that could seriously damage the economy, and
especially employment. A strong publicity campaign has made these tradeoffs well known to
the public.
Fiscal policy will be key to maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Fiscal policy will have to ensure continued macroeconomic stability and keep inflation in
check. Measures for safeguarding the strength of the public finances will include, first,
imposing rational limits on public consumption to ensure the maintenance of sufficient
reserves to allow automatic stabilizers to be used to their full extent; and second, restraining
public sector wage growth.
It is beyond doubt that this will not be easy, especially during the approach of the elections
scheduled for next October. The fiscal targets have been secured by two important
safeguards. First, the budget for 2005 was already locked in last December with the
framework of Slovenia's 2004-2005 budget, and will not be adjusted until the spring of 2005,
after the macroeconomic outlook is assessed. Second, the rule for the strict monitoring of
the budget execution has been put in place, and will be followed notwithstanding the
overperformance of the first quarter revenues.
Slovenia's improved fiscal outlook makes some room for fiscal action. The authorities intend
to increase the competitiveness of the corporate sector by advancing the planned reduction of

-4-

the payroll tax by six months, from next January to July 2004. This measure, which will
reduce the 2004 budget by some five billion Slovenian tolar, equivalent to 0.08 percent of
GDP, is aimed at reducing the cost of labor and helping companies that pay lower wages. To
keep the tax holiday from spilling over into higher wages, the reduction of the payroll tax
will not become effective until safeguards are put in place to ensure that private sector wages
are kept within the pre set limits.
Wage policy is considered essential for securing a smooth ERM-2 entry.
Real wages are expected to rise by 2.0 percent annually, lagging behind productivity growth.
The largest contribution to wage moderation will come from the public sector, where an
agreement concluded last July among the social partners has locked in the growth of public
sector wages. Real increases of no more than 0.5 percent for 2004 and 1.0 percent for 2005
are expected.
The wage setting arrangement for the public sector has defined the path for private sector
wage adjustments. On April 28, 2004, the social partners reached a national agreement
limiting private sector wage growth in 2004 and 2005 to one percentage point below
productivity growth, which provides for making adjustments in 2005 if the 2004 targets are
not met. At the individual level, the agreement secures a lump sum wage increase for all
workers aimed at reducing wage disparities. Negotiations have now started at the level of
individual industries, to make the agreed wage settlement operational and effective. This
will clear the way for the payroll tax reduction.
The financial system remains robust but is coming under increasing competitive
pressure from the EU.
The recent mission for updating Slovenia's FSAP has confirmed that Slovenia's financial
system is sound. It has provided valuable advice on how to address problems arising from the
increased competitive pressures resulting from EU entry. The mission's recommendations
will provide the framework for an Action Plan to be coordinated by the Bank of Slovenia,
which will monitor the practical implementation of the mission's advice just as it did after
initial FSAP exercise in 2000.
The Bank of Slovenia is considering a reinforcement of banking supervision, especially in
light of stronger pressures to lend to weaker clients. The Bank might also introduce at the
beginning of 2005 dynamic provisioning to counteract cyclic upturns, if international
accounting standards would not yet apply.
III. Conclusion
A few days ago, Slovenia became a member of the European Union community. The
promise of EU accession was a major factor in securing public support for the structural and
institutional reforms aimed at bringing sustained growth and macroeconomic stability. The
Slovenian economy today has remarkable resilience. It has come very close to achieving

-5-

price stability; the current account deficit and the fiscal deficit are expected to remain
modest; the financial system is robust; and safeguards against the risks have been put in
place.
From the beginning of its independence to the present day, Slovenia has never needed
financial assistance from the Fund. But its regular Article IV consultations and technical
assistance missions have enabled it to constantly check its policy approach with the Fund's
staff. The Fund's expertise, the frank exchange of views, and especially the readiness of
Fund missions to examine everything from conceptual policy issues to the effectiveness of
those policies, were highly valued features of these consultations. At this important moment
of EU accession, the authorities wish to express their sincere gratitude for the Fund's good
advice, and for the support for their stabilization policies embodied in the valuable reports
resulting from these discussions.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Slovenia
On May 7, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Slovenia.1
Background
Domestic demand rebounded strongly in 2003 after three anemic years. All components of
domestic demand strengthened appreciably, fueled by declines in interest rates and the
associated pickup in bank credit to the private sector. However, there was a large negative
swing in the contribution of net foreign demand to growth. Real GDP growth slowed to
2.3 percent, and the output gap widened. The external current account position receded from a
sizeable surplus in 2002 to approximate balance in 2003. Competitiveness and other external
vulnerability indicators remained satisfactory.
Progress with disinflation was better than expected. Year-on-year inflation declined from
7.2 percent at end-2002 to 3.5 percent in March 2004. Staff analysis suggests that the widening
of the output gap associated with the economic slowdown was the dominant driving force
behind disinflation in 2003. Other contributory factors, albeit to a lesser degree, were a
moderation of the pace of tolar depreciation, smaller increases in regulated prices and indirect
taxes, and excise tax adjustments to offset increases in international oil prices. While wage drift
in the public sector slowed and economy-wide real wage growth in 2003 was broadly similar—
about 2 percent—to that in 2002, the gap between wage and productivity growth narrowed.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

The fiscal outturn in 2003 implied some withdrawal of stimulus. The general government
deficit—1.4 percent of GDP—was slightly smaller than that envisaged in the mid-year
supplementary budget and broadly similar to the outturn in the past three years.
Monetary conditions at the policy level remained broadly unchanged in 2003. Prompted by the
deceleration in inflation, European Central Bank interest rate cuts, and a perception of falling
country-risk premium, the Bank of Slovenia lowered its key policy rate steadily by a total of
3½ percentage points since December 2002 to 4.75 percent in April 2004. Meanwhile, the tolar
continued to depreciate vis-à-vis the euro, though the pace of depreciation slowed from an
annualized rate of 3.3 percent in December 2002 to 2 percent in March 2004. The indexation of
financial contracts was eliminated in 2003. Bank lending rates fell in real terms, and private
credit demand and interest-sensitive capital inflows picked up. A large part of the expansion of
credit to enterprises was foreign currency-denominated, and was financed by rising bank
borrowing from abroad.
GDP growth is expected to rebound in 2004 and rise above the potential rate subsequently.
Growth is likely to be driven by strong domestic demand boosted by favorable business and
consumer expectations triggered by European Union (EU) accession and prospective euro
adoption, and a convergence-related decline in interest rates. In this environment, there is some
risk of domestic demand boom. The contribution of net foreign demand to growth would likely
remain negative in the foreseeable future, and the current account is expected to swing into a
modest deficit. The prospective narrowing of the output gap is likely to slow down the
disinflation process, complicating achievement of the Maastricht inflation criterion. Slovenia
already meets the Maastricht criteria for long-term interest rates and the fiscal deficit and public
debt ratios.
Following Slovenia’s accession to the European Union on May 1, 2004, the authorities plan to
enter ERM2 in the course of the second half of 2004 with the aim of adopting the euro in
January 2007.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors congratulated the authorities for their successful entry to the European
Union (EU) on May 1, 2004 and their impressive macroeconomic policy achievements, and
noted that the main challenge now is to ensure a smooth ERM2 entry and euro adoption, as
well as to continue preparing the economy for successful performance within the union.
Directors observed that Slovenia is in many respects well poised to join the euro area,
particularly in light of the substantial real and nominal convergence in meeting most of the
Maastricht criteria. They also considered that Slovenia’s competitiveness appears adequate.
Inflation, however, while falling, remains above the EU average.
Directors stressed that the intended early ERM2 entry and eventual euro adoption would
depend critically on bringing inflation sustainably down to a level that, in addition to meeting the
Maastricht criterion, would not hamper competitiveness once the exchange rate is fixed.

-3Other key tasks are to ensure that fiscal and wage policies are capable of absorbing shocks.
Directors cautioned that a credit-financed demand boom could complicate achieving the
Maastricht inflation criterion and create stresses on the banking sector.
Directors welcomed the recent sharp drop in inflation. They noted that while the increased slack
in the economy in 2003 was probably the main driving force behind disinflation, policy
measures—such as a slower pace of tolar depreciation—also contributed. Directors also
welcomed the efforts to limit excessive increases in administrative and regulated prices by
pressing for greater cost efficiency and savings in public companies. In this context, some
Directors stressed the need to further liberalize those prices. Directors commended the decision
to eliminate indexation of financial contracts.
Directors underscored that monetary policy needs to play a pro-active role in the run-up to
ERM2 entry by restraining monetary conditions in order to contribute to disinflation and help
contain possible intense demand pressures under ERM2. While acknowledging the Bank of
Slovenia’s (BoS) concern that monetary restraint could trigger capital inflows and potentially
impact competitiveness, Directors stressed that monetary conditions should not be loosened
prematurely.
Directors emphasized that fiscal policy should be oriented to alleviating budgetary pressures
related to EU accession and coping with the risk of a possible private sector demand boom.
They welcomed the significant expenditure saving measures incorporated in the budget for
2004–05, and noted that these measures should be carefully safeguarded in an election year.
Nevertheless, they stressed that further expenditure rationalization—particularly in the areas of
health care, education, and social transfers—is essential to ensure sustained flexibility in fiscal
policy and to achieve the authorities’ medium-term goal of structural balance. Directors urged
that, in the event of a demand boom, any revenue overperformance should be saved and any
further lowering of payroll taxes avoided.
Directors stressed that wage policy needs to play a central role in fostering disinflation and
safeguarding competitiveness. They commended the authorities for weakening wage indexation
and reducing wage drift in the public sector, and urged them to consolidate these gains by
restricting the cost of the new wage structure. Directors noted that wage policy can usefully
contribute to disinflation by reducing wage increases relative to productivity growth, particularly
in the nontradable sector. They also considered that achieving the Maastricht inflation criterion
might warrant a temporary wage pact at the national and enterprise levels under the guidance
of the government. Directors encouraged the government and social partners to fully eliminate
wage indexation and move to a wage-setting system that ensures wage differentiation based on
productivity.
Directors noted that the banking system is generally sound. However, they emphasized that
strengthening supervisory and prudential oversight—in line with the Financial System Stability
Assessment update—is essential to guard against the risks of rapid credit growth and stresses
on the financial system. They noted signs that banks were starting to shift to more risky
borrowers as a result of increased competition, and cautioned that this tendency was likely to

-4intensify as profit margins were squeezed further. Given the potential for a credit boom and
related risks in the run-up to euro adoption, Directors cautioned against any easing of the
existing prudential regulations. They deemed appropriate the BoS’s intention to complement the
supervisory framework by introducing dynamic provisioning appropriate, while noting that other
prudential tools may have to be considered to control surges in credit growth. Directors
welcomed Slovenia’s active AML/CFT efforts.
Directors urged the authorities to maintain the momentum behind structural reforms in other
areas and to improve the environment for private sector development. They welcomed
achievements in liberalizing utilities and transport services, and called for further progress in the
natural gas, telephony, and transport sectors, as well as a broader privatization program.
Directors also noted that stronger competition was likely to lead to lower prices, and hence
usefully complement the authorities’ disinflation efforts. The move toward the adoption of the
euro would be helped by greater labor market flexibility and higher participation rates—
especially among older workers.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board. The Staff Report for the 2004
Article IV Consultation with Slovenia is also available.
