STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Economic prospects. Qatar is using its fiscal space, generated from an increase in hydrocarbon
production and high prices, to implement a large public spending program to maintain strong
growth in the nonhydrocarbon sector in the medium term and improving living standards. Real
GDP growth is projected to accelerate to 19 percent in 2011 from 17 percent in 2010. Average
headline consumer price inflation has remained contained in 2011 at 2 percent. The overall fiscal
balance remained in a surplus of 2.7 percent of GDP in 2010/11. The current account balance is
projected to record a surplus of 28 percent of GDP.
Risks to the outlook. The principal risks ahead are lower oil and gas prices as a result of a decline
in global demand, and disruption in transportation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) due to increased
geopolitical tensions, but the government has adequate financial cushions and a policy framework
in place that would mitigate potential risks.
Sustaining economic and financial stability. The expansionary fiscal stance in 2011/12 warrants
careful monitoring of aggregate demand to ward off risks of inflation. In the context of the peg,
the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) would need to manage liquidity more actively. Monetary policy
should support credit growth without fuelling inflationary pressures or attracting short-term capital
inflows. Over the medium term, fiscal policy will need to balance sometimes competing objectives
of stabilization, development and generating intergenerational savings.
Strengthening and developing the financial sector. The banking system remains resilient to
shocks. Nevertheless, enabling a more robust risk assessment culture and conducting regular stress
testing of banks, developing a more formal and transparent macroprudential policy framework,
and putting in place a framework for early warning system would help mitigate risks to the
banking system and strengthen financial stability. Efforts should continue to develop the domestic
bond markets.
Building institutions. The authorities need to accelerate steps to establish a macro-fiscal unit that
could develop a medium-term expenditure framework to ensure the efficiency of public spending.
Improving economic statistics. With data availability underpinning good policy-making, more
progress is needed for timely compilation and dissemination of key statistics.

QATAR 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

BACKGROUND AND CURRENT CONTEXT
1.
Qatar has the third-largest proven
reserves of gas in the world, and is now the
world's largest producer of LNG. Qatar’s
20-year investment program, which focused
on a strategy to commercialize its large natural
resources, culminated in 2011. The State has
placed a moratorium on development of new
hydrocarbon projects until 2015 to give itself
time to assess its production performance and
carry out a comprehensive study of its offshore
North Field, where its gas is produced. Qatar
has embarked on a huge infrastructure
investment program over the medium term–
including roads, completion of the port and
airport, and metro—for which the budget
allocation is expected to be close to
$100 billion.
2.
Qatar has weathered the global
crisis and the regional turmoil with high
growth, and large external current account
and fiscal surpluses. The country’s large

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND
RISKS
Rapid Growth with Financial Stability
3.
Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
growth is projected to accelerate
to 19 percent in 2011 from 17 percent
in 2010—as the production of LNG increased
by 36 percent. Increased activity in
manufacturing, financial services, and trade
and hotels is driving growth in the
nonhydrocarbon sector at 9 percent in 2011.
4.
Headline inflation has remained
contained in 2011, but inflation excluding
rent increased to 5.8 percent in October
2011. Following an average deflation of
around 2.5 percent in 2010, inflation is
expected to average around 2 percent in 2011
(end-year 2.5 percent)—with negative rental
inflation being more than offset by a general
increase in all the other components of the CPI
basket.

budgeted receipt of profit transfers from
public enterprises, the overall fiscal balance
(net lending/borrowing) remained in a surplus
of 2.7 percent of GDP in 2010/11.1 The
government did not raise any new external
borrowings in 2010/11, but issued domestic
bonds and Treasury bills (T-bills) to facilitate
sterilization and liquidity management against
the backdrop of capital inflows. As a result the
net debt of the government increased. The
post-budget announcement of salary and
pension hikes would add an estimated
$1.6 billion to government expenditure in
2011/12. 2 Since oil prices have remained on
average well above $55 a barrel in 2011, the
actual fiscal balance is projected to record a
surplus of 7.2 percent of GDP in 2011/12. The
current account surplus is projected at
28 percent of GDP in 2011, up from a surplus
of 26 percent in 2010, reflecting increased
volume and prices of hydrocarbon exports.

Qatar Petroleum (QP) transferred lower profits to the
budget since it retained QR25 billion ($6.9 billion) of
its profits to increase its capital. However, if the
QR25 billion capital contribution to QP had been
included in investment income and the transfer back
to QP shown below the line as a financing item instead
of being netted out of investment income, last year’s
overall surplus would have been 7.6 percent of GDP.

Effective September 2011, the government
announced a 60 percent increase in the basic salary
and social allowance for Qatari state civilian
employees, a 120 percent rise for military personnel of
officer ranks, and a 50 percent rise for military
personnel of other ranks. In addition, the pension of
civilian retirees will increase by 60 percent, while that
of retired military officers will rise by 120 percent and
of other ranks by 50 percent.

Monetary and credit developments
reflect easy conditions. Commercial banks’
claims on the private sector increased by
19 percent y-o-y in October 2011. The easing
of monetary conditions in 2011 coincided with
the launch of some infrastructure-related
investments in the hydrocarbon and
nonhydrocarbon sectors.
7.
The banking sector is wellcapitalized. Equity injections and asset
purchases by the government strengthened
confidence in the financial system. The Qatar
Investment Authority (QIA) injected $2.8 billion
of capital into the banking system in three
tranches between 2009 and 2011. As a result,
the capital adequacy ratio of the banking
sector increased to 22.3 percent by end-June
2011. The average return on assets stood at
2.7 percent, and the non-performing loans
ratio was 2.3 percent at end-June 2011
(Figure 1). The exposure of local banks to
European banks is limited.3

SHORT-AND MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK IS FAVORABLE
DESPITE GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY
8.
The economic outlook for 2012
remains positive, despite increased
external risks. Real GDP growth rate is
projected to moderate to 6 percent in 2012,
with real hydrocarbon GDP slowing down to
less than 3 percent, as LNG production
remains constant. Large infrastructure
investment and increased production in the
manufacturing sector will maintain real
nonhydrocarbon GDP growth at 9 percent.
Average headline CPI inflation is projected at
4 percent in 2012. The fiscal balance is still
projected to record a surplus of over
7 percent, and the external balance is
projected to post a surplus of $47 billion.
9.
Qatar is expected to continue
recording a strong economic performance
over the medium term. The fiscal and
external current account balances are
projected to record surpluses, as
hydrocarbon prices are expected to remain
high. Large government investment would
sustain growth in the nonhydrocarbon sector
between 9 and 10 percent beyond 2012.
Average headline inflation is projected at
4 to 5 percent over the medium term, as
rents stabilize due to a gradual decline of the
current excess capacity in real estate, and as
the implementation of large investment
projects lead to some overheating pressures.

Risks are manageable
10.
The principal risks ahead are lower
oil and gas receipts as a result of a decline
in global demand and potential disruption
in transportation of LNG due to increased
geopolitical tensions. The government,
however, has adequate financial cushions
and a policy framework in place to mitigate
the impact, and price risk is limited since
Qatar’s hydrocarbon exports are delivered
under long-term contracts. Moreover, Qatar’s
low cost of LNG production, and the built-in
diversion clauses in the gas contracts, give it
additional flexibility to manage quantity and
price risks.
11.
A large drop in hydrocarbon prices
would have a significant impact on the
fiscal and external current accounts but
Qatar would still continue to generate
surpluses.4 Staff’s alternative
macroeconomic scenario indicates that the
external current account surplus would
decline sharply from an average 25.6 percent
4

A “crisis scenario” is generated by treating 2011/Q3
as being equivalent to 2008Q3 (oil price already
slightly off its peak and about to crash in Q4) and
then taking the quarter on quarter percentage
changes from the previous crisis. This implies the oil
price falling to $50 a barrel in 2011Q4, and
averaging $55 in 2012 and $70 in 2013. In addition,
LNG production, and hence exports, are estimated to
be 15 percent below the benchmark scenario. Crude
oil prices are used as a proxy for gas prices for this
exercise, as all the LNG and gas-related products are
converted to oil barrel equivalent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

of GDP in 2012–13 to 5.6 percent of GDP
under the shock scenario without diversion
of exports. The fiscal balance would turn
from a surplus in 2011, to a deficit from 2012
onwards, and cash flows to the State would
fall by $41 billion between 2012 and 2016,
but still generate surpluses in each year. Real
nonhydrocarbon GDP would reduce by half
in 2012, due to delays in the implementation
of transportation and other infrastructure
projects (Figure 2). The authorities, however,
do not see oil prices falling below $80 a
barrel in the medium term due to the
emergence of high demand for oil and gas
from China and India.

Even so, the drying up of foreign funding
channels could hinder the prospects of other
borrowers by increasing the cost, and
thereby affecting the infrastructure
investment plans and nonhydrocarbon
growth.6 Spillovers through financial
channels could impact Qatar’s valuation of
external portfolios and reduce the value of its
foreign assets.

12.
In addition, a deepening of the
banking and sovereign debt problems in
advanced economies could result in a
tightening of global liquidity and impact
Qatar through channels similar to those
observed in 2008–09, particularly since
banks have again expanded their real
estate lending. Nevertheless, risks to
banking stability appear much lower now
after three rounds of bank capitalization and
asset restructuring since 2008. Qatar tapped
the market with a $5 billion sovereign bond
issuance at favorable yields in November
2011.5

5

The bond was issued in three tranches: a five-year
$2 billion tranche at a yield of 3.184 percent,
$2 billion with 10-year maturity at a yield of
4.63 percent, and $1 billion of 30 year-maturity
yielding 5.825 percent.

Segoviano (IMF WP 10/120), a measure of the
vulnerability of one country to contagion from a
group of countries–the Spillover Coefficient (SC)–
is calculated, based on the CDS data of the
countries in the group.1 The SC measures the
probability of a sovereign default in one country
given default in the other countries in the group.
It can thus be used to estimate cross-country
contributions to financial stress.
While the estimated level of financial spillovers
to Qatar remains relatively low—and lower
than during 2008–09—Europe has been a key
contributor. The percentage contribution to the
change in a country’s SC is a measure of marketbased contagion from the other countries in the
sample. For the period since July 2011, when the
Euro area debt crisis intensified, European
countries are identified as explaining 90 percent
of the contagion risk to Qatar. This stands in
contrast to the period following the collapse of
Lehman, where the contribution to financial stress
was much more evenly spread across countries,
with neighbors contributing more due to their
regional ties.

POLICY PRIORITIES
A. Sustaining Economic and Financial Stability
13.
Headline inflation remains
subdued, but inflation risks have risen due
to an increase in public sector wages. The
authorities acknowledged that the economy
could face potential inflationary pressures
over the medium term from three channels,
viz., the expansionary effect of the major
Barzan gas project that will start in 2012, the
implementation of major projects in the
nonhydrocarbon sector, and the recent fiscal
package. The former two channels pose little
concern to the authorities as they are growth
generating, while the impact of the public
sector wage increase would depend on the
marginal propensity for domestic
consumption. Most of this inflation would
come from the nontradable sector,
notwithstanding the excess supply in real
estate, which will keep rents depressed.7 The
authorities emphasized that the newly
formed High-Level Committee on Prices
would contain monopolistic price pressures,
while the recently introduced limits on retail
lending by banks against salary assignment
preempted further leverage of the salary
increase.8 Staff projects a potential

7

Inflation reached double digits in 2008, driven by
supply bottlenecks and rising rents. In contrast, since
2009, rental inflation has been declining, and from
the second half of 2011, food price inflation is
expected to moderate. In addition, credit growth is
not expected to reach the 2008 level.

The authorities explained that the salary increase is
expected to alleviate household debt to some
extent, by inducing some individuals to repay part of
their loans to banks.

inflationary effect of the recent fiscal package
of about one percentage point (Appendix 1).9
14.
The expansionary fiscal stance in
2011/12 thus warrants careful monitoring
of aggregate demand to ward off risks of
inflation. The underlying fiscal stance for
FY 2011/12 mainly reflects higher
expenditure on account of the salary
increase, one-off current expenditures
related to the Arab Spring, and capital
projects, which would be less than
compensated by higher hydrocarbon
revenues, expected additional profit
transfers from public enterprises and higher
corporate taxes.10 Staff and the authorities
agreed that fiscal policy needs to continue
maintaining a careful balance between
spending on infrastructure to sustain non9

Staff estimated a simple model on annual
1990-2008 data. The analysis was not extended
to 2010, since the last two years saw deflationary
trends, mainly due to sharp declines in rents. The
fall in rents might have been overestimated, as the
measurement of rents (which account for
approximately 30 percent of the consumption
basket) is skewed towards new contracts. The model
included non-oil real GDP and domestic credit
growth, which are both endogenously determined
with inflation. The model included as exogenous
variables one-period lags of current and capital
expenditure (to alleviate endogeneity concerns) as
well as current international food prices, the nominal
effective exchange rate, and an index for imports
prices.
10

The nonhydrocarbon deficit as a percent of
nonhydrocarbon GDP, a better measure of the fiscal
stance in a hydrocarbon economy, is projected to
expand from 25.6 percent to 27.7 percent this fiscal
year instead of contracting from 36.5 percent, had
investment income been fully accounted for in FY
2010/11.

QATAR 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

inflationary growth, and saving and
investing hydrocarbon surpluses abroad in
order to generate sufficient income to
finance future budgets. The authorities do
not anticipate any further one-off increases
in current expenditure, and aim to allocate
40 percent of the total expenditure toward
capital expenditure over the medium term.
15.
The QCB should maintain its policy
stance of driving out short-term
speculative inflows and absorbing
structural liquidity. Beginning January 2011,
the QCB imposed a cap on its remunerated
deposits and reduced policy interest rates in
phases to align them with US policy rates.
These measures proved successful in driving
out short-term arbitrage funds that were
intermediated through the banking system
(Appendix 2). Issuance of government bonds
and sukuk coinciding with the imposition of
the cap on central bank deposits, and
issuance of T-bills in lieu of certificates of
deposit (CDs) facilitated the mopping up of
structural liquidity from the banking system
over a longer period, while shifting the cost
from the QCB’s balance sheet to government
expenditure. In the context of the peg, the
central bank has limited flexibility in
deviating from US interest rates, and would,
therefore, need to manage liquidity more
actively to keep inflation in check.

The QCB’s main liquidity management
instruments comprise reserve requirements,
CDs, which have since been discontinued,
and open market operations. The authorities
noted that their experience so far with the
issuance of T-bills has been positive. They
plan to continue with regular issuance of Tbills with a view to managing liquidity and
developing the short end of the yield curve.
16.
Developing a more formal and
transparent macroprudential policy
framework— notably with respect to the
definition of objectives, the elaboration of
analytical methods, and the policy
toolkit— to enable a swift response when
needed, would help achieve orderly credit
growth without generating overheating.
The main challenges for monetary policy will
be to support credit growth–particularly
project related–without fuelling inflationary
pressures or short-term capital inflows.
Credit is already expanding at a fast clip,
driven by the public sector, and real estate.
Continued growth in the nonhydrocarbon
sector and implementation of infrastructure
related projects will provide additional
demand for credit. Against this backdrop,
staff cautioned that banks and the QCB need
to ensure that the overall credit quality does
not weaken, particularly in the real estate
sector in view of the prevailing excess supply,
and the precarious global economic outlook.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

QATAR

The authorities agreed with staff’s suggestion
and might seek our assistance in developing
a macroprudential framework. They were,
however, of the view that the current excess
supply in real estate would gradually
converge with demand as Qatar’s
infrastructure projects get completed and the
construction workers are replaced by whitecollar workforce. They illustrated that the
completion of the construction of the new
airport would entail additional jobs for about
30,000 service-oriented and skilled workers
to run the facility. Such new workers, in
contrast to the current construction workers,
are expected to migrate with their families,
which would generate demand for other
services such as hospitals, schools,
entertainment, etc. Thus, the multiplier effect
of additional job creation in any service
industry on other service industries would
generate additional demand for housing.

The QCB should monitor individual
bank liquidity conditions and stand ready
to relieve potential pressures. The interest
rate differential between local and foreign
currency lending has led to a high demand
for bank credit in foreign currency by
residents.11 This has resulted in an increase in
foreign currency liabilities from the interbank,
corporate, and public segments. Staff was of
the view that a global foreign funding shock
may generate some liquidity tightening in
the domestic banking sector, which would
need to be managed, particularly at
individual bank-level. The QCB is monitoring
the liquidity of individual banks for signs of
stress and is confident that its prudential
regulation on the foreign asset-liability
position of banks and the requirement that
banks lend in foreign currency only if
corporates are able to generate revenues in
foreign currency, both provide a built-in
safeguard against potential liquidity squeeze
and credit risk. Moreover, QCB indicated that
a large part of the foreign currency loans
were extended to a few large governmentowned enterprises that were profitable and
generated earnings in foreign currency;
hence they were not concerned about credit
risk.

Lending to residents in foreign currency increased
by $31 billion between December 2010 and October
2011 to $49 billion (46 percent of total loans and
27 percent to total assets of the banking system). A
large proportion of demand for loans in foreign
currency has been driven by government and private
enterprises, some of which is in the real estate
sector. On the liabilities side, borrowings from
non-residents in foreign currency increased by
$6 billion, central bank reserves fell by $16 billion,
and the balance was covered by foreign currency
deposits of public enterprises over the same period.

Box 2. Interest Rate Pass-Through in the GCC
The pass-through of policy rates varies among
countries and over different time spans. In some
countries, deposit rates are stickier than lending
rates while in others the reverse is true. The passthrough of policy rates to lending rates is on the
low side, possibly reflecting the shallowness of
money markets in the GCC countries and banking
sector regulations. Estimates for four GCC
countries suggest that the interest rate passthrough was 0.30 and 0.50 for lending and deposit
rates, respectively.1
The long-term relationship between interbank
rates and bank lending rates differs
significantly between countries; it appears to be
strongest for Bahrain and Kuwait; in Qatar, the
relationship is weaker, though still significant for
the deposit rate, while there is no relationship
between rates in Oman.
Adjustment speeds implied by the short-term
dynamics also differ across countries.
Adjustment is relatively slow in Bahrain, with rates
adjusting fully after 20 months; in Kuwait, the
adjustment of deposit rates is also slow, with only
half of the adjustment captured in the first
12 months after the shock; and in Oman and Qatar,
an immediate effect on deposit and lending rates
(albeit with a small sensitivity, of around 1/10th) is
felt but most of the impact vanishes after six
months.
Continued efforts to develop the domestic
financial markets will increase interest rate
pass-through and strengthen monetary policy
transmission. The narrowing of interest rate
spreads between loans in foreign currency and
local currency would also require reforms in the
market to facilitate efficient pricing of risks for
long-term borrowing by banks. To achieve this,
there is a need to develop a well functioning
money market and a liquid sovereign yield curve.

The exchange rate peg has served
Qatar well as it provided a strong nominal
anchor. Preliminary estimates from CGERtype methodologies for exchange rate
assessment broadly indicate an undervalued
real effective exchange rate, narrowing over
the medium term (Appendix 3).12 The
macroeconomic balance approach suggests
that the Qatari Riyal is overvalued, which
implies that Qatar should accumulate larger
current account surpluses, given its
fundamentals. The external sustainability
approach suggests undervaluation, which
would imply that Qatar should save less. The
equilibrium real exchange rate approach also
indicates undervaluation. The preconditions
to sustain the peg, namely, a strong fiscal
position, a sound banking system, and
flexible labor and capital markets, are in
place and should facilitate adjustment.

expenditure is still its current component,
which has declined from its historical high of
about 90 percent of total expenditure
in 1990 to about 65 percent in FY 2010/11.
The authorities are balancing the competing
objectives of economic stabilization,
development and generating
intergenerational savings through fiscal
policy. They pointed out that despite the
increase in spending, the high hydrocarbon
prices have enabled them to continue to
generate cash flows to the State, and this
trend would continue over the medium
term.14
20.
Nevertheless, given the
authorities’ objective of fully financing
the budget from 2020 onwards from its
nonhydrocarbon revenues, and for
building buffers for shocks, staff
encouraged the authorities to save more
(Figure 3). With the nonhydrocarbon
balance projected at around 25 percent of
nonhydrocarbon GDP in 2016, this objective
will take effort to be achieved. Staff pointed
out that, in its benchmark scenario, projected
nonhydrocarbon revenues financing of the
total projected expenditure would increase
from 52 percent to about 63 percent in
2016/17, implying additional efforts in the
last four years. Expansion in the

Royalties from oil and gas revenues, corporate income
taxes on oil revenues and net profits accrue from QP to the
central government budget. The remaining oil and gas
revenues accrue directly to the State of Qatar and are,
among others, accumulated in the sovereign wealth fund
(SWF). The combined royalties, corporate income tax, net
profits of QP and the oil and gas revenues accumulated in
the SWF comprise the cash flows to the State.

implementation of the value added tax
(VAT) will significantly broaden the
nonhydrocarbon tax base and therefore
enable some increase in nonhydrocarbon
fiscal revenues. On the expenditure side,
given the plans for the announced large
capital projects, adjustment in current
expenditures would be the most feasible way
to reduce the dependency of the budget on
hydrocarbon revenues. The authorities are
confident of achieving their objectives by

2020. They do not foresee any further adhoc
increase in current expenditures, and remain
committed to keeping capital expenditure at
40 percent of total expenditure in the
medium term. The rationalization of the
corporate tax rate, the broadening of the tax
base, the non-renewal of tax holidays, and
the introduction of the withholding tax,
would increase corporate tax revenues in the
future.

B. STRENGTHENING AND DEVELOPING THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
21.
Staff’s stress tests indicate that the
banking system has the ability to
withstand credit and market risks.
Nevertheless, as also highlighted in the
Second Financial Stability Review of the QCB,
staff underscored the need to monitor
individual banks for stress, given the
interlinkages in the financial system. Further,
staff concurred with the QCB’s analysis that
banks’ dependence on wholesale funding,
though not significant, needs to be lowered
to mitigate potential risks. Staff and the
authorities agreed that enabling a more
robust risk assessment culture, conducting
regular stress testing of banks, and putting in
place a framework for an early warning
system would help mitigate risks to the
banking system and strengthen financial
stability.

ICRs with cash buffers stand at 18.3 in Q2
2011 compared to 13.1 at end-2010. The
income shock—a 25 percent decline—also
does not point to debt servicing pressures at
the aggregate level.15 Distance-to-default
results indicate that default risks still remain
low in 2011 compared to 2010.

Staff encourages the QCB to develop a
formal liquidity management framework to
facilitate a more proactive strategy in finetuning liquidity. In addition, coordination of
debt management with the Ministry of
Economy and Finance would be helpful in
maintaining a stable and adequate stock of
government securities for the further
development of an interbank repo market,
and also to provide a robust benchmark yield
curve for the corporate bond market. In this
context, staff welcomes the initiatives being

Staff welcomes the progress
toward the single regulatory regime.16
Other regulatory developments include the
ban on Islamic banking windows in
conventional banks (Appendix 4), and the
imposition of quantitative and price ceilings
on personal loans against salary assignment
(Appendix 5). These changes seek to bring
greater clarity to the regulatory framework,
mitigate risks in the banking system as well
as household debt, and usher in a more
orderly credit growth. The approval by the
Council of Ministers of the proposal to
establish the single regulator is an
encouraging development, and staff looks
forward to its formal launch in early 2012.
25.
Staff noted that the authorities are
considering strengthening the central
bank law to address important legal issues
arising in the context of the single
regulatory regime. They are also addressing
issues related to Islamic banking to adapt to
the new regulatory regime. Such refinements
to address the Shariah dimensions of Islamic
banking would help place the Islamic
banking industry in Qatar on a firmer
statutory footing.

26.
There is further scope to
strengthen the supervision of real estate
sector loans and improve the transparency
of the real estate market. Although
prudential regulation for lending to real
estate exists, given the existing excess
capacity in real estate, staff is of the view that
banks might be building up excessive risks in
this sector, particularly in private real estate,
which may materialize if the global economic
and financial conditions worsen. The absence
of comprehensive and timely data on the real
estate market precludes banks from
exercising proper risk assessment, and the
central bank from conducting risk-based
supervision. The QCB informed staff that it
collects data at the municipality level, and is
in the process of constructing a real estate
price index, which would be ready for
dissemination after three years. Staff
suggested that collating and disseminating
comprehensive price and volume data on
Qatar’s real estate market segments would
help banks assess risks better and also
enable the QCB to take informed preemptive
regulatory measures to preserve financial
stability. Additionally, staff encouraged the
Qatari authorities to develop a corporate
governance code for real estate developers
that would contribute to the prevention
of excessive risk-taking in the sector.

16

The single financial regulator system would bring
together the regulatory functions of the QCB, Qatar
Financial Centre Regulatory Authority, Qatar

C. BUILDING INSTITUTIONS AND ENHANCING TRANSPARENCY AND
GOVERNANCE
27.
Staff urged the acceleration of
steps to establish a macro-fiscal unit that
could develop a medium-term
expenditure framework to ensure the
efficiency of public spending. The mission
noted the steady progress being made in
restructuring and modernizing operations in
the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
Important initiatives include the drafting of
new financial and procurement laws (the
latter to enable decentralized procurement
and centralized monitoring); and developing
an e-based tax system (currently at the
tendering stage). The Ministry has initiated a
move toward the preparation of a three-year
budgeting framework. A solid medium-term
expenditure framework would represent a
critical building block for the eventual
adoption of a fiscal rule to help manage the
path of fiscal spending. In this context,
accelerated steps should be taken to make
the macro-fiscal unit operational to provide
the foundation for the medium-term
budgeting framework. The authorities are
interested in receiving technical assistance
(TA) from the Fund on setting up the macrofiscal unit.

28.
Staff reiterated its
recommendation to consolidate debt
management and development functions
in a debt office. Currently, the debt office
functions as a secretariat to the Ministerial
State Finance Policy Committee. The
maximum limit for borrowing is determined
through an Emiri decree and the Committee
decides on the timing, amount, maturity, and
instrument type for each internal and
external debt.
29.
Staff also encouraged the
authorities to sustain efforts to strengthen
public financial management. In view of
the large FIFA 2022 infrastructure-related
expenditure, staff underscored the
importance of adopting a Public Investment
Management System to provide a coherent
and rigorous set of procedures for project
selection, appraisal, and programming that
would enhance efficiency, accountability and
governance. The authorities are reevaluating
some of the major infrastructure projects
(such as the metro) with a view to
reassessing their size, structure, and
financing and completion time, which in
staff’s view is a step in the right direction.

Corporate governance practices
need to be strengthened to help maintain
financial stability. The guidelines issued by
the QCB in 2008 provide the framework for
improving corporate governance in banks.
Staff is of the view that the financial system
would be strengthened by moving towards
international good practices in some areas
such as appointment of independent
directors in bank boards. In light of the high
credit concentration of Qatari banks, the
mission encourages the authorities to have
an in-depth diagnostic of bank governance
that would highlight potential areas of
improvement. This would be particularly
useful since the QCB is rewriting the central
bank Law—which addresses among others
corporate governance issues—to make it
more consistent with the single regulatory
regime.

Box 3. Strengthening the Corporate Governance Code for Banks in Qatar
The global financial crisis has placed corporate
governance (CG) firmly on the policy agenda.
More than forty countries have issued new
guidelines or amended corporate governance
codes since the crisis.1 The Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision issued its Principles for
Enhancing Corporate Governance in October
2010 identifying key areas of focus: board
practices, senior management, risk
management and internal controls,
compensation, complex or opaque corporate
structures, and disclosure and transparency.
The GCC countries have also issued corporate
governance codes for banks: Bahrain issued a
CG code in 2010, Kuwait issued its code for
financial institutions in 2004, Oman in 2002,
Qatar in 2008, Saudi Arabia has issued various
guidelines over the years, and the UAE made its
2007 guidelines mandatory from 2010.

Despite considerable progress, there are still
some gaps in implementation of the CG codes,
including in transparency and disclosure,
exemptions for related-party lending, and the
structure of the board in the GCC countries.2
The guidelines issued by the QCB in 2008
provide the framework for improving corporate
governance in Qatari banks, but some of the
codes prescribed by the central bank are
superseded by other laws, such as the
Commercial Companies Law. The financial
system would be strengthened by moving
towards international good practices notably by
implementing the necessary changes to the
Commercial Companies Law to facilitate the
appointment of independent directors to bank
boards, and encouraging the continued
strengthening of banks’ risk management
practices especially in the area of real estate
lending.

D. ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND STRUCTURAL ISSUES
31.
Reducing Qatar’s vulnerability to
hydrocarbon price fluctuations will
require, in addition to fiscal management,
diversification into other sectors of the
economy and reinforcing competitiveness.
This will necessitate raising productivity
through greater use of the latest
technologies, increasing the efficiency of
investments, fostering more openness to
foreign competition, and enhancing the
quality of labor. These aspects have been
articulated in the government’s National
Development Strategy (NDS) for 2011–16.
Improving the efficiency of fiscal spending
could help improve productivity during the
transition.
32.
Opportunities for efficiency gains
and reducing distortions in petrol, energy,
and water use exist by reducing, among
others, direct and indirect subsidies.
According to Qatar’s NDS, a drive for
efficiency is central to creating and capturing
value, preserving and expanding a productive
base, and encouraging the private sector to
develop through economic diversification.
Increasing petrol pump prices by 25 percent
in January 2011 to QR1 per liter is a step in
the right direction. Free electricity and water
for nationals and subsidized tariffs for
expatriates tend to increase inefficiency in
the use of these resources. Fiscal expenditure
to compensate for the losses of the water
and electricity utility company is budgeted at
QR1.8 billion in 2011/12 (0.3 percent of GDP),
and is expected to grow in line with
population growth and industrial
development. Qatar has been rapidly
developing its petrochemical industry based

on local feedstock produced at low cost.
Natural gas feedstock prices charged for
Qatari petrochemical companies have been
on the rise, but continue to be lower than
spot and contracted Qatari export prices. The
authorities reiterated that currently there are
no plans to review any of the subsidies.
33.
Staff and the authorities agreed
that it is opportune to consider options
for deeper pension reforms. The recent
salary hike of 60 to 120 percent for civilian
Qatari public sector employees and military
personnel was also extended to pensioners.
The authorities confirmed that transfers to
the pension fund to meet the increased cash
outflows and the actuarial deficit would be
predominantly in the form of assets. Staff
suggested that reforms to rebasing of
pension payments over the average of the
last few years of service instead of the last
month’s salary, increasing the retirement age,
raising the early retirement age, and changes
to the investment policy to improve the riskreturn profile, need to be implemented in
conjunction with the cash and assets
transfers to the pension fund with a view to
strengthening it.

E. STATISTICAL AND OTHER ISSUES
34.
Timely compilation and
dissemination of key statistics remain
essential for adequate economic
management. Significant progress has been
achieved in the collation and dissemination
of national accounts and inflation data, and
sovereign external debt statistics. Since the
September 2010 TA mission on balance of
payments statistics, the authorities have
made progress in implementing the mission’s
recommendations, including compiling
balance of payments data in the international
format needed for publication in the
International Financial Statistic (IFS). Staff
encouraged the authorities to pursue their
efforts in strengthening economic statistics,
including working towards the compilation of
an International Investment Position (IIP)
statement.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35.
The mission commends the
authorities on their ongoing efforts in
strengthening Qatar’s Anti Money
Laundering (AML)/Combating Financing
of Terrorism (CFT) framework. The
domestic financial supervisory authorities’
legislation (Rules/Regulations) has been
developed by adopting a coordinated
approach, which has resulted in the
legislation being consistent across each
supervisory body. Following the adoption of
the new reviewed AML/CFT rules/regulations,
financial supervisory authorities have
increased their offsite and onsite reviews of
AML/CFT compliance at financial institutions
that are subject to their supervision. Progress
has also been achieved with regard to
implementing the United Nations Security
Council Resolutions in the areas of
strengthening mechanisms for
implementation and training of supervisors.

QATAR 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Qatar is using its fiscal space,
generated from an increase in
hydrocarbon production and prices, to
implement a large public spending
program. Large infrastructure investments
are expected to sustain strong growth of 9 to
10 percent in the nonhydrocarbon sector in
the medium term.
37.
Headline inflation is projected to
remain subdued, but inflation risks have
risen due to domestic factors. The potential
inflationary effect of the recent fiscal
package is estimated to be around
1 percentage point. This underscores the
need for fiscal policy to monitor aggregate
demand and for the QCB to manage
liquidity.
38.
The expansionary fiscal stance in
2011/12 thus warrants careful monitoring
of aggregate demand to ward off risks of
inflation. Fiscal policy must continue to
maintain a careful balance between spending
on infrastructure to sustain non-inflationary
growth, and saving and investing
hydrocarbon surpluses abroad to generate
sufficient income to finance future budgets.
39.
In the context of the peg, the QCB
would need to manage liquidity more
actively. The QCB would need to develop a
formal liquidity management framework to
facilitate a more proactive strategy in finetuning liquidity. In addition, coordination of
debt management with the Ministry of
Economy and Finance would be helpful in
maintaining a stable and adequate stock of
government securities for the further

development of an interbank repo market,
and also providing a robust benchmark yield
curve for the corporate bond market.
40.
Developing a more formal and
transparent macroprudential policy
framework to enable a swift response
when needed, would help achieve orderly
credit growth without generating
overheating. The main challenges for
monetary policy will be to support credit
growth without fuelling inflationary pressures
or short-term capital inflows. Against the
backdrop of increasing credit growth, banks
and the QCB need to be cautious that overall
credit quality does not weaken, particularly in
the real estate sector in view of the prevailing
excess supply. Collating and disseminating
price and volume data on Qatar’s real estate
market segments would help banks assess
risks better and also enable the central bank
to take informed preemptive measures to
preserve financial stability.
41.
The banking system has the ability
to withstand credit and market risks.
Nevertheless, staff underscores the need to
monitor individual banks for stress, given the
interlinkages in the financial system. Further,
individual banks’ foreign currency liquidity
conditions need to be monitored and the
QCB should stand ready to relieve potential
pressures. Enabling a more robust risk
assessment culture, conducting regular stress
testing of banks, and putting in place an
early warning system would help mitigate
risks to the banking system and maintain
financial stability.

42.
In the medium term, fiscal policy
will need to balance sometimes
competing objectives of economic
stabilization, development and generating
intergenerational savings. Fiscal space has
contracted somewhat compared to last year,
because of the permanent increase in current
expenditure, according to staff’s mediumterm fiscal sustainability exercise. Given the
authorities’ objective of fully financing the
budget from 2020 onwards from its
nonhydrocarbon revenues, and for building
buffers for shocks, the authorities will need
to increase savings over the medium term.
While the eventual implementation of VAT
will increase fiscal revenues, on the
expenditure side, given the plans for the
implementation of large capital projects,
adjustment in current expenditures would be
the most feasible way to reduce the
dependency of the budget on hydrocarbon
revenues.
43.
Establishing a macro-fiscal unit
would support fiscal policy making and
the development of a medium-term
budget framework to ensure the
efficiency of public spending. A solid
medium-term expenditure framework would
represent a critical building block for the
eventual adoption of a fiscal rule to help
manage the path of fiscal spending.

Reducing Qatar’s vulnerability to
hydrocarbon price fluctuations will
require, in addition to fiscal management,
diversification into other sectors of the
economy and reinforcing competitiveness.
Opportunities for efficiency gains and
reducing distortions in petrol, energy, and
water use exist by reducing, among others,
direct and indirect subsidies. It is also
opportune to consider options for deeper
pension reforms.
45.
Further improvements in statistics
will be essential, which will also require
greater coordination across agencies.
46.
It is recommended that the next
Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX 1. INFLATION IN QATAR: A VAR ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF THE RECENT FISCAL
PACKAGE1
Effective from September 1 2011, salaries
and1 wages of Qatari civilian and military
state employees have been permanently
increased by sizeable amounts. We use
historical data to estimate a simple VAR
model for inflation in Qatar, and find that
these increases in current expenditure have
the potential to increase inflation in 2012 by
one percentage point.
1.
The recent deflationary period in
Qatar (average deflation of around
4.9 percent in 2009 and 2.5 percent
in 2010) driven mainly by the roll out of
infrastructure and increased supply of
real estate inflation has been overturned
by increased inflationary pressures.
Inflation is expected to average around
2 percent in 2011 reflecting increases in
domestic prices of petrol and steel, and
the impact of global food prices. The
month-on-month core inflation (excluding
food and rents) was 5.2 percent in
September 2011. Potential inflationary
pressures might arise in 2012 onwards from
the recently announced sizeable increases in
current public expenditure in Qatar.2

The government recently announced a 60 percent
increase in the basic salary and social allowance for
state civilian employees, a 120 percent rise for
military personnel of officer ranks and a 50 percent
increase for military personnel of other ranks. In
addition, the pension of civilian retirees will
increase by 60 percent, while the pension of retired
military officers will rise by 120 percent and of
other ranks by 50 percent.

VAR model
2.
We estimate a simple VAR model
and use the model’s estimate of the
elasticity of CPI inflation with respect to
changes in current expenditure to infer
the effect of the recent increases in
current public expenditure on
inflationary prospects in Qatar. We focus
our analysis on the inflationary effect of the
fiscal package for 2012.3
3.
The model includes non-oil real
GDP and domestic credit growth, which
are both endogenously determined with
inflation. We include one-period lags of
current and capital expenditure as well as
current international food prices, imports
prices and the nominal effective exchange
rate as exogenous variables. The exogeneity
assumption of the fiscal variables is based
on the fact that budgets, which are voted
much ahead of their implementation, are
heavily reliant on fuel exports revenues and
3

50

Since the planned increases have not been
disbursed yet and with only three months
remaining in 2011, we are not looking at the
inflationary effect of such measures in 2011.

QATAR 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

are thus less likely to be influenced by other
factors. Nevertheless, periods of high prices
and inflation can trigger a fiscal response of
higher nominal wages and higher current
expenditure, thus undermining our
exogeneity assumption. Including the fiscal
variables in lagged values helps alleviate
such endogeneity concerns.

5.
Our main result is reported in
column (1) of Table 1. The coefficient on
current expenditure in the CPI inflation
equation is highly significant and equal to
0.1. This suggests that a 1 percent increase
in current expenditure is associated with a
0.1 percentage point increase in inflation in
Qatar.6

4.
In interpreting our VAR OLS
coefficients below, we note that the
inflation response to higher fiscal
spending can be overestimated due to
the above-mentioned reverse causality.
We can therefore think of our estimate as
the upper bound or maximum value of the
inflation response to current public
expenditure increases. All the variables in
the model are expressed in growth rates so
that the estimated coefficients are
interpreted as elasticities.4 The model was
estimated on annual 1990–2008 data5, using
one year lags.

6.
In computing the percent increase
in current expenditure, we assume an
increase of QR 10 billion in salaries of
public sector employees. With an
estimated 8 percent increase in current
expenditure in 2012 on account of the
recent measures, we thus expect the
inflationary impact of the salary increase in
2012 to be 1 percentage point.7,8

6

Our results are robust to estimating the model
after decomposing current expenditures to wages
and salaries and its other components, then
computing the elasticity of inflation to increases in
wages and salaries.
7

This does not take into account the transfers from
government to the pension fund, as it is unclear in
what form and when the transfer will take place.
8

4

These growth rates were showed to be stationary.

5

We refrain from including 2009 and 2010 since the
extent of deflation might be overestimated for
those years, as the measurement of rents (which
account for approximately 30 percent of the
consumption basket) is skewed towards new
contracts. Since new contracts have witnessed
sharp falls in rents at the beginning of the year, the
fall in average rents is likely to be less pronounced.

Additional channels that are not included in our
analysis can lower or strengthen this estimate. First,
our analysis assumes that the additional cash will
be spent on goods and services domestically.
Potential leakages however can occur and entail
lower inflationary pressures. Examples include
Qataris spending the additional money on travel or
using it to pay off existing debt. Second, we do not
tackle potential spillover effects on the wages of
Qataris working in the private sector, and less likely
on wages of expatriates. Inflationary pressures are
expected to be higher if such wage spillovers
materialize.

APPENDIX 2. MONETARY MANAGEMENT IN QATAR–EXPERIENCE WITH CAPITAL INFLOWS1
Limits on remunerated deposits of commercial1
banks with the central bank, and reduction in
policy interest rates, coinciding with the issuance of
longer-term government bonds, have been
successful in driving out short-term speculative
flows. The QCB needs to monitor the risk of rising
inflation and be ready to use liquidity tools and
macroprudential measures to manage the tradeoffs between inflation and capital inflows.
1.
The independence of monetary policy
in Qatar is limited by the peg to the US dollar.
The interest rate framework of the QCB
encompasses two policy rates, viz., QCB Deposit
Rate (QCBDR), and QCB Lending Rate (QCBLR).
These rates are announced by the QCB on
overnight deposit and loan transactions,
respectively, between the QCB and local banks
through the Qatar Money Market Rate (QMR)
Standing Facility. The QCB also prescribes a
reserve requirement (currently at 4.75 percent of
total deposits). Another instrument available to
the QCB is the issuance of CDs, which has been
temporarily discontinued since 2011, and
replaced by issuance of T-bills.
2.
Since 2008, the QCB has not fully
aligned its policy rate with US interest rates,
leaving scope for capital inflows. Although
monetary policy independence is constrained by
the peg, the authorities had maintained higher
interest rates compared to US interest rates—
predicated on the objectives of containing
inflation and preventing the expansion of bad
loans—since September 2008. The QCB’s net
foreign exchange reserves increased by
$8.6 billion to $18.4 billion in 2009; QMR deposits
1

Prepared by A. Prasad

with the central bank, remunerated at
2.0 percent, had increased from $1.8 billion to
$7.3 billion (Figures 1 and 2).2
3.
The reduction in policy rates in August
2010 was however not sufficient to arrest
capital inflows. In August 2010, the QCB
reduced its policy deposit rate—by 50 basis
points to 1.5 percent—the first time since April
2008. Between January and July of 2010, QMR
deposits had increased to $11 billion, and the
QCB’s foreign exchange reserves to $23 billion.
The QCB attributed the interest rate change to
prevailing high real interest rates, reflecting
persistent price deflation, alignment with the
interest rates in major advanced economies and
GCC countries, and Qatar’s improved sovereign
risk premium. The move was aimed at dissuading
banks from placing deposits with the central
bank and encouraging instead bank lending.3
Given the pegged exchange rate regime, the QCB
would have to rely increasingly on
macroprudential instruments to manage the

2

IMF staff had at that time (Article IV Consultation
2009) cautioned that as investors reevaluate global
risks, Qatar could attract speculative inflows. The QCB
had indicated that it was monitoring inflows carefully
and was ready to adjust interest rates if needed, while
managing credit growth with its macroprudential
instruments. Staff had also indicated that there is
scope for improving liquidity management through
liquidity forecasting and fine-tuning of the operations
of the QMR facility.
3

Staff (Article IV 2010) supported the reduction in the
rate, given the room to reduce interest rate
differentials compared to U.S. and other GCC
countries’ interest rates, the benign headline inflation,
and the relatively low credit growth in the economy.
Staff had noted that the QCB had further scope to
reduce policy rates in view of the existing high
spreads compared with interest rates in the U.S.

QATAR

credit cycle and to counter potential surges in
capital inflows.
4.
Despite the reduction in interest rates,
there were net capital inflows into the
banking system, seeking to take advantage of
interest rate arbitrage. Banks continued to
convert US dollars into Qatari Riyals and place
them in the QMR facility. Thus, between April
2008, and December 2010, the QCB’s net foreign
exchange reserves had doubled to $31 billion.
5.
The ceiling on remunerated deposits
of commercial banks with the central bank
resulted in a huge drawdown on QMR
deposits and a reduction in the net foreign
exchange of the central bank. In January 2011,
the central bank decided to set a new mechanism
for banks for deploying funds under the QMR
deposit facility and in CDs. According to this,
QMR deposits and CDs are not allowed to
exceed 100 percent of required reserves. Any
maintenance of funds beyond 100 percent of
required reserves would not be paid any interest
by the QCB. At the same time, the QCB sold
$13.7 billion (three-year maturity, with 5 percent
coupon) government bonds to local banks.
Combined, these measures resulted in the
withdrawal of some arbitrage funds. Between
December 2010 and March 2011, the QCB’s net
foreign assets had declined by $9 billion to
$22 billion, and the deposits in the QMR facility
dipped sharply from $19 billion to $5.5 billion,
part of which is likely to have been invested in
government bonds. In April 2011, the central
bank reduced its QMR deposit rate to
1.0 percent, and in August 2011 by a further
25 basis points to 0.75 percent. The central bank’s
foreign reserves stood at about $16 billion at
end-October 2011.

6.
The recent measures of the central
bank have been successful in driving out
speculative short-term inflows;
nevertheless, the reduction in policy rate
has come at a time when the government
announced large salary hikes for public
sector employees and pensioners, which
has the potential to increase inflation. The
central bank, therefore, needs to closely
monitor inflation, and be ready to absorb
liquidity through reserve requirements,
issuance of T-bills, and open market
operations. The central bank has already taken
measures to ban personal credit for
investment in equity, and imposed

APPENDIX 3. EXCHANGE RATE ASSESSMENT1
Estimates from an application of CGER-type1
methodologies broadly indicate that the
Qatari Riyal was undervalued during 2010 by
15 percent, with a need to decrease current
account surpluses over the medium term.

1.
Following terms of trade gains,
the real exchange rate had appreciated
32 percent between the beginning of
2003 and end 2008, but two-thirds of
this was eroded by a depreciation trend,
which ensued since end 2008. The tradeweighted real effective exchange rate
(REER) index depreciated 19.1 percent
between end 2008 and July 2011 (Figure 1).
The nominal effective exchange rate
diverged from the 2003–08 appreciation
trend, owing to higher inflation relative to
trading partners, but since end 2008 has
followed the REER as deflation set in.

The equilibrium real exchange
rate approach indicates undervaluation.
This approach directly estimates the
equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) as a
function of its underlying price-based
fundamentals such as the terms of trade
and relative productivity differentials
between tradable and nontradable sectors.
For the purpose of forming the exchange
rate assessment, the adjustment to bring
the exchange rate to the level consistent
with these medium-term fundamentals is
calculated as the difference between the
estimated ERER and its current value.
Absent data on the relative productivity
differentials between tradable and
nontradable sectors, the real effective
exchange rate (REER) is estimated from
monthly oil prices employing data going
back to 1980. This high frequency
estimation is based on a panel of 25 oil
exporters employing monthly data
between 1980Q1 to 2011Q3, with
individual country regressions to account
for country-specific heterogeneity. The
premise of the estimation is that for

QATAR 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

countries where primary commodities
dominate exports, fluctuations in world
commodity prices should explain most of
the movements in their terms of trade
yielding a “commodity currency” (Chen and
Rogoff, 2002, and Cashin, Cespedes, and
Sahay, 2002). Following this approach
(Cashin and Poghosyan, forthcoming), a
cointegration relationship between the
logarithm of the REER and the logarithm
of the real oil prices is found. A novel and
robust band pass filter methodology
(IBPF) for unit root testing indicates a
statistically significant long-run
cointegrating relationship between Qatar’s
REER and the real oil price, with an
elasticity coefficient of 11 percent. It
suggests that the Qatari Riyal is currently
undervalued by 15 percent given trends in
oil (and gas) prices (Figure 2).

3.
The macroeconomic balance
approach indicates overvaluation. This
approach calculates the difference
between the current account balance
projected over the medium term at
prevailing exchange rates and an
estimated current account norm. The
exchange rate adjustment that would
eliminate this difference over the medium
term is then obtained using countryspecific estimated responses of the trade
balance to the real exchange rate. Past

estimations have tended to employ
pooled OLS or fixed effects estimations,
which assume strict exogeneity of
explanatory variables and entail that the
error terms are uncorrelated with all past
and future values of the regressors. This is
a rather strong assumption and unlikely to
hold. Along with similar recent studies,
Beidas-Strom and Cashin (2011) address
these shortcomings by employing
generalized method of moments’ (GMM)
estimation, which controls for potential
endogeneity of the regressors in a
dynamic panel setting by applying the
GMM-IV system estimator of Blundell and
Bond (1998). GMM-IV uses additional
moment conditions to explain equilibrium
movements in the dependent variable.
They also address the shortcomings raised
in Bems et al (2009) and Arezeki and
Hasanov (2009) by introducing
specifications for the macroeconomic
balance (Table 1), which include
hydrocarbon reserves and financial assets
held outside the central bank. In Qatar’s
case, similar to several commodityexporters, only a modest amount of NFA
is held at the central bank, and hence the
choice of the preferred specification. This
yields an average current account norm
surplus of 22.7 percent of GDP in 2016.
Contrasting the norm to the projected
“underlying” current account position in
2016 (11.4 percent of GDP) suggests a
20 percent overvaluation of the REER; with
the implication being that Qatar should
accumulate larger current account
surpluses given its fundamentals.
4.
The external sustainability
approach indicates an undervaluation.
The underpinning of this approach is that
the sustainability of the current account
trajectory requires that the net present
value (NPV) of all future oil and financial or
investment income (wealth) be equal to the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 41

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

QATAR

NPV of imports of goods and services net
of non-oil exports. Subject to this
constraint, the economy would choose a
path for imports, and hence a current
account norm, that would support
intergenerational equity given volatile oil
prices and exhaustible oil reserves—
through an appropriate pace of
accumulation of net foreign assets.
Estimating Qatar’s wealth at $3.0 trillion2
import trajectories (“annuities/income or
allocation rules)” are calculated under three
different policy scenarios: (a) a constant
share of GDP annuity (red line); (b) constant
real per capita annuity (green line); and (c)
constant real annuity (black line) (Figure 3).
All three types of annuities are used in the
literature, and can be derived from the
optimization of plausible utility functions.
Choosing the constant real per capita
annuity rule as a benchmark indicates a
small undervaluation of 3 percent, as the
implied norm (9 percent of GDP in 2016) is
smaller than the projected current account
(11 percent of GDP in 2016), with the
implication being that Qatar could save
less. Naturally, changing the oil production
and price path, population growth, or initial
NFA, could have a significant impact of the
implied current accounts of each allocation
rule, as they are sensitive to parameter
assumptions.

2

Assuming for illustrative purposes 864 billion
barrels of reserves and a 4 percent recovery rate,
oil and gas production would grow gradually (by
2 percent). Oil prices and the GDP deflator
increase by about 2 percent after 2016, and real
non-oil GDP grows by 5 percent. Future oil
revenues are nominally discounted at 6 percent,
the assumed rate of return on externally held
financial wealth/NFA.

APPENDIX 4. SEGREGATION OF ISLAMIC AND CONVENTIONAL BANKING IN QATAR1
In February 2011, the QCB directed its
conventional banks that have Islamic
windows, to stop opening new Islamic
branches, accepting Islamic deposits, and
extending new Islamic financing. The QCB
has given until end-December 2011 for
conventional1 banks to wind up their Islamic
finance activities. As the directive is
implemented, the following issues merit
consideration by the QCB: (i) the costs of
winding up; (ii) impact on banking sector
competition, availability of Islamic products,
and the banking sector’s capacity to provide
syndicated loans; (iii) development of Islamic
liquidity management instruments; (iv)
issues related to duration mismatch and
funding gaps; and (v) harmonization of
regulation and supervision in the GCC
monetary union in the future.
Islamic financing in Qatar’s banking
system
1.
Islamic banking has been a fastgrowing segment of the Qatari banking
sector in recent years, and Islamic assets
accounted for 31 percent of total banking
sector assets at end-2010. Islamic banking
activity has been carried out both in
standalone Islamic banks and in Islamic
windows of conventional banks until
recently. Total assets of Islamic windows in
the conventional banks engaged in this
activity reached 12 percent of the total
balance sheet of conventional banks at
end-2010, accounting for a similar share of
profits (Table 1). Assets of standalone
Islamic banks constituted 21 percent of

total assets in the Qatari banking sector.
Among conventional banks, Qatar National
Bank’s Islamic window overwhelmingly
dominated the segment with QR30.2 billion
in total assets at end-2010, followed by
Commercial Bank of Qatar and Doha Bank.
Among standalone Islamic banks, Qatar
Islamic Bank had total assets of
QR51.8 billion, followed by Masraf AlRayan (QR34.7 billion) and Qatar
International Islamic Bank (QR18.2 billion).
Rationale for the new regulation
2.
The QCB recently directed
conventional banks to close their Islamic
operations. The regulation directs
conventional banks to stop opening new
Islamic branches, accepting Islamic
deposits, and dispensing new Islamic
finance operations. The directive gives
conventional banks until December 31,
2011 to collect balances in Islamic assets in
accordance with the conditions and
maturity dates agreed with customers, and
to pay Islamic deposits upon maturity, with
the exception of finance operations. After
this deadline, conventional banks will have
to continue to manage their remaining
Islamic assets in a special portfolio with the
possibility of transferring some of these
assets to Islamic banks.

3.
The QCB’s decision was
motivated by supervisory and monetary
policy considerations. In the QCB’s view,
the overlapping nature of non-Islamic and
Islamic activities makes banks’ risk
management and compliance with
prudential requirements more complex.
The existence of Islamic windows
complicates the preparation of financial
reports governed by different international
standards. It also makes the comparative
analysis of financial reports more difficult at
the domestic and international level. The
QCB also argues that conventional banks
cannot effectively separate capital for
Islamic windows and conventional
activities, an issue that is especially
problematic for branches of international
banks in Qatar with an Islamic window.
Furthermore, the QCB believes that it is
difficult to combine Basel and IFSB
standards for capital adequacy. The
segregation of Islamic and conventional
activities is also aimed at improving the
effectiveness of monetary policy, as it will
enable the QCB to introduce different
liquidity management instruments for the
two types of activities.
4.
Leveling the playing field
between Islamic and conventional banks
was a further rationale behind the
decision. The QCB would like to see the
2

orderly growth of Islamic banks in Qatar.
Since conventional banks were typically
able to raise funds at lower rates, they were
able to capture a large share of Islamic
banks’ business segment. Access to low2

The Governor informed staff that conventional
banks would not be allowed to have Islamic
subsidiaries, and they would not be allowed to

cost funding was an advantage, especially
in the case of international banks, which
were able to leverage their funds from the
global markets to take positions in Islamic
assets. The complete segregation of the
two banking segments should also reduce
the risk of contagion from one segment to
the other in the case of banking troubles in
any segment.
Early impact of the segregation directive
on the banking sector
5.
Conventional banks stopped
initiating new Islamic business, but—
with one exception—have not divested
of their Islamic windows. Following the
issuance of the directive, conventional
banks have ceased undertaking new
financing activities and taking Shariahcompliant funding. Up to end-October,
only one conventional bank divested of its
Islamic unit: the International Bank of Qatar
has sold off its Islamic retail portfolio to
Barwa Bank, a local Shariah-compliant
bank. Other conventional banks are still
considering options for their Islamic
windows, and there are indications that
some banks will convert the infrastructure
of their Islamic branches for conventional
banking purposes.
6.
Q2 2011 statements show the
gradual adjustment of conventional
banks’ balance sheets, though a complete
picture of the change in Islamic banking
activities of conventional banks is not
available, as some banks, notably Qatar
National Bank, the largest bank, do not
report Islamic and conventional banking
activities separately. At four other

2011, as contracts matured.3
7.
Conventional lending and Islamic
financing activities by the Qatari
banking sector continued to grow
vigorously in the first half of 2011,
although with a wide variation among
banks. On the aggregate, end-June data
do not indicate a switch from conventional
banks to Islamic banks by customers. The
growth rate of total loans including Islamic
financing of the five conventional banks
was 12.7 percent in this period, while total
financing activities by the three Islamic
banks declined by 0.6 percent due to a
contraction of Islamic financing in one of
the larger Islamic banks. Total assets of
Islamic banks grew faster in the first half of
the year but this is due to a large increase
of their financial investments in Islamic
debt instruments, primarily sukuk issued by
the QCB. Healthy growth in operating
income in both Islamic and conventional
banks in the first half of 2011 is also an
indication that the segregation directive
did not have a major impact on the
banking sector yet. Q2 net operating
income was 23 percent higher in 2011 than
in 2010 for conventional banks and by
18 percent higher for Islamic banks.

benefit from the directive at the expense
of conventional banks. The weighted
stock price of Islamic banks registered an
increase at the announcement of the new
regulation in February, in contrast to stock
prices of conventional banks which
declined sharply (Figure 1). Although
conventional banks’ stock prices and the
overall index recovered subsequently,
Islamic banks significantly outperformed
conventional banks and the overall Qatar
Exchange index between January and
August 2011. Investors’ reaction indicates
that the segregation directive is expected
to provide further opportunities for Islamic
banks to grow in a highly competitive
banking environment.

International experience
suggests that the treatment of Islamic
banking activities is not uniform across
countries. Some countries, such as Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain, Malaysia, the United Arab
Emirates, and the UK have allowed Islamic
windows, while e.g., Kuwait, Jordan, Syria,
Yemen, and Turkey only allow standalone
Islamic institutions. There are certain
advantages to allowing Islamic windows in
conventional banks. Islamic banking
services and products often benefit from
the experience and systems of conventional
banks, potentially improving the quality of

services and products and lowering their
cost. Windows also facilitate liquidity
management, especially in countries where
Islamic liquidity instruments are limited, as
windows usually have easy access to
liquidity support from the conventional
part of the bank. Islamic windows can
enhance competition in the market, which
could lower the cost of finance for Shariahcompliant products.
10.
Countries disallowing Islamic
windows in conventional banks usually
have several concerns. First, they are often
concerned about co-mingling of Islamic
and conventional assets and liabilities as it
increases reputational risk and raises issues
related to consumer protection. Second,
the windows could hinder the
establishment of effective corporate
governance and risk management systems.
The management and board of a
conventional bank may not be sufficiently
attuned to the unique risks inherent in
Islamic banking activities; thus their ability
to oversee the risk management of the
Islamic banking window may be
compromised. Third, the operation of
windows could open the door for
regulatory arbitrage or unfair practices.
Fourth, Islamic windows could hinder
effective financial oversight and the
preparation of proper financial statements.
Some prudential ratios that might differ for
Islamic banking could be difficult to
monitor appropriately. The issue of
resolution of Islamic windows is also often
unclear. Finally, monitoring the impact of
using Islamic monetary instruments could
be difficult in the case of Islamic windows,
which could hinder the design of
appropriate monetary policy.



Extend the timeline for unwinding
Islamic operations if necessary, so as
not to place unduly high costs on
conventional banks with Islamic
windows.



Manage the impact on banking sector
competition in view of the decline in
the number of institutions providing
Islamic banking services from 12 to 4.
In order to reduce the risk of
oligopolistic behavior among the
remaining Islamic banks, the central
bank could permit the reorganizing of
Islamic windows as subsidiaries.



Monitor the impact of the segregation
on the availability of Islamic products
and the banking sector’s capacity to
provide syndicated loans to ensure
effective financial intermediation.



Manage the impact on liquidity
management, since the segregation
could affect liquidity and rates in the
interbank market and Islamic banks’
capacity to engage in effective liquidity
management.4



Iron out the issues related to duration
mismatch and funding gaps since
conventional banks are permitted to
retain assets until maturity but not
renew deposits upon maturity.5



Resolve potential issues of regulatory
harmonization in the GCC monetary
union, since other GCC countries
continue to allow conventional banks
to pursue Islamic banking activities.

4

The QCB indicated that they are in the process of
designing new Islamic liquidity management
instruments.
5

11.
Several issues merit future
consideration by the QCB when
implementing the directive, to ensure
that the desired objectives are met.

The QCB indicated that deposits behind Islamic
assets in the special portfolios can be renewed, but
the renewals cannot exceed the original maturity.
In this respect, it is encouraging that the QCB’s
plans include the provision of funds by the central
bank for conventional banks to fund their special
Islamic asset portfolio if needed.

APPENDIX 5. QATAR CENTRAL BANK REGULATION OF PERSONAL LOANS BACKED BY SALARY
ASSIGNMENT1
For macroprudential and consumer
protection purposes, in April 2011, the QCB
tightened its existing limits on personal loan
amounts per borrower, and introduced a
ceiling on interest rates on salary-assigned
and credit card loans, including for existing
loans. 1 Limits on the absolute amounts of
loans will help reduce household debt and
moderate banks’ balance sheet risks. The
regulation, however, could distort product
pricing, act counterproductively to building
up of risk management capacity in banks,
hinder efforts to develop the domestic debt
market, increase moral hazard of borrowers,
and affect the revenues of banks.
1.
The QCB has historically
regulated bank lending for personal
loans. As in other GCC countries, the
dominant retail product in Qatar is
personal loans, in which the customer’s
salary is assigned to the bank (Table 1). The
QCB first issued regulation on personal
loans in 2007, and subsequently tightened
it in March 2008 when the maximum debt
service coverage ratio (monthly repayment
as a percentage of the borrower’s monthly
salary) was reduced to 50 percent from 70
percent. At that time, the limit on credit
extended to a Qatari national was
maintained at QR2.5 million ($686,000) and
the maximum tenor was kept at seven
years.
2.
The regulation limits the
maximum amount of personal lending
by banks and imposes a ceiling on
interest rates on personal loans assigned

against salary. The new limits are QR2
million for nationals and 400,000 QR for
expatriates. The maximum interest rate that
banks can charge on salary-assigned loans
is the QCB policy lending rate plus
1.5 percent, which worked out to 6.5
percent in April 2011. The new interest rate
also applies to existing salary-backed loans
contracted prior to the issuance of the new
directive. Interest rates on credit card loans
were also capped at 1 percent monthly. A
February 2010 QCB directive set a ceiling
on commission and fees on personal
accounts and services which will help
prevent circumvention of the interest rate
ceiling.
3.
The interest rate ceiling seeks to
correct the unresponsiveness of interest
rates to the gradual decline in the cost
of funding in recent years. The QCB
policy deposit rate has been reduced in
several steps from 5.15 percent to
0.75 percent between September 2007 and
August 2011, and commercial banks’
deposit rates have also been on a declining
trend, with an acceleration in the decline
since early 2010 (Figure 1). At the same
time, the level of personal loan rates has
hardly moved in the last three years, with
credit card rates fluctuating between 18
and 20 percent, and average car loan rates
staying close to 8 percent. Thus, the spread
between lending rates and the cost of
funds has widened considerably. After a
period of rapid build-up between 2005 and
mid-2008, the total amount of personal
loans in the Qatari banking system
stabilized in the QR55–60 billion range
($16 billion). Thus, the tightening of

Bank rates started to adjust to
the new limits, whereas the volume of
personal loans continues to grow
strongly. In fact, some banks already
lowered their retail loan rates months
before the new regulation was announced
in order to increase their market share. The
fall has been especially pronounced for
credit card rates, which were capped at
1 percent per month. The volume of
personal loans dipped in May but
consequently picked up strongly again.
Nevertheless, the share of personal loans in
the total loan book and as a percentage of
private sector loans stabilized since Q3

5.
The impact of the interest rate
ceiling on banks’ income is likely to be
limited as the decline in the net interest
margin will be offset by the strong
growth in credit to the public and
corporate sectors. Since personal loans
still account for approximately 18 percent
of total banking sector lending, lower
interest revenue from personal loans will be
a significant upfront hit to banks’
profitability, especially as existing contracts
will have to be repriced as well. The effect
on the pricing of other products is not
straightforward. Banks may be tempted to
reflect the lost interest income in the
pricing of other products. On the other
hand, corporate customers may exert
pressure on banks to lower corporate
lending rates as they compare spreads to
retail spreads. The likely decline in the net
interest margin notwithstanding, relatively
strong credit growth (16 percent y-o-y in
July 2011 for private sector loans) is likely
to offset this effect.
6.
The interest rate ceiling would be
counterproductive to the QCB’s efforts
to strengthen risk management of banks
that is backed up by the improving
capabilities of the recently established
credit bureau. The ceiling on interest rate
implies that banks will not be able to apply
risk-based pricing on salary-assigned loans.
The limits on the absolute amounts of
personal loans by themselves would have
been adequate to bring down the levels of
interest rates on such loans. While high
interest rates, such as the prevailing levels
prior to the introduction of the interest rate
ceiling, might have resulted in adverse
selection—an argument that supports the
QCB decision—it would generally be
desirable to let banks distinguish between

into a Labor Market Strategy for Qatar. The
study was completed in June 2005 and could
serve as a model for the GCC countries with
similar labor issues. The project made a

III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of December 2011)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Economic data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but there is substantial scope
for improving their frequency, timeliness and coverage. The most affected areas are the real
gross domestic product (GDP), financial accounts of the balance of payment, and external debt
statistics.
National Accounts: Despite recent improvements, key aggregates are limited to quarterly
estimates of GDP at current prices. The accuracy of data in the nonhydrocarbon sector is
undermined by the lack of comprehensive source data. In July 2011, Qatar Statistical Authority
published the final annual series of nominal and real GDP data for 2004 and 2009.
Price statistics: There have been some improvements in the compilation of the consumer price
index (CPI). The authorities are now publishing monthly CPI data based on a reweighted and
rebased (2007=100) basket, but the index remains deficient. The information related to
domestic rentswhich form a sizeable share of the basketconstitutes only new rents, leading
to overestimation of the current deflation.
Government finance statistics: The authorities presented to the mission, Government budget
and outcomes data according to Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM) guidelines.
However, budget data should be rendered consistent with the data on public sector in the
monetary survey and the balance of payments. Data on financing items in the budget are not
up to date. Access to this information along with data on the budget outcome for previous
fiscal years would enhance the basis for analysis.
Monetary statistics: Monetary data for Qatar Central Bank (QCB) and commercial banks are
generally timely and of high quality. The QCB reports monetary data regularly to STA for
publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS) on a monthly basis with a lag of about three
weeks. Monthly and quarterly data are also published in the Quarterly Statistics Bulletin.
Financial Stability: Qatar Central Bank published and disseminated its second Financial
Stability Report in 2011, and plans to make it an ongoing process.
Balance of Payments: Since the September 2010 technical assistance mission on balance of
payments statistics, the authorities have made progress in implementing the mission’s
recommendations, including compiling balance of payments data in the international format
needed for publication in the International Financial Statistic (IFS). The financial account has
been developed and coverage improved for major public corporations, the Qatar Financial
Center, and the Qatar Exchange. In addition, improvements have been made to the report
forms used by banks to collect balance of payments transactions, primarily for the current

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 57

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

QATAR

account. Continuing efforts are needed to further develop data sources, particularly for the
private sector. To this end, close collaboration with the Qatar Statistics Authority in the
development of surveys is strongly encouraged. In addition, close monitoring of investment
income is needed, particularly for foreign investments in the hydrocarbon sector. Given the
improvements made in the last year, the Qatar’s balance of payments data for Q1 2011 are
ready to be published in the IFS, with the caveat that that there will be revisions to the data as
coverage is refined and improved. The authorities need to continue their efforts to develop
their external sector statistics by working towards the compilation of an International
Investment Position (IIP) statement.
External debt
Detailed data on the country’s medium- and long-term external debt are provided to missions
during the Article IV consultation discussions. In the recent period, Qatar has issued several
international bonds. The authorities are disseminating data on external debt of the government
through the central bank website. It is important to further improve the information flow on
external debt and its maturity profile. The MOEF is giving priority to the collation and
dissemination of complete data on external debt (including government, government
enterprises, and non-government corporates).
Data Standards and Quality
Qatar is a General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) participant since December 2005. The
GDDS mission of April 2007 updated the GDDS Summary Table II Data Coverage, Periodicity,
and Timeliness; assessed dissemination practices relative to the requirements of the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) for coverage, periodicity, and timeliness; and identified
major milestones that Qatar would have to reach to graduate from the GDDS to the SDDS. To
enhance data dissemination practices, staff assisted the authorities in developing a National
Summary Data Page (NSDP) and an Advance Release Calendar (ARC).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Qatar
On January 30, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV Consultation with Qatar on a lapse of time basis. Under the IMF’s lapse of time
procedures, the Executive Board completes Article IV Consultations without convening formal
discussions. 1
Background
Qatar has weathered the global crisis with high growth, and large external current account and
fiscal surpluses. Government intervention in the banking system has ensured financial stability,
and it is using its fiscal space to implement a large public spending program to maintain strong
growth in the nonhydrocarbon sector. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is projected
to accelerate to 19 percent in 2011, up from 17 percent in 2010. The nonhydrocarbon sector is
expected to grow by 9 percent, driven by manufacturing, financial services, and trade and
hotels. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation excluding rent increased to 5.8 percent in October
2011. Following an average deflation of around 2.5 percent in 2010, average CPI inflation is
expected to average around 2 percent in 2011 (end-year 2.5 percent)—with negative rental
inflation being more than offset by a general increase in all the other components of the inflation
basket.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

1

2
The banking sector remains profitable and strong with a capital adequacy ratio of 22.3 percent,
average return on assets of 2.7 percent, and non-performing loans ratio of 2.3 percent at endJune 2011.
The economic outlook for 2012 and beyond looks favorable, despite increased external risks.
The main downside risks are lower hydrocarbon prices and potential disruption in transportation
of liquefied natural gas (LNG) due to increased geopolitical tensions. Real GDP growth rate is
projected to moderate to 6 percent in 2012, with real hydrocarbon GDP slowing down to
3 percent, as LNG production remains constant due to the self-imposed moratorium on new
hydrocarbon projects. Large government investment for infrastructure would sustain growth in
the nonhydrocarbon sector between 9 and 10 percent beyond 2012. Average CPI inflation is
projected at 4 percent to 5 percent over the medium term, as rents stabilize due to a gradual
decline in excess capacity in real estate, and as the implementation of large investment projects
lead to some overheating pressures. The fiscal and external accounts are projected to remain in
surplus throughout the medium term, as oil prices are expected to remain high.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2011 Article IV consultation with Qatar, Executive Directors endorsed staff‘s
appraisal, as follows:
Qatar is using its fiscal space, generated from an increase in hydrocarbon production and
prices, to implement a large public spending program. Large infrastructure investments are
expected to sustain strong growth of 9 to 10 percent in the nonhydrocarbon sector in the
medium term.
Headline inflation is projected to remain subdued, but inflation risks have risen due to domestic
factors. The potential inflationary effect of the recent fiscal package is estimated to be around
1 percentage point. This underscores the need for fiscal policy to monitor aggregate demand
and for the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) to manage liquidity.
The expansionary fiscal stance in 2011/12 thus warrants careful monitoring of aggregate
demand to ward off risks of inflation. Fiscal policy must continue to maintain a careful balance
between spending on infrastructure to sustain non-inflationary growth, and saving and investing
hydrocarbon surpluses abroad to generate sufficient income to finance future budgets.
In the context of the peg, the QCB would need to manage liquidity more actively. The QCB
would need to develop a formal liquidity management framework to facilitate a more proactive
strategy in fine-tuning liquidity. In addition, coordination of debt management with the Ministry of
Economy and Finance would be helpful in maintaining a stable and adequate stock of
government securities for the further development of an interbank repo market, and also
providing a robust benchmark yield curve for the corporate bond market.

3
Developing a more formal and transparent macroprudential policy framework to enable a swift
response when needed would help achieve orderly credit growth without generating
overheating. The main challenges for monetary policy will be to support credit growth without
fuelling inflationary pressures or short-term capital inflows. Against the backdrop of increasing
credit growth, banks, and the QCB need to be cautious that overall credit quality does not
weaken, particularly in the real estate sector in view of the prevailing excess supply. Collating
and disseminating price and volume data on Qatar’s real estate market segments would help
banks assess risks better and also enable the central bank to take informed preemptive
measures to preserve financial stability.
The banking system has the ability to withstand credit and market risks. Nevertheless, staff
underscores the need to monitor individual banks for stress, given the interlinkages in the
financial system. Further, individual banks’ foreign currency liquidity conditions need to be
monitored and the QCB should stand ready to relieve potential pressures. Enabling a more
robust risk assessment culture, conducting regular stress testing of banks, and putting in place
an early warning system would help mitigate risks to the banking system and maintain financial
stability.
In the medium term, fiscal policy will need to balance sometimes competing objectives of
economic stabilization, development and generating intergenerational savings. Fiscal space has
contracted somewhat compared to last year, because of the permanent increase in current
expenditure, according to staff’s medium-term fiscal sustainability exercise. Given the
authorities’ objective of fully financing the budget from 2020 onwards from its nonhydrocarbon
revenues, and for building buffers for shocks, the authorities will need to increase savings over
the medium term. While the eventual implementation of large capital projects, adjustment in
current expenditures would be the most feasible way to reduce the dependency of the budget
on hydrocarbon revenues.
Establishing a macro-fiscal unit would support fiscal policy making and the development of a
medium-term budget framework to ensure the efficiency of public spending. A solid mediumterm expenditure framework would represent a critical building block for the eventual adoption
of a fiscal rule to help manage the path of fiscal spending.
Reducing Qatar’s vulnerability to hydrocarbon price fluctuations will require, in addition to fiscal
management, diversification into other sectors of the economy and reinforcing competitiveness.
Opportunities for efficiency gains and reducing distortions in petrol, energy, and water use exist
by reducing, among others, direct and indirect subsidies. It is also opportune to consider options
for deeper pension reforms.
Further improvements in statistics will be essential, which will also require greater coordination
across agencies.
