STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
March 13, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context. Iran had achieved considerable progress in raising per capita income and living
standards in previous decades. But in recent years, such progress stalled as both
domestic policies and the external environment deteriorated. Inflation has increased
sharply and non-oil growth is well below potential. Corporate and financial-sector
vulnerabilities have emerged, and unemployment rates are high. A difficult external
environment and domestic vulnerabilities raise the risk of entrenching the economy in
a low-growth high-inflation scenario. The authorities are well aware of the challenges
and the reforms needed, but face a highly-complex institutional set-up and sociopolitical context. Advancing reforms will require broad political commitment and needs
to be supported by strong coordination and cooperation among key policymakers.
A highly uncertain outlook. Facing continued constraints on oil revenues and to carry
out international transactions, the economy is expected to continue to contract in
2013/14. With some positive tailwinds from the external side and modest incipient signs
that the pace of contraction in domestic demand is slowing, economic activity would
begin to stabilize in 2014/15. While the current outlook is subject to downside risks, the
interim agreement with the P5+1 also brings upside risks. Were this progress to derail,
the economy could be subject to new adverse shocks.
Dealing with stagflation. The policy mix should support the economy while also
gradually reducing inflation. Fiscal deficits should be contained at around 2–3 percent
of GDP, by broadening the revenue base away from oil and by keeping a tight lid on
spending. This should be complemented by reforms that boost the supply side (product,
labor, and credit markets) as well as the demand side (to restore monetary policy
credibility, reduce uncertainty, and better coordinate fiscal management).

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

Subsidy Reform. Iran’s design of the subsidy reform has been exemplary and the reform
remains a priority. Plans to increase domestic energy prices gradually are prudent but
should be underpinned by an automatic price adjustment mechanism to ensure full
implementation, by consistent macroeconomic policies, and by reforms to foster the
adoption of new technologies and tighter budget constraints, particularly in energyintensive sectors.
Strengthening the Policy Framework. Fiscal reforms should empower the scope for
countercyclical fiscal policy, better support macroeconomic stability, and be framed
within a medium-term expenditure planning to limit fiscal risks. Priority needs to be
given to price stability, by improving the mandate and operational autonomy of the
Central Bank of Iran and by reviewing government-mandated credit policies. Work to
unify the exchange rate should be initiated, while preserving flexibility ahead to ensure
competitiveness.
Reforms to Promote Growth and Jobs. There is a need to improve business
regulations, advance effective privatizations, and reduce nonwage labor costs.
Addressing weaknesses in the banking system is important, including by improving
the supervisory and crisis preparedness frameworks.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

CONTEXT
1.
Over the past two decades, Iran had achieved considerable progress in raising per
capita income and living standards. This progress was largely underpinned by investment, rising
employment-to-population and productivity since the early 1990s, and by high terms of trade since
the early 2000s (Figure 1). To a large extent, Iran has continued to benefit from its vast hydrocarbon
wealth, as well as from being a relatively diversified resource-intensive economy. Social indicators
show declining poverty and income inequality, supporting a relatively high level of human
development. Notwithstanding this progress, per capita income and living standards were still below
other resource-intensive economies.
2.
Such progress stalled during the past several years. Large shocks and weak
macroeconomic management have had a significant impact on macroeconomic stability and
growth. With a long history of high inflation and facing large relative price changes, macroeconomic
policies leading to and following the subsidy reform in 2010, remained accommodative to ease
corporate adjustment and support household transfers, while also exhibiting high volatility and
some procyclical trends. At the same time, the implementation of certain ambitious social programs,
such as for housing, significantly compounded these problems. The intensification of international
trade and financial sanctions since 2012 brought renewed shockwaves to the economy, further
undermining macroeconomic conditions significantly.
3.
The policy response to these shocks prioritized output over inflation stabilization,
and exposed the limitations of and the need to rethink the policy framework. The large relative
price change associated with the subsidy reform led to a significant increase in inflation and a
deceleration in non-oil growth in 2011, which were exacerbated by the deterioration in the external
environment in 2012. The policy response aimed to prioritize output over inflation stabilization by
continuing to accommodate the financing demands of the corporate and government sectors.
Following the intensification of economic sanctions, greater exchange rate flexibility helped to buffer
output to some extent but, as monetary policy remained accommodative, such flexibility resulted in
a sharp rise in inflation. All in all, macroeconomic policies contributed to a significant rise in the level
and volatility of inflation and output since the mid-2000s, and corporate and financial sector
vulnerabilities have now emerged, with unemployment at high levels. And while it would have been
difficult for the authorities to have fully buffered the economy from the recent shocks, the policy
framework did not provide sufficient resilience and the policy response did not appear sufficiently
timely, well-implemented, and coordinated.
4.
Iran now stands at a crossroad. The external environment remains uncertain and delaying
domestic reforms raise the risk of entrenching the economy in a low-growth and high-inflation
scenario, underscoring the need to address long-standing weaknesses in the policy framework and
the economy. The new administration that took office in August 2013 earned a strong mandate and
has already made significant progress in improving the external environment and confidence in the
outlook. The administration’s 100-day report confirmed how well aware the authorities are of the

economic challenges ahead and many of the reforms needed. But the task of advancing reforms
ahead will be difficult, not least due to a highly complex institutional set-up and a difficult sociopolitical context. This will require broad political commitment, supported by strong coordination
and cooperation among key policymakers. The 2014 Article IV Consultation provided a timely
opportunity to discuss and assess these issues.

and Figure 2).



Twelve-month inflation doubled in 2011. It accelerated from about 13 percent on the eve
of the subsidy reform to about 22 percent by December 2011. This owed much to the passthrough from the adjustment in subsidized prices for food and energy, as producer price
inflation rose from 12 percent to 39 percent (y/y) during the same period. This relative price
change also took place against a backdrop of administrative measures, such as price monitoring
and the use of strategic inventories of key staples, as well as some tightening of macroeconomic
policies, which helped limit the pass-through.

Since early 2012, international trade and financial sanctions brought renewed shockwaves
and pushed the economy into a deep contraction. A series of sanctions restricting oil exports,
the supply chain of some key sectors (like automobiles), and transactions of international and
domestic banks, impaired Iran’s ability to

shocks imparted significant contractionary
effects on the economy, with real GDP declining by almost 6 percent in 2012/13. During the first
half of 2013/14, real GDP is estimated to have declined by about 2½ percent, compared with the
same period in the previous year.



The authorities abandoned their managed exchange rate regime. Following a sharp
depreciation in the bureau/parallel market in September 2012, the Central Bank of Iran (CBI)
introduced a new Foreign Exchange center (FX center), mostly supplied with hydrocarbon export
receipts. The CBI initially offered foreign exchange for most current transactions at an official
rate of 2 percent below the rate offered in the bureau/parallel market, while maintaining the
previous official exchange rate for basic necessities. With the bureau/parallel market rate
continuing to depreciate, the 2 percent target was eventually abandoned, with three exchange
rates (an official for basic necessities, one for other current transactions (FX center), and a
bureau/parallel market rates) available for transactions. With the premium in the foreign
exchange market (between the bureau/parallel and the FX center rates) still high, at around
50 percent, loose monetary conditions, and new sanctions being introduced in early 2013, the
authorities eventually unified official exchange rates in June 2013. Market conditions have
stabilized since the Presidential elections in mid-June, with the rial appreciating by about
20 percent in the bureau/parallel market and the premium declining to about 20 percent in
recent months (Figure 3).

Throughout these shocks, monetary conditions were relatively accommodative and
inflation continued to accelerate. In the wake of the subsidy reform, the CBI tightened base
money but did not succeed in reducing money growth significantly, as specialized and other

during the last decade, when macroeconomic policies contributed to keep tradable and
nontradable inflation at high levels. More recently, the CBI has kept a lid on base money growth
thanks to tighter credit to the banking system and some fiscal consolidation, the exchange rate
in the bureau/parallel market has appreciated, and 12-month inflation has declined to about
29 percent in January 2014 (Figure 3).2

In early 2012, the MCC allowed banks to determine deposit rates. But this failed to translate into greater flexibility
and link with inflation, as lending rates for transactional contracts remained subject to officially-mandated caps.

In March 2013, the CPI basket was updated to reflect 2011 household spending patterns and entailed a
4½ percentage point higher weight for services (housing, health, and communications) relative to goods (food,



The fiscal position deteriorated significantly. Facing about 10 percentage point of GDP
decline in total revenues since 2010/11, the authorities cut spending by close to 6 percentage
points of GDP (with capital spending comprising about two-thirds of the cut). As a result, the
overall fiscal balance shifted from a surplus of 3 percent of GDP in 2010/11 to an estimated
deficit of 1 percent of GDP in 2013/14 (Tables 3 and 4). The cash deficit of the Targeted
Subsidies Organization (TSO) remained high, at an estimated 1–2 percent of GDP in the same
period, bringing the expanded overall deficit to about 2¼ percent of GDP in 2013/14 (Figure 2).



The financial system was also adversely affected. Banks’ asset quality and profitability have
been significantly affected by the combination of sanctions and rigid government credit policies
(Tables 5, 6, and 7). Reported nonperforming loans (NPLs) peaked at 17 percent of total loans
in 2012/13 (almost 10 percent of non-oil GDP), largely mirroring external trade and cash flow
problems in the corporate sector, particularly state-owned enterprises (SOEs).3 Credit to the
private sector grew by 21 percent (year-on-year) in December 2013, implying a decline of about
6 percent in real terms. Lending activity of state-owned banks was the most sluggish, as these
banks were heavily exposed to weak corporate borrowers. Despite these challenges, privatesector deposit growth (year-on-year) outpaced credit growth by 6 percentage points as of
December 2013.



The balance of payments remained in surplus, but external arrears emerged as
international sanctions impaired access to foreign exchange. Iran’s current account surplus
declined to 6½ percent of GDP in 2012/13, almost halving from the year before (Table 2). The
sharp fall in oil exports was the main factor, partly offset by import compression. The deficit
of the capital account remained contained, leaving the overall balance of payments in a surplus
of 3½ percent of GDP in 2012/13. Gross foreign assets of the CBI rose to about $104 billion by
end-2012/13. The liquidity of official reserve assets remained tight, and some external creditors
have reported rising public and private external arrears, mostly related to lack of access to hard
currencies for repayment.



There was a limited and temporary easing of economic sanctions in November 2013. Under
the interim agreement with the P5+1 in November 2013, Iran’s crude oil sales would be allowed
to stabilize at the level of around 1 million bpd and Iran could access US$4.2 billion of its own
funds held abroad in the six months, following the agreement taking effect on January 20, 2014.
Sanctions on Iran’s petrochemical exports, the automobile industry, and on the trading of gold
and precious metals, were also waived temporarily, potentially providing US$1.5 billion in
revenue. The United States and the European Union have also committed to establish a financial
channel to facilitate humanitarian trade with Iran, including for civil aviation needs and to enable
payment of tuition fees for Iranian students abroad. All in all, Iran would be able to dispense
about US$6–7 billion (2 percent of GDP) during the six months following its implementation on
January 20, 2014. The interim agreement maintained the sanctions against the Central Bank of
Iran and other domestic financial institutions.

NPLs could be underreported given past supervisory forbearance and weak loan classification standards.

NEAR-TERM RISKS AND THE MEDIUM-TERM
OUTLOOK
6.
The near-term outlook remains highly uncertain, with the distribution of risks
becoming more balanced but still tilted to the downside. Facing continued constrained
prospects for oil revenues and to conduct international trade and financial transactions, staff expects
the economy to continue to contract in 2013/14, with real GDP estimated to decline by 1¾ percent.
With some positive tailwinds from the external side and some incipient signs that the pace of
contraction in domestic demand is slowing, it is projected that economic activity would begin to
stabilize in 2014/15, with real GDP projected to increase by 1–2 percent. The real exchange rate
depreciation has continued to provide impetus to sectors such as agriculture, parts of
manufacturing, and non-oil exports, and prospects for hydrocarbons and manufacturing have also
improved. But the current outlook remains highly uncertain and subject to several downside risks,
most notably from a difficult external environment and from failure to address high unemployment
(Appendix I). In the meantime, the authorities are taking steps to make the regulatory framework
for foreign investment in the oil sector more attractive, while the interim agreement with the P5+1
brings upside risks. Nonetheless, were this progress to derail, the economy could be subject to new
adverse shocks. In any event, staff’s baseline scenario—which is based on sustained constraints for
oil revenues and to conduct international transactions—shows that growth would remain below
potential and inflation would remain high (Table 8).
7.
Even with a sustained improvement in the external environment, medium-term
prospects hinge on strengthening the overall policy framework and on boosting overall
investment and productivity (Alternative scenario in Appendix II). Comprehensive structural
reforms would be required to improve the business environment, enforce budget constraints and
restructure the corporate sector (to reduce its dependence on subsidies and energy intensity in
production), promote private sector investment, allow the financial sector to better allocate savings
and handle risks, and address high unemployment. At the same time, the hydrocarbon sector faces
large investment needs at a time when the call on OPEC is on a downward path. Being an already
well-diversified economy with a large domestic market provides a good starting point to advance
reforms. Nonetheless, the overall institutional policy and regulatory frameworks for product and
labor markets lag in global competitiveness. Reforms are needed to improve the business
environment to attract investment to boost productivity, and help restore sustainable growth and
employment.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
The policy discussions focused on how to restore macroeconomic stability and address
long-standing challenges in the policy framework and the structure of the economy to
achieve sustainable growth. The Fund’s past policy advice and technical assistance has had some
important impact on fiscal policy and statistics. The authorities made progress in implementing a
VAT, enhancing tax administration, adopting the Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFSM,
2001), and becoming a Global Data Dissemination Standard (GDDS) member. Nonetheless, many
of the past recommendations—on monetary, interest and exchange rates policies and on the
policies to support the subsidy reform have been difficult to implement and remain relevant,
especially in light of the constraints posed by the external environment. Against this backdrop, the
discussions focused on:

The authorities emphasized that focusing on disinflation was the best means to
address stagflation. CBI senior officials stressed that they have taken important steps to reduce
inflation. A tight control of base money over the past seven months has been underpinned by a
government-supported agreement to remove the financing of the Mehr Housing Program from the
CBI’s balance sheet. The authorities saw this agreement as a significant achievement and signal to

stressed their commitment to contain money
growth by placing participation papers at higher profit (interest) rates.4 It was agreed that a gradual
tightening of monetary policy would have limited output costs, help anchor expectations and
entrench disinflation, and also help contain the second-round impact from the planned increase in
domestic energy prices.

There are two types of lending contracts: transactional and participatory. Transactional contracts involve the
financing of working capital, and the CBI fixes their interest rates by industry. Participatory ones involve the financing
of some longer-term investment activity. The bank, and the depositor financing the loan, is entitled to a share of the
profit from these investments. As the amount of profits is not known at the time when banks collect the deposit and
make the loan, they indicate provisional profit rates. Economically, these profit rates are similar to interest rates.

Box 2. The Mehr Housing Project and Its Macroeconomic Implications
Iran started an ambitious affordable housing project in 2007 to bring some two million homes to the
housing market over a five year period. The Mehr Housing Project targeted low-income families and was
triggered by growing demand for new housing by Iran’s young population, with 0.8 million additional housing
units needed every year on top of a deficit of 1.5 million housing unit estimated in 2006. Under the scheme, the
authorities provide land to private developers free of charge and new homeowners get a 99-year lease on the
publicly owned land. The housing bank (Bank Maskan) extends, among other facilities, subsidized mortgage loans
to new homeowners to finance their home purchases.
The financing of this project was placed upon the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), significantly complicating the
conduct of monetary policy. Bank Maskan relied on credit lines and other financing facilities from the CBI. In fact,
CBI financing to Bank Maskan tripled in 2010, in the run up to the subsidy reform, and doubled during the
implementation of the first phase of the reform. By end-2011, CBI financing to Bank Maskan represented about
40 percent of base money. This trend undermined the CBI’s efforts to ensure that second round effects from the
change in domestic energy prices were minimized, while also forcing the CBI to tighten credit to the rest of the
economy, with adverse implications for economic activity.
The government has stopped the CBI financing of the Mehr Housing Project but its future financing
remains uncertain. Outstanding commitments under the project and the rise in the demand for affordable
housing would require a permanent solution. To avoid any future pressure on the CBI for further financing and
increase transparency of the fiscal accounts, the authorities should consider including the project in the annual
budget and finance it through budgetary resources.

The authorities and staff agreed that the 2014/15 budget provided a good balance
between disinflation and supporting the economy. The authorities emphasized that the
approved budget continued with their task of advancing fiscal consolidation initiated with the
amendment to the 2013/14 budget in late 2013. The new budget advances important tax and
expenditure reforms while also maintaining a tight lid on current spending. Several ministries will
participate in a pilot performance budgeting next year that will be extended to all in 2015/16 and
better entrench savings on current spending. While capital spending has been prioritized and is
envisaged to rebound, it would still remain well below pre-2012/13 levels. While the specifics on
how to proceed with increasing domestic energy prices were still being discussed, the authorities
indicated that such plans would help bring the deficit of the TSO from 1⅓ percent of GDP in
2013/14 to balance in 2014/15. These measures, along with several others on the revenue side,
would help keep the overall deficit at around 2½ percent of GDP in 2014/15.
11.
The authorities have also begun to broaden the revenue base away from oil. They
explained their intention to broaden the base for non-oil tax revenues from 6 percent of GDP to
10 percent of GDP over the next several years. This would increasingly allow the financing of current
spending through the tax system rather than oil revenues, which would be mostly allocated to
capital spending.

The authorities underscored ongoing efforts to strengthen tax compliance. These included
large taxpayers and other indirect taxes (such as on professions), and they agreed on the
potential to tax activities that have experienced large gains in recent years, such as on capital
gains on equity investment and real estate. It was agreed that these efforts should help limit
deficits and risks, improve the quality of the envisaged fiscal adjustment, and help lay the
ground for a more sustainable fiscal policy ahead. Staff noted that these efforts were critical
to entrench fiscal consolidation, as the results from the PIH on the illustrative medium-term
scenarios confirmed the need for further fiscal adjustment of about 1–4 percent of non-oil GDP.6

The PIH calculates the net-present value of fiscal oil revenue from 2012/13 to 2050 for baseline and alternative
scenarios. For the period post 2019, both scenarios assume that oil revenues stabilize at the 2019 level, and gas
revenue grows by 3 percent per year. Given forecasts of non-oil revenue, the PIH calculates a level of public spending
that is consistent with the net-present value of oil wealth. The PIH annuity assumes that oil wealth is spent up to
2050, while the PIH perpetuity assumes that expenditures are at a level that leaves the real value of wealth
unchanged.

The subsidy reform law stipulated the preparation by the TSO and the Supreme Audit Court of semi-annual reports

The authorities and staff agreed that increasing domestic energy prices was an important step to
reduce energy consumption, pollution, improve the efficiency of the economy, and bring domestic
prices toward international levels. The authorities acknowledged staff concerns on placing the
economy through another large adverse supply shock at the current juncture and explained that the
contemplated price increases were needed to address serious imbalances. Therefore, the price
increases would be significantly lower than during the first phase of the reform and done gradually
to minimize the impact on the economy and inflation. They agreed that such a gradual increase
should be underpinned by a medium-term plan (about five years) to anchor the price increases and
by an automatic price adjustment mechanism. Staff emphasized that the experience of the first
phase of the subsidy reform showed that shocks could significantly undermine the stability of the
exchange rate and the envisaged relative price adjustment. Consistent macroeconomic policies and
reforms to tighten budget constraints in the corporate sector are crucial to make this reform
sustainable.
13.
The authorities agreed that reforms to boost the supply-side and productivity would
also help in dealing with stagflation. While the difficult external environment limited the scope for
reforms and potential benefits, they stressed that restoring policy credibility and advancing reforms
to entrench disinflation were essential. First and foremost, the authorities emphasized promoting
macroeconomic stability, deepening domestic capital markets to further promote long-term
financing, and easing the administrative burden on the private sector. Addressing cash-flow
constraints and arrears in the corporate and banking sectors were also seen as important. Senior CBI
officials noted that the cash-flow constraints and interlinkages in the corporate, government, and
banking sectors were complex and difficult to solve immediately. They viewed sustained disinflation
and higher profit rates as means for banks to better support credit needs of the economy.

Box 3. A Brief Look at the Implementation of the Subsidy Reform and the Next Steps
The Targeted Subsidies Reform (TSR) is one of the most courageous moves to reform subsidies in an energy
exporting country, but has yet to fulfill its potential. Despite initial successful roll out of the TSR, its implementation
did not go as planned. Both domestic policies and external factors played a role in undermining the reform. Relatively
accommodative macroeconomic policies, deficits in the household cash transfer program, failure to impose tight budget
constraints on enterprises, and a lack of open communications and coordination problems within the government during
the implementation adversely affected the implementation of the TSR. Subsequently, the intensification of sanctions and
the large depreciation led to a reversal of the gains achieved and eventual postponement of the reform.
The initial success of the reform in driving down the consumption of subsidized products and improving income
distribution waned with the sharp increase in inflation.
After a steep reduction following the launch of the TSR,
domestic energy consumption picked up later with the real
decline in energy prices as inflation and nominal incomes
rose. Improvements in income distribution, with the poverty
rate declining by about 5 percentage points in the first three
months of the TSR and Gini coefficient by 0.04 points for the
whole year, were partially reversed by the rapid increase in
inflation and decline in real value of wages and cash transfers.

order of an estimated 1½ percent of GDP, adding to macroeconomic pressures. Second, despite being one key premise
of the TSR, there was no progress in reforming the production structure of enterprises and their energy efficiency. In the
event, the reform was also challenged by the lack of hard budget constraints at the corporate level, which thwarted pricestabilization attempts.

Rethink the framework that allocates oil-wealth/savings among the goals of
macroeconomic stability, intergenerational equity, and development. In recent years, the Oil
Stabilization Fund (OSF) has been “de facto” not operational, while the National Development
Fund (NDFI) is not allowed to finance the budget.8 With NDFI receiving a fixed and increasing
share of oil and gas export proceeds and no ability to finance government deficits, recent large
adverse shocks have forced large public spending cuts and resort to inflationary budgetary
financing. The mechanism for allocating oil revenues seems too rigid and detached from
changing macroeconomic conditions. OSF resources need to be replenished to support
countercyclical fiscal policy. Also, the decisions on how to distribute hydrocarbon revenues
among budget financing, lending to the non-oil economy through NDFI, needs to be better
coordinated to assess the fiscal impulse, limit procyclicality and enhance macroeconomic
stability.

Take steps toward annual multi-year expenditure and budget planning. Iran has in place
a one-year budgeting framework, with limited requirements for formulating a fiscal policy
consistent with a longer horizon. Within the annual budget bill, the authorities are not required
under the law to submit a medium-term projection. A medium-term approach should help
insulate the economy from oil-revenue shocks, strengthen expenditure planning, and thus
reduce the volatility of expenditure.

8

The OSF was established in 2000 to insulate the budget from fluctuations in oil prices (revenues) and to generate
savings to be used when prices fell, as well as to support development of the private sector. However, in 2010, the
NDFI was established as a nongovernment public entity to promote development and savings, while forbidden from
lending to the government.



Broaden the coverage of fiscal accounts, their transparency and accountability. In recent
years, the authorities have shifted part of their public sector accounts presentation to the
Government Financial Statistics Manual 2001. However, the coverage remains limited to mostly
the central government and excludes other parts of the general government such as provinces
and SOEs. Also, their supervisory framework remains unclear, especially for ex-post performance
and pre-emptive corrective actions.



Review quasi-fiscal activities (QFAs). NDFI senior officials emphasized that with the
establishment of the NDFI, important steps have been taken in only three years to strengthen
the management of oil wealth. A framework for saving a significant part of oil-revenues is now
well established, which ensures its independence from the government and also strengthened
its transparency.9 They noted that the

agreed with staff that there was significant scope to enhance NDFI’s investment targets, riskmanagement policy, transparency, and accountability along the lines of the Santiago principles
and the vast international experience. 10 Staff noted that other QFAs (such as the Mehr Housing
Program) and their respective interest rate subsidies should be made more transparent and
gradually incorporated into the central government budget.

As of the third-quarter of 2013, the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute’s Linaburg-Maduell transparency rating for the

The Next Steps of the Subsidy Reform: A Robust Supporting Framework
15.
The authorities agreed that it was essential to ensure an adequate framework for
advancing the subsidy reform. It was agreed that the current deficit associated with the subsidy
reform stemmed from shortcomings in its implementation, mostly related to the failure to impose
budget discipline on high-energy users, as well as a higher number of households receiving cash
transfers than originally planned. Specifically:


The authorities noted that future energy price increases would have to better balance
competing social needs rather than increasing cash transfers to all households. The
authorities explained that while they intended to maintain the framework associated with the
first phase of the reform, the political support to maintain the same design going forward had
waned. As a result, efforts had been mostly focused on identifying and means testing recipients
with a view to only including in future phases those households deemed most vulnerable to
higher domestic energy prices. But the identification of high- and middle-income groups has
proved difficult and the authorities continued to work on establishing a comprehensive and
reliable database of potential recipients. In the meantime, they were considering a proposal that
would be implemented based on criteria using a broad range of indicators (such as the number
of trips abroad per year, of luxury cars owned, professional occupation, or even re-registering
beneficiaries) to exclude less vulnerable groups. The proceeds from higher energy prices would
be used to support household spending on health insurance (as two-thirds of health care costs
are out-of-pocket), several high-energy intensive sectors, and also increase cash transfers only
to some of the most vulnerable households.



The authorities saw the reforms to tighten budget constraints at the corporate level as one
of the most difficult challenges. They agreed that the experience with the first phase of the
subsidy reform underscored the need to ensure that energy-intensive corporations were able
to optimize their energy use and adopt new technologies, as domestic prices were gradually
aligned with international ones. In this regard, they explained that diesel prices would be
adjusted more gradually than other fuels to facilitate such a process, while several options were
being considered to support such an adjustment and proper incentives, including the options
to link financial support to concrete energy savings. The authorities also indicated their desire to
announce future price increases within a medium-term horizon to increase the transparency for
investors.

16.
While supporting the need to advance with the reform, staff highlighted several risks.
The criteria for identifying and excluding less vulnerable groups had to be simple, transparent, and
perceived as fair. In addition, the distribution of resources for supporting energy-intensive sectors
should effectively foster the adoption of new technologies and tighter budget constraints. The
extent of the difficulties facing energy-intensive sectors likely exceeds the contemplated resources,
making the criteria for accessing such support critical. In subsequent stages of the reform, staff
noted the scope to make direct cash transfers more conditional on social goals and also tilted
toward savings for the broader population. Consideration could also be given to phasing out the
cash transfers to the population and potentially replacing them with a consolidated public

framework that distributes oil wealth or with a scheme to promote private savings. The authorities
could also make the lessons from the first phase of the reform well known to the public, to muster
support to future phases of the reform and to assist other countries in their reform efforts.
Monetary Policy and the Exchange Rate: Reforms to Strengthen Price Stability
17.
The authorities and staff agreed that the monetary policy framework needs to be
strengthened. Staff noted that the shocks and policy response in recent years showed that the CBI
had to deal with competing demands without a mandate focused on price stability. In addition, staff
stressed that the CBI’s operational effectiveness had been undermined by the institutional decisionmaking process. The Money and Credit Council (MCC) remains responsible for most decisions and
is dominated by government and private-sector representatives, with competing and oftentimes
contradictory goals. As a result of these constraints, the exchange rate—the traditional nominal
anchor—has been a key instrument of adjustment to shocks, and with fixed profit (interest) rates,
real profit (interest) rates have declined sharply. This response has compounded difficulties in
stabilizing inflation expectations and constrained the use of some of the traditional sterilization
instruments.

The authorities and staff agreed that several measures would help to reduce and
stabilize inflation at low levels:


Interest rates will need to be more reflective of inflation, with more scope for being
market-determined. CBI senior officials explained that bringing profit (interest) rates for
government-mandated credit and participation papers more in line with inflation would help
address some difficulties in credit markets and enable the CBI to better manage liquidity. At the
same time, the CBI would also signal its commitment to lower inflation, bolster the demand for
the rial, and thus help better anchor the needed exchange rate flexibility and money. While they
acknowledged difficulties in gradually increasing interest rates at this juncture, given the state of
the economy and concerns on renewed shocks, CBI senior officials saw limited output costs from
higher profit (interest) rates and a need to contain money growth to support disinflation. To do

so, they were determined to issue participation papers with higher profit (interest) rates than
before.11


Strengthen the mandate and operational effectiveness of the CBI. With less scope to use
foreign exchange reserves for sterilization purposes and risks from large and persistent fiscal
deficits, staff emphasized that reforms were needed to ensure that monetary policy can stabilize
inflation successfully. The authorities noted that there was growing consensus at the MCC to
strengthen the CBI’s mandate on price stability and its operational effectiveness. These reforms
would help entrench the benefits for disinflation stemming from the landmark decision on the
Mehr Housing Program. It was agreed that simplifying the CBI’s mandate and strengthening its
operational autonomy would significantly enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy, in line
with the experience of other chronic inflation countries that have successfully achieved price
stability.

19.
The authorities stressed their commitment to return to a unified exchange rate regime.
They recognized that the current external environment imposed several constraints on their ability
to unify the official and bureau/parallel exchange rates, and also underscored the significant
preparatory work that a unification would entail. Nonetheless, they were committed to unify both
markets by mid-2015. They also recognized that arrears on external payments by public- and
private-sector entities had emerged, but attributed these to technical difficulties in accessing foreign
exchange. CBI senior officials explained that they were prepared to clear public-sector arrears with
foreign assets held abroad and to eliminate foreign exchange restrictions and any arrears arising
from these restrictions. They also agreed with staff on the need to preserve some exchange rate
flexibility, given the relatively rapid exchange rate appreciation in real terms in recent months and
the lingering risks to the outlook. They also noted that the 2014/15 budget contemplated steps to
depreciate the official rate and bring it closer to the bureau/parallel rate.
20.
The official exchange rate appears somewhat overvalued, but uncertainties over Iran’s
external environment cloud its assessment. The authorities noted that the bureau/parallel
exchange rate—which is 15–20 percent more depreciated than the official rate—seemed to be more
in line with fundamentals. They stressed that the exchange rate has regained stability and that Iran’s
external buffers were comfortable, although they recognized some difficulties with accessibility.
Based on conventional CGER-methodologies, the official exchange rate seems moderately
overvalued (see Appendix III). However, these approaches are based on staff’s baseline
macroeconomic scenario, which shows Iran’s oil exports well below historical averages. Were Iran’s
external environment to improve, oil exports could revert back to about 2½ million barrels per day
(roughly the average of the years 2007–11), and the exchange rate would appear to be more in line
with fundamentals.

The current exchange rate regime gives rise to exchange restrictions and multiple
currency practices. The authorities explained that a significant part of current account transactions
were conducted at the official exchange rate. However, they recognized that several import
categories were being prioritized (basic necessities over other categories of authorized imports)
and that, given some delays in the process of granting of foreign exchange some importers were
effectively conducting their transactions through the bureau market. They emphasized that the
effective premium was in fact small due to the high transaction costs in the official market. They
emphasized the many difficulties in accessing foreign exchange, in transferring assets from countries
where they had trade surpluses to those with deficits, and in finding correspondent banks. In
addition, they explained that limits of US$300 and US$15,000 were effectively in place for travel and
for studies abroad, respectively, and that amounts in excess of these limits were accessed through
the bureau/parallel market at a more depreciated rate. These foreign exchange limitations, including
as a result of import priority categories, give rise to exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval
under Article VIII, Section 2(a). Furthermore, the establishment of an official exchange rate for use in
all exchange transactions which in practice differs by more than 2 percent from the rate used by
licensed foreign exchange bureaus gives rise to a multiple currency practice and an exchange
restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and (3). The authorities also
confirmed that no changes had been made regarding the transferability of profits under the Foreign
Investment Promotion and Protection Act and to the making of other investment-related current
payments under this act, but noted that they intend to examine possible modifications to the
regulations to remove the restriction. In addition, the authorities confirmed that the letters of credit
opened before March 21, 2002 that benefited from subsidies were still outstanding.12

22.
The authorities viewed as critical the need to advance reforms to improve the business
environment and address high unemployment. Staff noted that comprehensive steps would be
needed to enhance the efficiency of product, financial, and labor markets, as well as to strengthen
the institutional framework and effectiveness of the government (Figure 5). Discussions with a broad
group of representatives from different economic sectors highlighted the need to enhance the
enforcement of the rule of law and property rights, maintain policy and macroeconomic stability,
and enhance the transparency of policy making. In particular:


The authorities recognized that the corporate sector was facing difficult conditions. The
authorities explained that several reforms to simplify administrative procedures under the Law
for Continued Improvement of the Business Environment were now being implemented. They also
explained that past privatizations failed to effectively transfer ownership to the private sector
and tighten budget constraints, and therefore, have taken steps to improve the privatization
process. In addition, senior government officials stressed the administration’s commitment to

letters of credit, opened before 2002, is temporary as it relates to a limited number of letters of credit expected to
expire by 2016. Please refer to the Informational Annex for further details.

promote foreign and private sector investment, which they saw as beneficial not only for Iran
but also the region. The authorities recognized that efforts to improve the business environment
would require significant coordination with other state-agencies and the private sector. These
efforts would help improve the standards of corporate governance and support the deepening
of domestic capital markets, which they viewed as critical to entrench macroeconomic stability
and higher productivity. The authorities noted that the tight liquidity conditions reigning in
some sectors of the economy and their linkages, was a complex and difficult issue to solve in
the near term.
There was broad recognition that dealing with high unemployment will require reforms to
the labor market. The administration has placed unemployment (at 24 percent for youth and
20 percent for women by December 2013, respectively) as the most pressing problem. In
addition, the extent of underemployment is high.13 Labor force participation remains high
(mainly for men) but has been declining and prospective new entrants bring considerable risks
to social conditions over the medium term. As highlighted in several development plans, staff
noted that labor regulations should be reviewed to ease the rigidity of contracts (in terms of
hiring, firing, and special employment conditions such as study leave and force majeure) and
lower costs of labor (severance payments, social security contributions, and labor insurance)
which have led to high redundancy costs and low flexibility in employment and wage
determination (Box 5).

Box 4. Labor Market Issues and Unemployment in Iran
Iran’s labor market has faced difficult conditions over the past two decades. Participation rates have been declining,
employment between genders and age groups differ markedly, and unemployment rates have been persistently high, averaging
more than 12 percent since 2000. Moreover, unemployment rates for urban workers and the youth have been even higher, at
13.8 percent and 24.5 percent, respectively, in 2012.
The new administration recognizes high unemployment as a major challenge. An unprecedented number of students—
4.5 million—that are currently inactive are expected to enter the labor market in the years ahead. In the current environment
of slow economic growth, such a development could have significant implications for socio-economic conditions. To better
understand the relationship between growth and employment in Iran, staff used a template created by MCD staff to calculate
1
the elasticity of employment to GDP, based on the following equation:
log(Et) = α + ρ log(Et-1) + β log(non-oil GDPt)
where E is the number of people employed at time t, and β is the long-term elasticity, estimated at 0.35 for Iran. This elasticity
is relatively low compared with the MENA region, and may reflect the impact of the regulatory framework on employment
conditions.
Several scenarios help to assess the implications of macroeconomic policies and structural reforms on the labor market
and project different paths for the unemployment rate over the medium term. In particular:

 Under current conditions, unemployment is envisaged to continue rising. Were the non-oil economy to grow at an

average annual rate of 2½ percent and the labor force by 2 percent per year, and with the current estimated elasticity, the
unemployment rate would likely rise toward 20 percent by 2018.

 Non-oil GDP growth rates close to 6 percent per year would
help reduce unemployment somewhat. This would entail a
significant change in current economic conditions facing Iran,
either a comprehensive change in the external environment
and/or structural reforms to increase investment and
productivity. These reforms could, for example, increase the
elasticity of employment to growth and allow for lower growth
rates to reduce unemployment under adverse external
conditions. Reforms are essential but need the support from
higher non-oil growth.

 A combination of reforms and higher non-oil growth seems

essential to minimize risks from new entrants and also
reduce current high unemployment rates. For example, were
all 4½ million students to enter the market—the combination
of high growth and more elastic demand for labor could reduce
unemployment to around 9 percent.

The authorities underscored the need to improve the consistency of financial sector
policies. They explained that the banking system had faced a difficult environment over the past
several years. A combination of government directives, including through government-mandated
credit policies, had weakened risk management, particularly in state-owned banks, and incentives
for supervision. As a result, regulatory forbearance on prudential limits had become more
widespread and difficult to solve, due to the severity of past shocks and to the lack of proper
enforcement capacity and supervisory powers by the CBI, including bank supervisors not enjoying
full legal immunity. Banks’ loan classification procedures have been reportedly weak, resulting in
under provisioning and overstated capital adequacy ratios, particularly for state-owned banks. While
market participants expressed overall satisfaction with the direction the CBI was imparting to
financial sector policies, the authorities stressed that advancing many of the needed reforms would
require continued efforts to muster political support. In particular:


The authorities were considering different options to resolve NPLs and recapitalize banks.
They stressed and staff agreed that their main goal was to strengthen risk management and
compliance with prudential limits. Senior management at state-owned banks had already been
replaced and consideration was being given to make those banks subject to better accounting
and provisioning standards, so as to make them more robust financially, including through
recapitalization and consolidation. The authorities were broadly satisfied with private banks,
which had already begun to recapitalize themselves.



The authorities saw a good opportunity to gradually dismantle government-mandated
credit policies, to promote competition and better risk management. They noted that there
were major differences between private and state-owned bank practices, with many banks
having increasingly moved away from government-mandated credit policies. Staff encouraged
the authorities to begin reviewing and dismantling directed-lending policies promptly. This step
could also involve closing the gap between domestic and international best practices in risk
management, internal controls, and governance. In addition, staff saw merit in the view of some
market participants that privatizing state-owned banks and managing them on a more
commercial basis would help level the field of competition in the system.



The authorities saw a need to enhance supervision. While there has been increased
coordination between off-site risk assessments and on-site supervision, the authorities
acknowledged that enforcing supervision was still difficult. They explained that off-site
supervision remained constrained in swiftly penalizing banks that fail to abide by regulatory
standards, including the dissemination of prudential information to the CBI. Steps were being
taken for on-site inspections to be more risk-based, prioritizing weakest banks. Despite
enforcement challenges, the authorities were drawing up remedial action plans for banks that
fail to meet regulatory standards. Staff noted the urgent need to strengthen the CBI’s
supervisory powers and enforcement capacity.



There is a need to strengthen the crisis preparedness framework. Staff noted that risk-based
supervision should be supported by frequent stress testing of the banking sector, which would
also provide a useful warning signal and cross-check to on-site reviews. The authorities also

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

explained that the bank resolution framework needed improvement, particularly regarding the
recently implemented deposit guarantee fund, which remained too comprehensive and onerous
to banks.


Some steps should be taken toward expanding the supervision of bank-affiliates, business
conglomerates, and nonbank credit institutions. With many of the private banks part of large
business conglomerates, staff noted that it would be important to improve the information
coverage to better map individual bank exposures into a system-wide network to assess
linkages and risks. Nonbank credit institutions, primarily credit unions and microfinance
charities, can collect deposits that are exempt from some elements of the regulatory
framework.14 The banking supervision department has encouraged consolidation among
nonbank institutions and asked the larger merged entities to apply for a banking license.

24.
Staff noted that the recent progress on the external environment provided a good
chance to advance on the AML/CFT legislation. Some progress has been made in strengthening
the AML regulatory framework, most notably the adoption by the AML High Council of fourteen
new AML instructions, the establishment of an economic crime prosecutor office, and a defined
roadmap for improving the AML system.15 The authorities noted that all financial institutions have
been subjected to an AML supervisory inspection over the past two years. However, while a bill on
countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) had been prepared and approved by Parliament in 2012,
the authorities reported that it is currently pending before the judiciary for an opinion. Staff noted
that there was scope to move towards risk-based AML/CFT supervision and encouraged the
authorities to adopt a CFT law that is improved regarding the criminalization of terrorism financing
and related activities, the freezing and confiscation of assets, the reporting and analysis of
suspicious transactions, and international cooperation.

OTHER ISSUES
25.
The authorities underscored that official statistics, particularly for prices and
unemployment, were underpinned by sound methodologies. Traditionally, Iran has had
adequate statistics for surveillance, notwithstanding some methodological shortcomings in some
areas, but delays in publication became more pronounced amid the intensification of international
sanctions in 2012. Staff noted that official statistics, particularly for consumer prices and
unemployment, had come under increased scrutiny. The authorities emphasized that the
methodologies for consumer prices and unemployment followed best international practice and
that they have taken steps since taking office to publish information on a more timely basis. Staff
agreed and offered the authorities technical assistance to help reaffirm the underlying
methodologies.
14

An important share of these institutions deposits are being included in the monetary survey.

15

The instructions include among others the identification of Iranian and foreign customers, the identification of
suspicious transactions and the method of reporting, and the monitoring and control of Politically Exposed Persons.

STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Iran had achieved considerable progress in raising per capita income in previous
decades, but large shocks and weak macroeconomic management in recent years have had a
significant impact on macroeconomic stability and growth. A combination of shocks, associated
with the implementation of the first phase of the subsidy reform, social-programs inadequately
funded, and a marked deterioration in the external environment have weakened the economy.
Inflation and unemployment are high, while the corporate and banking sectors are weak. The
experience over the past several years has exposed structural weaknesses in the economy and in the
policy framework.
27.
The economic outlook remains highly uncertain. Facing continued constrained prospects
for oil revenues and international transactions, the economy is expected to have continued to
contract in 2013/14. With some positive tailwinds from the external side and incipient signs that the
pace of contraction in domestic demand is slowing, economic activity would begin to stabilize in
2014/15. But the current outlook remains highly uncertain and subject to downside risks. The
authorities are taking steps to make the regulatory framework for foreign investment in the oil
sector more attractive, while the interim agreement with the P5+1 brings upside risks.
28.
The opportunity to advance comprehensive reforms should not be missed. There is a
need to advance reforms to the product, labor, and credit markets to promote stability, investment,
and productivity. The authorities should avoid postponing reforms and “muddling-through” in the
hope of an improved external environment. Advancing reforms would lay the basis for sustained
high growth and employment, especially should the external environment continue to improve.
29.
Dealing with stagflation requires several measures, careful sequencing and
coordination. A three-pronged strategy should be centered on tightening monetary policy, some
balanced fiscal consolidation, and structural reforms to boost the supply side. Staff welcomes the
steps taken to remove the financing of the Mehr program from the Central Bank of Iran’s balance
sheet, which bode well for stabilizing inflation in the future. The authorities are encouraged to find
an alternative noninflationary source of financing for this program to minimize macro-stability risks
ahead. Increasing profit rates gradually would help to firmly anchor expectations and contain
second-round effects from the planned increases in domestic energy prices. The 2014/15 budget
continues with the government’s decision to consolidate fiscal policy and would help balance the
support for disinflation and needs of the economy. Staff welcomes the proposed measures to begin
broadening the revenue base away from oil, most notably, the decision to bring forward and
increase the scheduled VAT rate, as well as the reforms to strengthen tax administration and reduce
exemptions. Staff sees scope to further increase the VAT rate in the years ahead—as it remains well
below those of other resource-intensive countries—as well as to expand the taxation to specific
activities that have experienced large gains. These measures would help to improve the quality of
the fiscal adjustment and help lay the ground for a sustainable fiscal policy ahead.

28

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

30.
Reforms to the monetary and fiscal policy frameworks are also essential to entrench
macroeconomic stability. The Central Bank of Iran’s mandate needs to be simplified and refocused
toward price stability. To build a solid foundation for the future, it is essential to bring the
institutional decision-making setup at the Money and Credit Council in line with those of countries
that have successfully resolved high chronic inflation. Reforms to the fiscal policy framework should
strengthen its countercyclical role, limit fiscal risks, and enhance macroeconomic coordination. The
current framework supported by the Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF) and the National Development
Fund of Iran (NDFI) could better balance the goals of macroeconomic stability, intergenerational
equity, and development. For this, OSF resources need to be replenished soon to support
noninflationary budget financing and build buffers for future shocks. Decisions on how to save and
invest NDFI resources should be better coordinated explicitly with macro policies and underpinned
by more explicit safeguards and transparency. Adopting a multi-year budget planning and
expanding the coverage of the general government should enhance the operational conduct,
monitoring, and accountability of fiscal policy, and thus limit fiscal risks. Staff encourages the
authorities to review how best to bring quasi-fiscal activities into the budget to make them explicit
so as to reform or discontinue them.
31.
The authorities’ intention to unify the foreign exchange market by mid-2015 is
welcome. In the transition, the authorities should manage the exchange rate flexibly in light of
external risks and still high inflation. The assessment of the official exchange rate is subject to an
unusual degree of uncertainty. In the current circumstances, the official exchange rate would be
moderately overvalued, with the bureau/parallel market rate closer to equilibrium. Staff
recommends Executive Board approval of the retention of the exchange restrictions and multiple
currency practices referred to in paragraph 20 since these are maintained for balance of payments
reasons, are nondiscriminatory, and are temporary in light of the authorities’ commitment to unify
the exchange rate regime and to remove the restrictions by mid-2015.
32.
The subsidy reform needs to proceed with the right supporting framework and
macroeconomic policies. Iran’s design of the subsidy reform has been exemplary and the reform
remains a priority. The implementation of the first phase has faced significant and varied difficulties
and there is a need to make the lessons known to the public. Plans to increase domestic prices
gradually are prudent but should be underpinned by an adjustment mechanism with strong political
backing to support full implementation. The proposed distribution of resources among households
and specific sectors presents a departure from the original design. The process for identifying and
excluding less vulnerable groups requires criteria that are simple, transparent, and perceived as fair.
In addition, the distribution of resources for supporting energy-intensive sectors needs to ensure
a framework that fosters the adoption of new technologies and tighter budget constraints. In
subsequent stages of the reform, transfers could be made more conditional on social goals and
tilted toward private savings for the broader population.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

33.
There is an urgent need to strengthen the Central Bank of Iran’s supervisory powers
and enforcement capacity. The CBI should be able to swiftly take action in case banks fail to abide
by regulatory standards. Staff welcomes the CBI’s initial steps toward a risk-based approach to
supervision. Staff shares the view of some market participants about the scope for leveling the field
of competition in the system through further privatization and reforms to government-mandated
credit policies. Current proposals to deal with nonperforming loans and recapitalize public banks
need to be supported by restructuring plans and reforms to enhance their risk management and
accountability. In terms of crisis preparedness, it would be important to strengthen the bank
resolution framework and putting the deposit guarantee fund on a sustainable financial footing.
34.
Reforms to improve the business environment and the labor market are
complementary and essential to restore stability and boost employment and growth. The
scope to improve the business environment is large and can provide a significant boost to
productivity and growth in the years ahead. Enhancing the enforcement of the rule of law and
property rights, maintaining policy and macroeconomic stability, and enhancing the transparency
of policy making are fundamental pillars that would also pave the way for taking advantage of the
growing foreign investor interest. Advancing reforms on AML/CFT would also help reinsert the
domestic financial system into the global economy, lower transaction costs, and provide an
important impetus to productivity. With large potential entrants to the labor force in the years
ahead, reforms are needed to facilitate the reallocation of labor across sectors and lower nonwage
labor costs. Staff encourages the authorities to review labor regulations to ease the rigidity of
contracts and nonwage costs.
35.
There is a good opportunity to improve the timeliness of official statistics publication
and to reaffirm the underlying methodology behind consumer price and unemployment data.
In recent years, the quality and timeliness of price and unemployment statistics have come under
increased scrutiny. The authorities have taken some steps under difficult circumstances, but there
is scope for further improvement in the reporting and timeliness of official statistics. Technical
assistance in these areas would help address these issues.
36.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Youth unemployment is high
and could rise significantly

enter the labor force. Social
conditions could deteriorate
markedly.
CBI financing for the Mehr
housing program. The
decision to discontinue CBI

Expected impact on the economy if risk is realized

High

Medium-High
The new administration has identified unemployment as
Iran’s biggest challenge. If the economy does not generate a
sufficient number of jobs, social conditions would worsen
and risk political support for reforms. In turn, preserving the
economic status quo would exacerbate weaknesses in the
corporate and financial sectors, undermining future growth
prospects. Hysteresis effects could become significant.
Medium-High
If the CBI were to be called upon to resume supporting the
program, it would undermine its efforts to stabilize money
growth and the exchange rate, contain aggregate demand, and
reduce inflation to low levels.

Medium

Medium

A large and prolonged
decline in global oil prices.
New energy sources may come
online sooner than expected, or
the global economy may enter
a new synchronized downturn,
depressing demand.

Low

Sharp slowdown in growth in
China.
The buildup of excess capacity
may eventually lead in large
financial and fiscal losses.

Medium

1

Medium–High
An intensification of sanctions on trade and financial
transactions would negatively affect oil production, reduce
external surpluses, and put downward pressure on the
exchange rate. Fiscal revenue would decline, triggering cuts in
capital spending with adverse consequences for growth.
Confidence in the private and financial sector may also fall, and
reliance on the informal sector might increase.
Medium–High
Oil export revenue has already about halved from its 2011 peak
following the tightening of economic sanctions. It is likely to
continue declining due to the current sanctions. Lower oil prices
would depress oil revenues further, which may require a new
round of import and expenditure cuts. To minimize the social
impact of the adjustment, fiscal and monetary policy may not
tighten sufficiently, fuelling inflation.
Low–Medium
China accounts for about 40 percent of all Iranian oil exports
since mid-2012. Given the constraints on exports, it would be
difficult to replace weaker demand from China with exports to
other destinations.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment
of the risks surrounding the baseline. The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern
as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Nonmutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix II. Illustrative Medium-Term Scenarios
These scenarios show that, in the absence of a sharp increase in oil prices or production and structural
reforms that fundamentally boost potential non-oil growth, Iran will continue to face significant
constraints in achieving sustainable growth and lower inflation.
1.
Baseline scenario: With sustained restrictions on oil exports and international financial
transactions, the external and fiscal accounts will continue to deteriorate over the medium term.
In response, the authorities will reduce expenditure to levels that yield manageable deficits and
stabilize inflation at relatively high levels. The exchange rate will depreciate in line with inflation,
with risks of periodic volatility and sharp real depreciation, while credit to the private sector will be
crowded out by credit to government linked to fiscal deficits. Non-oil growth stabilizes well below
potential. Relatively soft budget constraints in the corporate sector help to hoard labor, but
unemployment still rises, as low growth impedes job creation needed to absorb new entrants.

2.
Alternative scenario: Sanctions continue to ease in 2014/15. Oil production and exports
recover by about 1 million barrels per day by 2015/16, with oil output back to 2007 levels by
2017/18. Policies are adjusted to lessen the inflationary impact of the fiscal deficit. The exchange
rate is unified in 2015/16, around the current bureau/parallel market rate, supported by profit
(interest) rates that are aligned more closely with inflation. Non-oil tax revenues grow somewhat
faster than GDP, mostly benefiting from improved tax administration. However, there are no new
tax policy measures, which along with the continued net savings in the NDFI, constrain public
expenditures. These expenditures remain broadly in line with the path derived from a PIH rule.
Structural reforms, along with the use of NDFI resources, support private investment, a recovery
in non-oil growth and lower unemployment.

Appendix III. External Sustainability and Exchange Rate
Assessment
Models based on high-frequency data suggest that the rial remains above its estimated equilibrium
on a real effective basis, despite the significant depreciation in 2012. Likewise, the macroeconomic
balance approach for estimating current account norms of oil exporters also suggest that Iran’s
medium-term current account is slightly below its equilibrium level. In contrast, the external
sustainability approach indicates the opposite conclusion, finding that the medium-term current
account is above the norm. Staff believes that the worsened external environment in recent years and
the uncertainty about Iran’s external conditions in the future complicate estimates of current account
norms, clouding the assessment of the exchange rate.
1.
Iran’s current account surplus has declined markedly in recent years amid a
deteriorating external environment. Oil export receipts have declined by over 50 percent since
mid-2012, mostly reflecting a decline in oil export volume. Non-oil exports have remained broadly
unchanged. Imports have also decline markedly as a result of the real exchange rate depreciation
and higher costs of conducting international business. As a result, the current account surplus
declined from 11 percent of GDP in 2011/12 to 6.6 percent of GDP in 2012/13.
2.
External buffers still appear comfortable. Gross foreign exchange reserves stood at about
$110 billion, equivalent to 17 months of imports and 49 percent of broad money, at end-December
2013. However, difficulties in accessing the international payment system and making payments in
convertible currencies following the intensification of international sanctions in 2012 have affected
the liquidity and currency composition of foreign assets. External debt has declined to $7 billion
(6 percent of gross reserves), given difficulties in securing foreign credit for imports.

Iran’s real effective exchange rate depreciated significantly in 2012, but accelerating
domestic inflation has since reversed some of the decline. The Iranian authorities introduced a
three-tiered exchange rate system in September 2012. Imports of a few basic necessities such as
medicine remained at the unchanged

significantly more than the real effective
exchange on the official rate, but the trajectories have been similar. Both rates fell steeply in the
second half of 2012 amid the coming into effect of new economic sanctions against Iran. The

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

authorities ceased transacting at the most appreciated official rate in July 2013, making the FX
Center rate the official rate. Since the end of last year, accelerating inflation has pushed up the
REERs by more than 30 percent.
4.
The equilibrium real effective exchange rate approach analyzes the relationship
between Iran’s official exchange rate and economic fundamentals. Using monthly data, a vector
error-correction model estimates the long-run relationship between Iran’s real effective exchange
rate (REER) and oil prices and oil exports. Given observed values of the fundamentals, the model
predicts an equilibrium level of the REER in every period. In addition, the model can break down
movements in the equilibrium into changes in the fundamentals.
5.
The equilibrium approach suggests that the official real effective exchange rate was
overvalued despite the significant depreciation in 2012. The rial depreciated by about 50 percent
on a real effective basis in September 2012, when the authorities introduced a new depreciated
official rate applicable to most current account transactions. Meanwhile, however, the equilibrium
REER dropped even more sharply due to the steep fall in reported export volumes. The model
therefore suggests that the depreciation in 2012 reflected the marked deterioration in Iran’s external
environment. The value of the rial in the bureau/parallel market has remained about 20 percent
more depreciated than the official rate, providing another angle to examine the degree of exchange
rate misalignment.

6.
The external sustainability approach suggests the projected current account deficit in
the medium term (the underlying current account) is close to its sustainable level. Bems and
de Carvalho Filho’s (2009) present a methodology for estimating external sustainability for resourceintensive countries. In their framework, external positions are sustainable if import expenditure
equals the income stream derived from resource wealth. Applying this approach to Iran requires two
steps. First, to estimate Iran’s hydrocarbon wealth, staff assumes that export volumes of crude oil
remain constant from 2019 at a level that is three quarters below the average export volume in
2007–12. Gas export volumes grow by 2.4 percent per year from 2018, consistent with the U.S. EIA
2013 annual report. Assumptions about export prices are consistent with the Fall 2013 WEO
database. The discounted sum of all future hydrocarbon exports is then equal to $712 billion, an

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

estimate of Iran’s external hydrocarbon wealth. Second, to estimate the flow of income available for
import expenditures, the stock of resource wealth has to be converted into annuities. Two common
conversion methodologies exist—constant real per capita annuity and constant real annuity,
although the differences are very small in the case of Iran, given low population growth. The results
suggest that Iran’s projected (or underlying) current account balance is narrowly above the
sustainable levels of around –1 percent of GDP.
7.
The current account norms derived from the external sustainability approach are
sensitive to parameter choice. For example, if the nominal rate of return that discounts future
hydrocarbon export revenue increases from

8.
The macroeconomic balance approach also finds that Iran’s underlying current
account is close to its norm. However, unlike the external sustainability approach, the
macroeconomic balance approach suggests that Iran’s underlying current account is below the
norm. Following Beidas-Strom and Cashin (2011), the macroeconomic balance approach estimates
four main specifications of Iran’s equilibrium current account. The specifications differ as to whether
they include a lagged dependent variable and how they proxy resource wealth (see text table).
Specifications II and IV are the most appropriate for Iran as they capture the economic impact
of Iran’s significant oil and gas reserves. In contrast, specification I does not take into account that
Iran’s resource wealth surpasses current net foreign assets, and specification III carries a
counterintuitive sign on the contribution of oil and gas wealth to the current account norm. The
macroeconomic balance approach therefore puts the current account norm at about 4 percent
of GDP, which is above staff’s projected current account surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2019.
9.
The overall assessment of the rial is different in the alternative scenario, which
assumes a different external environment and reforms. In staff’s alternative scenario, oil exports
reach their pre-crisis levels by the end of next year, and keep growing to 2.5 million barrels per day
in 2019. At these levels of oil exports, the equilibrium REER would be significantly more appreciated,
suggesting that the rial is currently undervalued. The external sustainability approach would not
detect a misalignment, with the sustainable current account norms practically identical with the
underlying current account. Only the result of the macroeconomic balance approach would be
unchanged, with the current account norms significantly above staff’s projected current account in
the medium term of 1 percent of GDP. In sum, using inputs from the alternative scenario illustrates
that the exchange rate assessment hinges crucially on assumptions about the prospects of Iran’s
external environment.

Exchange System
The exchange rate is determined in the central bank’s foreign exchange trading center. The de jure
exchange rate arrangement has been a managed floating arrangement against a basket of
currencies since 2002. Since the rial continued to depreciate against the basket with some step
adjustments, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed
arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective May 1, 2011. With effect from September 6,
2004, the Islamic Republic of Iran accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Iran maintains exchange restrictions and multiple currency
practices subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3:
Exchange restrictions arise from (i) limitations on the availability of foreign exchange for travel and
studies abroad as well as for the payment for imports based on priority lists. Amounts in excess of
these limitations may only be purchased in the foreign exchange bureau market but at a more
depreciated exchange rate, and (ii) limitations on the transferability of rial profits from certain
investments under the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act and from limitations on
other investment-related current international payments under this act.
A Multiple currency practice, which also gives rise to an exchange restriction, arises from the
establishment of an official exchange rate for use in all exchange transactions, which in practice
differs by more than 2 percent from the rate used by foreign exchange bureaus.
A Multiple currency practice arises from the budget subsidies for foreign exchange purchases in
connection with payments of certain letters of credit opened prior to March 21, 2002 under the
previous multiple exchange rate system.

The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on July 20, 2011.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund is generally adequate for effective surveillance; however, the data have
been reported with significant delays, notwithstanding the recent improvement in timeliness. The
Central Bank of Iran (CBI) disseminates key statistical aggregates in its quarterly Economic Trends,
also available at <http://www.cbi.ir/e/>. Iran has participated in the International Monetary Fund’s
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since August 2012 by publishing comprehensive
information on the statistical production and dissemination practices on the IMF’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board. Iran, however, still needs to improve timeliness of data dissemination to
fully meet the GDDS standards.
Real sector statistics


National accounts statistics are reasonably sound but should be released in a timely manner.
There is scope for further progress, especially in the coverage of small-scale industries and
services, informal sector and calculation of sector based economic activity deflators. Also, the
CBI and the Statistical Center of Iran (SCI) could make further progress to review and unify their
respective GDP estimates.



Price statistics are methodologically sound and released in a timely manner. The official labor
market statistics are released by the SCI, and are based on the definitions by the International
Labor Organization (ILO). The data is based on an urban and rural population sample of about
60,000 households, and the threshold for considering a person employed is to have worked at
least one hour during the reference week. Labor market statistics, however, could benefit from
further improvement, particularly with regard to hours worked and wage data.

Government finance statistics


Fiscal statistics on budgetary central government operations are reasonably sound but should
be released in a timely manner.



The data are compiled in accordance with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001
(GFSM2001) for the budgetary central government operations. The data consist of a statement
of operations for budgetary central government operations and do not cover nonfinancial public
corporations. There is scope to improve coverage of fiscal reporting on general government by
including the nonfinancial public corporations sector data. In addition, regular reporting on the
financial activities of the National Development Fund and the Targeted Subsidy Organization
and their consolidation into the public sector accounts could help improve fiscal data coverage.
Under current presentation, the Targeted Subsidy Organization is considered as a public
corporation and is classified in the nonfinancial public corporations sector.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN



Data on central government operations cover the general budget, the special purpose funds,
and certain transactions with the Social Security Organization. These data are not consolidated.
There is a need to expand the coverage of central government to include the complete
transactions of the Social Security Organization, four pension funds, and five procurement and
distribution centers.



The existing cash-based government accounting system should be upgraded toward an accrual
accounting system or a modified cash accounting where noncash operations (such as advances
and arrears) are identified.



Financing data in the GFS are broken down by residency of debt holders and by type of debt
instruments according to GFSM 2001. However, there is a need to develop a comprehensive
database on domestic and external public debt and to align the coverage of the monetary data
with the coverage of the fiscal data.

Monetary statistics


Monthly monetary data are reported to STA for publication in IFS, but timeliness needs to be
improved.



Compilation of monetary statistics diverges from international standards in the application of
the residency criterion and in the sectorization and classification of accounts. The authorities are
undertaking improvements in each of these areas, in line with the recommendations of past STA
missions.



The measure of broad money employed by the CBI does not include deposits of public
nonfinancial corporations, local governments, or foreign-currency deposits of residents.

External sector data


The accounting system for foreign exchange receipts and payments of the CBI and banks is
being implemented in line with the methodological guidelines of the Fund’s Balance of
Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5).



Data on the international investment position are compiled, but not disseminated. Only data on
public and publicly guaranteed debt are disseminated, but classifications do not fully accord
with the guidelines of the External Debt Guide. The data template on international reserves and
foreign currency liquidity is not compiled.

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with the Islamic Republic of Iran
On March 28, 2014 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Iran had achieved considerable progress in raising per capita income and living standards in
previous decades. But in recent years, such progress stalled as both domestic policies and the
external environment deteriorated.
Macroeconomic performance worsened markedly following the subsidy reform in late 2010 and
the intensification of sanctions in 2012. The economy contracted by almost 6 percent in 2012/13
and 12-month inflation rose from about 12 percent in late 2010 to around 45 percent in July
2013. With the deterioration in the external environment in 2012, the authorities abandoned their
unified and managed exchange rate regime until they eventually unified the official exchange
rates again in June 2013. The balance of payments remained in surplus, but the current account
surplus declined to 6½ percent of GDP in 2012/13, almost halving from the year before. The
sharp fall in oil exports was the main factor, partly offset by import compression. The deficit of
the capital account remained contained, leaving the overall balance of payments in a surplus of
3½ percent of GDP in 2012/13. Gross foreign assets of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) rose to
about $105 billion by end-2012/13. The fiscal position also deteriorated significantly. With
about 10 percentage points of GDP decline in total revenues since 2010/11, the authorities cut
spending and the overall budget balance shifted from a surplus of 3 percent of GDP in 2010/11
to an estimated deficit of 1 percent of GDP in 2013/14. The deficit of the Targeted Subsidy
Organization remained high, bringing the expanded overall deficit to about 2¼ percent of GDP

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which

in 2013/14. Throughout these shocks, monetary conditions were relatively accommodative, as
domestic interest rates became increasingly negative in real terms. The financial system was
also adversely affected, particularly banks’ asset quality and profitability.
Since the Presidential election in mid-2013, there have been some signs of stability. The
exchange rate has appreciated markedly in the bureau/parallel market. The CBI has kept a lid on
base money growth thanks to tighter credit to the banking system and some fiscal consolidation,
and 12-month inflation has declined to about 29 percent in January 2014.
Looking ahead, the near-term outlook remains highly uncertain. Facing continued constrained
prospects for oil revenues and international financial transactions, the economy is envisaged to
remain stagnant in 2013/14, with real GDP estimated to decline by 1¾ percent. With some
positive tailwinds from the external side and some incipient signs that the pace of contraction in
domestic demand is slowing, it is projected that economic activity would begin to stabilize in
2014/15, with real GDP projected to increase by 1–2 percent. But the current outlook remains
highly uncertain and subject to downside risks. In the meantime, the authorities are taking steps
to make the regulatory framework for foreign investment in the oil sector more attractive, while
upside risks emanate from the interim agreement with the P5+1.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors acknowledged the difficult economic environment facing the Iranian
economy in recent years. While Directors were heartened by incipient signs of stabilization in
economic activity and the decline in inflation, they noted that the economic outlook remains
uncertain and subject to downside risks. They encouraged the authorities to continue
implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and advancing structural reforms to lay the basis
for sustained high growth and employment.
Directors emphasized that tight monetary policy, balanced fiscal consolidation, and supply-side
reforms are essential to deal with stagflation. They welcomed the removal of the financing of
the Mehr housing program from the Central Bank of Iran’s balance sheet, and encouraged the
authorities to seek long-term noninflationary financing for this program. Directors also

recommended increasing interest rates gradually to bring inflation down and anchor
expectations. They welcomed the measures to broaden the revenue base away from oil, as well
as the steps to strengthen tax administration and reduce exemptions.
Directors noted that institutional reforms to refocus the Central Bank of Iran’s mandate on price
stability are essential to entrench macroeconomic stability. Reforms to the fiscal policy
framework should strengthen its countercyclical role, limit risks, and enhance macroeconomic
policy coordination.
Directors took note of the staff assessment that the official exchange rate in real effective terms
appears to be somewhat overvalued relative to the level implied by medium-term fundamentals,
while recognizing the uncertainty surrounding that assessment. They welcomed the authorities’
intention to unify the foreign exchange market and remove restrictions, and encouraged the
authorities to manage the exchange rate flexibly in light of external risks and still high inflation.
Directors agreed that subsidy reform should proceed with the right supporting framework and
macroeconomic policies. They supported the authorities’ plans to increase domestic energy
prices gradually, while improving targeted cash transfers. Directors also noted that the reform
should foster the adoption of new technologies and tighter budget constraints in energyintensive sectors.
Directors urged the authorities to strengthen the central bank’s supervisory powers and
enforcement capacity. They encouraged the authorities to level the field of competition through
further privatization and reforms to government-mandated credit policies. Directors also agreed
that plans to deal with nonperforming loans and recapitalize public banks should be supported
by restructuring, enhanced risk management and accountability, a strengthened bank resolution
framework, and a financially-sound deposit guarantee fund.
Directors viewed improvements to the business environment as potentially providing a boost to
productivity and growth. They encouraged the authorities to review labor regulations to ease the
rigidity of contracts and nonwage costs. Strengthening the regime against money laundering and
the financing of terrorism would also help reinsert the domestic financial system into the global
economy, lower transaction costs, and increase productivity.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ recent steps to improve the timeliness of official statistics
and noted that there is scope for further improvements.

Statement by Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for Iran
March 28, 2014
My authorities thank staff for their hard work and the frank and candid discussions. They are in
broad agreement with staff on a wide range of issues, and intend to draw on the Fund’s policy
advice and technical assistance in moving forward with their reform strategy.
The government of President Rohani, which took office in June 2013, has strong political and
social support and a clear mandate to address the economic challenges ahead, including
containing inflation, promoting high and inclusive growth, increasing employment
opportunities, and reducing the economy’s dependence on oil. My authorities are committed to
steadfast implementation of ambitious reforms in several key areas, despite the enormous
obstacles posed by the international trade and financial sanctions. They have already taken steps
to reduce inflation, stabilize the exchange market, and prepare the groundwork for critical
structural reforms to strengthen the economy’s resilience to external shocks.
Overview
Since 2011, the Iranian economy has been exposed to two major domestic and external shocks,
namely the subsidy reform and international trade and financial sanctions, which were
compounded by weak macroeconomic management and inadequate policy response. These
developments, which are well rendered in the report, have led to a significant growth contraction
in 2012/13 and 2013/14, in connection with the intensification of the sanctions, and a sharp rise
in inflation, also reflecting accommodative fiscal and monetary policies and the large passthrough of the sizable exchange rate depreciation. Nonetheless, the economy has exhibited a
measure of resilience, given the magnitude of the shocks, and is expected to emerge from
recession in 2014/15 and grow by 1.5 percent in real terms. Year-on-year CPI inflation, which
doubled in 2012/13 to 41 percent, has been declining since then, and is estimated at about
23 percent in February 2014 in line with the Central Bank of Iran’s (CBI) effort to contain the
growth of base money. Moreover, the external current account balance has remained in surplus,
gross international reserves have increased, and external debt has remained negligible.
The new government has firmly moved in the direction of easing external constraints and
addressing the many economic, financial, and social challenges ahead. High priority is given to

2
reducing inflation, unifying the exchange rates, completing the subsidy reform, improving fiscal
management, strengthening the banking system, and embarking on critical structural reforms to
invigorate growth and increase employment. Despite the new government’s initial efforts,
including fiscal and monetary discipline, and constructive engagement with the outside world, it
may take some time to achieve macroeconomic stability and set the economy on a path of high
growth and employment creation.
Addressing stagflation
The authorities agree on the strategy to address stagflation through tight monetary policy, fiscal
consolidation, and structural reforms to improve supply response. They plan to lower the
average CPI inflation from 35 percent to 23 percent in a year’s time, notwithstanding the
potential impact from the second phase of the subsidy reform, and have already taken steps to
this effect through a tight control of base money and terminating the financing of the large
housing program (Mehr) by CBI. The authorities agree that bringing profit rates more in line
with inflation would help address some difficulties in credit markets and enable the CBI to
better manage liquidity. They intend to issue CBI participation papers to contain money growth.
While there are concerns about output costs and second-round effects from the planned increase
in domestic energy prices, staff and authorities concur that a gradual monetary policy tightening
will limit these effects, in line with the SIP findings about the inflation-output trade-off in Iran.
Ensuring a successful disinflation strategy also requires a comprehensive reform of the
monetary policy framework, including strengthening the price stability mandate of the CBI and
enhancing its operational independence, on which consensus within the government is growing.
My authorities are open to examining all options in this area in conformity with Iran’s
institutional setting.
Since the successful exchange rate unification in 2002, Iran has adopted a managed float
exchange rate regime, eliminated most exchange rate restrictions for current transactions, and
liberalized some capital movements. Progress in this area, however, has been set back in recent
years, and a large premium has emerged in the bureau/parallel market compared to the official
exchange rate. The authorities are committed to unifying the official and bureau/parallel
exchange rates by mid-2015, notwithstanding the complexity of the task given external
environment constraints. Difficulties in accessing foreign exchange have also resulted in the

3
emergence of arrears on external payments by public and private sector entities. The authorities
are prepared to clear these arrears with foreign assets held abroad, and to eliminate foreign
exchange restrictions and related arrears.
On the supply side, trade and financial sanctions involve drastic physical limitations to output
and exports, as well as high production costs stemming from shortages of inputs and foreign
exchange. These severe constraints, which cannot be easily overcome by increased productivity
or competitiveness, have not allowed the economy to fully benefit from the change in relative
prices induced by exchange rate deprecation, as would be the case under normal circumstances.
Nonetheless, the authorities’ reform agenda includes wide-ranging structural reforms to improve
the business environment, enhance economic efficiency, and raise growth to absorb new
entrants to the labor market.
Fiscal policy
With a significant loss of budget oil revenue due to international sanctions since 2010/11, the
fiscal situation deteriorated in 2012/13 and 2013/14, despite sizable cuts in both capital and
current spending. The overall fiscal balance shifted from a surplus of 3 percent of GDP in
2010/11 to a deficit estimated at 1 percent of GDP in 2013/14. Adding the cash deficit of the
Targeted Subsidies Organization (TSO) raises the expanded deficit to 2¼ percent of GDP.
The 2014/15 budget bill approved on February 6, 2014, seeks to maintain the expanded deficit at
around 2½ percent of GDP (the second phase of subsidy reform should eliminate the TSO
deficit) to continue to support the economy while taking steps to broaden the revenue base away
from oil, prioritizing capital spending, and containing the growth of current spending. Total
spending growth is significantly reduced compared with the previous budget. The VAT rate was
increased from 6 to 8 percent and the authorities intend to raise it further to 10 percent one year
ahead of schedule. The tax law will be reviewed and tax incentives for certain activities and for
large statutory bodies will be reduced. Moreover, capital gains tax on equity investments and
real estate are to be introduced, the tax administration is proceeding with the implementation of
an integrated tax system, and efforts are underway to strengthen compliance. These efforts
would increasingly allow current spending to be covered by tax revenue rather than oil revenues,
which would be mostly allocated to capital spending.

4
Subsidy reform
The landmark targeted subsidy reform (TSR), which was launched in December 2010, initiated
a major shift in a decades-old subsidy system that was very costly and inefficient. The TSR
aimed at replacing subsidies with targeted cash transfers to households, and providing assistance
to enterprises and the government to adjust to the cost of high energy bills. After initial success
in the first phase of the reform, shortcomings in implementation and mounting economic
difficulties, including large depreciation of the nominal exchange rate, led to the postponement
of the second phase in mid-2012. Staff assessment of this important reform in terms of its
economic impact and its implementation, as well as the lessons to be drawn from such
experience, is well articulated in the useful SIP, and my authorities will give them adequate
attention in formulating next steps.
The authorities are committed to pursuing the reform, but with adjustments aimed at improving
the targeting of the most vulnerable households through better identification and means testing
of beneficiaries. The corporate sector will be encouraged to save energy, including the increased
use of less energy-intensive technology, and will be subjected to tighter budget constraints. With
strong political backing for gradually increasing domestic prices, in early February 2014,
Parliament approved plans to cut subsidies on fuel and food, but delayed implementation to
allow the authorities to mitigate the impact on consumers. In an effort to reduce the subsidies’
burden on the budget and improve the cash flow of the reform, the 2014/15 budget calls for
savings of about 2 percent of GDP in subsidy payments.
Financial Sector
Iran’s financial system has been adversely affected by the sanctions and by distortive
government-mandated credit policies, together with weakened risk management and incentives
for adequate supervision, which resulted in high non-performing loans (NPL), low profitability,
and weak credit growth. Efforts to address these problems include strengthening the CBI’s
supervisory powers and extending them to all banks and financial institutions. Non-bank credit
institutions have been encouraged to consolidate and apply for a banking license. In order to
strengthen risk management and compliance with prudential limits, senior management at stateowned banks have been replaced, and consideration is being given to subjecting these banks to
better accounting and provisioning standards. In addition, steps are underway to restructure and

5
recapitalize public banks to make them more robust financially. Private banks which have
continued to exhibit a relatively better situation, are also strengthening their capital base. With
regard to the rise in NPL, the authorities intend to continue to monitor the situation closely and
will take additional measures, as needed, to strengthen banks’ balance sheets.
Medium-term outlook and structural reforms
The authorities agree that the lifting of the restrictions on oil exports and international financial
transactions, as well as stepped-up implementation of critical reforms will shape Iran’s mediumterm outlook. Quantification of the outlook, however, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty,
and assumptions underlying the scenarios are not necessarily binary, i.e. reforms and lifting of
sanctions take place together (alternative scenario), or do not (baseline scenario). The authorities
are determined to move forward with their reform agenda to the full extent possible regardless
of whether current international restrictions are partially or fully eliminated. Under the
circumstances, authorities believe that with the right policies and reform, Iran has the potential
to achieve growth rates exceeding those stated in the staff alternative scenario.
Deepening structural reforms will be critical to promote higher sustainable growth and increase
employment opportunities, and remains a key objective of the authorities’ medium-term
strategy. Various initiatives have been taken to promote private sector activity and employment,
including simplifying administrative procedures under the ‘Law for Continued Improvement of
the Business Environment” and taking steps to improve the privatization process. The
authorities are aware of the need to raise the employment content of growth by making the labor
market more responsive to changing conditions in the economy, including improving labor skills
and addressing other labor market rigidities. They remain committed to promoting private sector
investment and attracting FDI to facilitate technology transfer and enhance efficiency. Further
efforts would also be made toward improving corporate governance and deepening domestic
capital markets, which the authorities view as critical to promote efficient long-term financing
of the economy.

6
Other issues
Progress on strengthening the AML regulatory framework has been made, most notably the
adoption by the AML High Council of 14 new AML instructions, the establishment of an
economic crime prosecutor office, and a defined roadmap for improving the AML system. The
CFT bill has been approved by Parliament, and since it includes criminalization and punishment
issues, it has been forwarded to the judiciary for an opinion. Recommendations have been made
to make the bill more compliant with best international practice, and it is expected to have the
judiciary’s opinion before end-2014.
On statistical issues, the authorities remain confident that their system is consistent with best
international practice and are considering Fund TA to help reaffirm the underlying
methodologies.
Conclusion
Overall, my authorities face daunting challenges of addressing the multi-layered reforms that are
needed to set the economy anew on a path of macroeconomic stability and high growth in a
highly unfavorable external environment. While the task will be arduous, and will require buy-in
and strong social support, the authorities are firmly determined to see through this difficult
period and look forward to continued close cooperation with the Fund in support of their reform
strategy.
