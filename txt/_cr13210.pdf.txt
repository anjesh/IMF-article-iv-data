STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 28, 2013

KEY ISSUES
The economy remains a long way from a strong and sustainable recovery. Despite
recent improvements in economic and financial conditions, recovery will be protracted.
Domestic deleveraging pressures remain, while external demand is still weak. Looking
ahead, activity is expected to pick up only gradually. Risks remain to the downside, with
the key risk being permanent damage to the economy’s productive potential.
A multi-pronged policy strategy is needed. Securing growth momentum and
rebalancing the economy are vital to boost incomes and income expectations, ensure
the sustainability of public debt, and support bank balance sheets. A multi-pronged
policy strategy is thus needed to address both demand and supply constraints that the
economy faces. In particular:


Monetary policy will need to remain accommodative, but expectations of its effects
should be tempered. In addition to further purchases of gilts, the BoE could provide
reassurance that policy rates will remain low until recovery reaches full momentum.



An expeditious repair of bank balance sheets is imperative, along with an elaboration
of a clear strategy for the two state-intervened banks, including returning them to
private ownership.



It is essential to offset the drag from planned near-term fiscal tightening, notably by
bringing forward capital investment, while preserving the medium-term framework.



Structural reforms need to be accelerated to improve the economy’s skills base,
infrastructure, and competitiveness.

Financial sector reforms need to build on recent progress. The stability of the UK
financial system is a global public good. Recent reforms are promising, but more is
needed to ensure the resilience of the system. In particular:


It is critical that coordination between the FPC and PRA is strengthened, especially in
the context of planned bank stress tests, to help alleviate regulatory uncertainty.



The PRA needs to be adequately resourced and its operational independence
ensured, to support an intensive and intrusive supervision of the financial system.



The FPC’s independence should be ensured and its toolkit expanded, so that it is
well equipped to deliver on its mandate of promoting financial stability.



Structural banking reform measures need to be coordinated internationally,
importantly to address the issue of “too important to fail”.

THE FOCUS OF THE CONSULTATION
1.
The recovery remains fragile, held back by deleveraging, impaired credit creation,
and weak external demand. Growth is expected to be stronger in 2013 than in 2012, but
nonetheless modest, and will be insufficient to substantially close the large negative output gap.
The more growth disappoints, the greater the risk of permanent damage to potential growth.
Hence, growth is the priority, and macroeconomic policy support for demand in the near term
continues to be vital. To ensure that growth is durable and robust, over the medium term the
economy needs to rebalance, away from public support to private demand, and away from
reliance on the domestic consumer to external demand.
2.
The consultation focused on policies to secure strong and better balanced growth.
This report responds to two basic questions: first, what is holding back the UK economy, and,
second, what policies are needed to stimulate growth and promote the necessary rebalancing?

THE RECOVERY REMAINS WEAK
Activity is still sluggish, but recent developments are encouraging
3.
Growth substantially disappointed in 2012. The UK economy grew by about
¼ percent in 2012. Net trade reduced growth by 0.6 percentage points of GDP, the biggest drag
since 2005, and well above staff projections. Domestic fixed capital investment was essentially flat,
leaving household spending the main source of private demand, but still substantially below
long-run potential growth. In terms of production, construction has been particularly affected by
the financial crisis, and the mining sector has been experiencing a secular decline, accelerated in
part by temporary shut-downs in North Sea oil extraction. Output of financial services has
gradually declined, such that its share of value added is now at levels of a decade ago. But the
overall trend of weak growth cannot be exclusively attributed to these factors.

4.
Recent data suggest some improvement in economic conditions. Purchasing
indicators, demand for vehicles, and consumer and business sentiment surveys indicate an uptick
in activity (see Figure 1). In addition, there are signs that the drag from construction and trade
might prove to be less than last year. And there have been some upward revisions to measured
output that, although small, eliminated the “double dip” in growth. Coming after disappointing
growth in 2012, such promising news is encouraging.
5.
Financial market conditions also improved, but volatility has returned. Funding costs
for banks and large firms had fallen significantly from the elevated levels seen during the
summer of 2012. Equity markets had recovered strongly, with the FTSE All Share index nearly at
the previous peak in April 2007, and prices of bank stocks rebounding. In May and June, markets
have sold off, and conditions could remain volatile as markets seek direction about likely future
returns and policy measures. Meanwhile, corporate bond issuance has been healthy, easing
financing constraints for large firms. And the housing market is showing some signs of recovery,
with house prices rebounding, reflecting a steady rise in the pace of new house orders and
market transactions. Commercial real estate prices, however, remain depressed at levels last seen
a decade ago, to the detriment of banks’ balance sheets and firms’ ability to borrow.

The labor market has performed
somewhat better than the goods market (Figure 2).
Employment is now slightly above its pre-crisis level,
led by a notable change in the composition of the
workforce—while public employment has declined
by 4 percent (0.3 million workers) from its 2010 peak,
private employment has increased by 5 percent
(1.0 million workers) in the same period, most
employment creation after 2007 is explained by a
rise in part-time workers offset by a decline in fulltime workers. In addition, labor market participation
has increased somewhat, because of changes in
marginal tax and benefit incentives and older
cohorts seeking to boost retirement savings.

Recovery will be protracted
7.
But the UK economy remains a long way from a strong and sustainable recovery.
Notwithstanding the recent uptick in activity, per capita income remains 6.5 percent below its precrisis peak, making this the weakest recovery in recent UK history. Even with the advantages of an
independent monetary policy and a flexible exchange rate regime, output has been slow to
recover. And GDP is well below the level implied by the pre-crisis trend—around 14 percent in real
terms. Moreover, unemployment is still elevated, at 7.8 percent, while youth unemployment is
21 percent, higher than the OECD average.

Measured labor productivity growth has collapsed. With output growth so weak and
employment relatively resilient, the growth rate of output per worker has plunged. No single
explanation appears to fully explain the decrease in labor productivity growth, but it reflects, at
least in part, a substitution of labor for capital, given the sharp decline in real wages, and a
sectoral reallocation of labor towards less productive sectors (see Annex 1).

The output gap remains negative and large. The output gap is more-than-usually
difficult to quantify. Some firms report increasing shortages of skilled labor, and some sectors
(notably finance and construction) might still be in the process of returning to more sustainable
levels of output.1 But still-high unemployment and weak wage growth points to an economy
operating well below capacity. Staff estimates the gap to be just above 3 percent, broadly in line
with other institutions’ estimates.2 The gap between the level implied by the pre-crisis trend and
current output is larger than the output gap, implying that the estimated level of potential is some
way below the trend line, but most of the shortfall in output is attributable to insufficient demand.
The economy is struggling to rebalance
10.
A key factor in the weakness of the recovery is the struggle to rebalance. In the
medium term, the economy needs to move away from public support toward private demand.
Similarly, to ensure balanced growth, the economy

Limited progress in domestic demand
rebalancing reflects household balance sheet

how long the drag from household debt will remain.
Monetary policy easing has substantially reduced

For example, output of financial services has declined by 8 percent from its peak in 2009. Although this is a
substantial decrease, taken as a share of gross value added, the output of the sector is still at the same level as in

the boom years. And, as noted above, asset prices have been recovering overall. Yet it appears
that the level of debt remains a significant constraint on spending for a sizeable proportion of
households, especially given the uncertainty concerning future employment prospects. In
aggregate, the ratio of household debt to disposable income has fallen by 26 percentage points
(from 167 to 141 percent), but this level remains substantially above historical averages,
suggesting that saving rates could remain elevated for perhaps 2 to 3 more years (see Annex 2).
12.
Firms have added to saving pressure, at the expense of investment. Corporate
balance sheets were relatively healthy overall going into the crisis, and corporate savings have
increased further thereafter.3 Concomitantly, business investment has fallen substantially during
the crisis: total investment as a share of GDP has fallen from 18 to 14 percent of GDP since 2007.4

The financial sector has also attempted to reduce leverage following the crisis. The
Funding for Lending Scheme and European policy actions have reduced bank funding costs,
mitigating emerging problems on the liabilities side of bank balance sheets (see Annex 5). But
problems remain with poor asset quality (particularly associated with commercial real estate) and
significant lender forbearance. Banks with such problems are reluctant to lend, especially to firms
and households with poor collateral. Hence banks lie at the heart of the paradox of thrift—as
weakness in the real economy persists, banks reduce leverage further, constraining lending and
activity.

External rebalancing is being held back by competitiveness problems and other
structural weaknesses, amplified by cyclical factors. Rebalancing toward export-led growth

Some of the measured increase in non-financial corporate saving balances might in fact be attributable to
activities by financial firms, but it appears that this cannot account for all of it. The increase is also corroborated
by increases in working capital (see Annex 4).

has been disappointing, especially given the 18 percent depreciation in sterling since the start of
2007.5 Limited progress in external rebalancing reflects structural weaknesses in the economy—
including poor diversification of exports and export markets and a large reliance on financial
services. This has been amplified by cyclical factors, including a decline in the terms of trade,
weak external demand, and a lack of competitiveness (as indicated by relatively high unit labor
costs), owing to a decline in productivity (see Annex 3). Previous historical episodes of external
rebalancing in the UK and OECD countries have been associated with increases in labor
productivity growth—suggesting that it will be difficult for the UK to improve its external balance
unless there is an improvement in productivity and competitiveness.

The exchange rate appears moderately overvalued. Staff estimates sterling to be
overvalued by about 5–10 percent. After depreciating strongly in 2007 and 2008, sterling
gradually appreciated (see Figure 3), and at the time of the 2012 Article IV consultation was
assessed to be moderately overvalued. Since then, the nominal exchange rate has depreciated,
but inflation in the UK has been higher than in trading partners, implying that a modest
overvaluation remains. This assessment is broadly consistent with model-based estimates of
medium-term fundamentals of the exchange rate and current account.6 A further depreciation of
5–10 percent would be consistent with narrowing the current account deficit from its current
level of nearly 4 percent of GDP to a level consistent with medium-term fundamentals. However,
although nominal exchange rate depreciation could facilitate a useful shift in the terms of trade,
a durable restoration of competitiveness will require increasing productivity growth.
5

During the period 1992–96—a notable previous episode of external adjustment—the exchange rate
depreciated and stabilized (see Annex 3). By contrast, the exchange rate has been less stable during 2008–11. In
particular, following the steep depreciation of sterling in 2007 and 2008, “safe haven” inflows of capital during
the euro area crisis resulted in a small appreciation of the sterling. This appreciation may have raised uncertainty
about future terms of trade and mitigated the effects of the earlier depreciation. Subsequently, the exchange rate
has depreciated again during 2013.
6

The EBA estimates imply that the current account is currently 2.3 percent weaker than implied by medium-term
fundamentals, but that the real exchange rate is 2.8 percent undervalued. The CGER methodology indicates an
exchange rate overvaluation of up to 12 percent using the external sustainability and macroeconomic balance
approaches, and a 10 percent undervaluation using the REER approach.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
Recovery will be gradual, with risks tilted to the downside
16.
The economy is projected to recover slowly, under current policy settings. Staff
expects growth of around 0.9 percent in 2013, and an annual average of about 1¾ percent over
the medium-term. This projection assumes that the crisis in the euro area will not re-intensify,
that overall external demand gradually strengthens, and that credit conditions will improve.
Nonetheless, ongoing headwinds from fiscal consolidation, private-sector deleveraging, and
depressed demand from the euro area and some emerging markets will limit the pace of
recovery. Domestic demand is expected to continue to contribute to positive growth, while net
trade, after acting as a small drag in 2013, makes a modest contribution to growth over the
medium term (see Table 2).

The output gap is expected to remain
substantial, raising the risk of hysteresis effects.
With weak growth projected in the medium term, the
output gap is projected to persist for several years,
remaining around 2 percent in 2018, a profile similar to
that projected by the Office for Budget Responsibility.
The projection assumes that the negative output gap
does not generate hysteresis effects on potential, which
would imply less flexibility for loose monetary
conditions and a larger structural fiscal deficit.7

Headline inflation is high, but is expected to gradually decline to the 2 percent
target. CPI inflation has remained stubbornly above the 2 percent target (currently 2.7 percent),
owing largely to increases in administered and policy-driven prices (such as energy and tuition).
But underlying inflation is modest—exempting administered prices, inflation is below the target,
and nominal wage growth remains very weak. Inflation expectations do not indicate substantial
risks to price stability: market-based expectations are in line with levels seen before the crisis,
and survey-based expectations have fallen after having risen from 2009 to 2011. Although the
impact of new administered price increases could take some time to work through, staff projects
that headline inflation will fall below the target of 2 percent by 2017, assuming an unchanged
monetary and fiscal policy stance.

Risks to the outlook remain to the downside.



The key risk is that persistent slow growth permanently damages medium-term growth
prospects. This could arise if private sector deleveraging is larger than expected, credit
conditions fail to improve, external demand does not pick up, and the drag from fiscal
consolidation is greater than anticipated. Longer-than-anticipated weakness in aggregate
demand could lead to further declines in investment in capital goods and human capital,
implying lower growth for an extended period.



Risk remains that financial stress in the euro area re-emerges and there is a protracted period
of slower growth. Despite recent market calm, growth in the euro area is likely to be weak,
and the re-emergence of market tensions cannot be ruled out, with the potential for
continued spillovers to the UK from depressed exports, higher bank losses and funding costs,
and reduced confidence.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS
A multi-pronged policy strategy is needed
20.
Restoring growth momentum and rebalancing the economy is vital. Strong growth is
needed to restore incomes, ensure the sustainability of public debt, and support bank balance
sheets. For long-term prosperity and resilience against future shocks, the economy has to be
diversified and not reliant on domestic consumption. These imperatives have supply as well as
demand dimensions—after five years of relatively weak activity, additional measures are needed
to raise long-term expectations of potential growth, while rebalancing necessitates a
transformation to a high-investment and more export-oriented economy.
21.
Policy remedies to restore growth and rebalance the economy are not
straightforward. Monetary policy is effectively at the zero bound; banks’ health needs
strengthening through building capital buffers, but in a way that does not reduce credit; and
public debt is rising, but the consolidation to address this will be a drag on growth. This implies
that no one policy lever will be sufficient; hence, there is a need for a coordinated multi-pronged
strategy to guide the economy to greater and more balanced growth.
22.
Appropriate policies could have important benefits for other economies as well as
the UK. Simulations of a package of complementary and balanced policies—monetary and fiscal
support for demand, including targeted expenditures on public investment, and structural
reforms to raise productivity and the labor force—show that there are important potential gains
to the UK and other countries. Importantly, although monetary easing is likely associated with

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

UNITED KINGDOM

sterling depreciation, the net demand effect dominates, and all economies experience increases
in their own incomes, even if their exchange rates appreciate.8

MONETARY AND CREDIT EASING POLICIES
Notwithstanding bold action, transmission of monetary policy has been weak
23.
Monetary policy in the UK has appropriately been highly accommodative. The Bank
of England (BoE) has implemented a number of measures:


The BoE lowered the policy rate aggressively (currently at 0.5 percent), despite headline
inflation being above target for an extended period.



From January 2009, the BoE has engaged in Quantitative Easing (now amounting to £375
billion, about ¼ of nominal GDP), bypassing the banking system to lower long-term rates
and stimulate asset prices.



In July 2012, the BoE, jointly with Her Majesty’s Treasury (HMT), initiated the Funding for
Lending Scheme (FLS), aimed at lowering funding costs for banks and boosting credit supply.
In April 2013, the scheme’s duration was extended by one year, to January 2015, and its
pricing structure modified to strengthen incentives for banks and nonbanks to lend to SMEs.

24.
The March 2013 Budget provided a new remit for the Monetary Policy Committee
(MPC). The remit reaffirms that the central objective of monetary policy is to meet the inflation
target of 2 percent per year. It also clarifies the government’s expectations of the MPC about
communicating the tradeoffs between inflation and growth, explicitly permits the use of
unconventional policies, and requests the BoE to explore the use of thresholds to guide policy
(see Box 2).
25.

The transmission of monetary policy has, however, been weak.



Notwithstanding ample and cheap liquidity, the transmission to retail rates has only been
partially successful. Mortgage rates have fallen considerably, lowering household debt
servicing costs. However, spreads of other assets classes remain elevated or even higher than
before the crisis, notably for lending to SMEs, as they are unable to post high-quality
collateral as security.9



Despite a substantial increase in broad money (excluding intermediate other financial
corporations), the transmission to lending has been unusually weak. Patterns in lending, rates

and spreads, as well as surveys of lenders and borrowers indicate that demand and supply
problems are both important in credit markets. Banks have endeavored to reduce leverage—
while some non-core deleveraging has been desirable, credit more generally has also
suffered, with reduced risk appetite particularly affecting riskier borrowers. But, just as
importantly, borrowers have been deterred from drawing on credit by weak growth
expectations and, anecdotally, increased caution about the stability of prospective
relationships with banks. Firms have notably relied increasingly on retained earnings and
built up unusually high levels of working capital, at a cost to investment (see Annex 4).
Maintain accommodation, but temper expectations of effectiveness
26.
Monetary policy should remain accommodative. The continued underperformance of
the economy, reflected in the persistent output gap, calls for the accommodative stance to be
maintained for an extended period. Because underlying inflation pressures are expected to
remain subdued, there is no immediate risk of the credibility of the monetary policy framework
being eroded.10 A broad set of tools could be considered:

QE. The BoE should consider further purchases of gilts. Studies by staff and at the BoE have
found that quantitative easing has reduced yields on long maturity government bonds, with
positive effects on asset prices. There is no clear evidence to suggest that the effectiveness of
QE—in the narrow sense of affecting gilt prices and expanding broad money—has
diminished over time. However, the transmission of broad money to credit has been weak
(see ¶27 and Annex 4).

10

The use of unconventional tools raises the issue of risks to the central bank’s independence, a common
perception being that monetary policy would become subjugated to fiscal policy if the Bank’s balance sheet
deteriorates sufficiently. The Asset Purchase Facility—the subsidiary of the Bank of England set up to facilitate
QE—is fully indemnified for all losses by the Treasury, and hence any gains or losses are due to the Exchequer.
The Funding for Lending Scheme is not indemnified. But even without indemnification, the right measure for
operational independence is not the net worth of the central bank but whether (the net present value of)
operating expenses is greater than (the net present value of) revenues (mainly seigniorage). On this basis, the
Bank has considerable room for asset purchases (but see ¶54).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

UNITED KINGDOM

Box 2. United Kingdom: Forward Guidance
The changes to the MPC’s remit raise the possibility of the BoE using explicit forward guidance on policy
rates as a tool of monetary policy, potentially with explicit thresholds to signal when rates would be
changed.
Forward guidance covers a range of possibilities. At one level, a central bank could be transparent about
what it sees as the likely path of policy rates to achieve its policy target, based on its assessment of the
current state of the economy. Another level would be to commit to a path for policy rates, whether for some
period of time or guided by a limited number of threshold conditions (such as the level of unemployment or
growth in a nominal variable such as incomes).
The case for greater transparency about future rates
Monetary policy transparency in the UK is relatively high, aided by a thorough explanation of views of the
state of the economy in the quarterly Inflation Report. However, projections for inflation and output are
conditioned on market expectations, and have to be “inverted” for private agents to infer the desired
interest rate path. Currently, markets do not expect rates to rise until 2016. However, there is a potential risk
that households and firms might anticipate that long interest rates increase faster than the Committee
would desire, especially if other economies raise rates earlier. Greater transparency about future policy rates
could therefore be a useful tool.
Forward guidance as demand stimulus
Another argument for forward guidance is that the promise of lower expected rates—whether by lower
nominal rates or higher future inflation—would induce private agents to bring forward demand. This rests
on some crucial assumptions: first, that private agents respond now to future interest rate reductions, and
that they perceive the policy-maker’s promise to be credible. In a situation in which agents are credit
constrained, as currently, the effectiveness of forward guidance will be reduced. Hence, as with other
monetary policy tools, complementary financial policies to restore credit intermediation are needed for this
mechanism to be fully effective.
Commitment and thresholds
The central bank could take forward guidance a step further by binding its own actions based on specific
criteria. The bank could commit to keep rates at a certain level for a period of time, or until an economic
condition(s) is satisfied (in the case of the Federal Reserve, until unemployment is below 6.5 percent and
inflation remains anchored). The central bank needs to assess the disadvantages of tying its own hands and
the benefits of making the promised rate path credible. Thresholds also need to be easily communicable—
well-known, accurate and timely—while also a sufficiently broad to summarize the overall state of the
economy. And any particular threshold would probably need to be supplemented with one or two other
conditions—such as inflation and financial stability—to cope with unforeseen shocks.



18

Forward guidance. In a situation such as currently faced by the UK, assurance by the central
bank that policy rates will be kept low as the economy reaches full momentum can play a
useful role; however, it is unlikely that this by itself could instigate a recovery (see Box 2).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM



Purchase of private sector assets.11 The sizes of these markets are relatively small, because of
which the broad money creation effect would be small. However, concomitantly, small
purchases by the BoE could have a material impact on the prices of such assets. In the cases
of covered bonds and securitized SME lending, a secure source of demand could play a
useful role in making issuance of such instruments more viable.



Policy rate cut. In principle, the Bank rate could be cut further. However, with a large quantity
of bank loans automatically linked to the policy rate, bank profitability could suffer, further
inhibiting loan growth. Hence, such a step would need to be considered carefully.



Modifying the FLS. If draw-downs from the FLS and credit creation remain weak, authorities
should examine whether current collateral requirements and haircuts (which are currently set
to match the discount window rate) are appropriate

27.
But the effectiveness of monetary policy is limited by weak banks and final
demand, making support from financial and fiscal policies vital. The effectiveness of
accommodative monetary policy is dependent on the health of the banking system and the
demand for credit. Hence, implementation of financial policies to strengthen banks’ health and
fiscal and structural measures to boost expectations of long-term incomes are necessary to give
monetary policy greater traction. This is particularly important since private domestic
deleveraging pressures (on both households and banks) have proven stronger than previously
anticipated, and the response of net trade has disappointed.

FINANCIAL SECTOR POLICIES
Repairing bank balance sheets is crucial
28.
Financial sector repair has advanced, aided by European and national policies. UK
banks’ funding costs fell sharply following the EU Summit, OMT and FLS announcements in
2012Q3. Banks have also reduced their reliance on wholesale funding, taking advantage of the
ample supply of deposits. Noncore deleveraging has progressed well, regulatory capital
adequacy ratios continue to edge up, and profitability—which had been dented by large conduct
costs in 2012—has improved somewhat in the first quarter of 2013 (see Box 3 and Figure 5).
29.
But banks are still not restored to healthy functionality. Significant asset quality
problems linger on banks’ balance sheets: the share of non-performing loans is high, especially
at the two government-intervened banks, and there are concerns about lender forbearance on

and tangible capital—to buffer against these risks—has slowed since 2009. In general, the health
indicators of UK banks are better than those of their EU peers, but markedly worse than those of
US banks (see Figure 6). Finally, the outlook for profitability is depressed due to regulatory
uncertainty about anticipated structural and price-based measures, and the impact of the new
“conduct” environment on banks’ ability to pursue fee-yielding products. Against this backdrop,
banks have been unwilling to expand lending to businesses, especially the riskier SMEs.

30.
An expeditious repair of bank balance
sheets is imperative for a durable resumption
in lending. As discussed in the previous section,
fully-functioning credit markets are crucial for
monetary transmission. Moreover, the US postcrisis experience demonstrates well the benefits
for credit markets and the economy of: (i) an
early and comprehensive treatment of banks’
asset quality problems (including through
adequate provisioning for expected losses); (ii) a
focus on tangible capital-building; and (iii)
credible stress tests, backed by supervisorapproved capital plans for major banks.

31.
To this end, the authorities have recently conducted an Asset Quality Review (AQR)
and laid out plans to strengthen banks’ capital positions.


Commissioned by the Financial Policy Committee (FPC, the macro-prudential authority), the
March 2013 AQR determined that banks’ capital positions, as of end-2012, were overstated
by £52 billion—this was attributed to under-provisioning for expected credit and trading
book valuation losses (£30 billion) and conduct costs (£10 billion), and the overstatement of
capital ratios resulting from an aggressive use of risk weights (£12 billion).



The estimated capital shortfall, however, is £27 billion when assessed against the FPC’s
preferred end-2013 benchmark of a 7 percent fully-loaded Basel-III common equity tier 1
capital ratio, computed after making appropriate adjustments for expected loan losses and
conduct costs over the next three-years, and for prudent risk weights.



The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) has announced the distribution of this shortfall
across major banks (£13.6 billion for RBS, £8.6 billion for LBG, and £3 billion for Barclays) and
has discussed individual banks’ capital-raising plans to meet the shortfall.13 The authorities
have also announced their intention to launch system-wide stress tests, on an annual basis,
from 2014 onward.

13

In addition, the PRA has published (for the first time) banks’ common equity tier 1 leverage ratios, with a view
to ensuring they do not fall below the 3 percent Basel-III floor. In this regard, two financial institutions (Barclays
and Nationwide) have been asked to prepare plans by end-June 2013.

It would be important to ensure that any capital building effort is robust, imparts
certainty and preserves lending. While the AQR was an important stock-taking exercise, it was
not a stress test and thus did not measure banks’ resilience to shocks. Moreover, the 7 percent
capital benchmark ratio set by the FPC falls short of the 9½–10 percent level that will ultimately
be required for major UK banks (as G-SIBs,

or if within the proposed ring-fence), and

capital plans would significantly enhance
the credibility of the stress tests. Finally, to protect credit, banks’ capital building effort, now and
in the future, must focus on new equity issuance, reduction of dividend payouts, restrained
remuneration, and balance sheet restructuring that does not reduce net lending. The FPC’s
recent recommendation to the PRA that banks that are making satisfactory progress on capital
should be allowed to reduce their liquidity coverage ratios to 80 percent (still well above EU
minima) should also prove helpful in supporting credit during the capital-building phase.14
A clear strategy is needed for the two government-intervened banks, with a view to

returning them to good health and eventually private ownership. Together, RBS and LBG
account for two-fifths of the stock of UK net private sector lending. The banks have made
progress in repairing their balance sheets and improving profitability. But challenges remain, as
evident by the recent inability as yet to divest branches, and the still-low market-to-book value
for RBS.15 The approaching completion of the banks’ original EC-approved restructuring plans
provides an opportunity to elaborate a clear way forward, especially for RBS where prospects are
more uncertain and complexities greater. Any strategy should seek to return the banks to private
hands in a way that maximizes the value for taxpayers, strengthens confidence and competition
in the sector, and minimizes outward spillovers. In this context, if a sovereign backstop is

The June 2013 Financial Stability Report estimates the liquidity release from this countercyclical policy
relaxation to be £70 billion (almost 5 percent of GDP), although, given question marks over, inter alia, capital
adequacy, it is not clear how much of this will translate into credit.

15

Staff estimates, using publicly-available information through 2013Q1 and the “HEAT” bank assessment tool
developed by Ong et al (forthcoming), suggest that RBS is among the weakest of the 28 globally-systemically
important banks (G-SIBs).

required to meet a capital shortfall, it should be provided, as this would have a high multiplier in
boosting growth.16
34.

The authorities have recently announced their intended strategy for the state-

intervened banks. The choice of a strategy is to be guided by the objectives of maximizing the
banks’ ability to support the UK economy, maximizing the value for taxpayers, and returning the
banks to private ownership. Consideration is being given to selling the government’s stake
(39 percent) in LBG, possibly beginning with an institutional placement, followed by a retail
offering. In the case of RBS, where the government has an 82 percent stake, a review is expected
to be conducted by Fall 2013 (with external professional support) on the merits of a good
bank/bad bank split that would allow the bank to focus on its core UK businesses and does not
involve the bank’s nationalization. In this context, further public capital injections into RBS have
been ruled out.

FISCAL POLICY
Fiscal consolidation has been a drag on growth
35.

Fiscal consolidation has been large and front-loaded, against a backdrop of large

public deficits and debt. In mid-2010, the newly-elected government embarked on a large and
front-loaded fiscal consolidation that aimed to balance the structural current budget by the end
of a rolling 5-year window and put the net debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path by FY15/16
(see Figure 7). To this end, the government set out a plan, comprising of discretionary deficit
reduction measures of about £130 billion (8 percent of GDP) from FY 2010/11 to FY 2015/16. The
government has since implemented more than a half of those discretionary measures. As a result,
the overall deficit fell from 11 percent of GDP in FY2009/10 to 7¼ percent of GDP in FY2012/13.17
Over the same period, the structural deficit, as measured by the cyclically-adjusted primary
balance (CAPB) as a share of potential GDP, narrowed by around 5 percent of GDP.

16

Any recapitalization need should likely arise mainly for RBS, although, in the absence of detailed information, it
is difficult to estimate precisely the amount needed. Based on the AQR, the PRA has quantified a £13.6 billion
(0.9 percent of GDP) capital shortfall in the bank, of which £10.4 billion is expected to be covered by RBS’s
existing capital plans. The remaining shortfall, of £3.2 billion, together with the amount of additional capital
required to raise RBS’s fully-loaded Basel-III common equity tier 1 ratio to, say, 10 percent (the level targeted by
the bank’s healthier peers), would amount to around £22 billion (1.5 percent of GDP).

17

Substantial asset transfers have also helped reduce the deficit. In April 2012, the government transferred assets
(1¾ percent of GDP) from the Royal Mail Pension Plan to the public sector, and, in November 2012, decided to
transfer the excess cash held in the BoE’s Asset Purchase Facility to the Treasury, starting 2013. Fiscal indicators in
this report exclude the temporary effects of financial sector interventions and asset transfers from the Royal Mail
Pension Plan, unless otherwise noted.

37.
Despite flexibility, consolidation has hurt growth. The consolidation was the largest
among major advanced economies, including France, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, and the
US. Using a conservative multiplier estimate of 0.5 (just under the recent average of effective
multipliers used by the OBR) would imply a cumulative GDP loss of 2½ percent, although it is
plausible that the multipliers might be higher.
Bring forward growth initiatives while preserving the fiscal framework
38.
Planned fiscal tightening in FY 2013/14 will be a further drag on growth. The March
2013 Budget envisages an additional discretionary tightening of £10 billion in FY 2013/14—in
structural terms, the OBR estimates that these measures imply a reduction in the cyclicallyadjusted primary balance of 1 percentage point of potential GDP. The discretionary tightening is
smaller than in FY2012/13, but at a time when households, firms, and banks are all deleveraging
and external demand is weak, the tightening will pose further headwinds to growth.

Judgments about fiscal policy need to balance debt sustainability with growth
concerns. The combination of continuing weak growth and high debt presents a dilemma:
further fiscal consolidation will weaken output, with the risk of a permanent loss to productive
capacity, while debt will accumulate unless there is consolidation, with the risk of an eventual loss
of credibility.


On the one hand, the UK has one of the highest deficit and debt levels in the G-20, and the
latter continues to rise. With nominal growth projections revised down, and automatic
stabilizers allowed to operate fully, the primary deficit is expected to remain above a debtstabilizing level, contributing to a worsening debt outlook. Public sector net debt is expected
to peak at just below 84 percent of GDP, and will begin to fall only in FY 2017/18 (see
Appendix I on Debt Sustainability).



At the same time, however, weak growth
has accentuated the large fiscal problem.
In 2008-10, the rising debt was in large
part accounted for by a worsening of the
structural deficit, but more recently, it can
be explained increasingly by unfavorable
cyclical conditions. In particular, the
impact of discretionary consolidation
measures on deficit reduction has been
more than offset by widening cyclical
primary deficits—indeed, low growth is
largely responsible for the worsening of
the debt outlook.

Moreover, the drag from fiscal consolidation may be unusually large in the current situation.
There is good reason to believe that multipliers—and the associated drag on output—are
larger currently in the UK where the output gap is large, the economy is in a liquidity trap,
and credit is constrained.

investment and labor participation, and sought to switch from current to capital spending.
However, these measures are generally too small in scale and, more importantly, some will not
come into effect in the near-term. More can, therefore, be done now to support recovery.
41.
Within the context of the medium-term fiscal framework, several growthenhancing initiatives could be considered now to offset the drag from planned fiscal
tightening. Such measures need to be aimed at raising expectations of long-run incomes and
returns on investments:


Bringing forward planned capital investment where possible. This would help catalyze private
investment and spur much-needed growth. The government’s National Infrastructure Plan
identifies over 550 public and private projects, valued at around £310 billion. Although some
projects, such as those requiring regulatory approval (e.g., energy sector projects) might be
difficult to bring forward, other investment projects, such as roads, as well as social housing,
could be brought forward relatively quickly. In addition, where projects are jointly-financed
by the public and private sector, the government could consider raising its financial
contributions, as the government’s borrowing costs currently are at a historic-low and much
lower than those faced by the credit-constrained private sector.



Reducing business taxes. The corporate tax rate is expected to be reduced to 20 percent by
2015 (among the lowest in OECD). However, the level of the effective marginal tax rate will
still remain relatively high, due to less generous capital allowances compared to other
countries. Thus, there is room to reduce the effective rate. Furthermore, as recommended by
the 2010 Mirlees Review, the government could consider introducing a tax allowance for
corporate equity to reduce the tax incentive bias in favor of debt over equity finance and
stimulate equity-financed investment. This measure would also help the financial sector raise
capital as the cost of equity issuance would be decreased.



Offsetting the budgetary impact of these measures over the medium term. In particular, the
government could consider broadening the VAT base and undertake a reform of property
taxes. The standard rate of VAT was raised from 17.5 percent to 20 percent in January 2011,
but many goods and services are zero-rated or exempt from VAT. Similarly, with respect to
property taxes, council tax is levied on the value of property, but property valuations have
not been updated since 1991 in the majority of the regions.

42.
Government investment in supply-side measures to boost growth will enhance
rather than damage credibility that the government has gained from its medium-term
fiscal plan. The UK has a strong commitment to medium-term fiscal consolidation, an Office for
Budget Responsibility that has rapidly established its credibility, and long-duration debt.


Market indicators for the UK―sovereign yields, CDS spreads, and sovereign default
probabilities―have not signaled any credibility concerns; instead, these indicators have
correlated well with other strong sovereigns, such as Germany (Figure 8). Raising growth
expectations will do more for reassuring debt sustainability, while also supporting bank

balance sheets. And although supply measures are often thought to have only long-run
benefits, they could bring immediate reassurance to purchases of UK debt.


Moreover, given the exceptionally long maturity of UK sovereign debt—by far the highest in
the G7, and a testimony to the authorities’ strong debt management capacity—even sharp
changes in marginal yields would pass only slowly through to effective rates.

HOUSING SUPPORT POLICIES
New housing support measures pose risks
43.
The government has introduced new policies to support the housing market. The
2013 Budget announced a new scheme, Help To Buy, aimed at boosting activity in the housing
market and making it easier for first-time buyers to purchase homes. The scheme comprises two
initiatives: an equity loan scheme (already implemented) and a mortgage guarantee scheme (still
being finalized). The equity loan leg of the scheme is targeted to new builds, and the guarantee
scheme will provide lenders with the option to purchase a government guarantee to compensate
for a portion of losses in the event of foreclosure.
44.
New housing market policies could boost aggregate demand, but also generate
adverse effects. Momentum in the housing market is already growing, with support from falling
mortgage rates (owing, in part, to the FLS). And the UK housing market is notable for inelastic
supply and structural incentives that support housing demand (see Annex 6). Hence, there is a
risk that the result would ultimately be mostly house price increases that would work against the
aim of boosting access to housing. Moreover, the guarantees pose risks for the public balance
sheet and create incentives for lower quality lending at a time when banks are being encouraged
to boost the quality of their balance sheets.
45.
The new measures require careful implementation. The scheme should be strictly
temporary, both to alleviate financial stability risks and to help the economy rebalance away from
a dependence on domestic consumption and non-tradable production. Moreover, the fee for
banks to access the Help to Buy scheme should be set at a level commensurate with the risks
posed to the public balance sheet.
46.
The measures should be balanced by measures to address housing supply problems.
Housing supply pressures could be eased by further liberalizing spatial planning laws. In
particular, the planning system should be made more responsive to changes in demand. Housing
supply could also be increased by making more land available for development through schemes
that compensate those who stand to lose from new developments. To facilitate an adequate
supply response, the government could also consider fiscal disincentives for holding land without
development.

STRUCTURAL POLICIES
A new wave of reforms is needed
47.

Structural reforms are an essential complement to other policies. First, they are

necessary to ensure a sustainable recovery to a dynamic economy—the current situation does
not simply reflect a shortfall in aggregate demand, and reforms are needed to raise returns to
investment and provide more confidence about long-term incomes. Second, reforms are
necessary to aid rebalancing to a balanced and robust economy that is less dependent on
specific sectors (e.g. financial services) and the buoyancy of domestic household spending.
48.

A “second wave” of structural reforms is needed. The reforms implemented in the UK

in the early 1980s induced more competition in goods and services markets, more flexibility in
the labor market, and increased the share of working-age adults with higher education. However,
structural weaknesses in human capital, infrastructure and innovation have undermined
economic prospects. A number of initiatives identified by the LSE Growth Commission, the
Heseltine Review, and the government should be pursued with greater vigor:


Improving skills: Retraining opportunities to currently low-skilled workers, including
vocational training, would enable them make the transition to high valued-added, high wage
work. Current immigration quotas can have perverse effects by restricting the attraction and
retention of skilled workers (such as recent graduates).



Infrastructure: Investment in infrastructure, notably in transport and energy, could be
supported by streamlining the planning application process and removing regulatory
uncertainty. Devolving more authority over planning decisions to local authorities, with
financial incentives provided through greater revenue sharing, could accelerate the
implementation of infrastructure projects.



Banking: The banking sector in the UK is notably concentrated in comparison with other
countries, with the six main retail lenders providing more than 80 percent of outstanding
lending. Increased competition would better serve the needs of UK firms and households,
especially given few alternative sources of funds for start-ups and smaller enterprises.18,19

18

The Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards has called for more to be done to boost competition
among banks. The Independent Commission on Banking has recommended the creation of a strong challenger
bank through the divestiture of assets belonging to Lloyds Bank.

19

The Breedon Review contains several proposals to develop non-bank lending channels for SMEs, such as by
raising awareness of alternatives and improving access to capital markets (e.g. reducing information barriers to.
securitization of SME lending).

FINANCIAL REGULATION
Challenges posed by the new regulatory structure should be addressed
49.
The UK has undertaken a major revamp of its financial regulatory structure. With
the Financial Services Act (2012) coming into force on April 1, three new bodies have been
formed: (i) the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), a subsidiary of the BoE, will be responsible
for the regulation and supervision of most systemic institutions, including banks, building
societies, credit unions, insurers and major investment firms; (ii) the Financial Conduct Authority
(FCA), a separate institution not overseen by the BoE, will supervise and regulate other financial
firms (e.g. non-banks such as asset managers), and be responsible for ensuring that relevant
markets function well and for the conduct regulation of all financial firms; and (iii) the Financial
Policy Committee (FPC), established under the purview of within the BoE, will oversee
macroprudential policy.
50.
The revamp of the financial regulatory structure is an important step, but comes
with its share of challenges that will need to be addressed. The reforms of the regulatory and
supervisory structure are aimed at improving the integration of microprudential and
macroprudential supervision to safeguard financial stability. But important challenges remain:


Ensuring greater coordination across the regulatory bodies. In the context of a concentrated
financial system, ensuring perfectly coordinated messages on bank capital while also
respecting the lines of separation between macro- and micro-prudential policy is a challenge.
This challenge was evident in the build-up to, and reactions to the publication of, the recent
AQR, and could reemerge in the context of the multiple stress tests planned over the next 18
months—the PRA’s individual bank stress tests this year; the system-wide stress tests
planned from 2014; and the EBA exercise expected in the second half of 2014. Given that
banks already face significant regulatory uncertainty from anticipated structural and price
based measures, there will be a premium on delivering consistent messages across regulators.
However, this consistency must be secured in a way that does not compromise the
operational independence of the PRA, which is critical for the effective supervision of the
UK’s globally systemically-important financial institutions.



Maintaining the momentum toward an intensive and intrusive supervision model, supported by
adequate resourcing. The UK’s new forward-looking and judgment-based supervisory
approach—already supported by written documentation and strategies—is welcome.
However significant further work and resources will be required for its full implementation. In
particular, the PRA will need to overcome still-entrenched cultural barriers to adopting
intensive and intrusive supervision, including by ensuring the data provided by firms is
comprehensive, timely and accurate – a critical requirement for credible AQRs and bottomup stress tests. There is also scope for more transparent communication of supervisory
judgments about firms’ financial health and business models, and risk management and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

33

UNITED KINGDOM

governance frameworks. Finally, it is important that recent progress on increasing senior
management engagement in PRA’s supervisory decisions is complemented by a more formal
framework for escalation of inspections, to help augment the integrity of the supervisory
process.


Ensuring the independence of the FPC and equipping it with the right tools. The FPC’s
independence should be guarded, including in the context of appointments to the
Committee. Moreover, its tools should be augmented. The recent imposition of stricter
forward-loss provisioning requirements on banks was an appropriate application by the FPC
of its softer powers of recommendation. Augmenting the FPC’s harder powers of direction to
include the authority to set the leverage ratio, with immediate effect rather than in 2018, and
loan-to-value and loan-to-income ceilings would have important benefits. This is because the
current toolkit, comprising sectoral and countercyclical capital requirements, is unlikely to be
sufficient to effectively prevent a buildup of systemic risk, especially through property
bubbles. Separately, it would be important for regulators to internalize the outward spillover
effects that could arise from imposing higher capital requirements on globally-active banks
headquartered in the UK. As discussed in Annex 7, these spillovers could be positive or
negative, strong or mild, concentrated or dispersed, depending largely on the reaction
function of global banks.

51.
Structural banking reform measures will need to be coordinated internationally and
address gaps. The effectiveness of the authorities’ planned (electrified) ring-fence atop pricebased regulations to address systemic risk will depend in part on active cooperation at an
international level on cross-border supervisory and bank resolution frameworks. The absence of
such cooperation–including in the context of the envisaged banking union for the euro zone–
could result in regulatory arbitrage, potentially undermining the UK’s attractiveness as a financial
center. Moreover, while the envisaged ring-fence will improve the resolvability of banks inside
the ring-fence, the issue of “too-important-to-fail” generally, and especially outside the ringfence, needs further consideration. In this context, strengthening the regulator’s ability (and tools)
to ex-ante discipline managers, shareholders, and debt holders can help reduce the buildup of
risks in the first place. Finally, the implementation of the reforms needs to be pay attention to
concerns about significant activity migration to more lightly-regulated shadow banks and nonbanks.

THE AUTHORITIES' VIEWS
52.
The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s assessment of economic
developments, noting that recent momentum, while encouraging, did not substantially
alter the picture of a subdued and uneven recovery. Like staff, the OBR projects the output
gap to remain persistently negative for a number of years. Both the OBR and BoE project modest
growth for 2013 (around 1 percent), assuming that consumption would benefit from rising
disposable incomes, reduced uncertainty, and continued easing in credit conditions. Net trade
would remain vulnerable to the fortunes of the euro area, but was expected to be less of a drag
34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM

on growth in 2013. Private fixed capital investment was expected to strengthen alongside
consumption and exports. Authorities agreed that the performance of the euro area remained a
significant risk, but put less emphasis than staff on the potential for stagnation and hysteresis.
Monetary and credit policies
53.
With monetary policy already exceptionally loose, most members of the Monetary
Policy Committee judged that no more stimulus was required at this time; some expressed
concerns about inflation risks from further easing. Some members also cautioned that
monetary policy could not raise income expectations, and had, in that sense, reached its limits.
Most MPC members agreed that the ill-health of the banking sector played a significant role in
reducing the effectiveness of loose monetary conditions. Many were of the view that credit
demand was weak, owing to reduced confidence in future incomes and returns.
54.
Authorities expressed satisfaction that the two main unconventional tools
employed during the past 12 months—purchases of gilts and the Funding for Lending
Scheme—were working mostly as anticipated. There were no obvious signs that QE had
reached its limits in terms of the ability to affect yields on gilts. The FLS had played a role in
bringing bank funding costs down and had reduced the cost of secured lending for households,
but there was little evidence of a material effect on the cost of lending to SMEs (hence the recent
modification to skew incentives towards SME lending). The authorities judged that no alterations
to the range of acceptable collateral or the haircuts on collateral were needed at the current
juncture. The authorities did not favor lowering Bank rate, as this, they viewed, would damage
already-low bank profitability. MPC members expressed skepticism about purchases of private
assets, arguing that wealth effects would be small and purchases would expose the BoE’s balance
sheet to credit risk.
55.
The authorities generally felt that the new remit was useful. The remit re-confirmed
the inflation target and clarified flexibilities, including the use of unconventional policy tools.
Bank staff viewed the explicit recognition of tradeoffs in part as a codification of existing
practices, but also viewed it as a good opportunity to take steps toward greater transparency
about such tradeoffs in the Inflation Report.
Fiscal policy
56.
The authorities considered that the fiscal strategy has ensured a flexible response and
that growth-enhancing fiscal policies have been put in place. Authorities cited large automatic
stabilizers, switching from current to capital spending, and allowing the Supplementary Debt target
to be relaxed, as well as specific growth-enhancing measures announced in the 2013 Budget. In
addition, emphasis was placed on the ability of activist monetary policy to boost demand, especially
under the terms of the new remit and the modifications to the FLS.
57.
The authorities judged that any deviation from the announced plans for fiscal
consolidation would be too risky. “Fine tuning” the consolidation path would bring little benefits

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35

UNITED KINGDOM

in terms of growth (multipliers were not thought to be large) but may have large negative effects
on credibility, with consequences for interest rates. Moreover, there were no signs of hysteresis
effects and new data were taken as signaling that growth was picking up. For the authorities,
continued fiscal vulnerabilities argued strongly in favor of maintaining existing deficit reduction
plans.
58.
The authorities agreed that the payoffs from infrastructure were substantial, but
argued that there are substantial constraints to implementing significant additional public
sector capital spending in the current year. The authorities argued that they continue to support
public and private infrastructure investment, including by using the credibility of the Government
balance sheet to encourage private sector investment through guarantees. However, at the same
time, they emphasized the importance of ensuring overall value for money in any new public sector
capital spending.
Financial sector policies
59.
The authorities concurred with staff on the need for stronger capitalization of UK
banks, and that it should be met by issuing new capital or restructuring balance sheets in a
way that does not hinder lending to the economy. The authorities agreed on the importance
of continuing the steps underway to strengthen the resilience of bank balance sheets. In this
context, the authorities updated staff on progress by the PRA in implementing the FPC’s
recommendation that major UK banks meet a common equity tier 1 capital ratio, on a Basel 3
basis, of at least 7 percent of risk-weighted assets by end 2013. In addition, they highlighted the
safety benefits of building adequate capital buffers ahead of an eventual normalization of
interest rates. The authorities assured that, while the precise scope has yet to be agreed, the
system-wide stress tests planned from 2014 will be developed to cover a wide range of scenarios
and risks, including macro-financial feedbacks, and seek to provide a model framework for
testing and bolstering banks’ resilience to shocks.
60.
The authorities agreed with staff’s call to return the two government-intervened
banks to private hands in a manner that maximized taxpayer value, ensured financial
stability, and improved credit intermediation. They noted that LBG was in good shape, and
are actively considering options for the sale of the government’s 39 percent stake, although
there is, as yet, no pre-determined timetable or method of disposal. RBS was considered more
challenging, given its size, complex business model and global presence.
61.
The authorities were alert to the challenge of coordinating micro- and macroprudential policies. The PRA agreed that ensuring its operational autonomy was a pre-requisite
for supervision of the UK’s globally systemic banks and insurers according to statutory objectives.
It also agreed that the verification of bank data needs further improvement, and that current
resources don’t allow for a more detailed asset quality review. The interim FPC noted that it had
decided not to recommend to the Government that the statutory FPC be given powers of
Direction over LTV and LTI ratios at that time, on the basis that further analysis, reflection and
public debate was necessary. Finally, the authorities appreciated the discussion on outward

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM

spillovers that may arise in the context of regulating global banks, but argued that such spillovers
would likely be more positive.
62.
The authorities concurred that the efficacy of UK structural banking reforms would
partly depend on international progress on cross-border resolution and supervision. In this
regard, they welcomed progress toward the establishment of a recovery and resolution directive
in Europe. They also welcomed progress towards the single supervisory mechanism in the euro
zone, while expressing satisfaction over the preservation of the UK’s voice within the EBA.

STAFF APPRAISAL
63.
Current policies are aimed at rebalancing the economy and anchoring durable
recovery. Progress has been made in reducing fiscal risks and ensuring the sustainability of
public debt. While adhering to the medium-term framework, the government has shown
flexibility in its fiscal program to support the economy. At the same time, monetary policy has
remained highly accommodative, to help support economic recovery, and has been
complemented by innovative credit easing policies. This policy mix—tight fiscal and
accommodative monetary and credit—is aimed at helping the economy rebalance from public to
private and external demand led growth. Financial sector policies have been geared toward
enhancing the resilience of the financial system, notably by improving the oversight framework
and increasing the capacity to deal with systemically important financial institutions.
64.
These policies have been broadly consistent with the Fund’s past surveillance
advice. In particular, consistent with Fund advice, the government has accommodated a
slowdown in the pace of structural fiscal consolidation, allowed automatic stabilizers to operate
fully, and brought forward spending with high multipliers. Similarly, the BoE has kept monetary
policy accommodative, including by additional purchases of gilts, and, jointly with the Treasury,
introduced the Funding for Lending Scheme, aimed at lowering bank funding costs and
improving credit conditions in the economy. Progress on financial sector reforms has also been
consistent with FSAP recommendations.
65.
Notwithstanding some nascent signs of growth, the UK is still a long way from a
strong and sustainable recovery and unemployment is still too high. Activity is expected to
pick up only gradually, as domestic deleveraging continues and external demand remains weak.
Restoring strong and durable growth and rebalancing the economy, by addressing both demand
and supply constraints, is vital to improving incomes, ensuring the sustainability of public debt,
and returning the banking sector to good health. This implies the need for a coordinated multipronged strategy to guide the economy to greater and more balanced growth.
66.
Monetary policy needs to remain accommodative. In addition to considering further
purchases of gilts, the BoE could provide assurance to households and investors that policy rates
will be kept low until the recovery reaches full momentum. These measures need to be

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

UNITED KINGDOM

complemented by credit easing schemes. In this context, the recent extensions to the FLS are
welcome.
67.
The effectiveness of monetary policy is, however, dependent on the health of the
banking system. In particular, repairing bank balance sheets is imperative for a durable
resumption of lending. This will involve, first and foremost, a strengthening of the capital position
of banks. To this end, and as a follow-up to the AQR, banks should expeditiously meet their
capital shortfall as assessed by the PRA. Moreover, beginning in 2014, it would be essential that
the authorities conduct an annual stringent system-wide stress test, backed by supervisorapproved capital plans to ensure a robust level of bank capitalization. Most importantly, capital
bolstering efforts should be based on a combination of new equity issuance, reducing dividend
payments, restraining remuneration, and balance sheet restructuring that does not reduce net
lending. A clear strategy is needed for the two state-intervened banks—which account for a large
chunk of the stock of net bank lending—that seeks to maximize taxpayer value, strengthen the
banks' contribution to the economy, and eventually return them to private ownership. In this
context, if a sovereign backstop is required to meet a capital shortfall, it should be provided,
since this would have a high multiplier effect on growth.
68.
It is essential that fiscal policy supports the nascent recovery. Planned near-term
fiscal tightening will be a drag on growth, and will come on top of domestic deleveraging and a
weak external outlook. Given the tepid recovery, it is essential that fiscal policy capitalizes on the
nascent signs of momentum to bolster growth, by pursuing measures that would alleviate
supply-side constraints and also provide support for the economy. In particular, to spur private
demand, the drag from planned near-term fiscal tightening could be offset—notably by bringing
forward capital investment and reducing business taxes—within the context of the medium-term
fiscal framework.
69.
The government needs to pursue with greater vigor structural reforms, aimed at
rebalancing to a more dynamic, balanced and robust economy. In particular, measures aimed
at improving the economy’s skills base and competitiveness would not only help boost the
productive potential, they would help support demand in the near-term by boosting
expectations about long-term prospects and incomes.
70.
Financial stability needs to be bolstered by building on recent progress in
improving the regulatory and supervisory structure. Such stability will anchor a strong and
durable recovery and reduce the risk to taxpayers, as well as limit spillovers from shocks that are
transmitted through the UK financial system. In particular, going forward, greater coordination
between the FPC and the newly established PRA should be ensured, notably in the context of the
planned bank stress tests, to alleviate regulatory uncertainty. The PRA should be adequately
resourced and its operational independence ensured, to support an intensive and intrusive
supervision of the UK’s globally-systemic financial sector. Similarly, the independence of the FPC
should be guarded and its toolkit augmented, notably by allowing it to set leverage ratios
beginning now, rather than in 2018, and providing it additional powers to limit loan-to-value and
loan-to-income ratios, as higher capital requirements alone might be insufficient to restrain
property bubbles.

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM

71.
Structural banking reforms should proceed apace, but the authorities will need to
remain alert to challenges. The authorities’ intention to introduce an electrified ring-fence is
welcome, but its effectiveness in reducing systemic risk without leading to a balkanization of
capital will depend critically on progress, internationally, on cross-border regulation and
supervisory frameworks (including in the context of the euro area banking union). The authorities
should also ensure adequate and pro-active supervision of non-banks and shadow banks, given
the possibility of significant risk migration to these entities due to regulatory arbitrage.
72.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the United Kingdom be held
on the standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix 1. Fiscal Debt Sustainability Analysis
Baseline scenario
1.
In the baseline scenario, the general government primary balance (defined as the overall
balance excluding interest payments) is projected to improve from a deficit of 4½ percent of
GDP in 2012/13 to a surplus of 2 percent of GDP in 2018/19, reflecting the government’s
commitment to medium-term fiscal consolidation (Appendix Table 1, baseline).
2.
However, in the near term, public sector debt to GDP ratio will continue rising and reach
a peak of around 98 percent of GDP in 2016/17, as the primary deficit exceeds the debtstabilizing level. After 2017/18, the debt ratio will be on a downward path.
Alternative scenarios and bound tests
3.
Debt would increase steadily in the absence of fiscal consolidation. If the primary deficit
remains constant, debt would increase to over 110 percent of GDP by 2018/19 (Table A1,
scenario with no policy change).
4.
Figure 1 illustrates a series of bound tests, including a permanent ½ standard-deviation
shock to growth, real interest rate, and primary balance independently, and a ¼ standard
deviation shock to these three combined, as well as a one-time 10 percent of GDP shock to
contingent liabilities.


Medium-term debt dynamics are not highly sensitive to interest rate shocks given the
long average maturity (about 14 years) of UK government debt.



However, if medium-term growth rates are persistently lower by ½ standard-deviation of
historical growth (equivalent to 1¼ percentage points of GDP) than in the baseline
scenario or if the primary deficit is higher by 1½ percentage points of GDP, the debt-toGDP ratio could rise well above 110 percent of GDP by 2018/19.

Annex 1. The Productivity Puzzle in the UK1, 2
Notwithstanding the sharp decline in output in the UK since the beginning of the crisis, employment
has remained surprisingly stable. As a result, labor productivity has plummeted. While many European
countries have seen persistently weak productivity, the UK’s loss of labor productivity stands out, as it is
now around 10 percent below its pre-crisis trend. Many reasons have been cited for the decline in
productivity, including mismeasurement of output, labor hoarding, and the increase in part-time
workers. No one factor can, however, fully explain this phenomenon.

A. Trends in the Labor Market
1.
The labor market in the UK has exhibited greater resilience than might have been
expected from the outturns for GDP. Historically, the relationship between GDP and employment
has been fairly stable in the UK. However, in the context of the Great Recession, this link has become
weak, and labor market performance has been significantly stronger.
2.
In normal times, the 4 percent drop in real GDP since 2008 would have been
associated with a 1 percent decline in employment. Instead, employment has been roughly
constant, and has actually risen from its low point at the end of 2009. If viewed through the prism of
employment growth, the current recession would compete with that of the 1970s for being the
shortest and shallowest recession in post-war UK economic history.

3.
The decoupling of output and labor market trends is reflected in the weakening of
labor productivity. Having experienced modest fluctuations around a trend growth of 2 percent,
labor productivity has declined at an average rate of 1 percent per year since the beginning of the
crisis. Indeed, the 5-year average productivity growth has been the worst in the post-war period.



In previous recessions, labor productivity has typically returned to its pre-crisis trend after
about four years, driven mainly by falls in employment rather than a recovery in output. This
time has been different. Many European countries have seen persistently weak productivity,
often weaker than has typically been seen in previous crises. The UK stands out as having
the weakest performance, with the current level of labor productivity being 10 percent below
a simple pre-crisis trend.



The decline in productivity in some other advanced economies, such as Germany, France
and Italy, has been concentrated in manufacturing. Over the recovery period, manufacturing
productivity has grown faster in these countries than in the UK, which explains why these
countries have begun to reclaim some of the lost ground. In contrast, much of the sustained
weakness in UK productivity is concentrated in services, where the level is still below its precrisis peak.

4.
What explains the productivity puzzle? This note examines some of the more popular
reasons suggested for the decline in labor productivity in the UK, followed by a discussion of other
factors that may be contributing to this phenomenon.

B. Some Popular Explanations for the Decline in Labor Productivity
5.
Three explanations have often been offered for the decline in productivity: (i) labor
input is measured incorrectly because it does not take into account the increase of part-time
workers; (ii) GDP is understated in the national accounts, and once the estimates are revised—which
has often been the case—there will be no productivity puzzle; and (iii) firms are hoarding labor, as
they await a pickup in demand to pre-crisis levels. Let us examine by turn each of these hypothesis.

distorting estimates of labor productivity. Indeed,
labor productivity in the UK has also declined when measured using the total number of hours
worked in the economy, a more accurate measure of labor input.

7.
GDP is understated. It has been argued by many economists that GDP in the UK is an
imperfect summary measure of the economy—it is often revised several times prior to its
finalization—and given the heightened uncertainty in the context of the crisis, current estimates of
GDP will likely be revised up. While revisions to GDP estimates are certainly a possibility, the

magnitude of the revision that is required to offset the
decline in productivity is way too large for this to be a
credible explanation for the puzzle. According to the
Office of National Statistics (ONS), over the period
1993–2008, the average revisions to GDP growth has
been in the order of around 0.3 percentage points.
However, if productivity growth over the past four
years is to have increased at its historic trend, GDP
would on average have to increase by 3 percentage
points per year. There has never been a revision in the
national accounts of this magnitude.

Labor hoarding. Over the business cycle some firms engage in labor hoarding, which is the
practice of retaining workers in order to minimize the

C. How Else Could We Explain the Labor Productivity Puzzle?
10.
Four hypotheses can be considered to explain the current labor productivity puzzle.
First, lower labor productivity is common across several OECD countries, and may reflect a persistent
reduction in potential output growth; second, lower real wages in the UK have contributed to
cushioning the impact of the recession on employment; third, there has been a destruction of firm
or sector specific human capital in the process of labor reallocation; and fourth, there has been a
natural redeployment of workers to sectors with low labor productivity growth. Each of these
hypotheses is examined below.
11.
Lower potential output growth? Low
labor productivity growth is not unique to the
UK. Indeed, labor productivity growth has been
dismal (and comparable to the UK) in other
developed economies, such as Germany and
Sweden, both of which have been relatively
unscathed by the crisis. This suggests that a
common factor, such as a structural reduction in
potential output across major advanced
economies, maybe at play and can help explain
low labor productivity.

12.
A moderation in real wages. The UK has experienced a substantial reduction in real wages
compared with other OECD countries—indeed, real wages in the UK declined by 10 percent in the
period 2008–12, while in most other countries in the sample it increased. Using a standard
neoclassical production function, a reduction of real wages induces a substitution of labor for
capital, which translates into lower labor productivity even without any change in technology.
Assuming a labor share of 0.7, a reduction of real wages of 10 percent translates into a reduction of
labor productivity of 3 percent, which might help to explain partially the labor productivity puzzle.4
13.
Labor substitution. In the context of the current crisis, there has been a change in the
composition of labor input. In particular, there has been a steep contraction in the number of fulltime workers, comparable to the experience of Ireland and Spain. There has also been an increasing
share of involuntary temporary and part-time workers—indeed, since the beginning of the financial
crisis, there has been a substantial increase in temporary and part-time workers that are looking for
a permanent or full-time job. To the extent that full-time workers are more productive than parttime workers, the change experienced in the labor market could lead to an overall lower
productivity. In fact, data on wage earnings support this hypothesis.

Temporary and part-time employment allows the economy to be more flexible in order to
better absorb shocks. However, the

to another one, and hence there will be a loss of skills and productivity associated to the
reallocation process.5


The median earnings of part-time workers and self-employed are less than 50 percent of the
earnings of full-time workers. To the extent that this difference in wages reflects differences
in productivity, the changes in the composition of employment in the context of the crisis
can help explain the moderation of labor productivity growth in the UK.

14.
Redeployment of labor. The flow of workers towards low labor productivity growth sectors
can partially explain the labor productivity puzzle. In the UK, the services and natural resource
sectors are the ones with the largest decline in productivity growth. During the crisis, employment
has been growing faster in these sectors. In the absence of this reallocation, measured labor
productivity would have been slightly larger.

D. Other Possible Explanations
15.
A change in the structure of employment. In previous major UK recessions, around
75 percent of the job reductions have occurred in two highly cyclical sectors of the economy—
manufacturing and construction. These sectors now account for a smaller share of jobs, and so have
generated less job losses this time around.

5

Von Wachter (2009) show that in the US displaced workers tend to lose on average 20 percent of their earnings
once they relocate from one firm to another one.

The underlying health of the UK
business sector. In the two earlier UK recessions,
the loss of jobs was intensified by structural
problems. By contrast, the nonfinancial business
sector of the economy was in much better shape
when the financial crisis hit, and companies were
in a better position to retain skilled and
experienced workers. The other two factors are
wage flexibility and policy measures, which has
resulted in subdued wage increases, more
part-time jobs and self-employment growing
strongly.

17.
An impaired financial system. A combination of uneven demand (across sectors) and an
impaired financial system, one that is unable to reallocate capital resources sufficiently quickly to
respond to such shocks, is enough to reduce aggregate output per employee. Such a process would
also give rise to precisely the volatility in relative prices and the widening sectoral dispersion of
profitability that is observed in the data. Some firms, it appears, are staying in business (and retain
employees) despite making relatively low returns. Others that are well positioned to expand are
unable to do so because they are unable to secure financing and hence substitute labor for capital.
It’s hard to imagine this dispersion in returns can persist indefinitely. Assuming the underlying shifts
in relative demand are permanent, the economy must in the end adapt to them. Indeed, at some
point, once the financial system returns to health, one could imagine exactly the reverse process: a
long period of above-trend productivity growth. If this is true, the economy’s lost potential is the
result of a misallocation of capital, rather than any form of “technical regress”. In that case it needn’t
have been lost forever. In time, as the financial system heals, and investment starts to flow, the
economy could well expand at an above-trend rate (without generating inflation), catching up some
of the ground lost over recent years.

E. Conclusions
18.
The “Labor Productivity Puzzle” in the UK reflects both structural and cyclical factors.
To the extent that low labor productivity growth is common to several OECD countries, one could
reasonably conclude that structural factors—such as a low trend growth of potential output—can
explain, in part, the productivity puzzle. With regard to cyclical and UK-specific factors, a reallocation
of employment from full-time to part-time jobs and the associated loss of skills; a redeployment of
labor toward low productivity growth sectors; the diminished role of recession-sensitive sectors
(construction and manufacturing) in job losses; and an impaired financial system appear to be
important in explaining declining labor productivity in the UK economy.

Annex 2. Household Debt Deleveraging and Consumption
Dynamics1, 2
In the run-up to the crisis, the rapid build-up of household debt helped support robust consumption
growth, allowing the UK economy to grow at rates exceeding the historical average. In the aftermath
of the crisis, however, there has been a rapid deleveraging of household balance sheets, which is
expected to culminate in the next two to three years. Until then, private consumption is likely to
remain relatively weak. Evidence from previous episodes of household deleveraging suggest that the
adverse impact on the economy, because of such deleveraging, was cushioned by demand rebalancing,
initially through a rise in government consumption but followed, more importantly, by a rapid increase
in net exports. In the current context in the UK, the lack of external rebalancing, notably because of a
decline in competitiveness and falling productivity, has further contributed to the weak recovery from
the crisis.

A. Background
1.
In the run-up to the crisis, household debt increased to unprecedented levels. Household
debt reached a peak of 167 percent of gross disposable income in 2007. The rapid rise in debt was not
viewed as being a problem, since it was accompanied by an increase in financial and non-financial
assets held by households. On the surface, the position of household balance sheets was robust, but it
masked underlying vulnerabilities that became evident during the crisis.

2.
The predominant share of rising household debt came from an expansion in mortgage
credit. This was fuelled by a rapid increase in real house prices during 2000–07. Other components of
household debt increased as well, but to a smaller extent. When crisis struck, house prices decreased
by around 9 percent in nominal terms during the periods of 2007–09.3

3.
In the aftermath of the crisis, there has been a significant deleveraging of household
balance sheets. Deleveraging has, however, been passive, in the sense that the ratio of household
debt to disposable income has declined owing to high inflation rather than to debt amortization.
This is not uncommon—barring Japan, in all previous episodes of deleveraging, debt overhang has
been alleviated because of high inflation (see section D).

B. How Long Will Household Debt Deleveraging Continue?
4.
The process of household debt deleveraging is not expected to culminate in the very
near-term. So far, household debt as a share of disposable income has declined from a pre-crisis
peak of 167 percent to around 141 percent. To assess the period ahead, we estimate the duration of
the deleveraging cycle based on five possible scenarios: (i) equilibrium debt set at its 10 year
average; (ii) equilibrium debt set at its 25 year average; (iii) debt stabilization at pre-crisis leveraging
trend; (iv) debt stabilization based on historical evidence; and (v) debt stabilization based on a debt
sustainability model. Based on these scenarios, we assess that household deleveraging could
continue for up to three years.4 Figure A2.3. illustrates all scenarios.


Equilibrium debt set at the 10 year average. According to this metric, households have
already achieved an equilibrium debt level, and so we should not expect further
deleveraging. That said, current financial market conditions suggest that households are
likely to continue deleveraging.



Equilibrium debt set at the 25 year average. Based on this metric, the deleveraging
process is more than half-way through, and at the current pace, household balance sheet
repair will culminate by 2015.



Debt stabilization at pre-crisis leveraging trend. The previous two methods rely on the
assumption that leverage will revert to a long-term average over time. However, the postwar series on household debt shows that there is a trend component. In fact, based on precrisis data, household debt on average increases by about 2 percentage points of disposable
income per year. If we extrapolate this trend, using the year 2000 as the starting point,
households will reach their equilibrium level of debt in 2013 (where the two lines intersect).



Debt stabilization based on previous deleveraging episodes. An alternative is to estimate
the expected path of household debt based on historical episodes. Based on the work of

4
For the first four scenarios we assume a pace of deleveraging of 5 percentage points of gross disposable income
per year. This is the average decline of household debt per year in the period 2007–12. In the fifth scenario, the pace
of deleveraging is determined by the assumptions on consumption and income growth, and the real interest. We use
as a source WEO projections to forecast all these components.

2007. Three cases emerge in the early nineties— Finland, Norway, and Sweden, where
households deleveraged in the aftermath of a crisis. We chose the deleveraging path of Sweden,
the country that had the largest reduction in household debt. Assuming that the UK will follow a
similar path, deleveraging is more than half-way through and will culminate in 2014.5


Debt stabilization according to a debt sustainability model. All previous scenarios assume
that households continue to deleverage at the current pace (average reduction of household
debt in the period 2007-12). However, the actual trajectory of deleveraging will depend on the
dynamics of consumption, gross disposable income, and the real interest rate.6 Using WEO
projections for all these components and a debt target set at the 25-year average, we find that
households have completed 60 percent of the deleveraging, and will reach the equilibrium debt
level by 2015

C. Implications for Private Consumption and Aggregate Demand: Evidence
from Advanced Economies
5.
There are likely to be significant changes in demand patterns in the context of
household debt leveraging, with implications for economic prospects. To understand the
macroeconomic consequences, we rely on event studies based on a sample of five advanced
economies, which witnessed significant household deleveraging.7 Three of the countries, Finland,
Norway, and Sweden, were chosen based on the fact that they are the only advanced European
economies that experienced a financial crisis in the two decades prior to 2007. In addition, we
consider two G-7 economies—Germany and Japan—that experienced household debt deleveraging
during 2000–10, and are closer in size to the UK. For this set of countries, we analyze a series of
macroeconomic variables 10 years before and 10 years following the peak of household debt as a
share of disposable income (see figure A2.6).

5

In this exercise we consider as a target (black line) the dynamics of household debt in Sweden during the period
1989-1997 (see section C). Even though there are many differences between the UK and Sweden, this exercise
provides a benchmark regarding the future path of deleveraging in the UK.

6

In this section we use the debt sustainability approach to infer the trajectory of household debt. The key factors that
are going to influence the expected deleveraging path are the savings rate (or the difference between gross
disposable income and consumption) and the difference between the growth rate in the economy and the real
interest rate. In the projections we assume that all savings are allocated to debt repayments and not asset
accumulation.
7

In all five countries households deleveraged by at least 15 percentage points of gross disposable income.

Debt deleveraging was accompanied by a decrease (increase) in private (public)
consumption. A common pattern across these

There was a significant slump in investment, but a discernable rebalancing toward
external demand. Ten years following the start of the deleveraging episodes, investment as a share
of GDP was lower by 5 percentage points, while net exports were higher by the same magnitude.
The trajectory of the investment share was very similar across countries. After an initial slump in
investment in the first three years, it remained relatively stable for the rest of the period. For the
Nordic countries, the decline in investment reflected mainly a reduction in residential investment,
which was a direct consequence of the banking crisis experienced during the deleveraging episode.
For Germany and Japan, the lower investment rate was part of a long-term trend witnessed over the
preceding 20 years. On the other hand, net exports rose in all instances, except in Japan, where they
remained stable during the entire deleveraging period.
8.
The rebalancing of demand went handin-hand with an increase in labor productivity. All
countries in the sample experienced an increased in
labor productivity. The Nordic countries experienced
an annual growth in labor productivity of
2.5 percent, while productivity increased by
1 percent per year in Germany and Japan. The flip
side of the gains in productivity was persistent job
losses in the Nordic countries, while employment
remained relatively stable in Germany and Japan.

Overall, during the episodes of deleveraging, aggregate demand was weak, resulting
in a persistently large output gap. In addition to a weakening of consumption during episodes of
deleveraging, aggregate demand grew at a slower rate, contributing to large and persistent output
gaps. The output gaps closed only after about 10 years after the deleveraging cycle began.

The UK experience with household deleveraging is different. In the case of the UK,
consumption as a share of GDP has increased in part explained by the relative resilience of the labor
market.8 However, if current labor market trends were to reverse, private consumption could decline
and be a drag on aggregate demand. Public consumption in the UK increased initially, but has
declined at a much faster rate than in the Nordic countries, resulting in a drag on the economy.
Investment has declined in the UK in the same way as in the sample of advanced economies, but net
exports have remained flat. The lack of external rebalancing could be explained, in part, by lackluster

The increase of consumption as a share of GDP can also be explained by higher social transfers and a high growth
rate of the private consumption deflator relative to the GDP deflator.

performance of labor productivity. Finally, the output gap in the UK has widened, consistent with the
experience of the comparator countries in the sample. To conclude, unless there is a rebalancing in
the components of aggregate demand, facilitated by gains in labor productivity, it will be difficult for
the UK to reproduce the pattern of recovery witnessed in other advanced economies.

D. Policy Implications of Household Debt Deleveraging: Lessons from
Advanced Economies
11.
It is necessary to have an appropriate set of macroeconomic policies to offset the drag
on demand arising from deleveraging. The experience from the sample of countries suggests that
there are important policy choices to be made in order to promote a swift recovery. In particular, a
combination of accommodative monetary policy, gains in competitiveness, gradual adjustment of
government consumption, and structural reforms were important in cushioning the impact of
deleveraging on output. In the UK, some of these elements of the policy package are missing,
making it more likely that deleveraging will continue in a context of low growth.


Monetary Policy: A policy stance which accommodates a temporary departure of inflation
from its long-run target can contribute to the process of deleveraging. Deleveraging can take
place through a reduction in nominal debt, a rise in real disposable incomes, or through
inflation. In the case of most countries in the sample, deleveraging took place because of an
increase in real incomes or through inflation (Columns b and c in the deleveraging
decomposition). The exceptions are Japan and Finland, where reductions of nominal debt were
more important. In the case of the UK, inflation has been the most important contributor to
deleveraging.



Exchange Rate changes: In most cases, a real exchange rate depreciation cushioned the effect
of deleveraging. In particular, a rise in net exports compensated for the lack of demand arising
from lower consumption growth. In the UK, the large real exchange rate depreciation has not
translated into a significant increase in net exports (see Annex 3), owing, in part, to a slump in
productivity, suggesting an important role for structural reforms aimed at boosting the
economy’s skills base and competitiveness.



Fiscal Policy: Government spending provided demand support during episodes of
household debt deleveraging. The example of Nordic countries is illustrative. In response to
the decline in output following the banking crisis in the early nineties, which was associated
with household deleveraging, the government responded by allowing automatic stabilizers
to operate fully and provided discretionary fiscal support. As a result, government
consumption as a share of GDP increased during the initial several years of the deleveraging
process. And rather than reducing government consumption over a very short span of time,
the retrenchment was phased out over several years. Indeed, it was only after 10 years
following the start of the deleveraging process, did the share of government consumption
come close to the level observed at the beginning of the cycle. In contrast, in the UK a more
front-loaded fiscal consolidation effort has contributed to the weakness in demand.9



Structural Reforms: One additional feature of the deleveraging cycle is the large
productivity gains in Nordic countries, in part supported by structural reforms. For instance,
as discussed by Lindbeck (1997), Sweden liberalized its labor and product markets ahead of
joining the EU, which allowed it access to a large market for its goods and services. This
contributed to an increase in labor productivity and a gain in competitiveness that
supported the external rebalancing of the economy. The deleveraging cycle in the UK began
in the context of highly flexible goods and labor markets, but declining labor productivity
(currently 10 percent below the pre-crisis trend) has undermined competitiveness and
external rebalancing (See Annex 1). Structural reforms, that improve the skills of the
workforce, upgrade public infrastructure, and encourage more innovation, will be crucial to
sustain future gains in productivity.

See chapter 3 from the April 2012 WEO “Dealing with Household Debt” for a discussion of fiscal policy in Nordic
countries in the context of household debt deleveraging.

E. Conclusions
12.
Household debt deleveraging in the UK is expected to continue for another two to
three years, and will be a drag on consumption and aggregate demand. In the absence of
policy support, such deleveraging will result in a very slow recovery of output. Prior experience with
deleveraging in other advanced economies suggests that the adverse impact on demand during the
deleveraging cycle could be offset by a combination of policies, including an accommodative
monetary policy stance, fiscal support, and, more importantly, structural reforms that improve the
skills base and competitiveness of the economy.

Annex 3. Prospects of External Rebalancing in the UK1, 2
This note analyzes the factors behind the limited progress in external rebalancing in the United
Kingdom. Securing a durable recovery and strong growth in the UK will require rebalancing away from
a reliance on domestic toward external demand. The analysis suggests that external rebalancing has
been held back by structural weaknesses in the economy, including poor export diversification, poor
performance of technology-intensive exports, and a large reliance on financial services exports. These
have been amplified by cyclical factors such as a decline in the terms of trade and weak external
demand, low productivity growth, and insufficient support from the exchange rate depreciation. As a
result, notwithstanding a substantial real depreciation of the sterling following the onset of the crisis,
net exports have adjusted very little, contributing a mere 0.3 percentage points to GDP growth rate
over the last 5 years.

1.
Weak trade performance has contributed
to anemic growth in the UK. One of the key factors
behind disappointing growth in the UK has been the
lackluster performance of net exports. Indeed,
notwithstanding a sharp real exchange rate
depreciation of around 15 percent in 2008
(18 percent since the start of 2007) following the
onset of the crisis, the UK’s trade balance improved
by around 1 percentage point of GDP at its peak,
and has worsened since then. As a consequence of
the lack of external rebalancing, the contribution of
net exports to growth in 2010–12 has been close to
zero.

Developments that preceded the crisis can help explain, in part, the UK’s poor trade
performance post-crisis.
2.
In the years ahead of the crisis, the UK
witnessed a very sharp decline in manufacturing
activity. As an economy develops, production first moves
from agriculture to manufacturing, and then eventually
from manufacturing to services. The trend decline of
manufacturing production as share of Gross Value Added
(GVA) is relevant process across all advanced economies.

The decline was, however, the largest in the UK among the G7 economies, amounting to a reduction
of about 50 percent in the share of manufacturing to GVA during the period 1990–2011. The sharp
decline in manufacturing possibly reflects a lack of competitiveness in that sector.
3.
The UK, like other advanced economies,
has lost market share globally. The process of
globalization boosted world trade by 10 percent
annually over the last decade, but all G7 countries
experienced a slower export growth, resulting in a
smaller market share. The UK had a 34 percent
decline in export market share in 2000–11. Some
other advanced economies, such as Germany and
the US, have, however, been more successful in
stabilizing their export market shares in recent
years.

Loss of market share reflected a lack of
competitiveness. Developments in the real estate and finance sectors in the UK during the period
2000–07 induced capital inflows that generated a rise in real wages, a consumption boom, and an
appreciated real exchange rate. Relative to other G-7 countries, the UK experienced the sharpest
increase in nominal unit labor costs.3 The lack of competitiveness was also reflected in lower returns
in the manufacturing sector. The net rate of return on investment in manufacturing was one-third of
the return reported in the services sector (5 and 17 percent, respectively). Moreover, given the
sensitivity of manufacturing to business cycles and the relative stability of services, the difference of
returns adjusted by risk was even larger. As a result, the economy increasingly specialized in
services.
5.
The UK had a chronic trade deficit, notwithstanding a sharp uptick in exports of services.
The biggest contributor to the deficit was the trade balance of goods. The trade balance in services
was consistently positive, owing in large part to the stellar performance of financial services exports.

B. Structural Factors behind the Lack of External Rebalancing
The role of export composition
6.
Against the backdrop of weak trade performance before the crisis, three structural
factors can explain the lack of external rebalancing in the UK. These include: (i) low exposure of
exports to fast growing emerging markets; (ii) low
Figure A3.6. Exports going to BRIC Countries in
growth of technology intensive products, where

advantage; and (iii) large exposure to financial
20
20
services, which has been affected adversely by the
15

11.9
financial crisis.
10.2
7.
Low exposure to Emerging Economies.
Among the G7 economies, the UK has the smallest
exposure to emerging markets. Part of the reason
why some other advanced countries, like Germany,
the US, and Japan, have a dynamic export sector is
because of their relatively large exposure to fast
growing economies. While the UK exported only
5 percent of its exports of goods to the BRICs in
2011, Japan, the US, and Germany had an export
share larger than 10 percent. But the problem for the
UK is deeper than that. UK exports are not
sufficiently dynamic in emerging economies. Indeed,
among major advanced economies, the UK had the
lowest average growth rate of exports to the BRICs.
In order to improve the trade balance, not only is it
important to increase the exposure to emerging
economies, it is equally important to upgrade the
type of goods exported to these economies.
8.
Poor performance of technology
intensive goods. In the context of countries with
relatively low labor costs entering the global market,
advanced economies are facing stiffer competition
in labor-intensive manufactured exports. In order to
remain competitive, therefore, these economies
need to specialize in high and medium-high
technology intensive manufacturing goods.4 These
typically involve more R&D and, depending on the
specific product, could provide a higher GVA to the

economy. The UK has one of the lowest growth rates of exports in high and medium-high
manufacturing goods among G-7 economies. The prospects for rebalancing will depend, in part, on
how successful the UK is in increasing its exports in these sectors.
9.
Large exposure to financial services. One important feature of the export sector in the UK
is the large participation of insurance and financial services in total exports. This share is more than
two times than that for the US, a global leader in financial services. During the 2000s, the large
exposure to financial services benefited the UK in a context where the growth of these exports
averaged 18 per cent annually. More recently, however, the average annual export growth of
financial services has been around -1 percent, resulting in a significant drag on UK’s trade balance.
One of the challenges to achieve a durable process of external rebalancing is to diversify the exports
away from financial services, in order to avoid the negative consequences of financial sector
deleveraging.

Comparative Perspectives: How does the UK Compare with Germany?
10.
Benchmarking the UK against Germany could provide important lessons. To this end,
exports were disaggregated across two key dimensions—the weight and the growth rate of exports
in each market destination—to assess whether the export performance can be attributed to the
weight of an export destination in total UK exports or to the growth performance of UK’s trading
partners. In others words, are UK’s export woes because of its “large” exposure to less dynamic
markets or is it because demand is weak in a large number of its export destinations. In addition,
exports are disaggregated by types of goods and services to evaluate their contribution to the
overall trade performance. Then, UK and German trade structure are compared.5, 6

The export growth is decomposed in two elements: the weights and the growth rate of each component, using the
∑
∆ , . Where ∆
is the total nominal export growth rate in the UK,
is the
following formula: ∆
share of a market destination “m”, and ∆ , is the export growth rate in market “m”. For instance, if UK exports
have a low growth rate there are two possible explanations. First, the UK can be heavily exposed to stagnant markets,
. Second, the market destinations could be broadly diversified, however,
which reflects a problem with the shares
there is limited demand across market destinations, which reflects a problem with the growth rate of each
component of ∆ , .

The trade data is expressed in nominal USD. Even though exchange rate fluctuations could affect the interpretation
of the results, UK export deflator series in dollar terms is fairly stable, suggesting that nominal exports are closely
related to real exports.

11.
There are significant differences in the trade patterns and export destinations between
the UK and Germany. The European Union, notably the euro area, has been the predominant trade
partner for UK and Germany. With regard to the rest of the world, the UK has greater trade linkages
with the United States, while Germany trades significantly more with the BRICs. German exports are
concentrated in goods (85 percent), while goods exports account for only 65 percent of UK’s total
exports of goods and services. Both countries export intensively machinery, transportation
equipment and chemicals. Moreover, in the case of the UK, exports of financial services account for
almost 10 percent of total exports.
12.
In the run-up to the crisis, the UK’s export performance was modest, owing to a
generalized competiveness problem.


A simple comparison of export performance suggests that over the period 2000–08,
Germany registered significantly faster export growth across all destinations compared with
the UK. While the average growth rate of exports in the U.K was 6.6 percent, German exports
grew at 12.9 percent per year7



As a counterfactual, if the UK had the same export destinations (and weight in total) as
Germany, exports would have grown faster, albeit modestly, by 0.5 percentage points.8 This
suggests that the destination of exports cannot explain the UK’s poor performance in the
run-up to the crisis. Similarly, if the UK replicated the export “structure” or “pattern” of
goods and services from Germany, total export growth would have been smaller, suggesting
that export composition cannot explain the UK’s poor trade performance.9



On the other hand, if the UK maintained its trade structure, but exhibited the export dynamism
of Germany across all markets, the growth rates of total exports would have increased by about
100 percent.10 This suggests that issues pertaining to “generalized competitiveness” may have
played a bigger role in undercutting export performance.

13.
In the post-crisis period, limited trade linkages with fast growing emerging markets
has undercut a recovery in UK’s exports.


In 2008–09, Germany and the UK experienced a contraction in exports of around 20 percent,
similar to the decline in world trade, followed by a swift recovery. Given the exceptional
circumstances that were affecting worldwide trade, the analysis is focused on the recovery
period of 2009–11.

7

The analysis of market destinations is based on the Directions of Trade Statistics, which only covers trade in goods.



If the UK adopted the same market destinations as Germany, nominal export growth could
have increased by about one-third.11 This suggests that the UK would have benefited from
having the same exposure to emerging markets as Germany.12

14.
Addressing underlying competitiveness problems and inadequate export
diversification would be important to boost exports. The external demand accounting exercise
shed some light on the dynamics of UK exports before and after the crisis. In the run-up to the crisis,
export growth was fairly weak across markets destinations, suggesting an underlying
competitiveness problem, so increasing the exposure to emerging markets would not have
improved substantially the trade balance. Instead, if the UK had the same export dynamism as
Germany, there would have been an improvement in the external sector. On the other hand, in the
post-crisis period, UK exports could have recovered faster if the UK had greater trade exposure to
emerging economies.

If the UK had the same composition of exports in terms of goods and services from Germany, it wouldn’t have
experienced a substantial change in export growth (counterfactual 3 in Figure 12). Similarly, in the case that the UK
retained its exports structure, but with the same export dynamism as Germany, it would not have necessarily
improved its trade performance.

C. Cyclical Factors: Lessons from External Rebalancing Episodes
15.
There are significant cyclical factors that have a bearing on the prospects for
rebalancing. An event studies approach is used to understand the cyclical factors behind external
rebalancing in the UK and OECD countries. The event studies of external rebalancing episodes—one
specific to the UK and the others based on the experience of 22 OECD countries—are defined in a
context where the trade balance improved by around

rebalancing episode in the UK, the trade balance increased
by 4 percentage points of GDP between 1989 and 1997.
Box A3.1. How much do net exports have to increase to close the output gap?
An external rebalancing of around 2 percentage points of GDP is required in order to close the output
gap in the UK economy. In the April 2013 WEO macroeconomic projections, the GDP in the UK is projected
to grow at an average rate of 2.0 percent which results in a negative output gap of 2.2 percent in 2018 (See
Table 1). Using these projections as a baseline scenario, we compute the required increase in the trade
balance to close the output gap in 2018. Assuming that exports of goods and services are the only
component of aggregate demand that changes, then the trade balance needs to increase 1.7 percent of GDP
in the medium-term to close the output gap. Albeit, this is a partial equilibrium analysis, it provides a useful
benchmark regarding the magnitude of external rebalancing required in order to achieve a situation of full
employment. This numerical target is used as a threshold in the event studies analysis, which provides an
insight on the cyclical factors that make this magnitude of external rebalancing possible.

The cases in which countries show a trade balance surplus exceeding 1 percent of GDP during the whole sample
period were discarded. The event studies are focused on cases that resemble as much as possible the UK, so
episodes of chronic trade surpluses are not considered.

16.
The event studies show that three cyclical factors can explain the lack of external
rebalancing. These include: (i) a decline in the
Figure A3.14. UK: Terms of Trade

production capacity. In the rebalancing episode of the early 1990s, sustaining a positive trade
balance was possible due to long-lasting real exchange rate depreciation. Between 1992 and 1996,
the real exchange rate depreciated by 12 percent and remained at a depreciated level through the
end of the period. On the contrary, in the current context, while the real exchange rate depreciated
sharply in 2008, it has been quite volatile in the period thereafter.

D. Conclusions
20.
Bold policy actions are required to restore competitiveness and improve the prospects
of external rebalancing in the UK. Abstracting from the external environment, this will require
both a diversification of its exports and of export markets. In particular, the UK will need to focus on
boosting technology-intensive exports and increasing its foray into fast growing emerging markets.
The former will inter alia require improving the competitiveness and skills base of the economy,
while the latter would benefit from further trade initiatives, including free-trade agreements.

Annex 4. The Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism,
Credit and Recovery1, 2
This note examines why the transmission of monetary policy to credit in the UK has not been
successful. There is consistent evidence of credit supply problems for all types of lending except for
mortgages. However, the importance of demand problems appears to be increasing more recently, as
prolonged periods of tight credit conditions and weak demand have started to discourage borrowers
from applying for loans, especially in the SME sector. The analysis suggests that easy monetary
conditions are being transmitted to the mortgage market, but not feeding through to spreads or
lending to the rest of the economy. This, in turn, explains why the recovery from the financial crisis has
been one of the weakest in the history of the UK.

A. A Weak Recovery from the Crisis
1.
The recovery of the UK economy from the financial crisis has been exceptionally weak.
The current economic recovery has been one of the slowest in the history of the UK, even when
compared to the Great Depression. In addition, following the financial crisis, the UK has
underperformed relative to most other large advanced economies (see figures below ¶7, main text).
2.
The US and the UK were both at the epicenter of the crisis, but the recovery of the
former has been faster and stronger. This adds some perspective into the poor performance of
the UK. The shocks ensuing from the financial crisis were of similar size and nature in both countries.
From peak-to-trough, GDP in the UK fell by 6.3 percent, and by 5 percent in the U.S. Further, over
the 2007–08 periods, equity prices, house price inflation, bank lending, and residential construction
fell at similar sharp rates in both countries. The two economies hit the GDP trough in Q2 2009 and
rebounded in 2010, but their performance started diverging thereafter. Growth in the UK
decelerated against the backdrop of stagnant investment, while the US economy maintained an
average annual growth rate of 2 percent, with positive contributions from investment in every year.
Therefore, the growth gap between the UK and the US appears to be partly driven by differences in
investment growth.

Furthermore, the disappointing performance of the British economy has been
accompanied by an extraordinary contraction of credit. Lending to firms and households in the
US resumed growing three years after the crisis started, while credit to the private sector in the UK is
still falling, notably to businesses. Consequently, unlike the US, the UK has been unable to embark
on an investment-led recovery.

B. Effectiveness of Monetary Policy
4.
Credit and economic growth have been fragile, notwithstanding the extraordinary
monetary stimulus provided by the Bank of England (BoE). Since March 2009, the BoE has
lowered the policy rate in several steps to close to the zero bound; purchased £375 billion
(25 percent of GDP) worth of assets, notably gilts, by issuing bank reserves over three rounds of QE;
and, in conjunction with the Treasury, launched the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) to lower bank
funding costs.

QE has partly succeeded in increasing broad money, but this has not translated into
higher credit to the private sector. The effects of QE on broad money and credit were mitigated
by endogenous responses from private agents that reduce deposits. Through QE, the BoE creates

78

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM

broad money by purchasing assets from non-bank private agents. However, if banks do not lend,
and agents spend their additional deposits investing in domestically-issued securities or foreign
assets, broad money falls. This has been reflected in a continuous decline of the money multiplier.3

The leakages leading to a reduction of deposits after each round of QE were associated
with weak bank lending, increased activity in capital markets and a larger volume of
transactions with the rest of the world.4 The effects of on broad money can be traced using the
banks’ balance sheet identity, whereby total assets equal total liabilities (see Butt. et. al. 2012). This
identity implies that the effects of QE on broad money can be offset by lower lending or an increase
in banks’ non-monetary liabilities.


The decrease in yields resulting from the first round of QE provided financial and
nonfinancial firms with incentives to substitute bank lending with capital market finance.
The negative contribution of net-other assets reflects banks’ shift towards bond and equity
issuance as a source of financing. Similarly, the negative contribution of lending to the
private sector, which is largely explained by firms’ repayment of previously acquired loans,
implies that corporates reduced their reliance on bank credit.



By contrast, in the last two phases of QE the fall in net foreign currency counterparts
(stemming from investors purchases of foreign assets) and net-lending to non-residents
weighed down on broad money growth.

3

The multiplier is defined as the ratio of broad to narrow money. Broad money includes currency in circulation and
deposits. Throughout this annex, M4 excluding intermediate other financial corporations is taken as the measure of
broad money, because that is the BoE’s preferred measure. Narrow money, on the other hand, is the sum of currency
and bank reserves.
4

The BoE has engaged in three rounds of QE. QE1 refers to the first phase of the program where £200 billion in
assets were purchased between March 2009 and January 2010. In the second round, QE2, £125 billion of assets were
purchased between October and May 2012. This was followed by QE3 in which £50 billion were purchased between
July 2012 and October 2012. These three rounds are depicted by the shaded area in the figures below ¶5.

But the negative contribution of bank lending has been exceptional, thus suggesting
an important impairment to the monetary transmission mechanism. The provision of credit by
banks has tended to be the most important transaction in creating broad money. This is due to the
fact that, by extending loans, banks create broad money in the form of deposits for the borrower or
the recipient of the borrower’s expenditure. However, since 2010, lending has, for the most part,
contributed negatively to changes in M4. QE may not have been successful in boosting lending to
the private sector because, by design, it circumvents the banking system. The main transmission
mechanism channels of QE are through higher

C. What Explains the Weakness in Bank Lending?
8.
Identifying whether the weakness in bank lending is driven by supply or demand side
factors, is essential to determine the appropriate policy response. The inefficiencies generated
by supply-side constraints should be addressed with policies that reduce the cost of lending for
banks, or that help financial intermediaries restore the health of their balance sheets. In this case, the
appropriate tools lie in the domain of the central bank or the financial regulator. By contrast, if
subdued demand is the main problem, there may be scope for welfare-improving fiscal measures.

9.
The weakness in bank lending after the crisis reflects both subdued demand and a
tightening of credit supply. As the financial crisis intensified, wholesale funding costs rose, and
banks’ risk aversion increased autonomously, and in response to tighter liquidity and capital
requirements. This discouraged banks from extending new loans and induced them to tighten credit
conditions. Although demand for credit may have fallen in response to tighter credit conditions,
agents’ willingness to borrow was also subject to independent negative shocks. Weak and uncertain
future demand prospects reduced firms’ appetite for external finance. Similarly, concerns about
future job losses and lower real income growth seem to have encouraged households to save more
and reduce their level of debt.
10.
Comparative statics analysis suggests that, since end-2011, supply-side constraints
have been the main driver of the weakness in lending, although not in the mortgage market.5
In the period leading to the crisis, aggregate lending to households and businesses increased and
average credit spreads narrowed (see graph A on Figure A4.24), suggesting that credit
developments were dominated by positive supply shocks. By contrast, more recently, lending flows
are falling slightly while interest rate spreads are widening (see graph C on Figure A4.24). This
implies that, since the Euro Area Crisis intensified, negative supply-side shocks have been the most
binding constraint on bank lending.
Figure A4.11. Lending to SMEs




Lending to businesses is currently being heldback by supply-side constraints. Since end2011 lending to businesses has dropped,
while the cost of credit of this type of lending
has increased (see graph F in Figure A4. 24).
Similar patterns are also observed in SME
lending data. Consequently, the weakness in
lending to the business sector has been
recently driven by negative supply-side
shocks.

Developments in the mortgage market seem to follow a different pattern, however. In the
mortgage market the periods preceding and following the crisis were characterized by rising
lending flows and narrowing credit spreads. Thus, positive supply shocks were the drivers of
mortgage lending in these two periods. Since November 2011, lending flows continued to
rise, but mortgage spreads started widening. Therefore, positive demand shocks have
become the main source of fluctuations in the mortgage market (see graphs A, B and C in
Figure A4.25).

5

This analysis builds on the simple partial equilibrium model by Bell and Young (BY, 2010) . While BY measure credit
spreads relative to the policy rate, in the model used here credit spreads are given by the difference between lending
rates and banks’ funding costs. The comparative statics analysis based on this model can reveal whether observed
movements in the cost and amount of lending are predominantly driven by demand or supply side factors. If lending
flows and the cost of credit move in the same direction, then demand-side shocks dominate. If, on the contrary, the
two variables move in opposite directions, then supply-side shocks are more important. We abstract from analyzing
the 2007–09 period, during which credit markets were disfunctional.

D. Survey Data Affirms Evidence from Market Data
11.
Survey data suggests that conditions in the mortgage and credit market for large firms
are improving. For the past few quarters, banks have been reporting that demand for mortgages is
growing and mortgage credit conditions are loosening. Similarly, when the Euro Area crisis
intensified, large firms and banks reported a tightening of credit conditions, but these now seem to
be moving towards more favorable levels.

Large businesses have been able to substitute bank debt with bond issuance, thus

confirming the importance of supply side constraints in credit markets. Relative to the
pre-crisis period (2005–07), bank borrowing by large businesses plummeted, while corporate bond
issuance held-up, aided by historically low yields.6 Note that if demand-side shocks were the

Note that equity issuance has been negative since 2011, as firms have engaged in equity buybacks. While this may
suggest that banks could be issuing debt to buy back shares, the volume of this type of transactions has been very
small. This kind of transactions normally account for less than 5 percent of total gross bond issuance and are
undertaken by at most two companies. In 2008, there was an important increase in the issuance of bonds used to
buy back shares. The transaction represented 16 percent of total gross bond issuance, but it was undertaken by a
single firm. Further, data from the CFO Deloitte survey suggests that equity buy-backs could be related to the fact
that firms consider their cash-payout ratios to be “below normal levels”.

underlying cause of weak lending to large firms, one would observe a contraction in both bank
borrowing and corporate debt. Going forward, large businesses are likely to continue funding
themselves through corporate bond issuance, as they still find bank borrowing relatively less
attractive.
13.

SMEs are more credit constrained than large businesses. Unlike large corporates, SMEs

cannot substitute bank debt with other sources of financing. Although banks report a modest
improvement in credit conditions to small businesses, SMEs do not perceive an improvement in the
availability of credit, and lending continues to fall. More than 40 percent of credit to SMEs is in the
form of credit card lending and overdrafts. Since end-2011, lending flows in the market for
unsecured lending have been largely flat, while credit spreads have risen (see graph F in Figure
A4.25). SMEs are relying more on personal funds and/or cutting back on their scale of operation.

are growing. The percent of SMEs that are not
applying or renewing lending facilities is quite high,
and the two most important factors which are
increasingly contributing to this behavior are
“discouragement” and expectations about possible
being denied access to credit.

E. Inefficient Allocation of Capital
15.
The prolonged period of tight credit conditions has induced firms to build-up their
working capital excessively, thus leading to inefficiently low levels of investment. In the postLehman period, businesses responded to tight credit conditions by increasing their deposit holdings
and inventories. While this has allowed firms to improve their operational liquidity, it may also be
the result of weak demand. Persistently weak demand prospects have led to inefficiencies in the
management of working capital, as firms have a significant amount of liquidity tied-up in their
inventories and are, therefore, unable to generate enough cash to pay their bills.

Indeed, large corporates are seeing an increase in the days of inventories on hand, and the
time taken to receive payments from customers has risen. Against the backdrop of tight credit
conditions, this has induced large firms to delay payments to suppliers.7

16.
In addition to tight credit conditions,
SMEs have been adversely affected through
the supply chain. The increase in payables by
large companies is damaging to SMEs, as the
former are often suppliers of the latter. SMEs have
been forced to accept payment terms, which are
detrimental to their working capital and cash-flow.
This appears to be distorting SMEs’ incentives to
demand external finance. Fewer SMEs are
applying for overdrafts to cover funding gaps, and
a larger share is seeking to build a safety net.

While the data in figures A4.19 and A4.20 is only available through 2011, evidence from the British Chamber of

through 2012.

17.
Working capital management practices in the post-crisis era could be creating
inefficiencies at the macroeconomic level. Over the past three years, economic growth in the UK
has been stagnant as firms, willingly or not, have been shifting away from bank lending and focused
on boosting their working capital. At the same time, the business cycle has become more correlated
with firms’ net cash position, while bank borrowing has become counter-cyclical although,
historically, this variable has tended to be pro-cyclical.
18.
This phenomenon affects the economy on a demand and a supply-side dimension.
Tight credit conditions and their ensuing pressures on firms’ working capital have induced
businesses to cut back on investment (demand). Moreover, uncertainty about future consumer
demand and late payments has induced businesses to delay production or file for bankruptcy,
thereby damaging the productive capacity of the economy.

F. Conclusions
19.
This note provided evidence that the transmission of monetary policy to credit is
impaired, owing to both demand and supply side considerations. This may explain why the
recovery from the crisis has been exceptionally weak in the UK. The results indicated that current
weakness in bank lending is largely explained by adverse supply-side shocks. However, there are
differences across sectors. While mortgage borrowers do not seem to be credit-constrained, SMEs
appear to be severely credit-constrained sector. These results are consistent with the information
conveyed by surveys, but SME survey data suggests that demand considerations are a growing
concern: prolonged periods of tight credit conditions are discouraging small and medium sized
firms from seeking external finance. The results also showed that liquidity and credit-constrained
firms have engaged in inefficient accumulations of working capital. This has created additional
pressures to SMEs financing concerns, and has led to lower growth.

Annex 5. The Funding For Lending Scheme1,2
A. Motivation for the Scheme
1.
The FLS was introduced jointly by the HMT and BoE on August 1, 2012 against a
backdrop of significant bank deleveraging and high bank funding costs. The scheme followed
“Project Merlin” (ended March 2012) and the National Loan Guarantee Scheme (launched in March
2012, sized £40bn), both of which aimed at

potential game-changer. Nine months later (on 24
April 2013) the BoE and HMT announced a one-year extension in the duration of the FLS, and
stronger incentives for banks and nonbanks to lend to SMEs. This followed continued credit
contraction and survey evidence that, SMEs, unlike households, have not benefitted from the
increased availability, and lower cost, of credit since mid-2012.

B. Original Design
2.
The FLS was designed as a four-year collateral swap—participating banks placed their
lower quality collateral with the BoE (with the usual haircuts and margins applied) in
exchange for higher-quality gilts. The latter could then be used to raise wholesale funds at close
to the policy rate. The amount of gilts participating banks could “draw down” was set at 5 percent of
their end-June 2012 stock of net sterling lending to the UK private sector (private non-financial
corporations and households). This stock stood at £1.67 trillion (three-fourth of it accounted by
lending to households), placing the initial potential size of the Scheme at about £80 billion. With
some banks (notably HSBC) choosing not to participate, the initial stock of net lending of
participating banks amounted to £1.36 trillion, implying an allowance of £68.2 billion. Importantly,
banks’ allowance increased pound-for-pound for any net lending increase after the initial date,

which meant there was no cap on the Scheme’s size.3 The Scheme came initially with a drawdown
period of 18 months, i.e. till end-Jan 2014.
3.
A pricing incentive was built in to incentivize net lending (or minimize deleveraging).
The Scheme access fee was set at 25 bps of the amount drawn if banks maintained or increased
their net lending over an assessment period (end-2013 vs. end-June 2012); 50 bps if banks
deleveraged by 1 percent, 75 bps if they deleveraged by 2 percent, and so on up till a maximum
cost of 150 bps. Gilts acquired under the scheme could also be counted for purposes of the liquidity
coverage ratio, and the capital charge on FLS-funded loans could be offset under Pillar-II capital
requirements.

C. April 2013 Extension/Modification
4.

On April 24, 2013, the authorities announced three key changes to the scheme to
further credit provision, notably to SMEs:

(i)

a one year extension (to January 2015) in the period under which participants can access
funding under the scheme.

(ii)

higher borrowing allowances for banks that lend more, and sooner, to SMEs: for every £1 of
net lending to SMEs in 2013 (2014), banks will now be able to draw £10 (£5) from the scheme,
4
whereas other lending will continue to translate into a pound-for-pound allowance.

(iii)

participating banks permitted to access FLS funding on the basis of their loans to certain nonbank credit providers (NBCPs) such as financial leasing corporations and factoring
corporations, which are an important source of credit for SMEs, and to mortgage and housing
5
credit corporations.

D. Effectiveness Through End-March 2013
5.
With just three quarter data, and the impact of recent changes not yet reflected, it is
still early to assess the Scheme’s effectiveness. Still, it does appear that the Scheme has
contributed to easing funding pressures on UK banks, with CDS spreads falling and equity valuations
improving. The fact that LIBOR spreads (over overnight interest swap rates) for sterling fell by more
than for euro suggests that the additional FLS backstop has helped UK banks, beyond the EU
Summit and OMT announcements in Q3-2012 (left chart below). Time deposit rates (right chart)

Thus, a bank with an initial stock of net lending of £100 billion and initial allowance of £5 billion would receive an
additional allowance of £10 billion if its stock of net lending increased to £110 billion.

Moreover, the sectoral split of lending–covering households, SMEs, large businesses and certain non-bank credit
providers (NBCPs)–will be published for each participating group alongside its respective drawdown.
5

Only lending to NBCPs “outside” the banking group will be eligible for this specific treatment. Each banking group
will continue to report lending by its NBCP subsidiaries within its total group-level lending figures (intra- group flows
to NBCPs will not count separately for the purposes of the FLS).

have also fallen to historic lows, although pass-through to lending rates has been partial. Mortgage
rates have declined steadily, but rates on unsecured lending to HHs and lending to businesses have
not. Anecdotal evidence suggests that effective rates on new business loans, i.e. once account is
taken of fee reductions, and loan approvals in pipeline, are also beginning to edge down.

The effectiveness of the Scheme with regard to boosting lending volumes is less clear.
The combined net lending of the 40 participating banks has fallen by £1.8 billion in the 9 months
through end-March 2013, with lending to SMEs remaining particularly weak. Cumulative drawings

E. Factors Impacting Effectiveness
7.
Four broad explanations have been preferred for the limited impact of the FLS on
lending volumes, including for SMEs:


Weak/low quality demand for credit: Responsible households are still looking to deleverage,
while bigger/healthier corporate can issue directly into the markets and are less reliant on bank
lending. The only demanders of bank credit may thus be higher-risk borrowers, such as SMEs
and high-LTV first-time home buyers, which banks perceive as poor credit risks, given weak
aggregate demand and earnings prospects, respectively.



Design of capital charge on FLS lending: The Scheme allows banks to offset under Pillar-II, the
regulatory capital charge in respect of FLS-funded loans. However, the offset was done on the
basis of average risk weight, which constituted a de facto incentive for banks to substitute
increase secured lending but reduce SME lending. The April 2013 modification to the Scheme
has addressed this by significantly improving the attractiveness of SME lending.



Health of UK banks: As noted in the PN, there are still some lingering concerns about the health
of UK banks, especially asset quality and the adequacy of existing capital buffers. As a result,
despite being flush with liquidity, banks have eschewed credit origination, persisting with
previous deleveraging plans, and using the cheaper funding to boost net interest margins and,
potentially, ever-greening forborne loans.



Timing issues: The timing of the Bank Asset Quality Review (announced in November 2012, and
published in March 2013) could have prompted some of the larger banks to deleverage faster in
Q4 2012 (see chart above). Also, the British Bankers Association has contended that business
demand for new loans was muted toward year-end due to the availability of £125 billion in
surplus cash and £15 billion in unused credit lines.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

F. Conclusions
8.
The FLS was a timely and innovative policy initiative. Alongside OMT and quantitative
easing, it has helped lower banks’ funding costs since mid-2012, and some of this reduction has
passed through to borrowers. The recent extension in the scheme’s duration is helpful, both in the
face of continuing euro area uncertainties, and because it would enable banks presently undertaking
balance sheet repair (in order to meet BoE's end-2013 capital requirements) to still access funding
under the scheme in 2014. Staff also deems appropriate the new explicit focus on SMEs, which
appear to face the toughest credit constraints, and account for three-fifth of UK employment.
9.
However, in light of continued negative credit growth since the Scheme’s origination,
it is important to keep expectations of FLS effectiveness tempered. There are limits to what
liquidity-easing measures can achieve on their own, in the presence of weak credit demand (a
function of expected future incomes), and banks that are still not strong enough to lend freely. The
removal of these bottlenecks would require a smaller drag from fiscal consolidation, and greater
clarity on the strategy for RBS and LBG.
10.
Going forward, it would be useful for the authorities to review the BoE’s definition of
acceptable collateral, and the haircuts applied to it. Some analysts have suggested that the BoE’s
collateral requirements may be serving as a constraint on lenders’ ability to access the FLS to the
desired extent. Over the coming months, if the authorities determine this to be a factor limiting FLS
effectiveness, there would be a case to consider some relaxation of the requirements.

Annex 6. The UK Housing Market1, 2
Residential property prices in the UK appear to be high, largely owing to stable demand and supplyside constraints. These restrictions have, over the years, translated into sizeable housing supply
shortages and have made residential properties less affordable. Government intervention is needed to
improve the efficiency of the planning system and strengthen the incentives of developers to build
homes. Yet existing housing policies stand to boost the demand for mortgages and dwellings, which
could fuel house prices further and worsen the affordability problem.

A. Supply Constraints and House Price Misalignments
1.
Residential property prices in the UK are elevated relative to incomes and rents.
Although house prices declined significantly during the crisis (13 percent), they have recovered
substantially, reaching near pre-crisis peak values. Moreover, residential property values are
currently about 20 percent above their historical average values of price-to-income and price-torent ratios. 3

This aggregate trend masks some variation across regions. London remains prime real
estate and prices are now 12 percent higher relative to their 2007 peak value. In the South East
region, prices have stabilized at around 4 percent above their pre-crisis peak values. By contrast, in
the rest of Britain house price inflation is zero, although residential values have stabilized at around
6 percent above their trough values.

Supply-side constraints in the residential real estate market and lack of security in the

rental market have made owner-occupied houses structurally less affordable. For decades,
housing starts have fallen short of the level needed to match demand owing to inefficiencies in the
planning framework. This has led to a sizeable shortage of housing, which is currently estimated at
one million homes. In addition, since rental contracts are very short-term and do not offer much
security to tenants, agents have developed a strong preference for home ownership, which has
contributed to maintain a strong demand for owner-occupied houses. These trends have been
accompanied by a continuous increase in the number of years it would take an individual who earns
the average gross disposable income to fully pay-off a house.4

The sluggishness of the planning process has weakened and distorted developers’

incentives to build homes. Land for development is released sluggishly, and the issuance of
building permits is burdensome and time-consuming. This entails risks and constraints that, over
time, have provided large developers with incentives to accumulate and manage land, rather than to
engage in the construction of houses. Large-listed house builders benefited from purchasing land at
fire sales levels during the crisis, while small and medium sized developers continue struggling to
access development finance. The majority of homes (65 percent) are developed by small and
medium-sized housebuilders, who also provide the largest share in terms of employment and value
added in the construction sector. Industry experts estimate that, if SME housebuilders continue to
face difficulty in accessing finance, the shortfall of housing supply could double by 2020.

C. Policy is Stimulating Household Demand
6.
The mortgage market has not yet recovered fully from the crisis. Some indicators
suggest that debt overhang and mortgage distress problems remain.


Mortgage approvals have increased somewhat, but they remain at historically low levels and
approvals for remortgaging remain depressed.



Housing equity withdrawal (HEW) – the
difference between net lending secured on
dwellings and households’ gross investment
in housing – remains at an all time low. While
this indicates continued injections of housing
equity by households, the latter is not
associated with increased mortgage
repayments. Instead, it reflects subdued
housing turnover and remortgaging activity.

However, credit conditions in the mortgage market have eased, owing to the
government’s efforts to stimulate the housing market. Housing schemes, such as NewBuy and
FirstBuy, have increased the availability of high loan-to-value mortgages (see Table 1 for details),
and the Funding for Lending Scheme has improved mortgage credit conditions by reducing bank
funding costs. Measures of quoted fixed-rate mortgages, which make up roughly half of available
mortgage products, have been dropping steadily since June 2012, and mortgage lending continues
to grow. This contrasts with credit market developments in the other sectors of the economy, where
credit is falling and interest rates remain stubbornly high.

Activity in the mortgage and housing markets is expected to continue improving.
Banks perceive that demand for mortgages is increasing and report having loosened the terms and
conditions for this type of lending. Similarly, housebuilders’ expectations about prices and property
sales continue to improve.

Further measures to prop up the housing market could be self-defeating. The
government has launched several schemes to support the housing market (see Table 1) and, in the
2013 Budget, it introduced Help-to-Buy (HtB), which comprises two initiatives: an equity loan and a
mortgage guarantee scheme. Only the equity loan leg of the scheme is targeted to new
builds. Through the guarantee scheme, the government will provide lenders with the option to
purchase a government guarantee that will insure them against the event of default, by
compensating them for a portion of the incurred net losses. The guarantee scheme is not targeted
and can be used to purchase homes with a value of up to £600,000.


HtB is designed to address the lack of financing for high loan to value home buyers, but it is
not clear that an overall failure in the mortgage market exists. Mortgage rates have already

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

97

UNITED KINGDOM

come down impressively, and mortgage lending is the only type of lending that continued
growing during and after the crisis.


While the equity loan leg of HtB could address the housing supply problem (as it is targeted
to new-built homes), experience from previous similar initiatives, like NewBuy, suggests that
the scheme may end up boosting housebuilders’ profits, without materially boosting the
supply of houses. The best way to address the supply problem is through planning reforms,
by inducing banks to lend more to SME housebuilders, or by discouraging large developers
from hoarding land.



The eligibility criterion is broad enough to accommodate London home buyers. This could
increase house prices significantly at the national level, as non credit-constrained buyers
outside of London will benefit from the scheme, and the house value threshold is about
50 percent higher than the average price of residential properties in London.



Similarly, the mortgage guarantee leg of HtB could make housing less affordable by
increasing the demand for houses and mortgages by high-risk borrowers. Since borrowers
benefiting from the scheme are expected to be of poorer credit quality, financial
intermediaries may offer them punitive rates and conditions.



HtB conflicts with macro-prudential policy objectives whereby banks are encouraged to
engage in more prudent lending practices.

D. Conclusions
10.
Unlike other crisis-hit economies, house prices in the UK are currently high relative to
incomes and rents. This phenomenon is largely explained by a relatively healthy demand and
supply-side constraints which have, over the years, widened the demand-supply gap considerably
and made houses unaffordable. Existing housing measures are designed to boost the demand for
high loan-to-value mortgages, which, due to the highly inelastic supply of housing, could lead to
higher residential property prices. To ensure these policies have the desired effect, they should be
complemented with measures that address the shortage of housing. Housing supply stimulus can be
provided through measures that enhance the efficiency of the planning system and increase the
amount of land available for development. Further, demand pressures in the market for owneroccupied houses could be alleviated by making long term private renting more attractive, through
the use of regulations that make rental contracts more secure.

Limitations/Comments
Over the 30 years since the scheme's
introduction sales have drifted up
and down. Research by the Human
City Institute shows that the level of
unemployment, the state of the
housing market and the size of the
council housing stock have been the
key determinants of Right-to-Buy
activity since 1980, rather than the
level of discount. The latter is the key
variable in providing potential
homebuyers with incentives to
purchase a home.

Some banks (Halifax and Barclays)
claimed that borrowers under the
scheme presented a higher risk than
other wise. This induced banks to
charge higher mortgage rates for
borrowers under the scheme (90
basis points higher), which translated
into £1000 pounds per year more for
the borrower.

Annex 7. Real and Financial Spillovers1, 2, 3
A. Spillovers from UK Macroeconomic Policies
We look at how a combined policy package of monetary easing, targeted fiscal stimulus, and structural
reforms could benefit the UK economy, and its effects on other countries. The exercise is done using the
G20MOD model, a multi-country structural macro model of the global economy with individual blocks
for each G20 country and several other regions. In sum, we find that such a policy package would have
positive outward spillovers for the UK’s major trading partners, despite the sterling’s depreciation (see
Figure A7.1).
1.
The exercise starts by matching the path of the WEO projection output gap with a
(temporary) negative demand shock producing an output gap of about -4 percent. In the
baseline, the recovery is slow—the output gap takes 6 years to close—in part because policy rates
are assumed to be constrained by the zero bound and hence there is little scope for traditional
monetary policy easing. Weak demand is associated with higher-than-usual saving rates and a
current account surplus, and puts downward pressure on underlying inflation. With decreasing
nominal demand, public debt to GDP increases, before coming down as nominal GDP rises and the
need for automatic fiscal stabilizers wanes. With nominal rates at the zero bound for 3 years and
lower inflation, real rates are higher, putting additional downward pressure on consumption and
investment. The real exchange rate initially moves in line with real interest differentials.
2.
We sequentially layer growth-supporting policies, starting with monetary stimulus,
extending to temporary fiscal stimulus, and finally immigration and education reforms. In the
first variation, we assume that the central bank adopts unconventional monetary policy measures,
equivalent to a 60 bps easing in policy rates relative to the baseline. In the second variation,
temporary fiscal stimulus is added to the monetary support: 1 percentage point of additional
expenditure on public investment for two years, financed with debt. In the third variation,
immigration reforms are enacted that boost the labor supply by 1½ percent over the course of
4 years, in addition to the fiscal and monetary support. Finally, education reforms are assumed to
boost potential output by 3 percent over a 5-year period from 2016 to 2020.
3.
The impact on the UK’s own growth, cyclical and potential and, hence, public debt
trajectory is favorable. The monetary stimulus has immediate effects, boosting demand by about
1 percent (although the effect dissipates after 5 years). Demand is also boosted by the fiscal
stimulus; in that case the spending on public investment also brings with it permanent increases in
productive potential. The structural reforms only bear slight improvements to output initially, but

have more significant effects later. Inflation is also higher than in the baseline path, reducing real
rates. With greater domestic absorption, the current account surplus is not as large. With higher
nominal output, the increase in the public debt ratio is less than that in the baseline.
4.
The real exchange rate depreciates. The increases in productive potential require a shift in
the terms of UK trade to shift some of the extra production externally—the long-run effect is
therefore a net depreciation. In the short run, positive real exchange rate differentials in the UK
encourage an appreciation from the starting point (i.e. before the negative demand shock), but this
is gradually offset by the policy measures such that the exchange rate is very slightly below its
starting point (and about 2½ percentage points below the baseline level in 2013).

Favorable spillovers to other countries follow from a combination of these effects. By
definition, sterling depreciation requires offsetting real exchange rate appreciation in other
economies. Appreciations are largest in the cases of Canada, India, Russia, and the US. But despite
the appreciation, the improved demand from the UK dominates and the net effect for all countries is
stronger exports than in the baseline.

B. Financial Spillovers
We show that the UK has preserved its status as a major financial center, with its near-50 percent half
share of global cross-border liquidity generation by branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks broadly
unchanged from pre-crisis levels. At the same time, Asian financial centers (Hong Kong and Singapore)
are rising and, together, match the UK’s share. Given that the UK is the reporting home of many global
banks with substantial presence in Asia, this highlights the importance of coordination between UK and
Asian regulators, including in relation to macroprudential capital requirements. We also study the
emerging risks of activity migration to the nonbank sector, showing that UK’s globally-systemically
important banks are now more vulnerable to UK nonbanks. One of the upshots for policy is that
intensive supervision of the UK’s financial system is vital for the safety and soundness of global finance.
The UK remains the world’s leading liquidity hub, but Asian centers are rising
6.
Despite being affected severely by the crisis, the UK has held its position as the most
important global hub for cross-border liquidity generation. A number of subsidiaries and
branches of banks headquartered outside the UK generate and distribute global liquidity (i.e. claims
on non-UK jurisdictions) through the UK. Although the current quantum of such liquidity is half its
pre-crisis peak of US$ 2.8 trillion, it is comparable to 2003-06 levels, and has been broadly stable
since early 2010. Thus, the UK has retained its status as the world’s leading liquidity hub, while the
US and Japan appear to have withdrawn from

Capital requirements for UK’s global banks can generate significant outward spillovers
8.
As the headquarters of several large global banks, the impact of UK regulation will be
transmitted globally. HSBC and Standard Chartered are just two examples of several
internationally-focused banks that have chosen the UK as their reporting home.4 Indeed, the size of
all UK-headquartered MFIs’ outstanding foreign currency assets (£8.1 trillion at end-April 2013) was
2¼ times the size of their sterling assets (£3.7 trillion), and why sound regulation and supervision of
these banks constitutes a global public good. This setting, however, also implies that the imposition
by UK regulators of capital charges tied to UK-headquartered MFIs’ UK operations could end up
significantly impacting the size and distribution of those MFIs’ “global” asset portfolios as well,
insofar as capital requirements are not exclusively met through new capital raising.
9.
It is instructive to attempt an approximate quantification of the impact of new
anticipated capital requirements in the UK. Two new capital charges are expected to apply to UKheadquartered banks over the medium-term, including as part of the new macroprudential
framework: the 2.5 percent charge for globally-systemically important banks, and 2.5 percent
countercyclical capital buffer. In order to broadly size the impact of such requirements, we make use
of recent empirical estimates by Aiyar et al (2013) of the cross-border lending effect of higher capital
charges on UK-headquartered banks (4 percent reduction in lending for a 1 percentage point higher
capital ratio). We extrapolate this to the case of a 2.5 percentage point higher capital requirement
(so a 10 percent impact on cross-border lending), and assume that British banks’ foreign affiliate
claims on nonbanks will be similarly affected as their cross border claims.
10.
The results of the exercise intuitively highlight the importance of UK-headquartered
banks’ global strategies for determining which jurisdictions are affected by how much. For
instance, it is possible that affected UK-headquartered banks respond to higher capital requirements
by adopting option A: reducing their cross-border and affiliate lending in proportion to their
exposure to each economy. This is unlikely, but if it happens, it could tighten domestic credit in Hong
Kong, Singapore and Ireland by over 1 percent. Alternatively the banks could opt for an arguably
more realistic option B: cutting lending to and operations in non-core destinations only, while
protecting top (or largest) 10 destinations. In this case, lending to higher-risk jurisdictions, such as
Egypt, Kenya, Pakistan, Tanzania could drop to zero. Banks can also outright relocate their
headquarters (for instance, HSBC and SCB could decide to relocate to Asia, given that much of their
operations are that jurisdiction any way), but this is not shown below.
11.
This suggests that UK regulators should internalize these outward spillovers, which
could be positive or negative for recipient economies. Whether the identified spillovers are
beneficial or not depends partly on the macroeconomic and financial circumstances prevailing in the
recipient economies. Consider, for instance, the case where the UK imposes counter-cyclical capital
requirements on British banks’ UK exposures to address overheating in the UK economy and banks

differences between the two jurisdictions with regard to home/host supervisory responsibility for application of
prudential and conduct measures.

104 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM

partially meet this requirement by reducing their exposures to a jurisdiction that is also overheating. In this case, the associated reduction in credit in that jurisdiction will clearly constitute a
positive spillover. However, if some banks decided to reduce their exposures to economies already
facing a slowdown, or closed entirely their operations in some non-core jurisdictions, this would
carry significant negative spillovers. To the extent possible, the UK authorities should seek to
consider such impacts before altering micro- or macroprudential policies as they apply to global
banks.

The systemic importance of UK nonbanks is rising
12.
Despite a low aggregate probability of default, the UK banking system’s vulnerability
to the nonbank sector has increased sharply since 2009. The conditional probability of distress
(CoPoD) of the UK banking system given distress in the nonbank sector (mainly insurance
companies) is about 0.5, which seems high, and has doubled from 2009 levels. At this point, we can
only conjecture about underlying reasons: perhaps banks are more reliant on funding from
insurance companies; or insurance companies are helping to shore up a range of asset prices (for
the sovereign, banks and firms) that improves prospects for banks. Notwithstanding this ambiguity,
the results are “interesting” in that they highlight the future systemic risk associated with any
“activity migration” from banks to (lightly-regulated) nonbanks that could result from an asymmetric
tightening of price-based and structural measures for banks. Although only the probability of
distress of UK banks following distress in UK nonbanks is shown below, it is easy to see that there
would be spillovers for non-UK banks and non-banks as well, given the G-SIB status of several UK
banks.
13.
This result is important, because tighter regulation/ring-fencing of banks could lead
significant banking activity and risks to migrate to nonbanks and shadow banks. Vinals et al
(2013, p. 24) notes the clear possibility of regulatory arbitrage in the context of these changes:
“Banks, particularly the internationally active ones, will optimize across different rule books by
moving operations, changing corporate structures, and redesigning products in ways that could
weaken policy effectiveness. This could push risks outside the regulated financial sector into shadow
banks whose regulation and supervision may not be as strong.”
14.
Intensive and pro-active supervision of UK nonbanks and shadow banks is essential to
effectively contain systemic risks. The UK is as vulnerable as any other major jurisdiction to this
risk. And to their credit, the UK authorities have positioned themselves well for these risks by
adopting a “twin-peaks” model where the supervision of all systemic institutions, including insurers,
for instance, is housed in a single agency, the Prudential Regulation Authority. However, the
authorities will need to keep a close watch on the activities of nonbanks that are currently not
deemed systemic, but may be becoming so.

present analysis, estimates were first obtained for the individual
probabilities of distress of the largest UK banks (RBS, Barclays, LBG.
HSBC and SCB) and nonbank financial institutions, mainly insurers:
Aviva, Legal & General, Old Mutual, Prudential, Royal & Sun Alliance
and Standard Life. The multivariate density of the combined UK
financial system (banks + NBFIs) was then sliced to derive conditional
probabilities of distress (using Bayes’ theorem).

Impact of transparency and anti-money laundering initiatives
15.
In the context of its G8 presidency objectives, the UK aims at improving entity transparency
and mobilizing the AML framework to foster tax compliance but which may generate outward
spillovers. In addition to supporting the inclusion of tax crimes as a predicate offense to money
laundering, the authorities seek to improve the transparency of companies’ and trusts’ ownership
both in the UK and in British overseas territories and Crown dependencies. These developments may
necessitate economic adjustment in these jurisdictions and could generate spillovers on other
financial centers as a consequence of the transmission of UK regulation through global banks
located in the UK.

Annex 8. FSAP Update: Status of Main Recommendations1
The authorities have made progress in implementing the recommendations of the 2011 FSAP
Update, which emphasized the need to intensify supervision and provide it with sufficient
resources. The new regulatory architecture announced in late 2010 came into operation on April 1,
2013, The Financial Services Authority (FSA) ceased to exist, and was replaced by the Prudential
Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). As the new structure is now in
operation, many of the FSAP recommendations are being addressed. The continued implementation
of the recommendations will require significant staff resources for both the PRA and FCA, and better
coordination with the macroprudential authority—the Financial Policy Committee (FPC). (The Bank
of England—responsible for the Financial Stability mandate.)

The commencement of the Financial Services Act 2012 (Act) on 1 April 2013
implemented the Authorities commitment to strengthen the financial regulatory
structure in the UK. The Act seeks to clarify the mandates and objectives of the
FPC, PRA and FCA. The legislation includes:

Overall Financial Sector Oversight
Revise the legal framework to clarify
mandates and include a specific financial
stability mandate for the prudential
authorities (HMT, BoE, PRA, and FCA).

• The establishment of a macro-prudential authority, the Financial Policy
Committee (FPC), within the Bank of England. It has two key objectives: to
protect and enhance the stability of the UK financial system (Financial Stability
objective) and, subject to that, to support the Government’s economic policy
(including, supporting growth and employment). The FPC contributes to the
financial stability objective by identifying, monitoring and taking action to
mitigate systemic risks. The FPC also has powers of direction and
recommendation over the PRA and FCA with regard to macro-prudential
measures. The Treasury has the power under the Act to recommend, annually, to
the FPC matters related to achieving its dual objectives of financial stability and
support for the economy, as well as matters with regard to exercising its
functions.
The Act does not contain explicit provisions to safeguard the independence of
the FPC. Ensuring FPC independence, while maintaining its accountability to
parliament and the public, remains important and requires close monitoring.
Additional provisions to safeguard FPC independence should be considered as
part of future delegated or secondary legislation.

• The Act enshrines transfer of responsibility for prudential regulation of banks,
insurers and major investment firms to a new regulator, the Prudential

UNITED KINGDOM

The Act has provisions which require the FPC to act in a way that does not
prejudice the work of the PRA and FCA. The Act also provides the FPC the power
to override those provisions if it believes that meeting its twin objectives (see
above) would be compromised if it did not impinge on the work of the PRA and
FCA.

Timeframe

Status
Regulation Authority (PRA) as a subsidiary of the Bank of England. The PRA’s
statutory objectives are to promote the safety and soundness of firms and
contribute to current and future policyholder protection. The PRA advances
these objectives by setting out expectations that firms should meet. It supervises
firms against these expectations by using a judgment-based approach, and one
that is both forward-looking and focused on the key risks posed to the stability
of the UK financial system.
The addition of the insurance objective for the PRA helps to address the
important issues that arise from the prudential regulation of insurance
companies.. However, the specification in the Act to protect future policy holders
raises some issues that should be clarified by the PRA. For how long will this
future protection extend (1, 5 or 10 years)? The PRA and FCA should further
clarify whether there is unhelpful overlap between FCA objectives and remit of
conduct regulation, for example, in relation to misselling of products including to
those who may become future policy holders whose protection would be under
PRA prudential remit.
The Act also does not provide an explicit and symmetric protection to current
and future deposit holders. While this may be argued as being covered under
the general financial stability objective, ensuring financial stability is not the
same as ensuring no adverse impact on deposit holders. There remains in the
Act an appearance, at least, of an asymmetry of protection of two types of
consumers. This asymmetry should be clarified by the PRA, and tackled through
future secondary legislation.
• The Act also signals the creation of a new conduct of business regulator – the
FCA. The FCA is responsible for the retail and wholesale conduct supervision of
around 25,000 firms across all sectors of the financial services industry and the
prudential supervision of 23,000 firms (those that are not prudentially regulated
by the PRA). The FCA aims to ensure that business across financial services and
markets is conducted in a way that advances the interests of all users and
participants. Under the Act, the FCA deals with financial stability concerns
through its integrity objective which includes within it the 'soundness, stability
and resilience' of the UK financial system. It has an important role to play in

infrastructure (including its prudential soundness and operational resilience);
oversight of participant conduct on organized trading venues and OTC markets;
and the conduct and prudential supervision of major trading firms not
supervised by the PRA and asset management activity. Unlike for the PRA, the
Act does not explicitly and separately define a financial stability objective for the
FCA. This raises the prospect of tensions that may arise when PRA prudential and
systemic concerns may override consumer protection issues in the case of failing
institutions.
While the existence of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) exists between
the Treasury, BoE, PRA, and FCA as required by the Act - to facilitate
coordination and communication between the respective institutions there
remain concerns that at certain times the MoU may become less operationally
effective. The PRA could use its power of veto over the FCA when the PRA’s
financial stability objective is impacted upon. However, this also represents a
potential source of tension between the two agencies.

HMT has remarked that secondary legislation will support the extended powers

It is clear that progress has been made to strengthen the UK regulatory
architecture, notwithstanding the need for enhancements (see above). The need
to adhere to European legislation will be important and may require further
changes to UK legislation. Changes to UK legislation may also follow from
various agreed approaches on financial regulation and supervisory practices

Indeed the policy statement by the PRA provides a non-exhaustive list of

Near term

Both the PRA and FCA are self financing from levies on regulated firms.
However, each of the regulators will need to consider the resources they need to
deliver their objectives on an ongoing basis.
As part of its judgment-based supervisory model, the PRA allocates resources to
regulated firms based on the potential impact they pose to its statutory
objectives. Consequently, the most significant (or Category 1) firms are subject
to a much higher intensity of supervision than firms in lower categories. As
outlined in the PRA’s approach documents, 250 (out of 600) supervisory staff are
allocated to the c25 Category 1 firms.
The UK authorities have remarked that judgment-based supervision is also
supported by teams with relevant skills and experience, as well as by engaging
senior management and the PRA Board more closely in taking key supervisory
decisions. This provides the PRA with the appropriate skills, resources and
framework to engage constructively with the UK’s new macro-prudential
arrangements centered on the FPC.

The PRA has moved from one-off reviews to continuous monitoring, and both

Establish a forum for ensuring good
governance and coordination among
organizations in the new regulatory
structure (HMT, BoE, PRA, and FCA).

High

Near term

The Financial Services Act 2012 (including the changes to FSMA) has established
a range of requirements and mechanisms relating to coordination between the
new regulatory authorities. These include requirements for the regulators to
consult each other when (for example) making rules, supported by a broader
duty to coordinate their functions whenever their actions might have an adverse
effect on each others’ objectives, and a requirement on the PRA and FCA to
establish an MoU covering matters of common regulatory interest. This has
been published.
The PRA-FCA MoU requires each regulator to appoint a senior executive
responsible for coordination; these appointees will meet quarterly to review the
effectiveness and efficiency of coordination and cooperation. For the first year,
this will be the respective CEOs – these meetings have been held, initially
between the designate CEOs, since the summer of 2012.
The respective management teams are clear that publishing this MoU is
insufficient, and that they must also ensure that staff is aware of its existence and
contents, and that it is adhered to and reviewed. Moreover, the teams are also
clear that they are responsible for fostering a culture of cooperation between
their respective organizations.

Under the terms of the MoU ,the FCA and PRA share data on firms, both dual
regulated and in some cases non-dual regulated, in order to maintain a
complete view of the market. Both organizations are required to publish a
summary of coordination performance in their annual reports.
Coordination between the PRA and the FCA is assisted by the membership of
their CEOs on each other’s board. The FCA, PRA and Bank are also voting
members of the FPC. At a working level, there are dedicated teams responsible
for coordinating analysis, and sharing information, across the FPC, FCA and PRA.
Across the respective supervision divisions, regular communication between the
FCA and PRA is maintained, in particular where the FCA and PRA share a direct
regulatory interest in dual-regulated firms and firms that are part of dualregulated groups. This is achieved through a number of mechanisms including,
supervisory colleges which bring together the respective supervision teams for
dual-regulated firms and groups from the PRA and FCA. Colleges are held at
regular intervals and the frequency is dependent on the category of the firm
involved.
A distinct FCA/PRA MoU covers the area of insurance with-profits policies, while

Coordination is vital for the operational effectiveness of PRA, FCA, FPC, BoE and
HMT, individually and collectively, and will require continuous monitoring.
Equally, continuous monitoring should also apply to governance arrangements
across the organizations in the new regulatory structure. Specifically, the PRA has
moved decision-making to high-level committees compared to the FSA where
decisions were taken at lower levels. While senior management engagement is
welcome in the supervisory process it should seek primarily to support staff
assessments, should be subject to reasonable checks, and should avoid secondguessing staff recommendations.
Enforce public disclosure by banks and
insurance and securities firms, including
prudential returns as appropriate (PRA).

High

Near term

PRA is reviewing disclosure requirements in the context of the work of the
Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF). The major UK banks have all made a
commitment to implement the recommendations of the EDTF this year.
In the context of European banking legislation, national rules on prudential
regulatory reporting will be deleted or amended following public consultation in
Q3 2013. The FCA will then deliver a system to receive prudential data from
banks, building societies and investment firms under the new European
reporting framework. The first reporting period is scheduled for Q1 2014.
Given the size and global significance of the UK financial sector, strengthening
disclosure by publishing prudential returns and firms’ own disclosures should be
a priority. The mission team remains unclear as to whether the PRA and FCA are
actively considering publication of prudential returns. The PRA has only
committed itself to examining the case for publication. Staff believes the PRA
could signal a more committed view of the importance of prudential disclosure

Moreover, while EDTF disclosure requirements are welcome, the PRA should see
these as a starting point for further improving disclosures by UK banks. The PRA
should provide clear guidance to firms on increasing the comprehensiveness and
transparency of their accounting and risk information to more granular and
consistent levels. More regular and consistent reporting at granular risk levels
related to banks Pillar III reporting should also be required.

Amend risk-based assessment
methodologies to ensure adequate
assessment of AML/CFT risk (FCA).

High

Near term

The FCA's financial crime remit directly impacts two of three of their operational
objectives: market integrity and consumer protection. The FCA focus will be on
protecting consumers as potential victims of financial crime, and to the use of
firms as a conduit for financial crime rather than protecting firms themselves as
potential victims. The FCA will also target firms that pose the highest financial
crime risks.
The Financial Action Task Force’s last evaluation of the UK (in 2007) stated that
the UK had comprehensive anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing
of terrorism (CFT) systems in place.

The 2011 FSAP recommendation and FCA update to the IMF on amending their
risk-based assessment methodology of AML/CFT will state that this is a dynamic
process and the Financial Crime and Intelligence Department is currently rolling
out a strategy to ensure that the FCA are a risk based and proportionate
supervisor of financial crime.

In 2011 the FSA published the Financial Crime Guide for firms, which is a
collection of good and poor practice throughout the regulated sector. This guide
assists in increasing standards in the regulated sector while also demonstrating

financial crime supervisors to have issued such guidance and to continue to
produce thematic/horizontal reviews which detail good and poor practice each
year.

Banking Oversight
Enhance supervision by (i) conducting
detailed reviews of credit and market risk
assessment by banks, (ii) conducting
verification and selected model
replication reviews on a proactive basis,
(iii) better integrating specialist work into
the supervision programme, and (iv)
enhancing peer analysis (PRA).

High

Near term

The PRA has developed a supervisory model that aims to address some of these
points. The model designates firms as Category 1-5, according to their size, level
of complexity and the impact their failure would have on the financial system.
The supervisory assessment framework for the largest banks (Category 1) is
systematic, proactive, and multi-year, which should lead to a continuous regime
of firm assurance that is more judgment-based and forward-looking than existed
previously.
The PRA—also drawing on the work across the BoE—makes use of a range of
‘top down’ analysis, including sector and ‘peer group’ analysis. At the same time,
PRA supervisors, risk specialists and policy staff are necessarily engaged in a
range of ‘bottom up’ analyses. These approaches will often be complementary.
The recent asset quality review that fed into the FPC’s assessment of UK bank
capital needs provided a valuable opportunity to employ a combination of ‘top
down’ risk analysis and ‘bottom up’ portfolio assessments to arrive at
conservative valuation assessments.
While the recent asset quality review did provide an opportunity to employ a
combination of top-down and bottom-up assessments of firms’ asset quality, the
mission team believes that further work will be required to ensure the authorities
do not prioritize one approach over the other and will need to further enhance
the communication of messages from these approaches.
To support the judgment-based forward-looking approach, the PRA is
committed to greater senior management involvement in supervision, including

engagement with the senior management of regulated institutions. Business
model analysis forms an important part of the PRA’s approach. The PRA
examines the threats to the viability of a firm’s business model, and the way in
which a firm could create adverse effects on other participants in the system by
the way in which it carries on its business. Peer analysis forms an important part
of this assessment.
The PRA supervisory assessment framework sets out how supervisors construct a
multi-year plan to assess the different areas of risk across individual
firms/groups. This includes testing of credit and market risk. For the larger firms,
the continuous assessment program includes asset quality reviews and valuation
reviews.
Interaction with banks at board level is reported to be more frequent and
conducted at a more senior level. It will focus on the key messages and ensure
firms understand the PRA’s concerns and are fully engaged in addressing them.
The PRA approach has been designed to offer a, long-term methodology for
addressing prudential risks comprehensively. However given that the PRA is a
new organization, the development of a resilient supervisory model will have to
be continuously refined in light of operational experience.

In addition, the supervisory assessment framework aims to link better capital and
liquidity assessments to a bank’s overall risk assessment. The different elements
of capital analysis are brought together under one overall approach.
The PRA has determined that the most resource-effective approach to Internal
Ratings Based (IRB) credit model validation is to review the firm’s model
documentation, assessing both the development process and outputs of the

Under the old FSA model, supervisory and risk specialist staff were separated,

validation process, rather than to undertake model replication.
In addition, the PRA has determined that the most resource-effective approach
to CAD & IMM (market & counterparty credit risk) model validation is to:
• Assess model governance and validation process, both in terms of design &
execution
• Review the firm’s model documentation
• Assess the model development process
• Assess model outputs of the proposed model
On an exceptional basis, where the PRA has doubts regarding a model that could
have a material systemic impact, the PRA would build their own model as a
benchmark against which to test those used by firms.
The mission team has already identified (above) that staffing levels remain a
concern with regard to key areas of work by the PRA and FCA, specifically with
regard to the assessment of data provided by firms, specialist risk assessment of
corporate loan portfolios, stress testing enhancements, movement from
sequential to parallel asset quality reviews of firms, more staffing to monitor, and
undertake in-house analytical work on network of OTC derivative exposures,
and early warning indicators; and analytical work on high-frequency
finance/trading.
Moreover, concerns remain that PRA work on IRB model validation focuses
essentially on reviewing documentation rather than appropriate bench-testing
with hypothetical portfolios. The mission team is also unclear how the previous
model of determining supervisory intensity has changed. Is the ARROW (old FSA
Advanced Risk-Responsive Operating Framework) risk framework utilized for this
purpose? Has it been replaced or amended to reflect the new supervisory
judgment led intensive and intrusive forward-looking approach? Finally, while

Adopt a proactive intervention

Medium

Medium term

The PRA has developed a Proactive Intervention Framework (PIF). This framework
supports the early identification of risks to a firm’s viability and seeks to ensure
that firms take appropriate remedial action to reduce the probability of failure. A
core part of the process is to identify actions that the authorities need to take in
advance in order to prepare for the failure and resolution of a firm, including
coordination with the Special Resolution Unit (SRU) and FSCS as resolution
authority and operator of the deposit guarantee scheme, respectively. To ensure
appropriate internal oversight, where it is proposed that actions expected in a
particular PIF stage should not be taken, supervisors will report to PRA senior
management.
The PIF has five clearly demarcated stages. The judgment on where to place a
firm within a particular stage is based on an assessment of the firm’s viability in
both current and future states of the world. The system does not rely
mechanically on backward-looking indicators.
The assessment of where a firm sits in the PIF is undertaken as part of the
ongoing supervisory process. It can be reviewed in response to specific concerns
arising in the external environment in which a firm operates — for example, in
response to a sector-specific risk identified by the FPC.

Along with other parts of the supervisory framework, the PIF has been
implemented recently and therefore the PRA will be able, going forward, to draw
on its implementation experience.

UNITED KINGDOM

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 121

If the PRA judges risks to a firm’s viability to be low, the firm will be in Stage 1 of
the PIF. This implies a normal level of supervisory monitoring and actions. As a
firm moves through each stage of the PIF, the intensity of supervisory
monitoring and the intrusiveness of supervisory actions will increase, and
contingency planning by the SRU and the FSCS will be stepped up.

articulated judgment-based, prompt intervention framework has to ensure that

respected within the current governance framework.

Develop a comprehensive plan to

High

Near term

The PRA has embarked on a prudential data strategy, which covers the data
collected from regulated firms. The overall aim of the strategy is to ensure that
prudential data meet user requirements and support the PRA’s approach to
supervision, in particular facilitate supervisory assessments based on evidence
and analysis. The data strategy will deliver a classification system for prudential
data collected by the PRA, with systematic reviews of the prudential data
inventory and data requirements. The strategy will also ensure that the quality
of PRA data and analytics to examine the data are fit for purpose and establish a
clear governance structure to determine whether proposed new data collections
should be implemented.
The mission team remains concerned that for the PRA (and indeed FCA) to carry
out it data management strategy will require additional personnel than currently
budgeted for. Staff has yet to see whether the assessment of firms’ own data
management systems meet PRA and FCA requirements under their data strategy.
As data cleansing will be carried out by the statistics section of the BoE, this may
mean an increased burden without a concomitant increase in resources.
Moreover there is also a need to meet European requirements (e.g. COREP).

Insurance Sector Oversight
Extend the new intrusive risk-based
approach to supervision to a wider range
of insurers (PRA).

High

Near term

The PRA has asserted that the reclassification of firms under the new model
(Categories 1-5) means that more insurers are subject to more intensive
supervision (Category 1 and 2) than the number of insurers covered in the
previous program. This was intended to meet the FSAP’s concerns that insurers
just below the previous CPP(I) threshold were insufficiently supervised.
While the mission team would agree that written documentation suggests that

more insurers are covered in the new intrusive risk-based approach to
supervision, it was unable to verify this assertion fully with the PRA or with

how many more insurers this involves and/or what coverage of the insurance
sector is now under the new intrusive risk-based approach to supervision.

PRA remarked that supervisors are able to call on the resources of in-house risk
specialists; they can also require a firm to employ external specialists to prepare
reports into any aspect of a firm’s business that may require further attention or
be a source of concern. Both options can be deployed to engage in on-site
testing. However, the PRA does not engage in routine ‘random’ transaction
testing but instead targets specialist resource on the basis of materiality and risk.
However, the answer to this question depends on the definition of ‘random’ as
for the larger firms, the continuous assessment programs include asset quality
and valuation reviews which could be regarded as transaction level examinations.
The mission team, without further granular information, is unable to make an
assessment of whether asset quality and valuation reviews suffice as transaction
level examinations. Moreover, PRA judgments are made on basis of materiality
and risk which detract from a pure random transaction examination of large and
small insurers. The mission team also remains concerned that small insurers are
unlikely to be selected or fully assessed for risk given the selective and directed
approach of the PRA.

the market integrity objective lacks transparency with regard to FCA’s financial
stability responsibilities.

Increase intensity of supervision with
greater use of “bottom up” analysis of
firm operations using on-site
examinations, including thematic work,
to supplement the “top down” risk

High

Medium term

The FCA supervisory model is designed to support a judgment-based and preemptive approach that is focused on delivering the FCA’s statutory objectives.
This is delivered through a risk based and proportionate supervisory approach
recognizing the diversity of the regulated firm population. The FCA supervises
approximately 25,000 firms including retail and wholesale firms across all
financial services industry sectors.
The first element of supervision is proactive firm specific supervision. This
involves elements such as business model and strategy analysis and on-site
assessments. The intensity of FCA approach depends on the firm categorization
and is proportionate to the potential impact of the firm on FCA objectives. The
higher impact firms (122 groups) are subject to a continuous assessment
approach, which involves a regular program of business model analysis,
meetings, information review and on-site assessments.
The remaining firms have a more sector based approach with less regular firm
specific engagement on a proactive basis. However, the tools used for the
supervision of small firms such as peer group analysis and firm questionnaires
are designed to identify those firms with outlier business models and therefore
assisting with the prioritization of work. As a minimum, all firms should have a
touch point with the FCA at least once every 4 years.
The FCA supervision model includes an increased focus on thematic
work. Thematic work allows the FCA to address risks that are common to more
than one firm and potentially more than one sector. It is based on sector risk
analysis which aims to identify what is currently or prospectively causing poor
outcomes for consumers or market participants. Thematic work usually involves
visiting a range of firms, across all firm categories, to carry out detailed work on
a specific area or product. It can use the full range of supervisory tools, such as

UNITED KINGDOM

124 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Priority

Timeframe

Status
on-site assessments, file reviews, interviews with senior management, consumer
research. Any project findings and remedial action is usually extended to all firms
that may be affected by the risk in question not just those directly involved in
the work, thereby mitigating risks at a sector or market level.
While FCA’s supervisory approach reflects the diverse and large number of firms
it supervises (for both conduct and prudential reasons) and the expansion of
thematic reviews, outlier analysis and a minimum touch-point requirement are
all useful, there are still a large number of firms with low and or weak contact.
Moreover the FCA and PRA current supervisory approach may not be able to
adequately capture that smaller, less intensively supervised firms could on
occasion have systemic and reputational impacts on other firms, markets and
products beyond their own operations. Adequate oversight, generally, of small
firms remains a concern given the large number of firms the FCA is prudentially
responsible for and the constraints on resources and analysis applied to their
supervision.

UNITED KINGDOM

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 125

Rather than requiring committed credit lines from banks (which the authorities
deem to be counterproductive or even unreliable in a stressed situation) the
Bank of England requires CCPs to hold cash, potentially supplemented with
other highly liquid collateral, to meet the minimum regulatory liquidity needs set
out in the revised CPSS/IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures and
reflected in the EU regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and
trade repositories (EU/648/2012) “EMIR”, which will apply to CCPs as they are
authorized under EMIR. The main UK CCPs have right of re-use to cash margins
provided by members, giving them access to an extensive pool of liquidity that is
not available to CCPs that do not have such rights of reuse.

Timeframe

Status
While liquidity standards are in line with CPSS/IOSCO standards there will need
to be clarification by authorities concerning cash margin re-use by UK CCPs.
Cash margin re-use could pose potential financial stability risks, thereby
endangering both the CCP and its own participants.

Develop contingency plans to deal with a
potential failure of a CCP (BoE, FSA).

High

Near term

The UK has been developing a recovery and resolution framework for CCPs. In
December 2012, primary legislation was passed on resolution of CCPs, under the
Financial Services Act 2012. The key features of this regime are: transfer powers
(similar to the stabilization powers in the UK’s banking resolution regime) with
regard to the business of a CCP in resolution; an enhanced power of direction
enabling the Bank of England to direct UK CCPs to take action on financial
stability grounds; and a power of direction by the Bank of England over the
administrator of an insolvent UK CCP. The resolution regime for CCPs does not
contain a bail-in tool and is currently constrained from having a power to closeout of contracts in resolution by the EU's Financial Collateral Arrangements
Directive.
Since the FSAP conclusions were published on 3 August 2011, the BoE and FSA
have worked with UK CCPs to ensure they have loss allocation rules in place to
address the situation in which they face a loss greater than the size of their
financial resources available in a default, with the aim of continuing to provide
clearing services for as long as possible.
HMT is expected to publish in Q2 2013 secondary legislation requiring UK CCPs
to introduce loss allocation rules to address how they will deal with a loss that is
greater than their existing financial resources. UK CCPs will also have to
introduce plans to deal with non-default losses that could lead to the CCP’s
insolvency.
In line with this regulatory requirement, the Bank of England will require CCPs to
refine some of the loss allocation rules that have been introduced or prepared
during 2012 and 2013, and put new rules in place for remaining services where
they have not yet been implemented. The Bank requires all new services with

The Bank offers settlement facilities (in sterling and euro) to CCPs.
It would be useful for authorities to clarify whether this involves access to
liquidity facilities more generally.

Near term

The BoE is the regulator of recognized payment systems, securities settlement
systems and central counterparties in the UK. The Bank monitors concentration
of banks’ payment and settlement activities, and regularly shares data and liaises
with the PRA on supervised firms where appropriate.

Since last year’s update the BoE has formally taken over as overseer of payment
system activity, and additional moves have been made to reduce the
concentration of payment system clearing by encouraging new member
participation (see above). However apart from these changes there is little
additional work undertaken from last year’s report on fully addressing
concentration of bank’s payment and settlement activity. Further work on

Since the FSAP, the Bank has sought to reduce the degree of concentration in
the provision of access to the CHAPS large value system. As a result, CHAPS has
introduced rules which prevent members settling for indirect participants where
that relationship presents systemic risk, and one large indirect participant has
joined, reducing concentration and the degree of ‘tiering’ in the CHAPS network.
A number of other non-members have committed to join over the next three
years. EUI, operator of the securities settlement system CREST, has also begun
analyzing data on ‘tiering’ and is discussing settlement bank status with the few
large members of CREST that are not already settlement banks.

through secondary legislation later this year, will extend the scope of the
resolution regime for deposit-takers in the Banking Act 2009 to include
investment firms, central counterparties (CCPs), and related group companies
(including the financial holding companies of banks). The Treasury is also
currently consulting with industry on a proposal to introduce a special
administration regime for the operators of systemically important payment and
settlement systems. The FSB is currently revising annexes of the international
standard Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes to specify how those
standards apply, in particular, to insurers, to Financial Market Infrastructures, and
with respect to the treatment of client assets in resolution. The UK authorities
anticipate that this will be reflected in the European Commission’s legislative
proposal on non-bank resolution, possibly in late 2013, which may require the
UK further to improve its resolution framework for non-banks. However
uncertainty still remains regarding the timing of this proposal as well as the
proposal for an EU bank resolution framework. Moreover the proposed EU bank
recovery and Resolution Directive, which establishes a harmonized framework for
the resolution of banks, would require changes to the UK bank resolution
framework to be fully consistent with the EU directive.
The mission team is encouraged with UK progress and the coordination with
international practices on resolution tools and framework. Secondary legislation

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with
the United Kingdom
On July 15, 2013 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the United Kingdom. 1
Economic recovery in the UK continues to be slow and fragile, as domestic deleveraging
pressures remain and external demand is weak. Economic activity is projected to recover
going forward, but the pace of expansion is expected to be weak relative to the scale of
underutilized resources. As a result, the output gap is projected to remain sizeable for an
extended period, portending the risk that continued cyclical weakness will lead to a
permanent loss in the economy’s productive capacity. Inflation has remained stubbornly
above the two percent target, owing largely to increases in administered and policy-driven
prices. Underlying inflation is, however, modest. Against the backdrop of a large output gap,
inflation is expected to decline to the 2-percent target over the medium term. Risks to this
central scenario remain to the downside, including from a reemergence of financial stress in
the euro area and larger-than-expected headwinds from public and private sector
deleveraging.
Current polices aim to rebalance the economy and strengthen financial stability. Significant
progress has been made toward reducing fiscal risks, notably through front-loaded
consolidation. In light of weak recovery, however, the pace of structural fiscal consolidation
slowed in FY 2012/13 (April-March), while flexibility in the fiscal program allowed
automatic stabilizers to operate fully. Current fiscal plans envisage additional discretionary
fiscal tightening of £10 billion in FY 2013/14, and will result in an acceleration of the pace of
structural consolidation.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
First Deputy Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and
this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up
can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Monetary policy in the UK has been highly accommodative to help bolster the recovery. In
addition to cutting the policy rate aggressively, the Bank of England has engaged in
Quantitative Easing, amounting to a cumulative £375 billion (about a ¼ of gross domestic
product), and, jointly with the Her Majesty’s Treasury, launched the Funding for Lending
Scheme, aimed at lowering bank funding costs. The transmission of accommodative
monetary policy to credit has, however, only been partially successful. Mortgage rates have
declined sharply and corporate bond and equity markets have recovered strongly. But bank
lending, notably to sectors of the economy unable to post high-quality collateral, such as
small and medium size enterprises (SMEs), remains very weak, as bank balance sheets
remain impaired.
To advance financial sector repair, the authorities have recently conducted an Asset Quality
Review and laid out plans to strengthen banks’ capital position. The financial regulatory
structure has also being revamped, with the establishment of three new bodies—the
Prudential Regulation Authority, Financial Conduct Authority, and Financial Policy
Committee—aimed at bolstering financial stability.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, despite recent signs of increasing momentum, growth
prospects remain weak as the economy moves to rebalance away from public to private
demand, and from domestic to external demand. Directors underscored that restoring growth
and rebalancing the economy are vital to improving incomes, ensuring debt sustainability,
and returning the banking sector to good health, and supported a multi-pronged policy
strategy to achieve these objectives.
Directors welcomed the accommodative stance of monetary policy. Many Directors agreed
that monetary policy should remain accommodative and further efforts should be made to
ease credit conditions. Many other Directors were skeptical about the effectiveness of
additional policy easing and called for a careful analysis of costs and benefits of further
measures. Directors welcomed the extension of the Funding for Lending Scheme and its
recent modifications to strengthen incentives for banks and non-banks to lend to small and
medium enterprises.
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to medium-term fiscal consolidation and
welcomed progress in reducing fiscal risks and ensuring the sustainability of public debt.
Most Directors underscored the importance of keeping fiscal consolidation on track to
preserve credibility, not least in light of the persistent weakness of the fiscal position.
However, a number of other Directors noted that slow growth could undermine the
credibility of the adjustment effort and called for additional flexibility within the context of
the medium-term fiscal framework, including by bringing forward capital investment.

3

Noting that the effectiveness of monetary policy is undermined by persisting weaknesses in
the banking system, Directors welcomed the steps taken to enhance the resilience of the
financial system and encouraged the authorities to proceed rapidly on financial sector repair.
In particular, they emphasized the need for banks to meet identified capital shortfalls without
delay. Going forward, Directors noted that it would be important that the planned
system-wide bank stress tests cover a broad range of risks, employ stringent scenarios, and
include supervisor approved capital plans. Directors called for a clear strategy for the two
state-intervened banks, including returning them to private ownership.
Directors welcomed recent progress in improving the regulatory and supervisory framework.
They stressed the importance of ensuring the operational independence of regulatory and
supervisory authorities and of greater coordination among these bodies. Directors
emphasized that adequate resources and appropriate tools should be provided to support an
intensive supervision of globally-systemic financial institutions.
Directors underscored the need for structural banking reforms to proceed apace. They
welcomed the authorities’ intention to reduce systemic risk by introducing ring-fencing, but
noted that its effectiveness would depend on global cooperation on cross-border supervisory
and bank resolution frameworks. Directors agreed that the supervision of financial
institutions outside the ring-fence should also be strengthened to prevent regulatory arbitrage
and the potential migration of risks to these entities.
Directors underscored the importance of further efforts on structural reforms to help the
economy move toward a more dynamic and robust structure. They agreed that measures to
improve the economy’s skills base and competitiveness would enhance the economy’s
productive capacity while supporting demand in the near term.

Statement by Mr. Steve Field, Executive Director for the United Kingdom
July 15, 2013
I thank staff for a very productive mission and a detailed Article IV report. My authorities
agree with much of the staff analysis, note the conclusion that policy responses to restore
growth and rebalance the UK economy are “not straightforward” and endorse the
recommendation that a multi-pronged strategy is required to address economic and financial
problems that have built up over many years.
Economic Outlook
Over the last year, the UK economic recovery has continued to be subdued and uneven but
the economic news has been better in recent months.
GDP growth was only 0.2 per cent in 2012. Domestic demand was actually stronger than
forecast, with much of the weakness attributable to net trade, which in turn reflects weakness
in the UK’s key export markets. Independent analysis by the Office for Budget
Responsibility (OBR) explains that “the unexpectedly poor performance of exports is more
than sufficient on its own to explain the shortfall”.
In March, the OBR forecast a steady return to growth of 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2013. Since
then, the economy has shown signs of improvement and the average of independent forecasts
for GDP growth has now risen to 0.9 per cent. GDP growth in Q1 was 0.3 per cent and recent
official and survey data for the services, construction and manufacturing sectors leads most
external forecasters to anticipate stronger growth in Q2. Overall, this gives some indication
that momentum is building.
Crucially, private sector jobs are still being created. According to the OBR, the picture on
employment “continues to surprise on the upside”. Employment is now at record levels,
432,000 higher than a year ago, while unemployment has fallen further and currently stands
at 7.8 per cent. Since early 2010 an additional 1.3 million private sector jobs have been
created, more than offsetting the fall in public sector employment of 423,000. Given these
trends, the risks of hysteresis should not be overstated.
CPI inflation rose to 2.7 per cent in May, up from 2.4 per cent in April, but is still down to
roughly half the level it was at its peak in September 2011. In May, the Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC) judged that inflation was likely to remain well above the 2 per cent target
for the rest of the year, reflecting external price pressures and administered and regulated
prices. That said, inflation is still expected to fall back to target over time, as external price
pressures fade and a gradual revival in productivity growth curbs increases in domestic costs.

There is some way to go before we see a strong and sustainable recovery. This reflects the
ongoing domestic and external challenges, and the fact that the UK was hit harder than most
countries by the financial crisis, following a decade of unbalanced and unsustainable growth.
The Government’s strategy is designed to protect the economy through this period of global
uncertainty, maintain market confidence and lay the foundations for stronger, more balanced
growth. As recommended by the IMF, my authorities are taking a multi-pronged approach.
This is focused on: monetary activism; deficit reduction; structural reform; and reform of the
financial sector.
Monetary activism
Monetary policy continues to play a critical role in supporting the economy and provides the
first line of defense against external shocks. The MPC has maintained Bank Rate at 0.5 per
cent over the past year. Given the potential impact on bank and building society profitability,
the view continues to be that further rate reductions could be counterproductive, potentially
inhibiting their ability to lend and impairing the functioning of money markets. The stock of
asset purchases also remains unchanged since mid-2012 at £375bn. The MPC will continue
to review this position in light of the latest developments.
In March, the Government reviewed the monetary policy framework and updated the MPC’s
remit. The new remit reaffirms the MPC’s primary objective of a 2 per cent inflation target
within a flexible inflation-targeting framework. Moreover, it clarifies the Government’s
expectation of the Committee in terms of the judgements it must make in forming and
communicating the trade-offs that are inherent in setting monetary policy to meet a forwardlooking inflation target while giving due consideration to output volatility. It also makes clear
that the use of all necessary unconventional policy tools to maintain price stability and secure
the recovery is available to the MPC, if judged necessary. The Chancellor has also requested
that the MPC provides an assessment of the merits of using intermediate thresholds in its
August 2013 Inflation Report.
In addition to pursuing a highly accommodative monetary policy, the Funding for Lending
Scheme (FLS) was launched in July 2012 to reduce banks’ funding costs and boost their
lending to households and businesses. Since its introduction banks’ funding costs have fallen,
and by more than their European counterparts. There is also evidence that this is being
passed on to consumers: interest rates have come down on mortgages, unsecured personal
loans, and loans to businesses of all sizes. And while the improvement in credit conditions
will take time to feed through to lending volumes, net lending is expected to pick up
modestly in the remainder of this year. In contrast, the expectation prior to the introduction of
the FLS was for a net decline in lending over this period.
In April, the FLS was extended by a further year to the start of 2015 to give banks and
building societies confidence that they will be able to continue to access funding on

reasonable terms. And given improvements in credit conditions have been less pronounced
for SMEs than for secured household borrowers and larger businesses, the incentives for
lending to smaller businesses have been strengthened.
Deficit reduction
In 2010 the UK had a budget deficit of 11.2 per cent, forecast by the IMF at the time to be
the largest budget deficit of any G20 country. Since then, the deficit has been reduced by
about a third, but it remains one of the largest in the G20 at 7.4 per cent of GDP. As a result,
gross debt is continuing to rise and is forecast to peak in 2016-17 at over 100 per cent of
GDP.
The Government’s fiscal strategy is anchored by the tax and spending plans set out in the
June 2010 Budget. Subsequent implementation and ongoing commitment to these plans has
ensured fiscal credibility. However, implementation has taken place within a flexible
medium-term fiscal framework. Sizeable automatic stabilizers have been allowed to operate
in full and the pace of structural adjustment has been allowed to slow in the near-term, with
the Government choosing not to take corrective action to meet its debt target. As a result, the
planned period of consolidation has been extended from 5 to 8 years.
The Government has continued to improve the composition of consolidation, recognising the
benefits of further switching from current to capital spending. Over the past two years, plans
have been revised to increase capital spending by around £20bn. And in recent weeks, the
Government has set out plans to deliver a further £3bn of capital investment in 2015-16 in
areas with the highest economic returns (transport, science and innovation and education)
and £100bn of specific infrastructure projects over the next Parliament.
In addition, recognising the fact that a significant proportion of infrastructure investment in
the UK is delivered by the private sector, the Government is using the credibility of its
balance sheet to provide further support to the economy through guarantees for investment in
infrastructure. While the government cannot control the timing of this investment, these
guarantees are designed to support investment in major projects that may have stalled due to
adverse credit conditions. This will also support the rebalancing of the economy towards
sustainable private-sector led growth.
In summary, my authorities continue to believe that the fiscal policy stance and projected
pace of consolidation implied by its tax and spending plans, remain appropriate, given the
economic outlook, risks and continued global uncertainty. In turn, fiscal credibility has
allowed the government to use its balance sheet to support investment through guarantees
and credit easing policies, and support the economy with the free operation of sizeable
automatic stabilisers. Credibility has also reduced the risk of adverse feedback between weak
public finances and the strained and systemically important financial sector, which staff
acknowledge is a “global public good”. Revising the fiscal plans in an attempt to fine-tune

the consolidation path would risk undermining credibility and could have consequences for
global, as well as domestic, financial stability.
Structural reform
A comprehensive programme of supply-side reforms is underway to boost competitiveness
and improve the business environment, as set out in the Plan for Growth, and the National
Infrastructure Plan. A wide-range of reforms have been identified across government,
including: infrastructure investment; deregulation; measures to boost trade and investment;
root and branch reform of the planning system; and radical reforms to every stage of
education and skills provision.
At the 2013 Budget, the Government complemented planning reforms by launching the Help
to Buy scheme to support the housing market. This is a temporary scheme to make it easier
for first time buyers to purchase homes and existing homeowners to move home. After three
years, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) will assess its impact and advise whether it
should be continued.
Separately, the Government also set out further reforms at the Budget to devolve significant
local funding to Local Enterprise Partnerships to enable them to tackle barriers to growth,
which hold back private investment at the local level.
Financial Sector Policy
The healing process in the UK financial sector has continued over the last 12 months. Bank
liquidity and funding positions have improved and capital ratios of major UK banks and
building societies have increased. However, confidence in the financial system remains
fragile and credit growth is still weak. The outlook is still clouded by the ongoing risks
associated with a weak and uneven global recovery, and imbalances in the euro area. More
still needs to be done to improve the resilience of the UK banking system and ensure that
lending to the real economy is maintained. To meet these challenges, the Government is
continuing to implement its ambitious financial sector repair and reform agenda.
On 1 April 2013, the Financial Services Act came into force, fully establishing the new
regulatory and supervisory architecture in the UK. The Financial Policy Committee (FPC),
Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) are now all
up and running. The view of my authorities is that the issues raised by staff in the 2011
FSAP, concerning the mandates and independence of these institutions, have been fully
addressed and, while it is still early days, there is a sound basis for effective coordination.
Given the uncertain outlook for financial stability, a number of steps have been taken to
ensure the capital adequacy of UK banks and building societies in line with FPC

recommendations. The PRA has conducted an asset quality review to ensure that banks have
credible plans in place to meet identified shortfalls, either by issuing new capital or
restructuring balance sheets in a way that does not hinder lending. The PRA will also ensure
that credible plans are in place for the transition to tougher prudential standards in 2019. In
order to assess capital adequacy on a forward-looking basis, the Bank of England, including
the PRA, is continuing to develop its stress testing framework and a discussion paper will be
published in the autumn. The PRA will also ensure that UK banks comply fully with
Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) recommendations when they publish their 2013
annual reports.
Structural banking reforms are now going through Parliament in the Banking Reform Bill.
Key measures include the ring-fencing of retail banking from wholesale and investment
banking and an additional 3 per cent of equity on top of the Basel III minimum for the largest
ring-fenced banks. These reforms will improve the safety of banks, protect taxpayers and
ensure a more stable financial sector. The Government also intends to give the FPC the
power to vary the leverage ratio for deposit takers and investment firms above the
international baseline requirement in 2018, though this will be reviewed once this baseline is
implemented in 2017. More broadly, the UK continues to press in European negotiations for
the full and faithful implementation of the Basel III binding minimum leverage ratio baseline.
In addition, the Government has asked the Office of Fair Trading to conduct a review of
competition in small business banking, recognising that competition remains an important
structural issue in the UK banking sector.
The IMF recommended in May that the Government urgently develop a strategy for
returning its shareholdings in the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Lloyds Banking Group
(LBG) back to the private sector. The Chancellor has announced that he is actively
considering options for beginning the sale of LBG and is urgently investigating the case for
breaking up RBS and creating a “bad bank” of risky assets - a review will be completed by
autumn. The Government strategy will be guided by three objectives: maximising the banks’
ability to support the UK economy; getting best value for money for the UK taxpayer and
returning the banks to private ownership.
