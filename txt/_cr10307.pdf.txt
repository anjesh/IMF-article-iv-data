Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation and First Review Under the Stand-By
Arrangement
Prepared by Western Hemisphere Department
(In Consultation with Other Departments)
Approved by Miguel Savastano and Thomas Dorsey
September 1, 2010
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
El Salvador’s economy was severely affected in 2009 by the global slowdown and electoral uncertainty.
Real GDP declined, and the public sector deficit and debt increased sharply. The economy is expected to
recover gradually over the next couple of years owing to its strong linkages to the United States, inflation is
projected to remain low, and the external current account deficit to widen but remain at sustainable levels.
Performance under the IMF-supported program has been good. All end-June performance criteria were
met, though progress in the structural area has been mixed. There have been slight delays in announcing subsidy
reform, but implementation is still planned by year-end. While some advances have been made in strengthening
tax administration, there are delays in enhancing coordination between the internal revenue service and
customs. Approval of the financial supervision and regulation law is delayed, and some recommendations of the
Financial System Stability Assessment are being proposed as structural benchmarks under the arrangement,
which will continue to be treated as precautionary.
The medium-term outlook is generally favorable, but sustained growth will depend on improvements in
the investment climate and a durable fiscal consolidation effort.


Even taking into account the adverse effects of negative supply shocks over the past decade, growth
performance in El Salvador has lagged that in the region. This despite lower exchange rate risk and
interest rates, and a real effective exchange rate that is in line with fundamentals.



The full dollarization regime has not changed the structure of the economy nor its response to shocks.
Structural improvements are necessary to boost investment and competitiveness and overcome growth
sluggishness.



Reducing the public debt-to-GDP ratio to pre-crisis levels is a key priority, especially in view of the high
sensitivity of the debt trajectory to negative output shocks.

El Salvador has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and its exchange system
remains free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current transactions. The
country has maintained a fully dollarized exchange rate system since January 2001.

I. BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW
1.
The 2010 Article IV consultation and first review under the Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA) took place against a background of a moderate recovery of external
demand.1 Owing to its strong linkages to the U.S. economy, the effects of the 2009 crisis in El
Salvador were relatively more severe than in the rest of the region, as consumption,
investment, and exports all fell sharply, and real GDP declined by 3½ percent. 2 Economic
activity is recovering modestly in 2010.
2.
The government’s economic strategy aims at ensuring fiscal and debt
sustainability, while safeguarding social spending. The strategy is underpinned by a
continued commitment to the dollarization regime as the key anchor of macroeconomic policy.
On March 17, 2010, the Fund approved a 3-year SBA in support of this strategy (with total
access of 300 percent of quota), which the authorities are treating as precautionary. President
Funes has been able to generate political majorities in Congress to advance key initiatives to
bolster his economic strategy, including approval of a tax package in December 2009.
However, going forward, forging consensus on future key initiatives and reforms remains
challenging.3
3.
A key medium-term challenge is to improve the growth performance of the
economy, which has lagged that of the region. Real GDP growth averaged 2.1 percent during
the last 5 years, compared with 5.1 percent in the rest of Central America; over the same
period, private investment averaged 15 percent of GDP, compared with 21 percent in the
region. By end-2008 40 percent of households were living under the poverty line. To address
this situation, in mid-2009, the Funes administration put in place its flagship General AntiCrisis Plan (PGA), which channels spending of about 1 percent of GDP to social programs.4 To
spur growth and investment during the remainder of their term, the authorities plan to
undertake fiscal reforms to create space for priority expenditures, assume a more active role in
promoting exports, and foster “public private partnerships” to promote investment in

Discussions took place in San Salvador during July 20–30, 2010. The staff team comprised A. Wolfe (Head), J.
Prat, A. Swiston (all WHD), and S. Segal (SPR) and was joined by F. Delgado (Regional Resident
Representative) and J. Gramajo (OED) in some of the discussions and by P. Madrid (MCM) to discuss findings of
the Financial System Stability Assessment. The mission met with Technical Secretary Segovia, Finance Minister
Cáceres, Central Bank President Acevedo, other government officials, congressional and labor leaders, think tanks
and private sector representatives.

infrastructure, including in the electricity and energy sectors. The government is also looking
to enhance the role of public banks to support lending to the productive sector.
4.
A recent IMF/World Bank Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA)
confirmed that the Salvadoran financial system withstood the global financial crisis well
and was well-capitalized and liquid. The FSSA recommended enhancements to the legal and
regulatory frameworks as well as measures to reduce some remaining vulnerabilities.5
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Developments in 2010 are broadly in line with projections contained in the
March 2010 staff report (Figure 1).


Output. The economic recovery is gaining strength, albeit at a modest pace. Real GDP
fell by only ½ percent (y/y) in the first quarter of 2010 after declining 4.9 percent in the
last quarter of 2009. The monthly index of economic activity rose 1.9 percent (y/y) in
June, the fourth consecutive monthly gain, and real GDP growth for the year as a whole
may be close to the 1 percent envisaged in the program.



Prices. Inflation was zero in 2009, and by July 2010 it had risen to only 1.0 percent
(y/y). Core inflation (excluding food and energy) was 0.9 percent in July (y/y),
compared with 2.6 percent at end-2009.



Trade and remittances. Exports (in U.S. dollars) declined 16 percent in 2009, but
increased by 14 percent (y-t-d) through July 2010. Imports rose by more during the
same period (17 percent), though some of the increase reflects higher oil prices (non-oil
imports are up 12 percent). Remittances rose by only 2.5 percent (y-t-d) through July
(Figure 2).



Net capital flows. Capital account flows are weaker than envisaged at the time of
program approval, mainly owing to delays in disbursements from international financial
institutions (IFIs). For the year as a whole, net international reserves of the central bank
are projected to fall by close to US$200 million compared with an increase of
US$100 million projected in the March staff report.



Financial system: Most bank indicators have improved in 2010. Deposits have risen
(3½ percent) through June, profitability is recovering, and non-performing loans have
leveled off (after increasing significantly in 2009). Liquidity and capital ratios remain
well above their pre-crisis levels, due to a shift to low-risk, liquid assets and some
capital injections (Figure 3). Credit to the private sector, which fell by 4½ percent in

5

report.

6
2009, has continued to decline through mid-2010, though there are indications that
lending is resuming in the third quarter.


Fiscal: The performance criteria on the deficit of the nonfinancial public sector for
March and June were met with comfortable margins. Restraint on current spending
(except for subsidy outlays) and slow implementation of the public investment program
were key factors contributing to the overperformance; government revenues were in
line with program targets (Figure 4). Performance criteria on public debt flows and on
the non-accumulation of payments arrears were also observed.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Macroeconomic Outlook

6.
There was agreement that the medium-term outlook presented in the March 2010
staff request for the SBA remains appropriate. External demand has picked up as projected,
and the domestic economy is recovering slowly, as was envisaged. Real GDP growth continues
to be projected at 1 percent in 2010 and 2½ percent in 2011, though downside risks have
decreased. Inflation is on track to rise to 1½ percent in 2010, and evolve in line with U.S.
inflation thereafter.

7.
The medium-term external current account deficit is expected to be somewhat
higher than envisaged. As in the March staff report, the current account deficit for 2010 is
expected to rise to 2.8 percent of GDP (from 1.8 percent in 2009), as import growth outweighs
that of exports and remittances. Thereafter, however, the deficit is projected to stabilize at
around 3.3 percent of GDP (compared with below 3 percent of GDP in the March staff report

7
owing to a higher projected oil import bill and stable remittances). The current account deficit
is expected to be financed by net FDI flows on the order of 2 percent of GDP, net government
borrowing for about 1 percent of GDP, and other private capital inflows.
B. Fiscal Policy
8.
It was agreed that the strategy of gradual fiscal consolidation that underpins the
three-year SBA and the projected fiscal stance for 2010 remain appropriate. The fiscal
deficit for 2010 is expected to decline to 4.8 percent of GDP on the back of higher tax revenue
(reflecting the recovery of demand and tax measures taken at end-2009) and expenditure
restraint. On a cyclically-adjusted basis, this decline would represent a withdrawal of fiscal
stimulus of 0.6 percent of GDP; that would be followed by a withdrawal twice as large in 2011,
anchored on continued expenditure restraint and subsidy reform.

Staff underscored that the gradual fiscal consolidation strategy is fraught with
risks and left little scope for slippages. The fiscal consolidation envisaged for 2010–12 is not
expected to result in a significant decline in debt levels. Under the agreed strategy, public debt
levels are envisaged to start declining only in

program.

8
10.
The near-term fiscal strategy hinges on subsidy reform, continued expenditure
restraint, and strengthened tax administration.


Reforming energy subsidies is key. Subsidies are poorly targeted and a drain on
government resources (staff estimates their cost at 1.4 percent of GDP in 2009). 6 Some
remedial measures envisaged under the program (e.g., adjusting electricity tariffs)
experienced delays, but the authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to reduce
subsidies on liquefied gas (LPG) and electricity which would be redirected to other
social policies.



Strict control of government spending in 2010–11 will be critical. While revenues
are expected to recover gradually (by over 1 percent of GDP in 2011), mainly reflecting
gains from tax administration improvements, a recovery in tax collections, especially
on the income tax, and a step up in Millennium Challenge Corporation grants, the
authorities underlined their commitment to contain government spending. They
underscored that outlays on wages, goods and services, and discretionary transfers
(excluding energy subsidies) will be kept broadly constant in real terms, which would
yield savings of almost 1 percent of GDP in 2011; this will provide space to channel
savings from energy subsidy reform to social sectors and infrastructure.



Tax administration has improved, but further progress is necessary. There have
been improvements in the areas of auditing and control of large taxpayers, and these are
expected to continue in 2011 when steps to enhance coordination between the internal
revenue directorate (DGII) and customs (DGA) are completed.

11.
The financing mix of the fiscal deficits in 2010–11 will be somewhat different than
anticipated. Congress has yet to approve several external loans envisaged at the time of
program approval, and some of these will only be disbursed in 2011. In view of this, the deficit
in 2010 is being financed through the drawdown of government deposits and by placing debt in
the domestic market (at very low rates).7 Staff urged the authorities to seek early congressional
approval for the 2011 borrowing program and encouraged them to take advantage of current
market conditions to refinance a US$650 million Eurobond that matures in the second half
of 2011. The authorities stressed that they are already in discussions with Congress and expect
to have full approval of their external borrowing program shortly, and they are working with
financial advisors to roll over the Eurobond.

7

Water usage and transportation subsidies were reformed in 2009.

By end-2011, government deposits at the central bank are projected to recover in line with original program
projections, thereby limiting the impact on the central bank’s current liquidity provision capabilities.

9
Medium-term issues
12.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy hinges on reaching agreement on a
fiscal pact to increase government revenue by at least 1½ percent of GDP. The authorities
indicated that discussions on key elements of the pact are moving forward with a broad range
of stakeholders. On the revenue side, they are working (with the Fund’s technical assistance)
on designing measures that would underpin the fiscal pact (including improvements in tax
administration, expanding the tax base and, as a final alternative, a possible increase in some
tax rates). The authorities were confident that they would reach agreement on a satisfactory
fiscal pact by 2012 and were reluctant to shorten the timetable because it could endanger the
entire set of reforms. Staff urged the authorities to stand ready to adopt the revenue measures
envisaged in the pact should they be needed for meeting the targets in their fiscal strategy.
13.
The authorities are committed to public financial management reforms to support
fiscal consolidation. El Salvador’s budget process has several shortcomings, including: (i) a
requirement of supermajorities in Congress for approval of long-term financing; and (ii) the
absence of a multi-year expenditure framework. The authorities indicated their commitment to
remedy these weaknesses. They noted that IMF technical assistance missions are visiting San
Salvador in August-September to advise on improving budget management and execution and
to design a multi-year expenditure framework (the latter also being supported by the World
Bank). In addition, they noted that they had requested a fiscal transparency ROSC (a mission
will visit San Salvador in the fourth quarter of 2010).
14.
Debt management could be improved. Public sector debt management is fragmented
(with some elements in the ministry of finance and others at the central bank). Staff advised the
authorities to consolidate these functions in one unit to avoid duplications and facilitate the
design of a consistent public debt strategy. The authorities noted that they are working to
improve debt management practices, including through the assistance of an external expert, but
did not see a need to consolidate all debt operations under one agency.
C. Full Dollarization and Financial Sector Issues
15.
The authorities reiterated that full dollarization will remain a key anchor of their
macroeconomic framework despite its limitations. Staff discussed the results of a study
assessing El Salvador’s performance under full dollarization. The study finds that dollarization
had reduced exchange rate risk and provided a strong nominal anchor that had secured low
inflation. The study also found that the Salvadoran economy’s dynamic response to shocks had
not been affected by dollarization, although the country had suffered more severe shocks in the
post-dollarization period than under the previous fixed exchange rate system (Box 3, Figure 5).
The authorities recognized the key role that dollarization had played in preserving
macroeconomic stability, but stressed that the inability to use monetary and exchange rate
policy to mitigate external shocks imposed non-negligible costs to the adjustment process.

10
16.
The exchange rate regime’s ability to withstand liquidity shocks should be
broadened. While commercial banks’ liquid asset

17.
Staff discussed the main findings of the
recent FSSA. The update found that banking system
soundness had improved since the previous FSSA (in 2004), solvency ratios could withstand
another moderate recession, and there have been advances in supervisory practices. However,
the report also considered that progress in approving key norms had been slow, and
recommended enhancements to the legal framework and bank safety net arrangements (Box 4).
The authorities were in broad agreement with the findings and recommendations and noted that
they were moving forward with key regulations in some areas. They also reiterated their
commitment to secure congressional approval of the financial supervision and regulation law
that has been with Congress for more than a year.
18.
The new financial supervision and regulation law will create one superintendency
in charge of banks, pensions, insurance, and securities, and shift regulatory powers to the
central bank. The new structure for financial sector oversight is expected to reduce
supervisory gaps, facilitate consolidated supervision and reduce regulatory arbitrage. The
authorities noted that they will ensure that supervisory vigilance is maintained during the
merger and that the central bank will issue key norms to enhance supervision. The issuance of
norms on corporate governance of commercial banks is being proposed as a structural
benchmark.
19.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ plans to improve the legal framework of domestic
capital markets. Domestic capital markets are underdeveloped and have played a limited role
in financial intermediation, partly owing to shortcomings in the regulatory and supervisory
framework. As a first step, the authorities reaffirmed their commitment to obtain congressional
approval of the Investment Funds Law (a structural benchmark under the program), which
would provide a legal basis and accounting and valuation standards for investment funds. They
noted, however, that Congress will consider this bill only after the financial supervision and
regulation bill has been approved.

11
20.
Efforts to bolster the bank resolution framework were also welcomed. Staff and the
authorities agreed that the bank resolution framework should be improved, and that the deposit
insurance fund (IGD), financial system supervisor, and central bank should develop mutuallyagreed comprehensive procedures, manuals, and standardized contracts. The authorities noted
that coordination among domestic regulatory agencies involved in the safety net is improving,
and that they are designing a financial stability strategy, as recommended by the FSSA. They
also plan to carry out a comprehensive bank resolution simulation exercise in the coming
months (a proposed structural benchmark under the program, MEFP ¶5) and are seeking to
promote cross-border crisis prevention and management arrangements with neighboring
countries.
21.
Staff discussed the authorities’ plans to strengthen the role of public banks in El
Salvador. The two-pronged approach consists of: (i) scaling up lending to priority sectors
through two existing public banks (with a combined share in banking system assets of around
5 percent as of end-2009), and (ii) converting an existing second-tier bank into a new national
development bank (Banco Nacional de Desarrollo) that would be in charge of an economic
development trust fund (to catalyze IFI and private-sector lending for large projects) and a
guarantee trust fund to support private-bank lending. Staff acknowledged that bank lending to
certain sectors had become scarce, but highlighted the difficulties in ensuring continued
adherence to transparent criteria in state-owned banks and limiting potential fiscal risks. The
authorities shared staff’s concerns, but indicated that the new entities would not represent a
fiscal burden as risks would be contained.
D. Competitiveness Issues
22.
The authorities agreed that the real effective exchange rate appears to be broadly
in line with fundamentals. Staff discussed the results from its assessment, which pointed to a
small undervaluation of the real exchange rate (according to the macro balance and external
stability approaches) and a somewhat larger (in absolute terms) overvaluation according to
estimates from the equilibrium real exchange rate approach (Box 5). The authorities were of
the view that the three approaches taken together were an indication that the real effective
exchange rate is in line with fundamentals.
23.
Staff stressed that improvements in the investment climate to boost
competitiveness should be a key priority (Box 6). They underscored that domestic and
foreign investment remains low both in nominal terms and relative to regional peers. Staff
acknowledged that El Salvador generally compares well against other countries in the region
under various measures of “doing business” and scores in the top half under a range of
“competitiveness” measures, but noted that there are relative weaknesses in certain areas such
as security, education and innovation.8 Lower sub-ranking scores are consistent with firm-level

Salvador Country Report, and the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2009–10.

12
data that cite crime and workforce education as key concerns in El Salvador relative to regional
peers. Private-sector representatives agreed that the investment climate had been adversely
affected by a deterioration of internal security, though some also cited uncertainties related to
the policy direction of the government.
24.
The authorities agreed that addressing the security situation is a priority in the
near term, and noted that their economic program contemplates allocating more
resources to this area and to education. They were also confident that public banks would
facilitate business start-ups and spur private investment. They stressed that their Five-Year
Plan includes proposals to address the aforementioned issues, as well as promoting innovation,
modernizing key productive sectors, and increasing regional integration.
E. Downside Risks
25.
A slower recovery and the breakdown of political support for the fiscal
consolidation process continue to pose the main risks to the government’s strategy. If
either of these risks were to materialize, tighter expenditure restraint would be the only
available tool to preserve macroeconomic stability.


Although risks to the growth forecast are roughly balanced, a prolonged period of low
growth or a double-dip recession would result in lower-than-envisaged tax collections and
possible untenable pressure on the spending side. As noted in Box 2, the sensitivity of El
Salvador’s public debt path to adverse growth outturns would result in unsustainable debt
dynamics.



Insufficient political support could endanger the authorities’ fiscal strategy, including by
delaying approval of IFI loans and stalling further reforms necessary for fiscal
consolidation.

26.
The government would need to take additional measures if the above risks were to
materialize. The authorities’ strategy provides a solid basis to move forward in a baseline
scenario, but they should stand ready to respond to a more adverse scenario. If external
financing fails to materialize, or if the government is unable to garner the necessary
congressional support for further reforms on the revenue side, spending would need to be
reduced to avoid recourse to riskier forms of financing (such as the issuance of short-term
debt). An important safeguard in this regard is the authorities’ plan to reprioritize the public
investment program to identify projects that could be delayed, while minimizing the social
impact.
IV. PROGRAM MODALITIES
27.
The main elements of the program approved in March 2010 were ratified for this
review. The authorities and staff reached understandings on the following updates (Table 14):

13


Quantitative performance criteria: The original indicative targets for end-2010 on the
ceiling on the deficit of the nonfinancial public sector (US$1,047 million, 4.8 percent of
GDP) and the accumulation of public sector debt (US$1,117 million) were converted to
performance criteria. The adjuster for revenue overperformance has been maintained.



Structural benchmarks: Approval of a budget for 2011 consistent with a fiscal deficit of
3.5 percent of GDP was added as a new structural benchmark (SB). The timetable for tax
administration improvements regarding coordination between the internal revenue service
(DGII) and customs office (DGA) was updated. Approval of the financial supervision and
regulation law (originally expected for July 2010) is now expected by end-2010 and
included as an SB for the second review. Congressional approval of the investment funds
law (originally expected for October 2010) has also been pushed back to March 2011. The
arrangement also includes two new SBs for the second review: undertaking a bank
resolution simulation exercise, and issuing norms on corporate governance of commercial
banks.



Consultation clauses: The two consultation clauses under which the authorities commit to
consult with Fund staff and reach understandings on corrective measures remain in force.9

28.
The authorities have made progress in addressing the recommendations of last
year’s safeguards assessment, but vulnerabilities remain. The most recent safeguards
assessment is to be completed in September 2010 and will note that the BCR has made
progress in implementing the recommendations of the 2009 assessment in the areas of internal
control and legal structure. The authorities have incorporated the recommendations of the 2009
assessment on the legal framework in the financial supervision and regulation law awaiting
congressional approval. The principal risk is in the area of financial reporting, where the
assessment recommends the adoption of an international financial reporting framework. The
assessment also recommends publishing the opinions of external auditors and creating a
framework to monitor the implementation of audit recommendations.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
A modest economic recovery is underway. Inflation remains contained, the external
current account is widening as envisaged, and fiscal consolidation is proceeding appropriately.
The precautionary SBA with the Fund has helped bolster investor confidence and financial
stability, and performance under the program has been good. All quantitative performance
criteria for the first review were met, and progress is being made, albeit more slowly than
originally envisaged, on the structural front.

9

The clauses cover a fall of 10 percent or more in private-sector deposits and banks’ short-term external
obligations (from their end-June 2010 level) and any system-wide change in commercial bank reserve or liquid
asset requirements.

14
30.
The key medium-term challenge faced by the authorities is to improve the
economy’s growth prospects. Poverty remains high, and growth is relatively low, even by
regional standards. Improving the investment climate through a continued commitment to
macroeconomic and financial stability and the allocation of government spending to more
productive areas would be key. Staff welcome the authorities’ immediate efforts to mitigate the
impact of rising poverty, and their commitment to strengthen financial sector oversight; ensure
fiscal sustainability; boost spending on education, security, and infrastructure; and improve the
climate for business start-ups.
31.
The authorities’ fiscal strategy of gradual fiscal consolidation remains
appropriate, but downside risks are not negligible. The small deficit reduction envisaged for
2010 and 2011 is consistent with the gradual economic recovery currently anticipated.
Together with the tax package approved in late 2009 and envisaged improvements in tax
administration, the modest recovery should increase tax revenues to the levels implied by the
deficit target. The planned reform of energy subsidies should provide the space to increase
spending on infrastructure, security, and social programs, including education. Staff welcomed
the authorities’ intentions to boost investment spending, which has lagged in 2010 and would
support medium-term growth prospects.
32.
Sustainability of the public finances over the medium term will require a
significant increase in revenue. Staff continue to support the authorities’ strategy to seek a
national consensus on a fiscal pact that is to be implemented no later than 2012 and would
include a tax reform aimed at increasing tax revenue by at least 1½ percent of GDP. Such a
reform would provide a sustainable resource base to finance needed social, security, and
infrastructure spending, while ensuring that fiscal deficits decline and the public debt-to-GDP
ratio is put on a durable downward path. Accelerating the implementation timetable of the
fiscal pact (or the revenue elements thereof) would speed up fiscal consolidation and allow
greater expenditure on priority areas in the near term.
33.
Fiscal performance would be enhanced by actions to improve public expenditure
and debt management. Staff welcome the authorities’ efforts to address shortcomings in the
budgetary process and to bolster public debt management. Staff would urge the authorities to
avoid delays in moving forward on their plans to roll over the Eurobond coming due next year.
34.
Dollarization continues to be a cornerstone of macroeconomic and financial
stability. In the almost ten years since El Salvador adopted the U.S. dollar, interest rates have
been lower than under the previous regime as exchange rate risk has disappeared, inflation has
remained low, and the real exchange rate has remained broadly in line with fundamentals.
Moreover, despite frequent and sizable supply-side shocks, the economy´s reaction to shocks
has not been significantly different when compared to the previous fixed exchange rate regime.
Nonetheless, while banks in El Salvador have liquid asset holdings roughly comparable to the
other fully-dollarized economies in Latin America and are solidly placed to withstand
moderate shocks, staff would urge the authorities to move expeditiously in improving systemic
liquidity management and strengthen their lender-of-last resort capabilities.

15
35.
Close monitoring of the financial system remains a high priority. Staff is
encouraged by the recent FSSA findings regarding banks’ resilience to macroeconomic shocks
and the upgrading of supervisory practices. Staff welcomes the authorities’ continued pursuit
of congressional approval of the financial supervision and regulation law and their intention to
continue to strengthen the regulatory framework by: (i) upgrading the bank resolution
framework, including through a comprehensive bank resolution exercise; (ii) issuing norms to
enhance supervision; and (iii) improving the legal framework of domestic capital markets.
Staff caution the authorities to maintain strict oversight of financial markets through the merger
of the superintendencies of banks, pensions and securities. Staff also recommend the prompt
adoption of measures to ensure that the revamped public sector banks channel credit to the
private sector in a transparent manner and without adding to fiscal risks.
36.
A protracted recession or unexpected difficulties in forging a political consensus
for the government’s fiscal strategy remain the key risks of the program. Risks to the
growth projections are somewhat mitigated by the conservative path for economic recovery
that underpins the authorities’ program. Faltering political support could endanger the
authorities’ fiscal strategy by delaying the approval of IFI loans or blocking a consensus-based
fiscal pact. So far, though, the administration has been able to move its agenda forward, and its
social and economic program is beginning to yield results.
37.
Staff recommend the completion of the first review under the SBA. Performance
under the program has been good, and the authorities’ policies appear adequate to meet the
targets under the program, support the recovery of the economy, and maintain external
stability.
38.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with El Salvador be held in
accordance with the July 15, 2002 decision on consultation cycles.

16

Box 1. Past Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
The previous Article IV consultation with El Salvador (IMF Country Report 09/35) was concluded in
the early days of the global financial crisis and highlighted the need to focus on crisis preparedness and
structural reforms. At that time, staff recommended a fiscal consolidation strategy to continue lowering
the public debt-to-GDP ratio to 30 percent. The onset of the global crisis drastically changed the
outlook for El Salvador’s economy, and the authorities requested Fund assistance in the form of a
precautionary SBA that was approved by the Board on January 16, 2009. Some of the specific
recommendations made during the 2008 Article IV consultation were:


Financial contingency measures. Monitor banks’ liquidity and their short-term borrowing
closely, draw up concrete action plans to deal with stress in the banking system, and negotiate
contingent credit lines. Response: In the context of the precautionary SBA approved by the
Fund ahead of the 2009 presidential elections, the authorities secured commitments from the
IDB to support the financial sector in the event of adverse shocks. In addition, the government
that took office in July 2009 requested a financial system stability assessment (FSSA), which
has been completed, and the authorities are developing a strategy to address liquidity-related
issues and other recommendations made by the FSSA.



Short-term fiscal policy. Maintain fiscal restraint and seek a political agreement to access
long-term financing from IFIs. Response: The authorities decided to accommodate the cyclical
decline in revenues associated with the global downturn, but exercised commendable
expenditure restraint during 2009, and redirected spending toward social sectors.

Structural reforms. Strengthen financial sector regulation and supervision and the sector’s ability to
confront shocks; improve the efficiency and targeting of subsidies; and implement a parametric reform
of the pension system. Response: Limited progress has been achieved on these fronts. The authorities
have submitted financial supervision and regulation legislation to Congress (to consolidate regulation
of the financial sector), but Congress has yet to approve the law. In 2009, the authorities were able to
eliminate electricity subsidies to corporations, reduce the transport subsidy by 40 percent, and lower
water subsidies; further reforms to liquefied gas (LPG) and electricity subsidies are planned for late
2010. The authorities are strengthening tax administration, despite delays in enhancing coordination
between the internal revenue service and customs. The authorities recognize the need for pension
system reform, but see this as a longer-term concern, while their immediate policy focus has been to
protect the economic recovery and lay the basis for fiscal sustainability.

17

Box 2. Public Debt Dynamics and Medium-Term Targets
This box presents two exercises related to El Salvador’s public debt. First a stochastic debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that subpar economic growth or interruptions to fiscal
consolidation would place the public debt on an unsustainable path and pose significant risks to
the government’s strategy. Second, two approaches to calculate sustainable debt levels shed light
on the appropriate medium-term target.
A stochastic DSA suggests that placing El Salvador’s public debt on a downward path
would require durable fiscal consolidation (compared with the evidence from cross-country
historical experience) and is very sensitive to adverse shocks to growth and interest rates.

within the 80 percent confidence interval.
The results from the exercise underscore the importance of adhering to the key fiscal
commitments under the program, namely firm expenditure restraint and subsidy reform and,
starting in 2012, a major tax reform to strengthen the underlying fiscal position. They also point
to the need for designing contingency measures in order to contain any deterioration of the fiscal
balance should risks materialize.
The optimal debt literature suggests that El Salvador’s current level of public debt, at over
50 percent of GDP, is high. Following the “debt intolerance” literature, annual data for
1989–2009 for a sample of middle-income countries was used to calculate public debt levels that
would allow El Salvador to improve its creditworthiness and belong to a “debt club” with easier
access to market financing (as provided by International Investor Rating). 2 The exercise yields a
target debt for El Salvador of 25 percent of GDP. A second approach takes as a starting point a
notional maximum debt-to-GDP ratio of 50 percent (the level used as a reference point in the
discussions of macroeconomic convergence in the Central American Monetary Council).
Subtracting from this level the space that would be needed to absorb contingent liabilities from
natural disasters (averaging costs of 3 percent of GDP in El Salvador) and/or financial crises
(averaging 12 percent of GDP in the region) yields a debt level for El Salvador of about 35
percent of GDP.

were derived from an unrestricted VAR model, with shocks around the deterministic projection calibrated to
match the historical properties of the data. The stochastic projections were then combined with an estimated fiscal
policy reaction function to produce 1,000 public debt paths and obtain a “fan chart” for the debt projection.

Box 3. El Salvador’s Economic Performance Under Dollarization
El Salvador’s economic performance since the adoption of the U.S. dollar as legal tender has
been on many key dimensions not functionally different from its performance under the
previous exchange rate regime (a peg to the U.S. dollar). Under dollarization, nominal and
real interest rates have been lower, while the costs associated with the lack of independent
monetary policy have been mitigated by the economic cycle’s close correlation with that of
the United States.
There has been no structural change in the economy’s response to shocks under
dollarization. Using a two-variable (output and inflation) structural VAR model to identify
supply and demand shocks, staff estimate that responses to shocks did not change after the
adoption of official dollarization in 2001. Under dollarization, the response of inflation to
supply shocks has been smaller, but slightly more persistent than under the peg, while the
response of output to those shocks under the two regimes has been similar. At the same time,
inflation has been less sensitive to demand shocks under dollarization than under the peg,
while the opposite has happened with output.
The reduction in exchange rate risk brought about by official dollarization has been
beneficial. Staff estimate that adopting the dollar has reduced the exchange rate risk
component of commercial bank interest rates by 500 basis points, generating average annual
net interest savings to the Salvadoran private sector of about ½ percent of GDP since 2001,
and annual savings of about ¼ percent of GDP for the public sector (with interest cost
savings of around ½ percent of GDP outweighing the loss of potential seigniorage). These
results follow from applying an estimate of the exchange rate risk premium implicit in
interest rates under the pegged system (some 4 and 5 percentage points for loans and
deposits, respectively), projecting them over the dollarization period, and applying the results
to the stocks of credit and deposits.
U.S. monetary policy during official dollarization seems to have had better stabilizing
properties on El Salvador’s output than did domestic monetary policy under the peg.
Staff estimated the output stabilization properties of monetary policy under alternative
regimes using simple Taylor rules. During the 1990s, domestic monetary policy tightened in
response to higher inflation, and tended to ease when output growth was rising, increasing
output volatility. Under official dollarization, changes in the U.S. monetary policy rate have
helped reduce the volatility of domestic output.
Using standard pass-through analysis, the transmission of monetary policy rates to
commercial bank lending and deposit rates has not been significantly different in the
two regimes. The pass-through of interest rates in El Salvador has been similar to Panama’s.
At the same time, market views of fiscal sustainability (proxied by El Salvador’s EMBI
spread) and indicators of banking system health have been important factors behind the gap
between Salvadoran and U.S. commercial bank interest rates.

19

Box 4. Key Recommendations of the FSSA
The 2010 FSSA found that El Salvador’s financial system had withstood the global financial crisis ,
and was well-capitalized and liquid. The FSSA report identified several vulnerabilities and areas for
further reforms, making the following key recommendations:


Financial supervision and regulation law (structural benchmark, SB, for the second
review). The FSSA supported the draft law currently before Congress, but acknowledged that
the merger of three superintendencies and transfer of regulatory authority to the central bank
would bring about challenges. At the same time, it noted that the law should provide an
explicit mandate for financial stability; broaden and clarify the powers and improve the
governance and independence of the Financial System Superintendency (SSF); and increase
accountability. The FSSA also proposed addressing some gaps in the current draft legislation,
including on strengthening the legal protection for supervisors and augmenting the remedial
action powers of the SSF in the early preventive stages..



Comprehensive liquidity and banking crisis resolution arrangements. The FSSA noted
the constraints posed by official dollarization and urged the authorities to develop a
comprehensive policy to provide liquidity support to the financial system in situations of
stress. A key pillar of this policy would be the formation of a comprehensive liquidity policy
which could include a fund that pools liquid resources from banks (similar to the one in
Ecuador). The FSSA also recommended easing some legal restrictions on the central bank to
channel its own reserves or borrowed funds to banks and noted that coordination among safety
net providers should be strengthened by developing mutually-agreed strategies on financial
stability and banking crisis resolution.



Investment Funds Law (SB for the third review). The FSSA encouraged the approval of
the draft law, welcoming its potential to broaden the investor base and help develop domestic
capital markets.



Norms on key financial sector risks. Noting that the SSF had initiated an ambitious project
to move toward risk-based supervision, the FSSA observed that regulation in several areas
was lacking, including on corporate governance, credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, and
operational risk. Draft regulations in several areas were well-advanced, and the FSSA
recommended their prompt implementation.



Enhancements to bank resolution and deposit insurance. The FSSA recommended reforms
to bring bank resolution practices and the deposit insurance scheme in line with international
best practices, including: increasing the target level and sources of funding for the deposit
insurance fund, eliminating the requirement to notify a bank three days prior to the suspension
of operations, setting the least-cost criterion as the measure of the maximum deposit insurance
support, and allowing the removal of a bank’s board upon commencement of judicial
intervention. These recommendations are being considered by the authorities.

20

Box 5. Exchange Rate Assessment
El Salvador’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has remained relatively stable during
the last decade, reflecting the absence of a domestic currency beginning in 2001 and relatively
low and stable rates of inflation.

CGER-based assessment. An assessment of El Salvador’s exchange rate based on the three
CGER methodologies suggests that (as of end-2009) there is no evidence of misalignment.1
Two approaches under CGER, the Macroeconomic Balance and the External Sustainability
methodologies, suggest a small undervaluation, while the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate
methodology suggests an overvaluation of about 6-7 percent.

Impact of remittances. Given large remittance inflows to El Salvador, it may be necessary to
adjust the CGER methodology to account explicitly for the influence of remittances on
household consumption. If in equilibrium, spending on imports moves in tandem with
remittances, the current account norm would be unaffected by remittance flows. However, if
households decide to save the entire remittance inflow, the current account norm would be
impacted one-for-one by remittance flows, thereby lowering the calculated current account
norm deficit.

Export performance. Despite far-reaching
reforms to the trade and investment regimes,
exports in El Salvador remained stable at about
21 percent of GDP, from 2001–2009, some

average of its regional peers. Trends in exports
have persisted despite their changing

1/ The table covers gross debt of the nonfinancial public sector plus external debt of the central bank.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at
their levels of the last projection year.

Attachment I. Letter of Intent

San Salvador, September 1, 2010
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C., 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
The global slowdown caused by the world financial crisis severely affected El Salvador’s
economy during 2009. International trade flows, remittances, and private capital flows declined,
taking a heavy toll on domestic economic activity and tax collections. The Government of
El Salvador, with the support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international
financial institutions, has worked resolutely to shield the domestic economy—especially the
most vulnerable sectors—from the impact of the crisis, while pursuing macroeconomic policies
to safeguard macroeconomic stability in El Salvador’s dollarized economy.
2.
The economy weathered the crisis and is starting to recover, in line with the improved
global environment. Real GDP in the first quarter of 2010 fell by only ½ percent (y/y) after
declining almost 5 percent in the last quarter of 2009. Exports and imports are experiencing
double-digit growth, reflecting a strengthening of external and domestic demand, and
remittances are recovering. While bank credit has been slow to pick up, deposits are increasing,
and the banking system remains highly liquid and well-capitalized.
3.
The Government of El Salvador remains committed to its strategy of ensuring fiscal and
financial sustainability while safeguarding social spending. In line with the goals outlined in our
letter of March 1, 2010, we have been implementing poverty-reducing programs and are making
progress in improving the targeting of critical government expenditure (especially energy
subsidies), consistent with our policy framework of putting the fiscal deficit and public debt ratio
on a durable downward path. We are also moving ahead with key reforms in the financial sector
to strengthen its oversight and bolster its resilience to shocks.
4.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) updates the
policies of the Government of El Salvador for 2010–12 outlined in the MEFP dated March 1,
2010. In support of our economic program, we request completion of the first review of the
3-year Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with El Salvador approved on March 17, 2010. Our
intention is to continue treating the arrangement as precautionary. We believe the SBA will
continue providing critical support for our commitment to sound macroeconomic policies, help
anchor the confidence of depositors, investors, and creditors, and provide potential access to
liquidity support for the financial system, if the need were to arise.

43

5.
We believe that the policies described in the attached MEFP are sufficient to meet the
objectives of our program and stand ready to take additional measures that may be needed for
this purpose. We maintain our commitment to consult with the Fund in advance of any revisions
to the policies described in the MEFP, as well as the adoption of additional measures, in
accordance with IMF policies on such consultations. Consultations with Fund staff would also
occur in the event of a significant decline in the sum of private sector deposits and short-term
external liabilities of the banking system, or if the need were to arise to change the reserve
requirements or the liquid asset requirements currently applicable to the banking system. We will
continue to comply with all obligations of Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and
will maintain our close dialogue with IMF staff on our economic policies after the expiration of
the arrangement, for as long as there are any outstanding purchases in the upper credit tranches.
Program implementation will continue to be monitored through semi-annual reviews, with the
second review to be completed on or after March 15, 2011. The performance criteria and
structural benchmarks under the program are set out in Tables 2 and 3 of the attached MEFP.
6.
We authorize the IMF to publish this Letter of Intent and its attachments, and the related
staff report.
Sincerely yours,

________________/s/_________________

Attachment II. Supplement to the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
1.
Recent economic developments. Economic activity has been broadly in line with
projections at the time of the approval of the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). The contraction in
real GDP moderated to -0.5 percent (y/y) in the first quarter of 2010 (compared with
-4.9 percent in the last quarter of 2009), and the index of economic activity rose 1.9 percent (y/y)
in June driven by increases in manufacturing, financial services, and retail trade. Remittances
rose 2.5 percent through July. Inflation remains contained, at 1.0 percent (y/y) in July.
2.
Program performance. All quantitative performance criteria for end-March and endJune 2010 were met. Plans for liquid propane gas subsidy reform have been finalized and will be
in effect by end-December 2010. The large taxpayers unit at the Domestic Tax Administration
Directorate (DGII) has been strengthened and is expected to audit 80 of the 100 largest taxpayers
during 2010. The authority of the auditing department at the DGII has been consolidated, and a
risk-management approach to taxpayer selection for audits is being adopted. The strategic plan
for the modernization of both the DGII and the General Customs Administration Directorate is in
progress, and the process of enhancing coordination in the tax collection process across the two
agencies has begun. The Financial Sector Supervision and Regulation Law is undergoing
changes in the legislative discussions on the bill, and approval is expected by end-December
2010.
3.
Macroeconomic framework. The outlook for 2010 and 2011 remains broadly
unchanged from the time of the approval of the SBA. The macroeconomic framework continues
to assume a gradual recovery, with real GDP growth projected at 1 percent in 2010 and
2½ percent in 2011. Inflation projections are unchanged at 1½ percent in 2010 and 2¾ percent in
2011, in line with inflation in the United States. The external current account deficit is expected
to be slightly higher than previously projected, at 2.8 percent in 2010 and 3.1 percent in 2011.
Our program will be anchored on strict adherence to official dollarization and a prudent fiscal
policy.

Fiscal policy. Fiscal policy will continue to be aimed at reducing gradually the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) deficit and placing public debt on a firm downward path, while
shifting spending toward social programs and investment in key sectors. The proposed deficit
targets during the 2010–12 program period, take place against the backdrop of a moderatelypaced recovery of economic activity, and are expected to take the non-financial gross public
sector debt ratio to 51 percent of GDP; thereafter, the ratio is expected to decline steadily to
46.8 percent by 2015. These targets are broadly the same as those laid out at the time of program
approval. Key elements of our fiscal strategy include the following:


Fiscal targets for 2010. We will continue to maintain the NFPS deficit in 2010 at or below
US$1,047 million (4.8 percent of GDP), while limiting the increase in the stock of gross
public sector debt to at most US$1,117 million—consistent with our projected end-year
NFPS debt-to-GDP ratio of 50 percent of GDP.

45



Budget for 2011. Congressional approval of a budget for 2011 consistent with an NFPS
deficit of no more than 800 million (3.5 percent of GDP) will be a new structural benchmark
under the program for end-December 2010. This deficit target will imply a reduction of more
than 1 percentage point of GDP in the overall deficit from the expected 2010 outturn, and
demonstrates our firm commitment to fiscal consolidation. In addition, the 2011 budget will
reallocate spending away from poorly-targeted energy subsidies to key social programs.
 Increased spending on social programs. The anti-crisis program that we adopted in
June 2009 has helped mitigate the effects of the economic slowdown on the most
vulnerable populations and will be maintained at 2010 levels (1 percent of GDP) in
2011.
 Subsidy reforms. With subsidies projected to cost about 1.4 percent of GDP in
2010, we have placed a high priority on completing the broad-based reform of all
such expenditures that we began in 2009. By end October, we will have made
public a plan to bring liquid propane gas (LPG) prices closer to market rates, while
still protecting the most vulnerable through a consumption subsidy (see ¶11 of the
attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding, TMU). We will also adjust
electricity tariffs to residential customers with an average monthly consumption
above 99 kWh to more closely reflect market prices (see TMU ¶12). These reforms
are expected to free resources of about 0.3 percent of GDP in 2011 that would be
redirected toward other social spending.



Saving of revenue over-performance. We maintain our commitment to save a portion of any
revenue overperformance (as detailed in TMU ¶7), while allowing the rest to be used toward
key social spending.



Medium-term fiscal strategy. We are improving the transparency and planning of government
operations by implementing a medium term strategy of fiscal consolidation. Our efforts
started with the publication of our 2010–14 government program (2010–2014 Plan
Quinquenal de Desarrollo). Beginning with the 2011 budget, we will introduce a mediumterm budget framework that will seek consistency between short-term and medium-term
objectives, including a fiscal framework consistent with our medium-term objectives of
putting the NFPS deficit and public debt ratio on sustainable downward trajectories. Key to
our efforts will be the implementation by end-June 2012, at the latest, of a fiscal pact to be
developed in consultation with a broad range of stakeholders that aims at an increase in
government revenues of 1½ to 3 percent of GDP over the medium term.



Financing. We expect to cover the bulk of our financing needs during 2010–12 with external
resources of relatively long maturity. We have firm commitments from the World Bank,
IADB, and the Central American Bank for Economic Integration for more than US$800
million of disbursements through end-2011. Additionally, in June 2010 we placed a 15-year,
US$200 million bond on the domestic market at very favorable terms.

46

5.
Financial sector policy. The government is committed to continue preserving and
protecting the soundness and stability of the Salvadoran banking system and is adopting reforms
to enhance its resilience and increase the efficiency of financial intermediation.


Consultation clauses and financial system vigilance. If we were to consider it necessary to
modify either the reserve requirements or the liquid asset requirements currently applicable
to the banking system (see TMU ¶9), we would consult with IMF staff on such a change. In
addition, if at any point during the program period we were to observe a significant decline in
the sum of external short-term liabilities of banks and total private sector deposits held in the
banking system (as defined in TMU ¶8), we would evaluate the appropriate policy response
in consultation with IMF staff. To test the mechanics of our bank resolution framework,
strengthen coordination among agencies, and enhance procedures, we will conduct a bank
resolution exercise test in the coming months (structural benchmark under the program for
end-February 2011 and described in TMU ¶15).



Structural reforms. We will seek congressional approval of the Financial Sector Supervision
and Regulation Law by end-December 2010 (see TMU ¶13). We will also seek congressional
approval by end-March 2011 of the Investment Funds Law (see TMU ¶14). We will issue
norms to strengthen corporate governance of the banking system by end-February 2011
(structural benchmark under the program, see TMU ¶16).

6.
Safeguards assessment. The recommendations of the safeguard assessment of the
central bank (BCR) that was completed in May 2009 are being implemented. The BCR has
modified the charter of the auditing committee to appoint an independent member as its chair,
define the qualifications of its members, and has been authorized to contract an external expert to
assist it in carrying out its responsibilities. It is also reviewing monetary submission data at
program test dates and published full financial statements on its website.
7.
Program monitoring. Quantitative performance criteria will continue to be monitored
on a quarterly basis and program reviews will continue to be on a semiannual basis. The phasing
of access under the arrangement and the schedule of reviews are set out in Table 1. The
quantitative targets and performance criteria for end-September 2010 and end-December 2010,
as well as indicative targets through end-December, 2012 are set out in Table 2. The structural
benchmarks of the program are set out in Table 3.

Attachment III. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) describes the
understandings reached between the authorities of El Salvador and IMF staff for monitoring
performance under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). In particular, it defines concepts
employed in measuring the quarterly fiscal and debt quantitative performance criteria; the
continuous performance criteria on external debt and domestic payments arrears; the adjuster for
the overperformance of tax revenues; triggers for consultation clauses; structural benchmarks;
and reporting requirements under the SBA.
A. Quantitative Performance Criterion on the Fiscal Balance of the Non-Financial Public
Sector
2.
The nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) comprises the central government, the rest of
the general government (Instituto Salvadoreño del Seguro Social (ISSS), municipal governments,
public hospitals, the national university, and other decentralized agencies), and the non-financial
public-sector enterprises (Comisión Ejecutiva Hidroeléctrica del Río Lempa (CEL), Comisión
Ejecutiva Portuaria Autónoma (CEPA), Administración Nacional de Acueductos y
Alcantarillados (ANDA), and Lotería Nacional de Beneficiencia (LNB)).
3.
The overall balance of the NFPS is measured on a cash basis from below the line,
defined as: (a) net domestic financing of the NFPS; plus (b) net external financing of the NFPS;
plus (c) proceeds from exceptional sources such as, but not limited to, proceeds from
privatization or licenses and concessions, (see Table A1). The components of NFPS financing
are defined and measured as follows:
(a) The net domestic financing of the NFPS is defined as the sum of: (i) the increase in net
claims of the domestic financial system on the NFPS, excluding government bonds initially
sold abroad; (ii) the net increase in the amount of public sector short-term paper (LETES)
and bonds held outside the domestic financial system and the NFPS, excluding bonds
initially sold to nonresidents; and (iii) floating debt of the NFPS due to expenditure
operations and tax refund payments.
(b) The net external financing of the NFPS comprises: (i) disbursements of external loans;
plus (ii) receipts from the issuance of government bonds abroad and LETES held by
nonresidents; minus (iii) cash payments of principal (current maturities of loans, bonds, and
LETES); minus (iv) cash payments of external arrears (principal and interest); minus (v) debt
buy-backs or other prepayments of debt (at market value); minus (vi) debt-equity swaps
accounted at the market value of these papers; and minus/plus (vii) the increase/decrease in
other net foreign assets of the non-financial public sector.
(c) Proceeds from exceptional sources such as, but not limited to, privatization, the sale of
licenses, and the granting of concessions are defined as: (i) the cash payments received by the
Treasury from the sale of state-owned assets; plus (ii) debt-equity swaps, accounted at market

51

values. Also included are up-front payments received by the Treasury for the granting of
concessions for public services and capital leasing agreements.
B. Performance Criterion on Debt Flows Contracted by the Public Sector
4.
The performance criterion measures the sum of debt contracted by the nonfinancial public sector (as defined in paragraph 2) in the year, which shall apply to all flows of
gross external debt as specified in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with
Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-00/85); all domestic gross debt flows; and any
new debt with a sovereign guarantee. The debt ceiling will be adjusted upward for any borrowing
by the non-financial public sector, domestic or external, raised for prefinancing purposes that
would result in an equivalent increase in deposits at the central bank (BCR), until the prefinanced liability (or liabilities) mature.
C. Non-Accumulation of External Debt or Domestic Payments Arrears
5.
The NFPS will not accumulate any external debt arrears during the program
period. For the purpose of this performance criterion, an external debt payment arrear will be
defined as a payment by the NFPS that has not been made within thirty days after falling due
under the contractual agreement, unless specified otherwise. The performance criterion will
apply on a continuous basis.
6.
The NFPS will not accumulate any domestic payments arrears during the program
period. For the purpose of this performance criterion, a domestic payment arrear will be defined
as an obligation by the NFPS that has not been paid within sixty days after falling due under the
contractual agreement, unless specified otherwise. The performance criterion will apply on a
continuous basis.
D. Adjuster for Overperformance of Tax Revenue in 2010
7.
In the event that net tax collections exceed the program baseline of
US$2,203 million as of end-September 2010 or US$2,881 million as of end-December 2010, the
performance criterion on the overall balance of the NFPS will be raised by 50 percent of any
such excess.
E. Consultation Clauses
8.
Floor on the sum of total bank deposits of the private sector and external short-term
liabilities of banks. These are defined, respectively, as deposits of the private sector in
commercial banks, and external liabilities of commercial banks with an original maturity of up to
one year.1 If at any point during the arrangement, the sum of private-sector bank deposits and
1

The definition consists of the sum of line items 211 (DEPOSITOS) and 212108 (PRESTAMOS PACTADOS
HASTA UN AÑO PLAZO—ADEUDADO A ENTIDADES EXTRANJERAS) of the balance sheets of banks as

(continued)

52

external short-term bank liabilities should be less than US$7,555.4 million (i.e., ten percent
below the end-June 2010 level), a consultation clause will be triggered, and the authorities will
contact Fund staff to discuss possible remedial actions.
9.
The reserve requirements and liquid asset requirements of the banking system are
defined in current regulations (at about 22 percent and about 3 percent, in effective terms,
respectively). 2 If at any point during the arrangement the authorities consider it necessary to
modify the reserve requirements or liquid asset requirements, a consultation clause will be
triggered, and the authorities will contact Fund staff to discuss those measures.
F. Structural Benchmarks
10.
The authorities will publish their strategic plan for the modernization of the
Domestic Tax Administration Directorate (DGII) and the General Custom Administration
Directorate (DGA) by end-September 2010 (structural benchmark, rephased from April 30,
2010). The plan will outline steps to enhance coordination in the tax collection process across
agencies, including the migration of the DGII and DGA toward the same IT platform so that
there can be communication between the databases of the two units.
11.
The reform of the liquid propane gas subsidy will introduce a new tariff structure and
a new targeted subsidy to assist the most vulnerable.
12.
The reform of the electricity subsidy will reflect the adjustment of tariffs of consumers
that average more than 99 kWh per month, so that charges will more closely reflect the costs of
generation, in line with the existing price determination formula.
13.
The Financial System Supervision and Regulation Law will contain the following
elements: (i) the merger of the supervisory entities for banks, pensions, and the stock exchange;
(ii) enhanced functional autonomy of the new supervisory institution; (iii) stronger legal
protection for supervisors; (iv) provisions to strengthen cross-border supervision through
improved information sharing; and (v) invest the Central Bank to be the consolidated financial
system regulatory authority.
14.
The Investment Funds Law will contain the following elements: (i) a clear legal
framework for investment funds; (ii) accounting and asset valuation rules for investment funds;
and (iii) terms for investor entry and exit.
15.
The test bank resolution exercise will meet the following criteria: (i) will be
conducted by the Financial System Safety Net institutions: Superintendency (SSF), the Deposit
compiled by the Superintendency of the Financial System on a weekly basis; minus the lines noted in Table A2,
which represent public sector deposits and accrued interest. As of June 30, 2010, (the agreed baseline date) the sum
of private sector bank deposits and external short term liabilities of banks was US$8,394.9 million.
2

The regulations on reserve requirements and liquid asset requirements are NPB3-06 and NPB3-11.

53

Insurance Fund (IGD) and the BCR; (ii) will be applied to one licensed commercial banks
operating in El Salvador at the time the exercise is conducted and its impact over the banking
system; and (iii) will result in a detailed report that will be shared among participating regulatory
agencies.
16.
The issuance of norms to strengthen corporate governance of commercial banks will
include the following components: (i) rules governing the functioning, structure, composition,
and duties of boards of directors; (ii) requirements for committees formed by boards of directors,
including audit and risk committees; (iii) shareholders’ rights, including voting power in
proportion to their share of ownership, access to and rules for annual shareholders’ meetings, and
requirements for information sharing among shareholders; (iv) transparency guidelines; and (v)
guidelines on conflicts of interest within financial conglomerates.
G. Reporting Requirements
17.
To facilitate monitoring of program implementation, the government of El Salvador
will prepare and send to the IMF, by e-mail or by fax, monthly data and reports within six
weeks following the end of the preceding month, and quarterly data and reports within six weeks
after each test date, unless specified otherwise. Such data will include (but are not limited to) the

VIII.

Safeguards Assessments:
The Central Bank of El Salvador (BCR) is subject to an update safeguards assessment
under the current Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). The safeguards assessment associated to
the SBA approved on January 16, 2009 was finalized in May 2009, and an update for El
Salvador’s new SBA, approved on March 17, 2010, was completed on August 20, 2010.
The 2010 assessment found that the BCR has made progress in addressing safeguards
recommendations in the areas of internal control and legal structure. The update
concluded that efforts to adopt an international accepted accounting framework (e.g.,
IFRS) should be intensified, and recommended the publication of the audit opinions of
the independent audit firm and more systematic monitoring of audit recommendations.

IX.

Exchange Arrangements:
The U.S. dollar is legal tender and circulates freely. The dollar is used as a unit of
account and a medium of exchange, with no limitations. All payments may be made in
either dollars or colones. The BCR has the obligation to exchange colones for dollars
upon request from banks, at a fixed and unalterable exchange rate of C 8.75 per U.S.
dollar. As a result, El Salvador has an exchange rate arrangement with no separate legal
tender category. El Salvador has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3,
and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.

X.

Article IV Consultation:
The 2008 Article IV consultation was concluded on November 12, 2008 (SM/08/326).
The next Article IV consultation with El Salvador will be held in accordance with the
July 15, 2002 decision on consultation cycles. The current Article IV consultation was
delayed due to a change in government in 2009, albeit, engagement has been fluid in the
context of a formal IMF program that spanned two administrations.

59

XI.

FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
An FSAP Update was conducted in 2010. The report is to be considered by the
Executive Board on September 15, 2010. A fiscal ROSC was conducted in 2002 and
a data module ROSC was conducted in 2003.

II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK

1.
The IMF’s El Salvador team led by Andy Wolfe (Mission Chief) has met on various
occasions with the World Bank’s El Salvador team led by Laura Frigenti (Country Manager)
to address macro critical structural reforms and to coordinate the two teams’ work for the
period September 2010–August 2011.
2.
The teams have agreed that El Salvador’s main macroeconomic challenges are
achieving a durable fiscal consolidation, including by increasing revenues as a percent of
GDP, and improving the investment climate to boost the growth performance of the
economy. Reducing the public debt-to-GDP ratio to pre-crisis levels is a key priority,
especially in view of the high sensitivity of the debt trajectory to negative output shocks.
3.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams have identified five structural reform areas
as macro critical, in view of their central role in achieving fiscal consolidation and sustained
growth.

4



Subsidy reform: Reduce the need for budgetary transfers to pay for subsidies on
electricity and liquefied gas (LPG), in conjunction with maintaining subsidies to the
most vulnerable users. At present, electricity and LPG subsidies are poorly targeted,
and are estimated to represent a drain on government resources equal to 1.4 percent of
GDP in 2009.4 Reform of energy subsidies would provide fiscal space to accelerate
spending on infrastructure, security, and social programs, including education.



Tax reform: Boost tax revenue by at least 1½ percent of GDP. Such a reform would
establish a sustainable resource base for financing needed infrastructure, security, and
social outlays while ensuring that fiscal deficits decline and the public debt-to-GDP
ratio is put on a durable downward path.



Public financial management reform: Implement reforms to address shortcomings in
El Salvador’s budget process, including: (i) a requirement of super majorities in
Congress for approval of long-term financing; and (ii) the absence of a multi-year
framework. These weaknesses reduce the authorities’ ability to execute the investment
budget, with negative consequences for long-term growth.



Financial sector reform: Strengthen the regulatory framework by: (i) addressing
deficiencies in the bank resolution framework; (ii) issuing norms to enhance
supervision; and (iii) improving the legal framework for El Salvador’s capital markets.



Investment climate reform: Improve the growth performance of the economy.
Domestic and foreign investment in El Salvador remains low both in nominal terms and

Water usage and transportation subsidies were reformed in 2009.

61

as compared with regional peers. Relative weaknesses in areas such as security,
education, and innovation likely impact negatively on investment and growth.
4.
The teams agreed to support the authorities’ work in these areas with the following
division of labor:


Subsidy reform: The authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to reduce
electricity and LPG subsidies in the context of the current IMF program and have
committed to make public a plan to bring LPG prices closer to market rates, while still
protecting the most vulnerable through a consumption subsidy. They will also adjust
electricity tariffs to residential customers with an average monthly consumption above
99 kWh to more closely reflect market prices.



Tax reform: The authorities are working toward a fiscal pact that would be
implemented no later than 2012 and would include a tax reform aimed at boosting
revenues by at least 1½ percent of GDP, a goal that has been incorporated as a
structural benchmark in the current IMF program. The Fund is providing technical
assistance on the design of revenue measures that would underpin the increase,
including the possible increase in tax rates.



Public financial management reform: An IMF technical assistance mission visited
San Salvador in August to advise on improving budget management and execution and
was joined by a World Bank mission to work on designing a multi-year expenditure
framework. The World Bank is planning additional technical assistance focused on
strengthening tax collection agencies, modernizing public financial management and
enhancing public sector transparency. The operation is backed by a loan that is awaiting
congressional approval. In addition, a Fund mission will visit San Salvador in late
September 2010 as part of a fiscal transparency ROSC.



Financial sector reform: The 2010 update to El Salvador’s Financial Sector Stability
Assessment (FSSA) conducted by the World Bank and IMF found the financial system
had withstood the global financial crisis and was well-capitalized and liquid. At the
same time, the FSSA noted several vulnerabilities and opportunities for structural
reforms. Some of these elements, including congressional passage of the financial
supervision and regulation law and passage of an investment funds law, are
incorporated as structural benchmarks in the current IMF program. The authorities are
also considering reforms that would allow the central bank to undertake limited lenderof-last-resort (LOLR) functions, in line with FSSA recommendations.



Investment climate reform: To spur growth and investment during the remainder of
their term, the authorities plan to undertake fiscal reforms to create space for priority
expenditures, assume a more active role in promoting exports, and foster “public
private partnerships” to promote investment in infrastructure, including in the
electricity and energy sectors.

62

The teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:


The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in the above macro critical
structural reform areas. Timing: as needed.



The World Bank team requests to be kept informed of progress in the above macro

STATISTICAL ISSUES

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.

National Accounts: National accounts data are based on 1990 weights and compiled under the 1968 SNA, although
a project is underway to transition to the 1993 SNA and update the series to 2005 weights. The project also
envisages the publication of quarterly national accounts by expenditure, which are currently available on only an
annual basis.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) since 1998. El Salvador is taking a
flexibility option for the periodicity of the labor market
and wages/earnings data category and will continue at
this time to publish annual data with a timeliness of one
quarter after the end of the reference year.

A data ROSC was published in December 2004.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 23, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
El Salvador
On September 15, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with El Salvador.5
Background
The Salvadoran economy was severely affected in 2009 by the global economic slowdown.
International trade flows, remittances, and private capital flows declined, taking a heavy toll
on domestic economic activity and tax collections. Economic activity declined by 3.5 percent
in 2009, and inflation was zero. As a result, tax revenue declined sharply, and the nonfinancial public sector deficit widened to 5.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Bank
deposits continued to increase despite the global crisis and election-related uncertainty.
Asset quality deteriorated and bank profitability declined as a result of the economic
downturn, but the financial system weathered the shock well.
Economic recovery is underway. Exports, imports, and remittances are all increasing, and
economic activity has been growing since early this year. Economic growth is expected to
reach 1 percent in 2010, and inflation is forecasted to remain low at around 1.5 percent. The
current account deficit is expected to widen modestly to 2.75 percent of GDP from
1.75 percent of GDP in 2009, as domestic demand recovers. Tax revenue is rising and the
fiscal deficit is narrowing. Most bank indicators have improved in 2010, as deposits continue
to rise, profitability is recovering, non-performing loans have leveled off, and liquidity and
5

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

68

capital ratios remain well above their pre-crisis levels. In this light, the authorities are
treating their 36-month Stand-By Arrangement as precautionary.6
Fiscal policy has focused on mitigating the impact of the economic downturn on the most
vulnerable, within the context of maintaining a sustainable medium-term debt path. Savings
from reform of electricity, transportation, and water subsidies have been redirected toward
the authorities’ anti-crisis plan, which entails spending of about 1 percent of GDP per year
to improve social conditions and poverty alleviation. Tax revenue has increased, owing to
the effects of the December tax package and the economic recovery, while spending has
remained contained. The non-financial public sector deficit is expected to end the year at
4.75 percent of GDP, and narrow further in the medium term as fiscal consolidation efforts
and the economic recovery take hold.
As required by IMF procedures for cases of exceptional access, an Ex Post Evaluation
(EPE) of El Salvador’s experience with the exceptional access Stand-By Arrangement
approved in January 2009 was also reviewed by the Executive Board. The EPE focused on
program objectives and design, as well as key lessons from the experience. The report
found that the Stand-By Arrangement, which the authorities treated as precautionary,
contributed to preventing a crisis at the time of political transition, while acknowledging the
program quickly went off track due to the global crisis. Lessons learned include that large
precautionary financing packages, where appropriate, can help to prevent crises; and that
an approach that includes the candidates’ public endorsement of the program’s main
objectives can help maintain confidence around the time of elections.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their economic strategy and good
performance under the Stand-By Program. Directors noted that El Salvador’s economy is
gradually recovering after having been severely affected by the global crisis and that the
medium-term outlook is also generally favorable. Further strengthening the economy’s
growth prospects and reducing poverty will depend on a durable fiscal consolidation effort
and improvements in the investment climate through continued commitment to
macroeconomic and financial stability. Timely implementation of structural reforms will also
be important.
Directors supported the authorities’ strategy of gradually consolidating the public finances
as the economic recovery takes hold, while striking a reasonable balance between starting
fiscal consolidation and supporting the recovery, while maintaining adequate social and
public investment spending. Undertaking determined revenue-raising measures, including

The Stand-By Arrangement, with total access of SDR513.9 million (about US$777.5 million)
was approved on March 17, 2010 (see Press Release No. 10/95)

69

strengthening tax administration, and accelerating the reform of energy subsidies will be
consistent with these objectives.
Directors emphasized the need to place debt-to-GDP ratio on a firm downward path and
stressed the importance of the timely enactment of a fiscal pact and continued expenditure
restraint. They welcomed the authorities’ efforts to develop a medium-term expenditure
framework and encouraged them to strengthen debt management practices.
Directors noted that dollarization has served the economy well and helped maintain
macroeconomic stability. They also noted staff’s assessment that the real effective
exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals and stressed that it is important to take
measures to boost competitiveness.
Directors were encouraged that the Salvadoran banking system is liquid and wellcapitalized but noted that further reforms aimed at enhancing its stability will be critical to
strengthen its resilience. They called for swift approval of the Financial Sector Supervision
and Regulation Law and supported the plans to bolster the corporate governance of banks
and to upgrade the bank resolution framework. Directors encouraged the authorities to limit
the fiscal risks involved in increasing the role of public banks in the provision of credit.
Directors welcomed the opportunity to review El Salvador's experience with the 2009
exceptional access Stand-By Arrangement. They supported the key messages of the ex
post evaluation report that the Arrangement contributed to reducing uncertainty during the
political transition and that access to sizable external financing and the endorsement of
program objectives by the leading presidential candidates, helped maintain depositors’
confidence and signal policy continuity.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Press Release No. 10/347
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 20, 2010

IMF Executive Board Concludes First Review of El Salvador’s Stand-By Arrangement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has concluded the first review of
El Salvador’s performance under its 36-month Stand-by Arrangement. The main objectives of El
Salvador’s economic program under the arrangement are to bolster economic recovery, reduce
poverty, preserve financial stability, and secure debt sustainability. The Stand-By Arrangement
was approved on March 17, 2010 in the amount equivalent to SDR513.9 million (about
US$781 million). The Salvadoran authorities intend to continue treating the arrangement as
precautionary (see Press Release No. 10/95).
Following the Executive Board discussion of El Salvador on September 15, 2010, Mr. Naoyuki
Shinohara, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“The Salvadoran economy continues its gradual recovery from the global downturn and the
medium-term outlook is also generally favorable. Over the longer term, further strengthening the
economy’s growth prospects and reducing poverty, while safeguarding fiscal sustainability,
requires a comprehensive strategy, including measures to raise revenues, structural reforms
aimed at enhancing the business climate, and higher private investment.
“The authorities’ Fund-supported economic program seeks to consolidate gradually the public
finances as the economic recovery takes hold. The authorities’ strategy for 2011, which includes
strengthening tax administration to increase revenues as well as reforming energy subsidies, will
create space for high-priority social spending and public investment while lowering the fiscal
deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP.
“Beyond 2011, timely enactment of a fiscal pact, which includes measures to raise revenue on a
durable basis, and continued adherence to expenditure targets in the authorities’ program will be
critical to sustain fiscal consolidation, placing the debt-to-GDP ratio on a firm downward path.
“Continued commitment to the dollarization regime has been the cornerstone of macroeconomic
and financial stability. While the Salvadoran banking system is liquid and well-capitalized, it
would benefit from further reforms aimed at enhancing its resilience. Approving the Financial
Sector Supervision and Regulation Law, bolstering the corporate governance of banks, and

72

upgrading the bank resolution framework will be key to this objective. Limiting the fiscal risks
associated with the provision of credit by public banks will also be necessary,” Mr. Shinohara
said.

Statement by Ramón Guzmán, Executive Director for El Salvador
September 15, 2010
We would like to thank staff for their comprehensive set of papers and for the constructive
dialogue with our authorities. They broadly agree with Staff’s assessment and recommendations.
Ex Post Evaluation of Exceptional Access Under the 2009 Stand-By Arrangement.
Given that we agree with staff’s analysis, we would like to make the following comments for
emphasis only:
1. As expressed in several opportunities, we consider the 2009 Stand-By Arrangement as a
successful case of IMF’s support. The authorities, as well as economic agents, were
concerned that sudden banking deposits outflows around the time of presidential elections
could have a significant effect in a small, open and fully dollarized economy, given previous
experience. In that sense, as staff rightly points out, the main objective of the program was to
prevent a crisis of confidence by sending a signal of policy continuity and by securing a
liquidity buffer in case risks materialized.
2. Although we cannot evaluate what the case would have been without a program, we can be
sure the program was successful in the sense that the country did not experience a crisis and
it preserved financial stability during the election and transition periods, despite the effects of
the global crisis. Moreover, sovereign spreads remained stable and in line with those in the
region.
3. Another factor that contributed to the success of the program was the engagement of both
presidential candidates with its main objectives, reflected in their public statements.
4. Although we agree with staff that a more conservative initial macroeconomic framework
would have been useful to avoid deviations, we believe the program was well designed
considering the information available and the prevailing uncertainty about the duration and
magnitude of the global crisis at the time of approval (January 2009).
5. We should not forget that the Salvadoran program was a pioneer of the High Access
Precautionary Arrangements (HAPAs). As such, the Salvadoran experience was instrumental
for other countries in the region which gained access to similar programs after the reform of
the Fund’s toolkit in March 2009.
6. Finally, we believe that the program’s main objectives (to prevent deposit flight, preserve
macroeconomic stability, and boost the economy’s resilience to shocks), were satisfactorily
accomplished.

74

First Review Under the Stand-By Arrangement and 2010 Article IV Consultation
We believe the SBA has provided crucial support to the authorities in their commitment to sound
macroeconomic policies and helped anchor confidence of depositors, investors and creditors. It
has also provided an important liquidity buffer to support the dollarized financial system in case
negative shocks occur.
As Staff mentions, performance under the SBA has been good. All the quantitative performance
criteria for end-March and end-June were met.
In the structural area, plans for liquid propane gas subsidy reform have been finished and will be
in effect by end-2010; the large tax-payers unit has been strengthened, and a risk-management
approach to taxpayer selection for audits is being adopted. The strategic plan for the
modernization of the Domestic Tax Administration Directorate and the General Customs
Administration Directorate is in progress, and the process of enhancing coordination across the
two agencies has begun. The financial sector supervision and regulation law is up for
congressional approval, which is expected by end-December 2010.
New structural benchmarks for the second review were established, including a budget for 2011
consistent with a fiscal deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP, the undertaking of a bank resolution
simulation exercise, and the issuance of norms on corporate governance of commercial banks.
Recent Developments
Although at a modest pace, the economic recovery is gaining terrain. In the first quarter of 2010
GDP fell only 0.5 percent (y/y) after declining 4.9 percent in the last quarter of 2009. The
monthly index of economic activity rose 1.9 percent in June 2010 (driven mainly by increases in
manufacturing, financial services and retail trade), in line with the envisaged 1.0 percent GDP
growth for the end of the year.
Prices have remained stable during 2010. In July 2010, headline inflation was 1.0 percent (y/y),
while core inflation observed a reduction from 2.6 percent at the end of 2009 to 0.9 percent in
July 2010.
International trade has been recovering in 2010 after observing a significant decrease in 2009. As
of July 2010 (y-t-d), exports observed an increase of 14 percent and imports rose by 17 percent.
Remittances have recovered modestly: as of July 2010 (y-t-d) they increased by 2.5 percent.
Capital account inflows are weaker than envisaged, owing mainly to delays in disbursements
from IFIs. That situation may lead to a decrease of US$200 million in net international reserves
(compared with an increase of US$100 million projected in the program).
Regarding the financial system, deposits have risen, profitability is improving and nonperforming loans have stabilized. Liquidity and capital ratios are well above those observed

75

before the crisis. Notwithstanding, as in many other countries in the region, credit to private
sector reactivation remains a challenge.
Macroeconomic Outlook
The outlook for 2010 and 2011 remains broadly unchanged since the approval of the SBA. We
continue assuming a gradual recovery, with real GDP growth projected at 1.0 percent in 2010
and 2.5 percent in 2011.
Inflation projections are unchanged at 1.5 percent in 2010 and 2.75 percent in 2011. The current
account deficit is expected to be 2.8 percent in 2010 and 3.1 percent in 2011, slightly higher than
previously projected
Economic and Social Program
Our authorities’ macroeconomic program will be anchored on strict adherence to official
dollarization and a prudent fiscal policy while safeguarding social spending. In that context, they
have implemented poverty reduction programs and are making progress on improving targeting
of critical government expenditure (particularly energy subsidies), in line with their policy
framework of taking the fiscal deficit and public debt ratio on a sustained downward path. Our
authorities have also moved ahead with key reforms in the financial sector aimed at
strengthening oversight and bolster resilience to shocks.
Fiscal Policy
For 2010, fiscal policy will continue to be aimed at reducing gradually the NFPS deficit to
4.8 percent of GDP (5.6 percent in 2009), while protecting spending on social programs and
investment in key sectors.
For 2011, as mentioned, our authorities are seeking congressional approval of a budget
consistent with an NFPS deficit of no more than 3.5 percent of GDP, implying a reduction of
more than one percentage point of GDP with respect to the expected 2010 outturn, making
evident our authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation. Moreover, the 2011 budget will
reallocate spending away from poorly-targeted subsidies to key social programs.
The envisaged deficit targets for 2010 and 2011 take place against the backdrop of a moderatelypaced recovery of economic activity and are expected to take the non-financial gross public
sector debt ratio to 51 percent of GDP in 2011; thereafter, the ratio is expected to decline steadily
to 46.8 percent of GDP by 2015.
Saving of revenue overperformance. If tax revenues were to exceed those projected under the
program in 2010, authorities will use up to 50 percent of the excess revenue to increase spending
in social programs, with the remainder allocated to meet the adjusted performance criterion on
the overall balance of the non-financial public sector.

76

Medium-term fiscal strategy. The authorities are improving transparency and planning of
government operations by implementing a fiscal consolidation medium- term strategy. Their
efforts started with the publication of the 2010–14 government program (Plan Quinquenal de
Desarrollo). Beginning with the 2011 budget, authorities will introduce a multi-year expenditure
framework that will seek consistency between the short-term and medium-term objectives of
putting the NFPS deficit and public debt ratio on a sustainable downward trajectory. Key to this
effort will be the implementation of a fiscal pact (by end-June 2012) to be achieved through
intensive consultation with a broad range of stakeholders with the objective, among others, to
increase government revenues over the medium term between 1.5 and 3.0 percent of GDP
through 2015.
Financial Sector
The authorities are committed to preserving and protecting the soundness and stability of the
Salvadoran banking system, and are adopting reforms to enhance resilience and increase the
efficiency of financial intermediation.
Authorities will seek congressional approval of the Financial Sector Supervision and Regulation
Law by end-December 2010 (a structural benchmark under the program). The bill strengthens
financial sector supervision by merging supervisory entities for banks, pensions, and the stock
market. It enhances the autonomy of the merged institution; empowers the Central Reserve Bank
of El Salvador (BCR) to be the only regulator of the financial system; and it provides legal
protection for supervisors. In addition, the bill bolsters cross-border consolidated supervision by
permitting the superintendency of the financial system to share information on local operations
with foreign supervisors.
Authorities will also seek congressional approval of the Investment Funds Law (a structural
benchmark under the program) by end-March 2011. The law aims at facilitating financial
intermediation by creating a clear framework for investment funds, specifying accounting and
asset valuation rules, and setting the rules for investor entry and exit.
Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA). We noted that the main findings of the updated
FSSA confirm improvement of the banking system soundness since the FSSA in 2004, with
solvency in good stance and advances in supervisory practices. The authorities are in broad
agreement with the findings and recommendations of the FSSA and have been taking actions to
attain the recommended enhancements to the legal framework and bank safety net arrangements,
including securing congress approval of the Financial Sector Supervision and Regulation Law,
and the Investment Funds Law. They also plan to carry out a comprehensive bank resolution
simulation exercise by February 2011.
Competitiveness
There is agreement between staff and authorities that real effective exchange rate appears to be
broadly in line with fundamentals. Our authorities also agree that investment remains low
relative to other countries in the region and recognize that there is room to improve the business
climate in areas such as security, education and innovation. They are clear that addressing the

77

security situation is a priority in the short term; therefore their economic and social program
contemplates to allocate more resources to this area and to education. They are also considering
proposals to promoting innovation, modernizing key productive sectors and increasing regional
integration.
Economic Growth Challenge
Our authorities agree with staff that a key medium-term challenge is to improve the economy’s
growth performance. To stimulate growth and investment during the rest of its administration,
the government plans to assume a more active role in promoting exports and foster public-private
partnerships to stimulate investment in basic infrastructure.
The government is also evaluating how to enhance the role of public banks to support lending to
private sector, which remains subdued. Our authorities believe that a more active role of public
banks can help to spur that credit. The envisaged measures are based on the premise that public
banks’ participation has to be transparent and without a significant fiscal burden.
Downside Risks
We share staff’s view that a slower economic recovery in the US – given the close linkages of El
Salvador with the US economy – and a breakdown of political support to the fiscal consolidation
process are the main risks to the authorities’ strategy. Although the risks are broadly balanced,
our authorities are aware that were those risks to materialize, in absence of political support to
revenue measures, authorities will have to reduce spending to avoid forms of financing that
could endanger debt sustainability.
Finally, we believe that the envisaged policies are adequate to meet the objectives of the
authorities’ economic and social program and we are certain that authorities stand ready to take
additional measures (in consultation with the Fund) that should be necessary for that purpose.
We also think that the SBA will be instrumental to preserve El Salvador’s macroeconomic
stability and to help support economic recovery during the following years.
