BARBADOS
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2006 Consultation with Barbados
Approved by Caroline Atkinson and Scott Brown
July 20, 2006
• Discussions. A staff team held discussions in Bridgetown during May 3–16, 2006. The team met
with Ms. Mia Mottley, Deputy Prime Minister; Mr. Clyde Mascoll, Minister of State in the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Affairs; Mr. Grantley Smith, Director General of the Minister of Finance and
Economic Affairs; Ms. Marion Williams, Governor of the Central Bank of Barbados; other senior
officials; and representatives from the private sector.
• Team. The team comprised Jorge Roldos (Head), Sergio Martin, Carlene Francis, Irineu de
Carvalho Filho (all WHD), and Eugenio Cerutti (FIN). Mr. Clements (WHD) joined the mission for
the final discussions, and Mr. Fried (Executive Director) and Mr. Campbell (Advisor) also
participated.
• Previous consultation. The 2005 Article IV Consultation was concluded on August 5, 2005, with
the Staff Report issued as IMF Country Report No. 05/297. Directors underscored that a key challenge
in sustaining strong economic growth would be to address macroeconomic imbalances, including a
high level of public debt, large fiscal and external current account deficits, and declining international
reserves. Directors welcomed steps to slow the growth of credit, and encouraged the use of indirect
monetary instruments. They underlined the importance of structural reforms to encourage foreign
direct investment, improve competitiveness, and enhance growth. Directors also emphasized the
importance of continued commitment to further trade and capital account liberalization, and urged the
authorities to rationalize costly fiscal incentives.

•

Relations with the Fund. Barbados has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and
4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions. The Barbados dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at
BDS$2=US$1 since 1975.
• Data. The statistical information provided by Barbados is broadly adequate for surveillance
purposes, but weaknesses remain. In particular, the coverage and transparency of data on public sector
entities and capital account transactions need to be improved. Barbados participates in the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS).

•

Report publication. Past Staff Reports on Barbados have been published. The authorities have not
indicated yet their consent to the publication of this year’s document.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent developments
Barbados’ economy continued to grow in 2005, but macroeconomic imbalances worsened.
GDP growth is running at about 4 percent, but inflation of more than 6 percent and the widening
of the current account deficit to 12½ percent of GDP are raising vulnerabilities, particularly in
the context of the exchange rate peg. The fiscal position was relatively stable in 2005/06, but
government debt remains above 80 percent of GDP. Credit to the private sector has continued to
grow at fast pace, but strong capital inflows have financed the external deficit and prevented a
further loss of gross international reserves (GIR) in 2005.
Policy discussions
The discussions focused on the need to address macroeconomic imbalances and achieve
sustainable growth. The outlook for near-term growth is auspicious, as the private and public
sectors intensify preparations for the 2007 Cricket World Cup (CWC). However, Barbados faces
risks associated with the large current account deficit, as well as with high oil prices and elevated
levels of debt. These could weigh negatively on growth, especially in the aftermath of the CWC.
The mission recommended a tightening of policies to reduce risks of overheating, protect
the exchange rate peg, and bring public debt to safe levels. Monetary policy was tightened in
2005, but credit to the private sector has continued to grow at a fast pace. The staff
recommended a further increase in policy rates, but the authorities expected the increases of
2005 to eventually achieve the desired reduction in credit growth. The nonfinancial public sector
deficit is expected to widen by 2½ percent of GDP in 2007/08 (to about 3 percent). The mission
recommended that this fiscal expansion be avoided, and to bring the debt-to-GDP ratio to under
60 percent by 2011. The authorities preferred a more gradual path of fiscal consolidation.
The mission supported the objective of maintaining the currency peg, provided that
macroeconomic imbalances are corrected and structural reforms to enhance
competitiveness are strengthened. Weaknesses in competitiveness could compromise external
adjustment in the medium term. The mission argued that competitiveness could be best fostered
by structural reforms, including trade liberalization, privatization, and the rationalization of
sectoral incentive programs—including limiting support for the sugar adaptation strategy to
commercially viable activities.
The authorities agreed on the need to keep a watchful eye on banks’ asset quality and a
recent fall in their net foreign asset position. Official banking indicators appear sound, but
large capital inflows combined with rapid domestic credit growth could pose risks to the
soundness of the system. The authorities also agreed on a gradual opening up of the capital
account, and reported a number of measures to strengthen the financial sector regulatory
framework and to develop financial market infrastructure.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Barbados has favorable economic and social indicators by regional standards, as
well as strong and stable political institutions. Tourism and financial services are major
sources of employment and foreign exchange. Per capita income is the highest in the region and
the country enjoys an investment grade rating. The country ranks high in the United Nations
Development Program’s Human Development Index, poverty is low, and unemployment has
been declining. Business conditions are adequate, and corruption and crime are low.

2.
Political stability has reinforced a social consensus that ensures policy continuity.
Barbados is a parliamentary democracy where the ruling Barbados Labor Party (BLP), led by
Prime Minister Owen Arthur, has been in office since 1994 and enjoys a large majority in
parliament. The next elections are due in April 2008. A tripartite partnership among the
government, business, and trade unions, provides a framework for wage negotiations and
coordinated responses to challenges arising from increasing regional and global integration.

6
3.
Barbados’ economy did well in the 1990s, but the post-9/11 global slowdown led to
the emergence of macroeconomic imbalances. Following eight years of 3 percent average
GDP growth, low inflation and fiscal deficits under 3 percent of GDP, real GDP growth turned
negative in 2001 and stayed low in 2002–03. In response, the government launched a “national
emergency program” of public investment in late-2001. While this helped revive economic
activity, it also contributed to a widening of the overall budget deficit, an increase in government
debt, and increasing external imbalances.
4.
GDP growth was among the highest in the region in 2004–05, but signs of
overheating emerged (Figure 1). The economy started to recover in 2003, and GDP grew at
around 4 percent a year in 2004–05 under a benign external environment and expansionary
policies. Investment picked up pace in the last two years, fueled by rapid credit expansion and
strong capital inflows, but at the expense of increasing external current account deficits. Inflation
remained below regional averages, anchored by the long-standing peg to the U.S. dollar, but
accelerated in 2005. Public sector debt remained at high levels, but in contrast to other countries
in the region, was largely domestic.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Barbados’ economy continued to grow in 2005, but inflation accelerated to more
than 6 percent. GDP growth was 3.9 percent in 2005, slightly lower than in 2004, and
unemployment fell to a historical low of 9 percent (Figure 2). Higher inflation reflected the passthrough of higher oil prices, as well as domestic demand pressures, as highlighted by an increase
in core inflation—which excludes food, transportation, fuel, and light—from almost zero in 2004
to 4 percent in 2005 (Box 1).
6.
The overall fiscal position deteriorated slightly in 2005, after improvements in
2003–04. Although the central government balance improved as a result of buoyant tax revenues,
extrabudgetary capital expenditures ahead of the CWC increased to around 2 percent of GDP
(Figure 3). Public enterprises continued to lower their deficits, and the National Insurance
Scheme (NIS) achieved a surplus of 3.3 percent of GDP.1
7.
The authorities tightened monetary policy in 2005 but credit to the private sector
continued to grow at a fast pace (Figure 4). Despite a four-step 250 basis points increase in the
minimum deposit rate to 4.75 percent, private sector credit rose by 21.7 percent in 2005—driven
mostly by lending to the tourism and personal sectors. Commercial banks reduced excess
reserves and net foreign assets to finance this expansion.

Previous Fund reports did not incorporate NIS balances in the fiscal accounts.

8.
Financial indicators suggest that the
banking system continues to be sound.
Nonperforming loans fell to 5.5 percent of total
loans in 2005, from 7.9 percent in 2002, but
they remain higher than in other countries in
the region. The capital adequacy ratio of the
four locally-incorporated banks declined from
25 percent in 2003 to 13 percent in 2005,
reflecting high growth in banks’ assets, as well
as an increasing share of loans in banks’
balance sheets.

The external current account deficit deteriorated further, reaching 12.4 percent of
GDP in 2005, driven by higher oil imports and domestic demand. Almost half of the
deterioration in the current account deficit in 2004–06, relative to 2000–03, is explained by
increased oil imports (see Table). Large increases in private spending, fueled by rapid credit
growth, have also contributed to the deterioration in the current account—despite the real
effective exchange rate depreciation and falling unit labor costs.

10.
While imports of goods and services accelerated over the last three years, growth in
tourism has been less impressive, and strong capital inflows have financed the external gap
(Figure 5). Imports and exports of goods (including beverages and chemicals) have grown at
two-digit rates since 2003. In contrast, tourism receipts recovered strongly in 2003, but stagnated
thereafter. Strong capital inflows, including a US$125 million sovereign bond issued in
December 2005 and the funding of private sector projects associated mostly with tourism, curbed
a decline in gross international reserves that had started in 2003—and reserves covered
3.5 months of imports by end-2005.
11.
Barbados has made progress in structural reforms in some key areas. The authorities
continued their program to cut income tax rates aimed at improving competitiveness. They have
also liberalized further the telecommunication sector, and privatized a major insurance company.
In 2005, arrangements were concluded for Barbados’ formal membership in the CARICOM
Single Market and Economy (CSME). More recently, a reduction in foreign exchange controls
has effectively liberalized travel arrangements within CARICOM and facilitated the holding of
foreign currency accounts.
III. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
The medium-term outlook is favorable, although uncertainties remain in light of
significant macroeconomic imbalances. The outlook for economic activity in 2006–07 is
auspicious, as the private and public sectors intensify preparations for the 2007 CWC. However,
Barbados faces risks associated with the large current account deficit and the rapid expansion in
domestic credit, as well as with high oil prices and elevated levels of both private and public
debt. These could weigh negatively on growth, especially in the aftermath of the CWC.
13.
The path of external adjustment envisaged under current policies is very gradual,
which could imply a fall in reserves to low levels by historical standards. In the medium-term
baseline scenario, which is based on the mission’s understanding of the authorities’ policies for
the 2006–11 period, the current account deficit falls slightly (to around 10 percent of GDP in
2008 and then to 7 percent in 2011). The authorities’ current policy is to limit public sector
external borrowing to at most cover amortization needs, implying that the current account deficit,
net of private capital inflows, would be financed out of reserves. Under this assumption, reserves
would decline to about 2½ months of imports of goods and services in 2007–08 and to just above
two months by 2010.

Rapid credit growth also poses some
risks to the outlook. Increased competition in
the banking system after the entry of regional
banks has contributed to rapid credit growth
since 2003, and has accelerated an ongoing
mortgage boom (see Figure).2 The lack of an
index of real estate prices makes it difficult to
assess the run up in values, but anecdotal
evidence suggests that Barbados has also
experienced a substantial rise in property values.
Although historically the real estate sector
appears to have been quite resilient, a correction
in real estate values could place pressure on
household net worth and the banking system,
with concomitant adverse effects on growth.

1/ Trends are rolling HP-filters, constructed by applying consecutive HP
filters using data from the beginning of the sample to each particular year.

15.
High oil prices and debt levels leave little room for the public and private sectors to
adjust to unexpected shocks. The persistent nature of the current oil shock suggests the need to
adjust domestic absorption, rather than continuing to finance higher oil payments with
borrowing. Public sector debt in Barbados remains high, even if it has not reached the levels in
some other Caribbean countries. Like other small economies in the region, Barbados is
vulnerable to weather-related and external demand shocks. For instance, public debt
sustainability tests (Appendix VI) show that a combined shock to interest rates, GDP growth, and
the primary fiscal balance, would bring already high debt levels to 86 percent of GDP in 2011, in
contrast to the baseline scenario debt ratio of 75 percent of GDP. Improved current account and
balance sheet positions would provide more flexibility to cushion such shocks.
IV. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
16.
Discussions focused on the need to tighten macroeconomic policies to reduce the
external deficit and promote debt sustainability over the medium term, and to implement
structural reforms to enhance growth. The direction of policies over recent years was broadly
in line with Fund policy advice, until the fiscal easing of the past year. The authorities argued
that the current fiscal stance and a more gradual path of fiscal adjustment going forward than that
suggested by the Fund would help to sustain growth and employment. In the staff’s view, a
tightening of fiscal policies is urgently needed in order to safeguard the external position and
2

Although private sector credit growth is above trend, only mortgages have grown fast enough to satisfy
standard definitions of a credit boom (see Gourinchas, Valdes and Landerretche, 2001, “Lending Booms:
Latin America and the World,” NBER Working Paper No. 8249).

10
support the currency peg, that has provided an anchor for price stability for three decades. Fiscal
restraint is also needed to ensure medium-term fiscal consolidation and lower government debt,
now close to 82 percent of GDP. The mission also emphasized that structural reforms would
enhance growth prospects and strengthen competitiveness to assist medium-term external
adjustment.
17.
To provide a framework to analyze the external adjustment process, the mission
prepared different medium-term scenarios that incorporate an active scenario with a more
ambitious plan for adjustment and structural reforms. Both the baseline scenario, on
unchanged policies, and the more active scenario, envisage continued rapid growth in 2006–07,
and a slowdown thereafter. The baseline scenario is based on the authorities’ short and mediumterm targets for fiscal policy, and implies a deficit of 3 percent of GDP for the nonfinancial
public sector (NFPS) in 2007, and somewhat lower deficits from 2008 onward.3 This would
leave debt at around 75 percent of GDP in 2011. The active scenario entails slower growth in
2007 than the baseline, owing to tighter monetary and fiscal policies.4 However, it results in
higher growth from 2008 onward as a result of greater progress in reducing public debt and
enhanced structural reforms. The active scenario incorporates a stronger fiscal adjustment that
avoids the procyclical fiscal impulse in the near term and brings the debt-to-GDP ratio to around
60 percent in 2011, and around 40 percent in 2015.
A. Fiscal Policy for Macroeconomic Stability and Debt Sustainability
18.
The Barbadian authorities see fiscal consolidation as an important policy objective,
but a number of policy initiatives are likely to worsen the fiscal position over the medium
term. The authorities consider a deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP for the central government to be
sustainable over the medium term, and are committed to this target. Continued discipline over
current budgetary expenditures allowed the central government to achieve a lower-than-expected
deficit in 2005/06, and is expected to help contain spending within the authorities’ ceiling over
the medium term. Going forward, innovative private-public partnerships (PPPs) for the provision
of infrastructure and other services could contribute to containing capital expenditures, although
adding to current outlays in the future.5 Nevertheless, capital and extra budgetary expenditures
will continue at relatively high levels in 2006/07 and 2007/08, and no new revenue-raising
measures are contemplated. Combined with the removal of the temporary 6 percent import tariff
3

The NFPS comprises the central government, social security system, public enterprises, and offbudgetary operations.

Higher VAT rates and public enterprise prices account for higher inflation in 2006 in the active scenario,
while less crowding out and higher deposit growth allow more room for credit to the private sector
beginning in 2007.
5

At this stage, the mission followed current fiscal accounting practices of treating these projects as
regular extra budgetary capital expenditures, until more detailed information on contractual obligations of
the government, promoters and lenders, is provided by the authorities.

11
surcharge and the start of the sugar adaptation project, the overall NFPS deficit is projected to
rise to 3 percent of GDP in 2007/08.6
19.
In the mission’s view, an early fiscal adjustment is necessary to contain
macroeconomic imbalances and avoid the need to sharply tighten policies during the
expected slowdown in the aftermath of the CWC (Box 2). The staff also argued that presently
favorable domestic and international economic and financial conditions are the best times for an
early adoption of measures to correct the procyclical fiscal stance. In this context, the mission
recommended a fiscal adjustment strategy comprising both expenditure and revenue measures to
increase the NFPS primary surplus to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2006/07 (see Figure). On the
revenue side, the mission suggested an increase in VAT rates and a reduction in exemptions. The
mission also encouraged the authorities to increase the prices charged by major public
enterprises, some of which have not been raised for several years. In addition, a more automatic
and transparent pricing mechanism for these products and services would be highly desirable. In
particular, oil price increases would have to be fully passed on to consumers.7 Finally, the
mission recommended a nominal freeze on discretionary spending, restraint on wage
adjustments, and postponement of some capital expenditures. In particular, the active scenario
assumes a more gradual implementation of the sugar adaptation project (over five rather than
three years).

According to the Prime Minister’s Economic and Financial Policy Statement, the sugar adaptation
strategy includes the construction of a multipurpose facility for the production of refined sugar,
electricity, and ethanol. The estimated cost of the facility is US$150 million (or 5 percent of 2005 GDP)
over three years. This figure does not include the costs of increasing land acreage dedicated to the
cultivation of sugar cane and other costs.

The January 2006 increase in domestic fuel prices implied almost a full pass-through of international oil
price increases. However, the further increase in international prices since then has only partially been
passed on.

12

20.
The authorities saw the proposed adjustment strategy as too sharp. They argued that
2006 was an exceptional year, as the country had to meet the challenges associated with hosting
the CWC. However, they indicated that fiscal policy would be further tightened if the decline in
GIR was sharper than envisaged. They also reiterated their desire to reduce public debt,
including publicly-guaranteed debt, to 60 percent of GDP. Finally, the authorities noted that the
water and transportation companies would be put under the regulatory umbrella of the Fair
Trading Commission, which is expected to contribute to more timely reviews of pricing
decisions.
21.
Following a pause in 2007/08—to avoid exacerbating an expected slowdown postCWC—the mission recommended a further fiscal effort thereafter to bring the primary
surplus to above 5 percent of GDP and debt to safer levels. In the baseline scenario, the debtto-GDP ratio would decline from 82 percent in 2005 to 72 percent in 2007, owing to low real
interest rates, rapid growth, and a conservative assumption that the government draws down
deposits at the central bank as the primary source of funding. However, a partial reversal of such
conditions after 2007 implies that the ratio goes back up to 75 percent of GDP by 2011. The
mission suggested lower extrabudgetary expenditures and the winding down of the sugar
adaptation project to bring the debt-to-GDP ratio to under the 60 percent target by 2011. The
authorities indicated that they prefer a more gradual adjustment path, with the aim of reaching
the debt target in 2015.
22.
The authorities argued that the Barbados government has a number of assets that
should be taken into account for debt sustainability assessments. Public sector debt net of
NIS holdings falls from 64 percent of GDP in 2005 to 55 percent in 2011 in the baseline
scenario. The NIS assets are, however, earmarked to meet future pension liabilities.
23.
The mission commended the authorities’ management of the NIS, whose assets
reached 27 percent of GDP by end-2005. A 2003 reform of the pension system improved the
solvency of the NIS, enabling the institution to provide more than 2 percentage points of GDP of
funding to the rest of the NFPS in 2005. Sound asset management guidelines and practices have
contributed to historical nominal returns of more than 6 percent. To improve portfolio
diversification, the NIS has a stated objective of reducing the exposure of its portfolio to the
public sector, currently at around 60 percent of total assets. In addition to investing more in
foreign assets, the NIS could contribute further to the development of long-term government and
corporate debt markets by allocating a higher share of its portfolio to these assets and a lower
share to T-bills.

24.
There are a number of options under consideration for improving the formulation
of fiscal policy and the dissemination of fiscal data to the public. The mission noted that the
authorities have strengthened their coverage of developments in the NFPS, which would help in
evaluating fiscal policy and debt dynamics. The staff suggested going further to include
operations outside the central government in budget documents, and incorporate these into the
authorities’ new medium-term fiscal framework, which is projected for implementation in
2007/08. Finally, the mission was encouraged by the authorities’ interest in undertaking the
fiscal module for the IMF’s Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), which is
expected to be completed for the next Article IV consultation.
25.
The mission and the authorities agreed that there was also scope to strengthen the
management of public sector debt. The evolution of the public debt could be better monitored
by focusing on the NFPS primary surplus, that together with interest rates and GDP growth are
the main determinants of public debt dynamics. In addition, the mission suggested the
publication of an annual issuance calendar, which would greatly improve the asset management
activities of the NIS and other institutional investors.
B. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
26.
The authorities have announced that no additional increases in interest rates are
contemplated for 2006, as the rate increases of 2005 would eventually lead to the desired
reduction in credit growth. Preliminary figures for the first quarter of 2006 suggest that credit
growth has slowed down somewhat, but both the authorities and market participants believe that
it is still too early to gauge the extent of the slowdown. Moreover, despite a sharp decrease in
liquidity, banks still have relatively large holdings of T-bills and access to parent bank funds to
continue financing credit growth.

14
27.
In the mission’s view, it would be important to further tighten monetary policy to
correct domestic and external imbalances. A number of considerations argue for additional
monetary tightening. First, real interest rates have declined close to zero as core inflation has
climbed, projected to be close to 5 percent in 2006. In light of this inflation and the economy’s
advanced cyclical position, a further increase in nominal interest rates would be well timed.
Second, international interest rates have continued to rise, and the existence of negative
differentials might lead to foreign exchange market pressures. Third, strong competition for
market share in the banking system appears to have changed the monetary transmission
mechanism, with declining spreads requiring a larger increase in the minimum deposit rate for
the same effect on lending rates.
28.
The authorities acknowledged the need for interest rates to rise, but expected the
market to achieve this outcome without central bank intervention. They expect tight
liquidity conditions to lead to further increases in T-bill and lending rates. However, the
authorities also noted that if market rates did not increase in the near term, they would be
prepared to adjust policy rates.
29.
The mission discussed with the authorities the scope for expanding the use of
indirect monetary policy instruments. The mission recommended that Barbados increase
gradually the use of indirect monetary instruments, in preparation for the phasing out of capital
account restrictions envisaged under the CSME. Increased reliance on indirect instruments would
also have a salutary effect on banks’ efficiency and would help to develop financial markets.8
The authorities viewed indirect instruments to be ineffective in implementing monetary policy,
as financial markets are insufficiently developed. Nevertheless, they also noted that efforts are
underway to deepen these markets—including the integration of bank and securities settlement
systems, the dematerialization of government securities, and the establishment of deliveryversus-payments systems—that will facilitate the introduction of indirect monetary instruments.
30.
The mission supported the authorities’ plan to open up the capital account
gradually in the context of the CSME. A timetable for fulfilling the mandates of the CSME is
to be deferred until 2007. The mission agreed with the authorities that this liberalization should
be contingent on macroeconomic conditions in Barbados, including the correction of
macroeconomic imbalances. In addition, the mission recommended that the authorities keep a
watchful eye on the recent decrease in banks’ net foreign asset position. Even if banks’ currency
positions are balanced, mismatches across banks and corporates could lead to an increase in
credit and/or rollover risks.
31.
The mission recommended that the authorities keep a vigilant eye on the potential
for deterioration in credit quality during the present episode of strong credit growth. The
8

See W. Samuel and L. Valderrama, 2006, “The Monetary Policy Regime and Banking Spreads in
Barbados,” forthcoming IMF Working Paper.

15
financial system in Barbados is adequately regulated and supervised, but since financial
soundness indicators generally lag the development of credit problems, the mission suggested
that particular attention be given during regular inspections to the early detection of potential
problems associated with rapid credit growth—in particular in the personal/mortgage sectors.
32.
The mission commended the authorities’ recent efforts to strengthen the regulatory
framework of the financial system, including further implementation of several
recommendations from the 2002 FSAP (see Appendix IV). Guidelines on market risk for
commercial banks, and legislation on deposit insurance, are expected to be implemented before
year-end. Implementation of Basel II regulations is expected for 2009. Also, the government is
well advanced in drafting legislation to create a new Financial Services Commission to supervise
institutional investors and other nonbank financial intermediaries, while the large credit unions
would be placed under the supervision of the central bank.
33.
To assist the authorities in their further efforts to strengthen the financial system,
the mission encouraged the authorities to undertake an FSAP update in 2007. The mission
also supported the authorities’ plan to undergo a mutual evaluation of AML/CFT by the
Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) in 2006.
C. Exchange Rate and Income Policies
34.
The mission supported the objective of maintaining the currency peg, which would
require macroeconomic imbalances to be corrected and structural reforms accelerated. The
peg has served as a strong anchor of price stability and investor confidence. An early tightening
of fiscal policy, combined with an increase in interest rates, is likely to reduce the growth of
domestic demand to more sustainable levels. This would bring down the current account deficit,
while keeping the level of GIR comfortably above three months of imports, in the active scenario
(see Figure). Assuming that the mission’s recommendations are followed, the adjustment would
be shared by the public and private sectors in proportion to their contributions to GDP.

The real exchange rate has depreciated, but competitiveness remains a concern. The
U.S. dollar depreciation and domestic deflationary forces post-2001 depreciated the real
exchange rate steadily until 2005, when increased domestic inflation and the U.S. dollar strength
started to erode such gains in competitiveness. A comparison of relative domestic price levels
and relative per-capita income suggests an adequate level for the exchange rate given the
country’s level of development. However, despite recent rapid productivity growth, the gap
between wages and productivity that opened up after 1995, has not been fully closed (see
Figure). With respect to tourism, Barbados’ share of Caribbean tourist arrivals has declined,
although spending per tourist appears to have increased.9 The authorities noted that in some
sectors, such as beverages, chemicals, and international businesses, growth in exports is firming
up.

Central bank figures imply a resumption of the decline in the share of tourism expenditures. A more
recent survey by the Caribbean Tourism Organization (CTO), however, suggests a healthy growth in
absolute terms and a stable share in the region (see Figure).

17
36.
The mission recommended that the government exercise restraint in forthcoming
wage negotiations to preserve competitiveness—in addition to tightening macro policies
and enhancing structural reforms. The upward trend in inflation and tight labor markets set
the stage for difficult wage negotiations. Public sector wages cover a large fraction of the labor
force and spillovers to private contract negotiations could risk losses in competitiveness. The
mission welcomed the emphasis the authorities are placing on the reduction in personal income
taxes (which has boosted take-home pay), and do not just past inflation, in wage negotiations.
D. Structural Issues
37.
The mission encouraged the authorities to focus their reform efforts on further
opening up the economy, improving the efficiency and flexibility of capital and labor
markets, and placing greater reliance on private sector initiative and competition. A prompt
adoption of these measures would improve the competitiveness of the economy, making growth
and the external position more sustainable in the medium and long run. In his 2006 Economic
and Financial Policy Statement, the Prime Minister announced a broad continuation of policies,
but also introduced new industry-specific incentives to ease restructuring costs in the agricultural
and manufacturing sectors. The mission recommended that priority be given to the following
areas of structural reform:
•

Trade liberalization—At about 22 percent (including the import tariff surcharge), tariff
rates are relatively high. This may have adverse implications for the competitiveness of
the country’s export sector, including tourism. The mission urged the authorities to
complement the planned liberalization within the context of the CSME (Box 3) with
more MFN liberalization. Furthermore, after several years of protection from
competition, it would be useful to assess whether some industries could operate without
government support. The robust job growth forecast over the next few years provides a
propitious environment for reallocating workers from sectors that might be affected by
increased import competition.

•

Sectoral and energy conservation programs—The mission noted that a number of
initiatives are being introduced to better coordinate sectoral incentive programs and avoid
duplication. At the same time, there is scope for a careful assessment of the costs and
benefits of these programs, and for additional streamlining. In particular, these
programs—including for restructuring—should be of limited duration. The mission also
noted its concern with the potential fiscal costs of the sugar adaptation strategy.10 It
recommended that activities in these areas be limited to those that are commercially
viable and can survive without government support, including raw sugar production. If
these activities are not found to be viable, consideration could be given for redirecting

10

The impact of the sugar preference erosion on GDP is expected to be marginal, while the trade deficit is
expected to increase from a minimal amount in 2006 to US$1.8 million (or 0.1 percent of total exports of
goods and services) by 2011.

18
support for the sector to social safety net payments for the affected workers and other
programs designed to strengthen infrastructure and human capital development more
generally.
•

Privatization and investment climate—The mission endorsed the authorities’ intention
to further privatize—including in the tourism sector—and urged that an explicit
identification be made of potential assets that could be divested in the near term. To
further strengthen the business climate, improvements in port and distribution systems,
and the process for buying and selling real estate, would be helpful.

•

Capital market development—The government has an important role to play in this
area by improving debt management practices and creating benchmarks for the
development of private instruments. The mission also supported the authorities’ efforts to
further develop the stock market in a regional context.

•

Labor market flexibility—The authorities note that flexibility has increased in the
context of the CSME, which has contributed to the containment of wage pressures in the
face of rapid employment growth. Nevertheless, the mission urged the authorities to
examine the scope for streamlining unemployment and severance benefits in light of the
dual eligibility of workers for both benefits.

•

Disaster and risk mitigation—The mission welcomed recent efforts to further
strengthen disaster preparedness, including the requirement of insurance for all hotels
licensed after January 2006. The mission encouraged the authorities to work with other
countries to move forward on regional efforts for the pooling of catastrophic risk.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL

38.
Barbados’ economy continued to grow in 2005, but macroeconomic imbalances
worsened. GDP growth is running at about 4 percent and is expected to continue at this fast pace
in 2006 and 2007. However, inflation accelerated to more than 6 percent and the current account
deficit widened to 12½ percent of GDP in 2005. While strong capital inflows have financed the
external deficit and prevented a further loss of reserves in 2005, financing conditions may
deteriorate further in the years ahead.
39.
Early action to tighten macroeconomic policies would reduce the risks of
overheating and help to support the exchange rate. Increases in oil prices explain in part the
acceleration of inflation and widening of the external deficit. However, expansionary macro
policies, and consequent rapid credit growth have also contributed to an acceleration in core
inflation and imports over the last two years. An early and decisive tightening of
macroeconomic policies is needed to address macroeconomic imbalances and help safeguard the
maintenance of the fixed exchange rate regime as an anchor of macroeconomic stability.

19
40.
On fiscal policy, a return to the fiscal consolidation path of recent years would be
desirable. On expenditures, further increases in extra budgetary expenditures or PPPs that add to
an already buoyant private sector should be offset by reductions in other outlays. Less
distortionary indirect taxes could also be increased in anticipation of the removal of the import
tariff surcharge, and better pricing policies could consolidate the finances of the major public
enterprises.
41.
Public debt levels are being lowered, but they should be brought down to safer levels
at a faster pace. Rating agencies and other market participants consider high public debt one of
the key weaknesses of the Barbadian economy, and the current debt path would only gradually
reduce debt ratios. Currently favorable cyclical and interest rate conditions will bring debt to
GDP ratios down in the near term, but the reversal of such conditions would partly undo this
progress. Furthermore, the pension system exposure to the public sector should be reduced.
42.
Further monetary tightening would help contain inflation and curb excessive credit
growth. Real interest rates are low, and the prospects of higher international rates and
uncertainties about monetary transmission suggest that further increases in policy rates are
warranted. If monetary policy measures fail to slow credit growth to more sustainable levels, a
tightening of prudential standards might be considered. Continued efforts as planned by the
authorities to develop money and capital markets would facilitate the gradual introduction of
indirect instruments of monetary policy.
43.
Official banking indicators appear sound and regulations are being strengthened,
although it will be important to monitor potential risks from large capital inflows and
rapid domestic credit growth. The authorities are to be commended for the introduction of a
number of measures to strengthen the financial sector regulatory framework and to develop
financial market infrastructure. However, since financial indicators generally lag the
development of credit and liquidity problems, potential deterioration in credit quality and
reductions in net foreign assets need to be watched carefully—especially in an environment of
increasing competition from regional banks.
44.
Strengthening competitiveness could facilitate external adjustment in the medium
run. In addition to more sustainable macro policies, competitiveness could best be fostered by
structural reforms, including trade liberalization, the rationalization of incentive programs, and
privatization, rather than by selective support to sectors that generate or save foreign exchange.
Also, support for the sugar adaptation strategy should be limited to commercially viable
activities. Finally, flexible labor markets and deeper capital markets are likely to enhance growth
in the medium term.
45.
The statistical information provided by Barbados is broadly adequate for
surveillance purposes, but weaknesses remain. In particular, the coverage and transparency of
data on public sector entities and capital account transactions could be improved.
46.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Barbados take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

The relative importance of credit shocks grows with the forecast horizon, and it is as important as
oil price shocks for a horizon of about three years. This analysis suggests that the impact of the
rapid growth in credit to the private sector over the last two years is likely to continue to
contribute to inflationary pressures in the medium run.
_______________________________
1/ The model is a four variable vector autoregression (VAR), with quarterly data from 1974Q1 to
2005Q4. The variables included are international oil prices (oil), consumer prices (cpi), bank credit to
private sector (credit) and the interest rate on treasury bills (t-bill). The results on variance
decomposition are robust to changes in the ordering of the variables.

Box 2. Barbados: Fiscal Policy Stance, 2001–11
Fiscal policy was countercyclical in
the first half of the decade. Indicators
of fiscal stance and impulse1 show a
sharp change in policies in different
phases of the cycle. The fiscal
expansion of 2001–02 was clearly
countercyclical as economic growth
was below trend. Similarly, when the
economy was rebounding in 2003–04,
the fiscal impulse became negative, in
a typical countercyclical fashion.

However, fiscal policy turned procyclical in 2005, and fiscal impulses under the
baseline scenario are expected to
continue to exacerbate the ongoing

cyclical expansion. Expenditures
associated to the CWC and other
public projects will extend the
expansionary stance to 2007. Fiscal
policy becomes neutral in 2008, when
projected economic growth would be
below potential output growth—while
the output gap continues to be positive.
An early adjustment, as in the staff’s
active scenario, would avoid tightening
policies further in the aftermath of the CWC.

1/ The fiscal impulse indicator is calculated as the difference between the fiscal stance in two
consecutive years. The fiscal stance is obtained by subtracting the neutral fiscal balance from the
observed fiscal balance, where the former is calculated by assuming unitary elasticity of revenues with
respect to nominal GDP and unitary elasticity of expenditures with respect to potential GDP (see S.K.
Chand, “Fiscal Impulse Measures and Their Fiscal Impact,” in M. I. Blejer and A. Cheasty “How to
Measure the Fiscal Deficit” IMF, 1993).

Box 3. Implications of the CARICOM Single Market and Economy for Barbados
The single market phase of the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME), designed
to facilitate the free movement of goods, labor, and capital, was formally launched on
January 1, 2006 with six members. The single economy phase, which will involve
harmonization of laws, and coordination/convergence of economic, monetary and fiscal policies,
is expected to be implemented by end-2008.
•

Barbados is expected to reap net benefits in the area of trade, particularly trade in services.
High production costs, related in part to high wages, put Barbados at a comparative
disadvantage in the production of most goods. However, significant opportunities to
diversify into cross-border financial and service-related activities are expected.

•

The provision for the free movement of labor covers five categories of workers - media
workers, university graduates, musicians, artists and athletes, and is expected to facilitate
labor market flexibility.

•

Barbados has adopted several measures to facilitate free movement of capital, but to
minimize the risks associated with capital outflows, the authorities are proceeding
cautiously with the implementation of full capital account liberalization. Announcement
of a commitment date for full capital account liberalization has been deferred until 2007.

APPENDIX III. BARBADOS—RELATIONS WITH THE CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) approved US$226.6 million in loans, contingent loans,
equity and grants to Barbados between 1970 and May 2006. This represents 8.6 percent of total
approvals to CDB’s borrowing member countries.
Of the total funds approved US$61.8 million or 27.3 percent were allocated to the productive
sectors which comprise agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, and mining. Within the productive
sectors, US$45.5 million or 20.1 percent of the total was allocated to the manufacturing sector,
while tourism accounted for US$12.0 million, or 5.3 percent.
Economic infrastructure accounted for US$111.6 million or 59.2 percent of approved funds. Of
these funds, US$55.4 million (24.4 percent) were allocated to the transportation,
US$50.7 million (22.3 percent) to the education, and US$3.2 million (1.4 percent) to the health
sectors.
Approximately US$13.5 million in new loans (multisector) was approved in 2003 while no new
loans were approved in 2004 and 2005. In 2006, for the period up to May, a technical assistance
loan of US$3.5 million was approved.

APPENDIX IV. BARBADOS—FOLLOW-UP ON KEY RECOMMENDATIONS
OF THE 2002 FSAP
FSAP Recommendations

Action Taken by the Authorities

Banking Sector
Financial Institutions Act: The FIA should be
amended to strengthen the independence of CBB,
impose aggregate limits on large exposure and
connected lending, facilitate license revocation and
distressed bank resolution, and require CBB’s prior
approval of the external auditor for licensees.
On-site Examinations: Supervisory resources of the
CBB should be boosted to enable it to conduct regular
onsite examinations of all onshore and offshore banks
on an 18–24 months cycle.
Deposit Insurance Act: The potential for financial
instability may be contained by a well designed deposit
insurance scheme in a properly supervised banking
system.

The FIA is expected to be revised. Guidelines regarding
market risk, large exposures, outsourcing, corporate
governance (including connected lending) has been
drafted. There is no specific date for approval, but
CBB’s authorities expect some decisions in the second
half of 2006.
The CBB has conducted more regular on-site
examinations during 2005.

A Deposit Insurance Act has been drafted, and it is
expected to be passed by the Parliament of Barbados in
2006. The deposit insurance scheme will also facilitate
license revocation and distressed bank resolution.

Credit Unions
CBB assisted on site examinations: A high priority There were two rounds of joint inspections (the CBB
should be assigned to completing the CBB assisted on and the Co-operative department) of the larger credit

Capital Markets
Securities Commission: The well drafted legislation
and the authorities’ efforts to promote a more efficient
and transparent market have been reflected in the
assessment of the IOSCO Principles. However, the SC
is not yet fully staffed or operational.
Securities settlement period: Securities clearing and
settlement should move toward DVP principles and
T+3 settlement cycle.

The inspection and enforcement of the Security Act has
improved since the Securities Commission became
fully operational in 2003.

Effective January 1st 2006, the securities clearing and
settlement cycle was reduced to T+3, or three business
days after trade day.

44
APPENDIX V. BARBADOS—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
The statistical information provided by Barbados is broadly adequate for surveillance
purposes, although some important weaknesses remain. Barbados participates in the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Dated metadata and the authorities’ plans for improving
the statistical base are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
Real sector
2.
The Barbados Statistical Services (BSS) compiles national accounts statistics according
to the 1968 SNA. The exclusion of the offshore enterprises from both the national and external
accounts is an issue of major concern because such enterprises have substantial onshore presence
due to tax treaties. A lack of timely, reliable source data on nonsugar agriculture, private
construction, and nontourism service activities adversely affects production-based GDP
estimates. To address some of the weaknesses in this area, in June 2005 the authorities initiated a
census of economic activity, including in its coverage tourism, financial businesses, and
transport and communications. Expenditure-based GDP estimates are derived from selected
surveys; the household survey yields a reliable, albeit out-of-date, estimate of aggregate
consumption, but the external trade and investment surveys suffer from certain weaknesses.
Constant price GDP estimates have an outdated 1974 base year; the authorities are currently
updating the reference year 2000 in order to facilitate comparison within the CARICOM area.
CARTAC has recently provided assistance to improve the national accounts through the
development of a supply and use table. This program will ultimately lead to the rebasing of the
national accounts and the development of better estimates for all sectors of the economy.
3.
Despite recent initiatives to update the consumer price index and the index of industrial
production, potential misalignments in real estate prices are left unattended owing to the absence
of a systematic index of property prices. The consumer price index uses an expenditure basket
for 1998–99 for its July 2001=100 series introduced in January 2002. Comparisons of CPI data
prior to 2002 with CPI data after 2002 should be undertaken with care. The index of industrial
production is based on the sectoral weights prevailing in 1982; the authorities are currently
working towards rebasing the series to 1994.
Nonfinancial public sector
4.
Fairly comprehensive and timely data for above the line items are available for the
general government, but there is a lag in the reporting of transfers. As a result of the underreporting of off-budget transactions, a significant discrepancy exists between the overall balance
and financing data. Public enterprise data is not systematically and promptly reported to the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs (MFEA); consequently data supplied by public
enterprises, such as on government transfers and capital spending, often differ from those
provided by the MFEA. Also, financial sector data on public sector net domestic borrowing
usually cannot fully be reconciled with above the line fiscal data, partly because of limited

45
availability of the nonbank financial sector information. Authorities plan to have full accrual
reporting for 2007/2008, and that will be further discussed with a planned FAD ROSC mission
for November 2006.
Financial sector
5.
Important weaknesses remain in the monetary accounts. The concept of residency applied
to the monetary statistics is not consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual. The Central Bank of Barbados (CBB) classifies some loans to and deposits of nonresidents as credit to the private sector and part of broad money, respectively, instead of as net
foreign assets of commercial banks. Moreover, non-national individuals are recognized as
residents only after they have resided continuously in Barbados for at least three years. There is
also a need to extend the coverage of data to include offshore bank accounts. Accounting
conventions underlying monetary data compiled by the CBB are in need of improvement: data
are reported on a cash basis and do not include accrued receivables and payables. Commercial
banks’ positions are recorded on an accrual basis; however, the accrued interest receivable and
payable is classified under other assets and other liabilities, respectively, rather than under the
appropriate category of domestic credit. Marketable securities are recorded at the acquisition cost
and revalued to market value only on an annual basis (as of December 31). Short-term zerocoupon securities (treasury bills) are recorded at acquisition cost and are not revalued to market
value until redemption at maturity. Positions with the IMF (SDR holdings, Reserve Tranche
Position, and SDR Allocation) are valued at the IMF holdings rate rather than at the end-ofperiod market rate. These issues are being addressed in the context of the GDDS.
External sector
6.
Lags in the compilation of merchandise trade data limit the timeliness of estimates of the
external current account balance, in particular, information on the activities of the offshore
sector. Estimates of the components of the financial account also need to be strengthened.
Quarterly balance of payments estimates are no longer provided. In October 2005, Barbados
provided STA with 1987–2004 annual balance of payments data.

1/ External debt figures differ from other tables because it includes deposits of nonresidents in foreign currency accounts.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar
terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency
(e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
August 4, 2006

1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff report
was issued. The thrust of the appraisal contained in the staff report is not affected by these
developments.
2.
Revisions of preliminary data for 2005 have reduced the current account deficit.
Revised estimates of the average length of stay for tourists improved travel credits in the
balance of payments. This, in turn, reduced estimates of the 2005 current account deficit
(from $380.9 million to $367.8 million, or from an estimated 12.4 percent of GDP to 11.9
percent), and increased estimated real GDP growth (from 3.9 percent to 4.1 percent).
3.
Preliminary data for the first half of 2006 are in line with projections. Economic
activity remains strong, with real GDP growth at around 4 percent. End of period inflation
has slowed slightly to 6.5 percent by end-June 2006. Also, gross international reserves have
declined from about $620 million at end-December 2005 to around $580 million at the end of
June 2006. Finally, credit to the private sector has been growing at an annual rate of above 20
percent in the first months of the year, but slowed to 19 percent in the 12 months to June
2006, in line with the staff report projection of 13 percent for end 2006.
4.
Credit agency outlook reviewed. Standard & Poor's revised its outlook for
Barbados’ sovereign rating from BBB+/negative to BBB+/stable. The revision was based on
fiscal adjustments that are expected to lead gradually to lower debt levels. However, the
agency also warned that the outlook could be revised back to negative if high current account
deficits persist and/or the government fails to rein in its fiscal deficit.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation
with Barbados
On August 4, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Barbados.1
Background

Barbados has favorable economic and social indicators by regional standards, as well
as strong and stable political institutions. Tourism and financial services are major
sources of employment and foreign exchange. Per capita income is the highest in the
region (US$17,300 on a PPP basis) and the country enjoys an investment grade rating.
The country ranks high in the United Nations Development Program’s Human
Development Index, poverty is low, and unemployment has been declining. Business
conditions are adequate, and corruption and crime are low.
Barbados’ economy did well in the 1990s, but the post-9/11 global slowdown led to the
emergence of macroeconomic imbalances. Following eight years of 3 percent average
real GDP growth, low inflation and fiscal deficits under 3 percent of GDP, economic
growth turned negative in 2001 and stayed low in 2002–03. In response, the
government launched a “national emergency program” of public investment in late2001. While this helped revive economic activity, it also contributed to a widening of the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2overall budget deficit, an increase in government debt, and increasing external
imbalances.
Barbados’ economic growth rebounded to 4 percent a year in 2004–2005, and
unemployment fell to a historical low of 9 percent. Higher inflation reflected the passthrough of higher oil prices, as well as domestic demand pressures, as highlighted by
an increase in core inflation—which excludes food, transportation, fuel, and light—from
almost zero in 2004 to 4 percent in 2005.
The overall fiscal position, which had begun to improve in 2003–04, deteriorated slightly
in 2005, as a result of a sharp increase in extrabudgetary capital expenditures. Partly
offsetting this, the central government balance strengthened as a result of buoyant tax
revenues, public enterprises continued to lower their deficits, and the National
Insurance Scheme achieved a surplus of 3.3 percent of GDP.
The authorities tightened monetary policy in 2005, with a four-step 250 basis points
increase in the minimum deposit rate to 4.75 percent. Nevertheless, credit to the private
sector continued to grow at a fast pace, rising by 21.7 percent in 2005—driven mostly
by lending to the tourism and personal sectors. Commercial banks reduced excess
reserves and net foreign assets to finance this expansion. Financial indicators suggest
that the banking system continues to be sound.
The external current account deficit deteriorated further, reaching 12.4 percent of GDP
in 2005, but the level of gross international reserves stabilized. Almost half of the
deterioration in the current account deficit in 2004–06, relative to 2000–03, is explained
by increased oil imports. Large increases in private spending, fueled by rapid credit
growth, have also contributed to the deterioration in the current account—despite the
real effective exchange rate depreciation and falling unit labor costs. Strong capital
inflows in 2005 nevertheless curbed a decline in international reserves that had started
in 2003.
Barbados has made progress in structural reforms in some key areas. The authorities
continued their program to cut income tax rates aimed at improving competitiveness.
They have also liberalized further the telecommunication sector, and privatized a major
insurance company. In 2005, arrangements were concluded for Barbados’ formal
membership in the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME). More recently, a
reduction in foreign exchange controls has effectively liberalized travel arrangements
within CARICOM and facilitated the holding of foreign currency accounts.

-3Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the strong economic growth and the positive outlook for
continued economic expansion. At the same time, Directors noted that significant
macroeconomic imbalances have emerged, in particular an accelerating inflation and a
large external current account deficit.
Directors also welcomed the authorities’ commitment to tighten macroeconomic policies
if downside risks materialized, and recommended an early tightening of policies to
reduce the risks of overheating and help support the exchange rate peg. While
increases in oil prices explain in part the acceleration of inflation and the external deficit,
Directors stressed that expansionary macroeconomic policies and associated rapid
credit growth have contributed to an acceleration in core inflation and imports over the
last two years.
Directors observed that the procyclical fiscal stance has contributed to these
imbalances, and recommended a return to the fiscal consolidation efforts of recent
years. On expenditures, they underscored that further increases in extra budgetary
expenditures or public-private partnership projects that add stimulus to an already
buoyant private sector could be postponed or offset by reductions in other outlays. On
revenues, they encouraged the authorities to increase value-added tax revenue in
anticipation of the removal of the import tariff surcharge, carry out a comprehensive
review of the pricing policies of public enterprises to help consolidate their finances, and
ensure a full pass-through of international oil prices to consumers. Directors also
welcomed the authorities’ interest in a fiscal Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes to help improve transparency in the fiscal accounts.
Directors noted the envisaged reduction in public debt ratios, but considered that the
slow pace of debt reduction left Barbados vulnerable to exogenous shocks, and
encouraged a faster pace of adjustment. Directors commended the authorities for the
strong performance of the public pension system, and endorsed a further diversification
away from public sector assets.
Directors agreed that further monetary policy tightening would be needed to contain
inflation, curb excessive credit growth, and support the peg. They pointed out that real
interest rates are low, and that the prospects of higher international rates further
underscore the need to increase policy rates. Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans
to develop money and capital markets, which would facilitate the gradual introduction of
indirect instruments of monetary policy.
Directors were encouraged by sound banking indicators and upgraded financial sector
regulations, and emphasized the importance of monitoring potential risks associated
with large capital inflows and rapid credit growth. Directors commended the authorities
for the introduction of measures to strengthen the financial sector regulatory framework

-4and to develop the financial market infrastructure. However, Directors noted that, since
financial indicators generally lag the development of credit and liquidity problems, credit
quality and reductions in net foreign assets need to be carefully monitored, especially in
an environment of increased competition from regional banks.
Directors felt that strengthening competitiveness through structural reforms could also
facilitate external adjustment and support the exchange rate peg over the medium term.
In this regard, they welcomed the authorities’ efforts to advance the agenda of the
CSME and in this context recommended further reforms to facilitate private sector-led
growth, such as trade liberalization, the rationalization of incentive programs, and
privatization, rather than selective support to sectors that generate or save foreign
exchange. Directors also noted that the support for the sugar adaptation strategy should
be limited to commercially viable activities.
Directors noted that the statistical information was broadly adequate, and suggested
improvements to the coverage and transparency of data on public sector entities and
capital account transactions.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of
the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the
country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article
IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional
level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with
longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of
general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
