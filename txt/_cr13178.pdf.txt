STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FIRST POST-PROGRAM MONITORING DISCUSSIONS

KEY ISSUES
Context: The authorities have used available margins to lend policy support,
mitigating the effects of the euro area crisis on activity and financial conditions.
External and financial stability were maintained despite a difficult environment.
Fiscal Policy: In the near term, policies should remain supportive, and the start of the
consolidation process should take downside risks to growth into account. However, the
relatively rapid rise in public sector debt since the onset of the crisis underscores the
need for a well-articulated medium-term fiscal strategy with a deficit path that delivers
a gradual reduction in debt. The strategy should aim to safeguard fiscal sustainability,
enhance the credibility of the budgetary process, accommodate planned public
investment levels, rebuild fiscal buffers, and increase policy transparency.
Financial Sector: The banking sector remains well-capitalized and highly liquid, with a
stable domestic financing base, but vulnerable to low probability confidence shocks.
Structural Reform: Despite a long track record of macroeconomic stability, income
convergence has been slow. The authorities’ strategy to fill infrastructure gaps through
public investment and a proactive policy to attract FDI to speed up structural
transformation should be complemented by policies that ensure links between new
investment and the domestic economy, particularly by absorbing the large pool of
unemployed and inactive labor. A number of possible structural impediments to credit
supply could be addressed, although their effect is likely to be modest.

CONTEXT
1.
A track record of conservative policies, together with external official assistance,
provided Macedonia with buffers to confront spillovers from the global crisis and deal
with domestic shocks. As a result, with only a mild recession in 2009 and then again in 2012,
Macedonia averted large real and financial dislocations.

Balance of payments pressures in the first half of 2009 were managed successfully
through higher policy rates and tighter bank liquidity requirements.

In early 2011, in light of euro area risks, the authorities requested a high-access
precautionary Fund arrangement (Precautionary and Liquidity Line). In March 2011, the
authorities drew on the PLL, citing impaired access to external markets risks and reduced, market
access largely due to the uncertain outcome of impending elections
(http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=25234.0). The drawing reinforced gross
reserves.

A number of financing operations with the World Bank, notably in late 2011 and early
2013, relieved public sector financing constraints and allowed for a widening of the deficit to
support weak domestic demand and start clearing budgetary arrears.
2.
Looking forward, the authorities continue to face a difficult external environment
but with reduced policy space, particularly in the context of the de facto peg1. Persistent
uncertainty about financial and demand conditions in Europe will weigh on growth, while the
margins for policy stimulus have narrowed.
3.
The start of EU accession negotiations remains uncertain. The former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia was granted candidate status in December 2005. However, the name
dispute with Greece continues to block the initiation of EU accession negotiations and NATO
membership. In its latest progress report from April 20132, the European Commission urged the
authorities to implement the commitments made in March to end the political stalemate in
Parliament, and noted that progress has been made in promoting good neighborly relations as
well as on formal talks on the name issue.
4.
Some key recommendations of earlier Article IV consultations have been
implemented, others remain outstanding. The authorities have made important progress in
1

The report refers to the exchange rate regime as a peg. Formally, the official (de jure) exchange rate
classification is “floating” and the de facto exchange rate regime for Macedonia is a “stabilized” arrangement. The
NBRM buys or sells foreign exchange to keep the denar trading in a very narrow band around the rate of
61.5 denars per euro.

lengthening domestic debt maturities as well as deepening domestic debt markets. They have
closed all but one of the identified gaps in the crisis management framework. Progress with
public financial management reforms is mixed. The public recognition of government payment
arrears— which were reported at MKD 5.6 billion (1.2 percent of GDP) as of September 2012—
and the commitment to clear them was a welcome policy decision. The authorities have recently
initiated changes to the commitment, recording, and control systems. Continued transparency
on the stock of arrears would boost confidence in the durability of the solution.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
Following a shallow recession in 2012, a modest recovery is forecast for 2013, predicated on
an acceleration in public investment and FDI projects coming on stream. The weak external
environment and difficult liquidity conditions for the domestic private sector present
important downside risks. Both fiscal and monetary policies—the latter constrained by the
commitment to maintain exchange rate stability—are providing support. The impact of
weaker trade on the current account in 2012 has been mitigated by high private transfers, and
public sector net external borrowing has helped build up reserves despite modest FDI. The
financial sector remains stable—liquid and well-capitalized—albeit with still rising NPLs.

A. Growth and Inflation
5.
Weak domestic and external
demand halted growth in 2012. Following
a sharp decline in the first half of the year,
growth picked up in the second half, mainly
supported by construction and public
consumption. Overall, activity declined
0.3 percent in 2012, with a negative
contribution from net exports and private
consumption, against the backdrop of a
steady deceleration of private sector credit.
In spite of a 0.6 percent increase in
employment, gross wages remained flat
throughout the year, implying declining real
incomes. Trade weighted effective import demand for Macedonian products declined by
1.9 percent.
6.
In 2013, economic activity is expected to pick up to about 2 percent, with risks
tilted to the downside. So far, notwithstanding an uptick of the industrial production index in
February and March, low turnover in the retail trade sector and persistently weak credit do not
point to a solid recovery in domestic demand. Nonetheless, baseline growth is predicated on an
acceleration in the second half of the year, driven by public infrastructure works and foreign
investment projects, as well as a slight rebound in private consumption. Despite stagnant

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

effective external demand, projected export growth is driven by a rebound of metal exports from
last year’s lows and FDI-generated specialized exports facing robust demand.
7.
Inflation is expected to moderate to 2.5 percent in 2013. After peaking at 5.3 percent
year-on-year in September 2012, driven by rising food prices and (regulated) price hikes in the
electricity and heating sectors, headline inflation decelerated to reach an average of 3.3 percent
for the year as a whole. For 2013, second-round effects of
energy price hikes are assumed to wear off, while food
prices are expected to decline. After accelerating to
2.9 percent year-on-year in December 2012, core inflation
has been on a downward trend, falling to 2.4 percent in
April, and is expected to settle at 2.2 percent on average
this year. Cost side pressures are weak—unit labor costs
are expected to remain broadly flat, and the output gap is
not expected to close before end-2015.

B. External Sector
8.
External stabilty was maintaned in 2012, despite weakness in trade and private
capital flows. In 2012, the current account
deficit widened to 3.9 percent of GDP, with a
worsening of the trade balance to
23.7 percent of GDP partly offset by record
private transfers (notably remittances),
reaching 21 percent of GDP. Yet in spite of
weak FDI inflows and some capital outflows
in the form of intra-company cross-border
loans and corporate deposits, the stability of
the peg was supported by official external
inflows, sizeable trade credits and inward
bank deposits, resulting in a strengthening of
official reserves.
9.
The current account deficit is expected to deteriorate in 2013 on account of
increased FDI-related imports. In 2013, import volume growth related to the implementation of
FDI projects in the manufacturing sector is expected to accelerate while exports would come
on-stream more gradually, resulting in a further deterioration of the trade balance to 25 percent
of GDP. This would widen the current account deficit to about 4.9 percent of GDP, assuming no
further acceleration of private transfers. The current account is expected to be financed by net
FDI inflows of about 3 percent of GDP, as well as net public sector medium-term external
borrowing—inflows already reflect a disbursement of a syndicated loan linked to a World Bank
Policy-Based Guarantee which more than covered the eurobond maturity in January 2013.
10.
On current projections, the level of gross international reserves provides a
sufficient buffer against external shocks. Reserve levels are in line with standard
‘rule-of-thumb’ measures, covering about 120 percent of short-term debt, 4.7 months of

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

prospective imports, and about 53 percent of broad money, as well as with combined metrics
such as the Greenspan-Guidotti rule, covering 99.6 percent of the sum of the short-term debt
and current account deficit, on average over the years 2012-2016. To better assess reserves
against the type and size of pressures observed in past crisis episodes, a new Fund metric3
benchmarks the level of reserves against a weighted index comprising export earnings,
short-term debt, other portfolio liabilities and broad money (M2), the parameterization of which
also depends on the exchange rate regime. This metric places reserve levels in Macedonia almost
exactly in the midpoint of the suggested adequacy range of 100 to 150 percent. Finally, reserves
also provide appropriate cover against country-specific shocks (see text box).
Reserve Adequacy – Further Considerations
In view of the idiosyncratic characteristics of the Macedonian external sector, with a structural trade deficit
covered almost 85 percent by private transfers (assumed to primarily reflect remittances), the standard
metrics may usefully be adjusted to incorporate scenarios relating to a ‘sudden stop’ in these current
account flows.
In this regard, the level of reserves covers about 90 percent of the needs corresponding to the new Fund
metric augmented by a shortfall of expected private transfers by 50 percent, and about 75 percent of the
similarly adjusted Greenspan-Guidotti metric, over the 2012–2016 period. A less severe scenario which
assumes that the shortfall in private transfers is accompanied by some compression in imports, brings the
reserve cover to about 80 percent of the identified financing needs under the Greenspan-Guidotti metric.
Moreover, a recent technical assistance mission, relying on country-specific calibrations of the Jeanne and
Ranciere (2008) welfare-based model, where risk-averse policy makers are assumed to hold reserves as a
self-insurance instrument against sudden stops in capital flows, also concluded that reserve holdings were
adequate, including when incorporating the endogenous probability of a currency or banking crisis.

also reflected a policy choice to start clearing refund arrears—a total of MKD 1.8 billion
(0.38 percent of GDP) VAT refund arrears were cleared in 2012. Keeping the cash deficit
contained at 3.8 percent of GDP required expenditure compression beyond the ceilings
established in the supplementary budget. With only about 20–25 percent of discretionary room
in the budget, the adjustment fell mainly on capital expenditure.
12.
The deficit for the first quarter of 2013, at 2.4 percent of projected annual GDP,
already represents two thirds of the annual target. Revenue developments were dominated
by large VAT refunds through February, with all other revenues at about a quarter of the annual
target, and an overperformance of profit taxes. On the expenditure side, subsidies and other
transfers rose by 250 percent relative to Q1: 2012, mainly related to advance payments of
agricultural subsidies. While this appears to be an intra-annual reallocation of expenditure,
further expenditure compression will likely be needed to meet the deficit target of 3.5 percent of
GDP. The authorities were not considering a supplementary budget at the time of the
discussions, noting that on current revenue trends the required spending adjustment could be
accommodated within normal capital spending buffers by postponing envisaged but not-yet
started projects as has been the case in the past.
13.
Some capital expenditure has shifted off-budget starting in 2013. As of January
2013, most of the public sector road infrastructure projects will be taken up through the newly
created Public Enterprise for State Roads (PESR). Previously part of the budgetary central
government, this entity can borrow on its own behalf, although most of its debt carries an
explicit sovereign guarantee. Given the envisaged increase in capital expenditure for developing
road infrastructure in the near to medium term, it would be important to track the evolution of
the public sector aggregate that includes the deficit and debt of this new state-owned enterprise,
for assessing both debt sustainability and the aggregate demand impact of fiscal policy.4
14.
Overall public sector debt has
risen faster than central government
debt, as the public sector has sought to
accommodate the protracted economic
downturn. Since the crisis, the authorities
have sought to support domestic demand
through both higher budget deficits as well
as through financing support for SMEs
through the Macedonian Bank for
Development Promotion (MBDP). Debt of
the MBDP has risen from 0.4 percent of
GDP in 2009 to 2.2 percent in 2012, and
largely reflects the use of credit lines provided by the European Investment Bank (some €250 mn
in 2009–2012, and additional €100 mn announced in 2013). In 2013, the projected marked
4

Since the PESR is a non-market non-profit institution (NPI), which performs government functions, it would be
advisable to consolidate it within the central government for deficit and debt accounting puporses. See IMF
(2011) “Public Sector Debt Statistics—Guide for Compilers and Users”, Washington, DC: Chapter 2.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

increase of SOE debt, from 2.7 to 4.5 percent of GDP, is mainly a result of the creation of the
PESR, and the external credit lines supporting its expanding activity.
15.
Substantial net domestic issuance in 2012 as well as in the first quarter of 2013 has
provided financing for the higher deficits. Net domestic issuance of €451 million and net
external borrowing of about €79 million in 2012 financed the budget deficit as well as built up
government deposits at the NBRM to €319 million (4¼ percent of GDP) at year end. Net
domestic issuance through April 2013 stands at €120 million, higher than the €100 million
envisaged in the budget, which the authorities intend to use as a financing buffer for 2014. In
addition, in line with previous Fund advice, since Q3 2011 the Treasury has continuously sought
to lengthen debt maturities. Some maturing 3-month T-bills have been rolled over into 6- and
12-month securities, and the authorities have increased the issuance of 3- and 5-year bonds.
These longer dated securities currently make up 25 percent of the total debt stock, up from
5 percent at the end of 2011.

D. Monetary and Financial Developments and Policies
16.
The absence of external pressures in a
low growth environment allowed the NBRM to
lower the policy rate by 25 basis points to
3.5 percent in January 2013, and to gradually
reduce its stock of outstanding Central Bank
bills. In addition, in order to stimulate private
credit growth while also strengthening the
balance of payments, the NBRM lowered
reserve requirements by the amount of new
loans to domestic net exporters and electricity
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

producers, effective January 1, 2013, with limited take-up to date. Since April 2012, the amount
of outstanding 1-month CB bills (its main sterilization instrument) has gradually been reduced by
about MKD 10 billion to MKD 24 billion (Figure 3). Over the last few months, this has resulted in
a higher subscription of 7-day NBRM deposits, which carry a 1¾ percent interest rate.
17.
Banking sector indicators suggest that the system is in overall sound shape, but
non-performing loans are increasing. As of December 2012, the capital adequacy ratio stood
at 17.1 percent (with tier 1 capital at 14.5 percent), and over 29 percent of total assets were
highly liquid. Deposits provide the main funding source. The NPL ratio rose to 11.7 percent in
February 2013, but provisions exceed NPLs. Profitability remains low but positive. Euroization of
deposits, while high, continues to decrease gradually to below pre-crisis levels.
18.
After steadily decelerating in 2012, credit growth is expected to remain subdued in
2013. Loan growth declined from 5.2 percent (year-on-year) in December 2012 to 4.4 percent in
February 2013, even as deposit growth accelerated from 4.9 percent to 5.6 percent. On the
supply side, banks are likely to remain conservative in light of modest growth prospects and low
profitability. In addition, group-wide policies prescribed by foreign parents seeking to strengthen
their capital ratios at the consolidated level are likely to limit asset growth in the largest banks in
the system. Meanwhile, credit demand continues to be affected by the economic outlook.
19.
The NBRM made several changes to banks’ provisioning rules. In mid-2012, it
introduced minimum provisions for unsold collateral-in-possession on banks’ balance sheets. In
March 2013, it announced further changes, effective December 1, 2013, providing the banks with
somewhat more leeway in taking into account collateral value when provisioning loans. The
NBRM expects the latter amendments to result in a modest release of provisions, which the
banks will be obliged to allocate to reserves.
20.
Adoption of amendments to the banking law early this year closed all but one of
the long-standing gaps in the crisis management framework. The amendments ensure that
the NBRM has the ability to impose fit and proper requirements on bank management and
owners, and pave the way for the central bank to widen the class of collateral that banks may use
to access liquidity support. The last outstanding issue in this area requires clarification of the
NBRM’s power to intervene an insolvent bank without being subject to court challenge.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Despite a long track record of macroeconomic stability, income convergence has been
slow. The discussions focused on policies that would reduce risks to the outlook in the
near to medium term, preserve the sustainability of fiscal and external positions, and
address structural constraints that have held back sustained strong growth.

A. Outlook and Risks
21.
Macedonia’s near-term growth outlook remains difficult, but the economy is
well-positioned to restart the convergence process. In the short run, the main risk to growth is

10

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

a slower than anticipated pick up in private consumption in a context of weak export growth—a
repeat of the factors that stalled growth in 2012. Over the medium term, staff’s baseline scenario
envisages growth to settle around 4 percent by 2016, implying a modest acceleration relative to
average growth in the pre-crisis decade but also only a moderate speed of convergence toward
living standards in EU countries. Over this horizon, the main risks relate to weaker-than-expected
investment and a continued drag of net exports on growth, should there be setbacks in the
implementation of FDI plans or difficulties in developing backward linkages to the domestic
economy.
22.
Despite strong real and financial linkages to the euro area (text chart and Box 1), a
number of factors mitigate risks in the near term:

New tradable sector FDI has reduced reliance on traditional exports and reoriented
exports geographically.

Local subsidiaries of euro area
banks (Greece and Slovenia) are
well-capitalized and liquid and have
limited exposure to parents—with no
short-term wholesale funding
dependency—as well as limited credit
exposure to those economies.

With banks funded mainly by
resident deposits, and with public sector
external financing requirements for 2013
already met, the channels for
transmission of any renewed stress in Europe appear limited to relatively low probability but high
impact confidence shocks. The short-lived spike in deposit withdrawals from the Macedonian
subsidiary of Slovenia’s NLB in late March bears testimony to such risks.
23.
A sudden loss of confidence could be transmitted through remittances, which are
sensitive to domestic conditions. While generally a stable source of current account financing,
a sudden stop of remittances—a large share of the 20 percent of GDP in private transfers—has
the potential to quickly create large balance of payments pressures, as was the case in 2009.
Renewed political uncertainty could affect the volume of these flows.
24.
The toolkit for crisis management has been strengthened further. Creating the
scope for widening ELA collateral eligibility provides a substantial enhancement of the crisis
management toolkit. The standing Financial Stability Committee (FSC) can serve as a useful
platform for a regular discussion of risks, and some thought could be given to expanding the
membership to include other financial sector regulators such as the Insurance Supervision
Agency. In light of the heightened risk of confidence shocks in the current environment, staff
suggested that the authorities may want to review the scope of the deposit insurance system,
which currently applies only to natural persons.

Box 1. Know Your Cluster-Macedonia1

A network analysis of global interconnectedness suggests that
Macedonia and its neighboring countries form a tight cluster of
economies that are mutually interdependent—more connected to
one another than those outside the cluster2—with Greece and
Serbia acting as likely gateways, connecting the cluster to others.
Membership in the cluster reflects the strength of trade, banking,
and migrant and remittance links.
Data limitations are unavoidable in any large cross country
comparison: in this context, issues of nationality in classifying
origin and destination of migrants and remittances, as well as
accounting for transshipping of exports through neighbors to
Germany may obscure stronger direct linkages to the core.
Nonetheless, this framework is useful in highlighting the
following: 1) with two gateways in the cluster, there is greater
potential for negative feedback effects within and between
clusters; 2) a shock to one member of the cluster may be

The network of bilateral ties as of 2010 in Figure 1 is based on trade, bank exposures, portfolio assets, FDI
stocks, migrants, and remittances. A link between a country pair is defined as its share in the average of the two
countries’ total. To produce the network graph, the links that are “sufficiently large” are aggregated by either
taking an unweighted average or choosing the maximum (if the difference between the maximum and minimum
link is sufficiently large). See I. Derényi, G. Palla, T. Vicsek, “Clique percolation in random networks” Phys. Rev. Lett.
94, 160–202 (2005). Details of the approach can be found in the IMF Board Paper FO/DIS/12/38.

25.
The authorities noted that they are prepared for tail risk events, and the past stress
in Europe has not translated into a loss of confidence in the banking sector. The authorities
monitor deposits on a daily basis, and have tested bank IT systems’ ability to generate reliable
insured deposit data on short notice. In case of deposit outflows, they expect to be able to
supply the system with ample liquidity on a short notice, which should serve to stabilize the
situation quickly. Overall, the NBRM believes that its bank resolution framework is adequate.
Deposit insurance coverage and scope are seen as appropriate.

B. Fiscal Policy—Restoring a Medium-Term Perspective
26.
As the crisis subsides, fiscal policy should regain its medium-term perspective. The
authorities are appropriately looking to increase growth potential with some upfront fiscal costs.
However, as debt levels have shifted up from low to moderate, the authorities have revised up
their near term deficit targets while at the same time shifting some capital expenditure
off-budget. Until there are palpable payoffs from the authorities’ growth enhancing strategy, the
debt-carrying capacity of the economy will remain low, which calls for a careful reconciliation of
competing fiscal policy objectives.
27.
In order to preserve debt sustainability, there is a critical need to anchor fiscal
policy in a medium-term fiscal strategy which would reconcile competing priorities. The
authorities’ commitment to a business friendly, low tax environment is paired with increasing
pressures on current and capital expenditures:

Ad-hoc pension increases in excess of the standing indexation formula add about
MKD 2 billion (0.4 percent of GDP) to 2013 primary expenditure; agricultural subsidies continue
to increase, and public sector wages—which were temporarily frozen as a crisis-adjustment
measure—are expected to rise by 5 percent in 2014.

Scaling up public investment projects, namely road and railway infrastructure, is a key
stated medium-term objective. The authorities also appropriately envisage higher spending on
labor market activation policies, training, skills and education to maximize the benefits of FDI
inflows.

In addition, in the medium term, rising interest cost—due to a higher debt stock and a
projected rise in global interest rates—will compete for space with productive expenditure in the
overall spending envelope. This is currently mitigated by the still large share of long-dated
official external public sector debt at concessional rates (around 40 percent of total public sector
debt in 2012), which will reprice rather slowly.
28.
A greater focus on multi-annual budgeting would provide a better framework for
assessing available fiscal space and help avoid arrears. Optimistic revenue assumptions and
weaknesses in the commitment recording and control framework—particularly as it pertains to
multiyear projects—were key factors behind the emergence of public sector payment and VAT
refund arrears. Strengthening the forecasting framework, as well as the system of commitment
controls will improve fiscal management. The authorities have been taking corrective measures,
but weaknesses in the Treasury system (text box) will complicate monitoring and control
functions in the near term. Meanwhile, it remains crucial that commitments are entered promptly
into the existing system.

Treasury Operations: Status of Corrective Measures
Reporting. The Manual of Treasury operations has been amended to define the procedures for reporting
multi-annual liabilities of budget users to the Treasury, improving the procedures for reporting liabilities in
line with signed contracts, and defining the procedures for validation of liabilities by internal auditors.
IT upgrade. In line with findings of shortcomings in the Treasury System by successive annual audits by the
State Audit Office, a working group has been set up to define the technical specifications and needed
documentation for upgrading the Treasury software, so as to give it the required capacity for proper
detailed electronic filing of payment orders as well as sending out electronic reports to budget users.
However, this new Treasury module would not be rolled out before 2014.

29.
A return to medium-term fiscal strategy documents would help revitalize fiscal
transparency. The last such document, covering 2011–2013, was published in December 2010.
Resuming the preparation and publication of such strategy documents would foster a
better-informed public debate, strengthen government accountability and credibility, as well as
improve risk awareness. The published fiscal reports should cover a wider scope of public
institutions than the budgetary central government, capture a broad range of direct and
contingent liabilities, be published in a timely manner, and take a rigorous approach to risk
analysis. As such, these documents would prove to be valuable tools to the public, investors, and
policymakers alike.
30.
In that light, while an economic case can be made for creating the PESR, fiscal risks
should be carefully monitored. A proliferation of entities set up as public non-financial
corporations can be associated with the dilution of accountability and control and problems in
reporting and consolidating fiscal data, complicating overall fiscal management. First and
foremost, the central authorities should be able to exercise tight control of the entity’s budget
preparation and execution. In addition, they should ensure that financial reporting is timely,
transparent and subject to oversight, and allows for the consolidation of PESR activities with
central government fiscal tables for the purposes
of macro-fiscal analysis.
31.
To ensure debt sustainability, the
central government primary deficit should be
gradually reduced to first stabilize debt and
then rebuild fiscal buffers.


14

In the near term, fiscal policy should
remain supportive. On current fiscal targets,
fiscal policy is expected to provide a very
small positive impulse in 2013, appropriately
aiming to sustain the still fragile recovery in
output as private sector activity starts to strengthen.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA



Once the recovery sets in, central government deficits should decline. Country-specific
factors such as a low and volatile revenue ratio, low average growth, rigidity of expenditure,
and the constraints imposed by the exchange rate regime suggest that safe debt levels for
Macedonia would be generally on the lower end of standard intervals5. While rebuilding
fiscal buffers used during the crisis will be important in the longer term, the more immediate
policy goal is to stabilize debt. Under benign assumptions about the growth-interest rate
spread, this would require a reduction of central government primary fiscal deficit by about
1.6 percent of GDP relative to forecast for 2013 outturns (text table and chart). Given largely
downside risks to growth, the start of the consolidation process could be effectively
managed by identifying consolidation measures that the authorities could commit to in 2014,
but which would have a full year effect in 2015.

The recommended fiscal path for central government deficits appropriately balances

Model-based approaches fail to provide a clear anchor as they produce a fairly wide range of appropriate debt
levels for emerging markets. See World Economic Outlook (September 2003): “Public Debt in Emerging Markets”,

toward conservative borrowing limits,6 suggests that even if scaling up public investment can
be favorable in the long run, the transition period is challenging and exposes the country to
increased risk of carrying a permanently higher debt level. Offsetting some of the planned
scaling up of public investment in Macedonia by some adjustment to current expenditures
would stem a rapid build-up in debt, particularly under an uncertain outlook for growth (see
Annex I on debt sustainability).
Authorities’ views
32.
The authorities noted that boosting growth is indeed the centerpiece of economic
policies. In the near term, addressing arrears has played a crucial role in supporting demand.
Increasing capital expenditure is a key pillar of their growth strategy, as well as attracting and
accommodating FDI in a manner that ensures positive spillovers and linkages to the domestic
economy.
33.
The authorities concurred with the need to reduce the deficit as the cycle turns, but
noted that the pace of consolidation would depend on a number of factors. They saw the
need for a cautious pace of deficit reduction. The authorities noted that capital expenditure
plans include big projects that would require budgetary space—Corridor X highway construction,
railways, a gas pipeline. They argued that a solid social safety net is an important stabilizer, and
saw higher subsidies in agriculture and increases in pensions and social assistance as a needed
cushion that counterbalances less popular structural reforms.
34.
The authorities noted that a medium-term fiscal and debt management strategy is
currently under preparation. They saw the suspension of medium-term fiscal strategy
documents as a reflection of the extreme uncertainty under which policymakers have been
operating through the global downturn. They noted that a medium term fiscal and debt
management strategy would be provided to Parliament before the 2014 budget. They concurred
that the strategy should indeed provide detailed information and analysis on expenditure and
debt of various levels of government.
35.
The authorities were mindful of the need to maintain sight of and control over
broader public debt. They noted that fiscal risks from the broader perimeter of government are
contained by strict controls at the central government level, and reiterated that the Ministry has
full control over the indebtedness process of public enterprises, including the newly created
Public Enterprise for State Roads.
36.
The authorities emphasized their commitment to a durable solution for public
sector arrears. They have publicly announced that all arrears have been cleared and noted that
they have taken measures to prevent reoccurrence, including by strengthening reporting

A few recent papers focus on the public investment and growth link and the implications for assessing debt
sustainability exclusively in the context of low-income countries where infrastructure gaps are notably large.

requirements for multi-annual contracts, and are confident in their ability to properly monitor the
emergence of payment delays. Execution of the budget through March has been in line with the
authorities’ expectations, providing assurances that there is enough budget space and liquidity
to remain current on all due obligations.

C. Monetary Policy and International Reserves
37.
The exchange rate peg to the euro continues to serve Macedonia well, delivering
low average inflation and a stable real exchange rate. Staff continues to view the peg as
appropriate for Macedonia, provided supportive macroeconomic policies remain in place. CGER

competitiveness, securing
foreign direct investment and unlocking potential growth by establishing backward linkages
from newly established firms to domestic suppliers (Box 2).
38.
The primacy of the exchange rate peg limits the latitude for further easing. The
policy rate spread over euro rates has narrowed. Reserves remain adequate, balance of payments
pressures are limited, core inflation is coming back down, and the ratio of euro-denominated to
denar deposits continues to decline, but credit growth is weak—conditions that, at the margin,
may allow for some further limited stimulus. Nonetheless, this needs to be carefully weighed
against external risks, particularly as further rate declines may be less effective in light of banks’
demonstrated risk aversion and already high liquidity. With regards to the efficiency of monetary
transmission, staff sees the recent (since January 2013) persistent shift of volume from Central
Bank bills to 7-day deposits as a risk to the effectiveness of CB bills as the main instrument of
monetary policy. This risk is emphasized by recent issuances of 6-month government paper
below the policy rate.
Authorities’ views
39.
The authorities see monetary policy as appropriately accommodative, and
reaffirmed their readiness to raise interest rates to respond to potential exchange rate
pressures. They noted that while conditions late last year were conducive to some further
relaxation, they had been concerned about the uptick in core inflation. Nonetheless, last year’s
inflationary peak is seen as a transitory consequence of fuel and food price developments, and a
gradual decline in headline and core inflation is expected to continue, with monthly core inflation
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

in February and March at zero percent. This may provide some further room, if necessary, to
support activity. The authorities explained that the decision to keep the central bank bill level
stable in the face of excess demand was intended to give banks an incentive and opportunity to
extend credit to the private sector. They noted that even 7-day deposits enjoy a comfortable
interest rate differential in favor of holding denars. Finally, they saw the recent increase in the
take up of 7-day deposits as temporary, and see no obvious factors—higher capital flows or
higher economic activity—that would lead to continued increases in these balances.
Nevertheless, they reiterated that it was not their long-term policy intention to use this
instrument as their main instrument for liquidity management. The authorities continue to see
the monetary policy framework as consistent with the exchange rate peg, and reaffirmed their
readiness to raise interest rates if necessary to respond to any potential exchange rate pressures.
Box 2. External Sector Assessment
Macedonia’s external position appears sustainable. In particular, while net external liabilities are on a declining
path, various frameworks for computing the real effective equilibrium exchange rate do not point to
overvaluation. Nonetheless, the persistence of a high trade deficit is an important vulnerability, and suggests
that there are important non-price factors that weigh on competitiveness. To a large extent, the authorities’
policies center on addressing these structural bottlenecks to growth.
Economic policies in Macedonia are geared toward attracting foreign direct investment by maintaining
cost competitiveness and improving the business environment. These policies have been largely
successful. Since the mid-2000s, brownfield and greenfield foreign direct investments have gathered speed in
the tradable sector, particularly in the automotive component, but also in the food processing and tobacco
sectors, leading to increased export diversification and trade integration with the EU. Key features of the
Macedonian economy that have been behind the recent inflows are the proximity to core EU markets, a stable
macroeconomic environment, contained unit labor costs attributable to a policy of wage moderation, and a
large pool of available labor, and a low-tax environment.
External debt is projected to have peaked at 68 ½ percent of GDP in 2012. Staff’s baseline forecast is for
a decline in the external debt to GDP ratio of about 8 percentage points over the forecast horizon. The
baseline forecast is predicated on about 4 percent of GDP in non-debt creating inflows annually, i.e., slightly
below the average inflows recorded over the pre-crisis years 2003–2008, fully financing the non-interest
current account deficit. The assumed recovery of FDI to pre-crisis levels seems plausible, given supportive
policies put in place in recent years and in view of increasing export market shares.
Continued effort to address non-price competitiveness constraints is needed to boost growth and
reduce the large trade deficit over the medium term. Labor participation rates remain notably low and the
grey economy widespread. Infrastructure gaps—particularly in roads and railways, but also in energy—are
being addressed through public expenditure programs, mostly financed by concessional long term loans. The
mechanisms for providing feedback from the needs of new industries to the education and training on offer
should help absorb the large pool of unemployed labor. Skill upgrades, together with continued
improvements in the business environment should help strengthen linkages of FDI to the domestic economy.

The latter factor is expected to largely limit the scope of second-round effects that may arise from the recently
announced indexation of the minimum wage in the private sector.

D. Structural Reform—Boosting Growth
Unemployment and Jobs
40.
The high unemployment rate in Macedonia cannot be easily explained by standard
labor market frictions. While measured unemployment –at 30½ percent—is disquietingly high,
there are no obvious large policy-induced distortions on the demand or supply sides of the labor
market that could explain such an outcome. A comprehensive analysis of traditional labor market
constraints suggests that employment protection legislation is slightly more flexible, on average,
than in peers, the size and duration of social assistance does not provide notable disincentives to
seek work, nor are labor tax wedges particularly high (see Chapter 1 of the Selected Issues Papers).
This, combined with the observed degree of unresponsiveness of employment to output changes,
suggests that more structural factors are at play.
41.
Large emigration flows, considerable loss of skilled labor, and small FDI inflows slowed
the necessary structural transformation to boost employment. While civil conflicts were much
less disruptive in Macedonia than in some other
former Yugoslav republics, brain drain estimates
place Macedonia among the most affected
countries (Beine et al. 2006). Late structural
transformations, and a weak flow of foreign
investments, partly due to armed conflicts in the
region in the 1990s, also hindered the natural
development of new sectors with large productivity
increases. The composition of output in Macedonia
still shows a relatively large dependence on
low-productivity sectors such as small scale farming
and heavy industry.
42.
The effort to attract FDI is bearing fruit, and should have a positive impact on the
speed of structural transformation and, critically, on activity rates and employment. The
authorities have developed a strategy that goes beyond a low tax environment—focusing on
building needed infrastructure and allowing feedback from the needs of new industries to the
education and training on offer. This, together with a greater focus on primary education, should
help absorb the large pool of unemployed labor. However, with labor costs being an important
input into location decisions of labor-intensive industries, the authorities should carefully monitor
the impact on labor costs of the decision to link the minimum wage to the average wage. Durably
boosting growth would also depend on FDI projects developing closer linkages with the domestic
economy—this will be a gradual process, but continued improvements in the business environment
would help.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

Authorities’ views
43.
The authorities broadly concurred with this overall assessment. They highlighted the
magnitude of the structural challenge, particularly in light of the limited public expenditure space. In
that respect, the authorities noted that further work could usefully investigate which of the
constraints to job creation are most binding. In addition, as job creation accelerates, it would be
useful to understand the potential role of other constraints, such as the real scope for mobility of
the labor force to accommodate higher labor demand created by new FDI.

Financing Convergence
44.
Boosting sustainable credit growth would help finance economic convergence to
European income levels. While cyclical considerations and conservative policies at the parent
group level currently play a role in limiting credit extension, Macedonia has historically stood out for
its low level financial deepening, as proxied by the credit-to-GDP ratio compared to peer countries.
Empirical analysis (see Chapter 2 of the Selected Issues Papers) provides some evidence of
unsatisfied demand for credit in the economy, likely due to constraints on credit supply.
45.
A number of possible structural impediments to credit supply could be alleviated. The
authorities have already initiated the process of reviewing the bankruptcy legislation, with a view to
streamline inefficient and lengthy procedures. Further improvements to corporate accounting
practices at SMEs would allow banks to lend against business plans rather than only against
collateral. More realistic valuations of collateral would lower perceived risks by banks; these would
require improved data collection and dissemination, particularly on real estate sales transactions.
Finally, the interest rate cap, set at 8 and 10 percent above the policy rate for household and
corporate loans, respectively, has led to a bunching of rates close to the ceiling and has likely
negatively affected access to credit for riskier projects. In addition, the cap, which is reset every
6 months, could inhibit monetary policy transmission in an environment of rising rates.
Authorities’ views
46.
The authorities largely concurred with staff’s analysis. They noted that in addition to the
effects mentioned above, the interest rate cap may have raised lending rates across the board, as
banks cannot properly differentiate risk by adjusting the price of credit. Recording and publishing
real estate transaction data could technically be done by the cadastre, but would likely require a
formal change to its mandate. The authorities noted, and staff agree, that while all of these
measures could boost credit growth at the margin, the overall effects may not be large.

E. Capacity to Pay
47.
Macedonia’s capacity to repay the Fund is adequate. Fund repayments (some
€230 million in total) are concentrated in 2014–15 (Table 7); a €150 million Eurobond matures in
2015, and further bulky repayments are due on syndicated lending operations in 2016. The
authorities noted that current domestic issuance plans will cover financing requirements for this year

and part of next year. They saw external capital markets as open, with potential for bond issuance in
the second half of 2014. Staff projects a modest accumulation of reserves in 2014 even in the
absence of a sovereign bond issue, contingent on the realization of current public sector external
borrowing plans and benign market conditions that would allow the rollover of short term external
debt.

STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
Macedonia is well positioned to return to growth, although the external outlook
presents a key risk. Having avoided the build-up of large imbalances in the pre-crisis period,
Macedonia does not face the prospects of a growth-dampening repair of private and public sector
balance sheets. Consequently, the economy is well positioned to restart growth. The expectation of
a near term moderate recovery in growth is supported by a solid pipeline of FDI, improvements in
the export base and diversification of markets, and public infrastructure investment. Nonetheless,
export diversification cannot compensate for the importance of the European market—real linkages
to the euro area remain very strong and could weigh on the fragile recovery.
49.
Policies should remain focused on boosting medium-term growth. Income
convergence in the pre-crisis decade has been slow. One key precondition for growth is to maintain
macroeconomic stability, and that requires ensuring the sustainability of fiscal policies—gradually
reducing the deficit and debt over time. Investing in future capacity, namely public physical
investment in transportation and energy, as well as investment in education, training, and labor

market policies to counter long-term and youth unemployment, should be accommodated within
available fiscal space. These policies would allow Macedonia to fully reap the benefits of incoming
FDI.
50.
External and financial stability have been maintained despite a difficult external
environment. A number of important factors—bank funding models and the prefinancing of
public sector external borrowing requirements—have limited the direct channels of transmission of
renewed financial market stress in Europe. Reserve levels are adequate. Nonetheless, the external
environment remains volatile, and the authorities should remain vigilant and ready to react to low
probability but high impact confidence shocks. Recent changes to the Banking Law have closed
most of the identified remaining gaps in the crisis management framework. Progress on the last
outstanding issue in this area—addressing the risk of court challenges to the NBRM’s intervention of
insolvent banks– would complete this agenda.
51.
The near term policy mix remains appropriate. Given the largely downside risks to
growth, policies should remain supportive. Fiscal policy settings for 2013 provide a small positive
impulse to growth. While margins for maneuver are limited by the commitment to exchange rate
stability, monetary policy settings reflect an appropriate balance between stability and growth.
52.
The authorities should anchor fiscal policy in a medium-term fiscal strategy which
commits to a long term sustainable debt level. Medium-term fiscal deficits would need to be
lowered relative to the authorities’ current baseline scenario, in order to first stabilize central
government debt and then gradually rebuild some fiscal space for future countercyclical responses.
The debt trajectory should take into account the fact that safe debt levels depend on
country-specific characteristics such as the level and volatility of revenue ratios and average growth
rates. A fleshed out medium-term strategy would increase budget transparency and present a
framework for the prioritization of expenditure in the context of consolidation.
53.
Strong monitoring and control of public sector entities would ensure that fiscal risks
remain contained. With some capital expenditure being moved off-budget, it will be important to
(i) take into consideration the evolution of the debt and deficits of the broader public sector
aggregate in setting budgetary targets, so as to appropriately balance the risks to debt against the
growth benefits of infrastructure building, and (ii) maintain tight central control of budget
preparation and the pace and nature of indebtedness of the PESR as well as other state-owned
enterprises.
54.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

Annex I. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
1.

The key assumptions underlying the dynamics of the DSA include the growth rate, the

level of the deficit, and real interest rates.


Economic growth is assumed to gradually revert to the 4 percent potential growth rate.



The baseline forecast assumes a 3 percent of GDP central government deficit over the medium
term (consistent with an analysis of sustainability on current policies, in the absence of specified
adjustment measures), and a 3.5 percent cash deficit for the current year.



The deficit is assumed to be financed through a mix of domestic and external issuance and by
drawing on government deposits at the NBRM. These deposits stood at MKD 19.6 billion at
end-2012, and are assumed to gradually decrease and stabilize around a level of
MKD 5.5–6 billion by 2015.



The analysis takes as a starting point the level of central government debt of 33.8 percent of
GDP at end-2012.



Average real interest rates are expected to gradually increase from 2014 onwards. This is due in
part to the expected gradual normalization of the nominal interest rates domestically and
abroad, and in part to a shift in the composition of financing. On the external side, the DSA
reflects a gradual shift from official to private financing, as official lending is amortized over the
next few years: specifically, official external debt is assumed to gradually fall from 37 percent of
total central government debt to 20 percent by 2018. The dynamics also incorporate a gradual
shift towards domestic financing, with the share of domestic debt out of total central
government debt to gradually rise from 32 percent in 2012 to 38 percent by 2018.

2.

Another critical assumption is the relevant concept of the public sector. As some capital

expenditure is being moved off-budget, it will be important to take into consideration the evolution
of the debt and deficits of the broader public sector aggregate in setting budgetary targets, so as to
appropriately balance the risks to debt against the growth benefits of infrastructure building. With
the transformation of the Road Fund (previously part of the central government) into the Public
Enterprise for State Roads (PESR), the central government debt concept would no longer capture a
considerable portion of infrastructure-related borrowing. In order to show the effect of this shift,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

staff’s DSA attempts to model the dynamics of both concepts of debt. The PESR deficit is assumed
to stay constant at its current level of 0.3 percent of GDP until 2018. This level is in line with last
year’s cash deficit and the projected 2013 deficit, and does not include an expansion of construction
activity that could lead to an increase of the PESR deficit.
3.

Under these baseline assumptions, central government debt continues to rise over the

forecast horizon. The difference between debt including and

45

excluding PESR currently amounts to 1.2 percent of GDP,

40

equivalent to about half of the total debt incurred for the

35

purpose of building new road infrastructure. The remainder of

30

the debt incurred for road construction consists of debt

A plausible shock to growth worsens the debt dynamics substantially. A plausible

growth shock adds 9 percentage points to the baseline projections for the central government debt
level over the 5-year forecast horizon, with central government

50

debt breaching what could be plausibly considered long term

45

sustainable debt levels for Macedonia. The employed

40

(standard) growth shock is modest. It is equivalent to ½ a

35

standard deviation, calculated over a ten year horizon between

30

2002 and 2011, translating into growth of about 3 percent in

scenario.
5.

An interest rate shock has a lower impact. The real interest rate shock employed is

equivalent to ½ standard deviation, and translates into a
real interest rate level of 3.8 percent in 2018, compared to
2.6 percent under the baseline. As interest rates are
volatile over longer time horizons, this shock can be

6.

Modeling the dynamics of total public sector debt is beyond the current scope of the

DSA. Public sector debt includes the central government, sub-national governments such as
municipalities, public agencies, state-owned enterprises, and public financial institutions such as the
development banks and the National Bank. However, as most of these debts are ultimately
guaranteed by the government, and hence are either direct or contingent claims on the sovereign
(as is the case for example for government guarantees), the broader public debt concept is indeed
relevant for debt sustainability. At end-2012 total public debt (excluding NBRM debt) stood at
38.7 percent of GDP, or 4.9 percentage points above central government debt. While it would be
useful to assess the debt dynamics of this broader category of the public sector, insufficient
information on the medium-term plans—including deficit projections—of all these entities, and
particularly of public corporations, constrains such an exercise.

growth in the euro area would be transmitted
through strong trade links. Direct exports to the euro
area account for 50 percent of total exports. Indirect
exposure to the euro area is even higher, given large
export shares to Kosovo, Serbia, and Bulgaria. The
high import content of exports and the increased
reliance on specialized exports facing more robust
demand, mitigate to some degree the effects on the
balance of payments.
Medium
Setbacks in the implementation of FDI plans
would lead to weaker than expected investment,
reducing medium term potential growth. Debt
dynamics would worsen.

High
 Confidence shocks could result in deposit
outflows—particularly corporate deposits which have
shown volatility in past episodes of stress. This could
put pressure on the peg and require sharp tightening
of monetary policy.
Mitigating Factors:
 High bank liquidity, as well as the NBRM’s capacity to
supply the system with ample liquidity on a short
notice should serve to stabilize the system.
 Deposit insurance coverage limits are adequate. The
authorities could consider expanding the coverage of
the Deposit Insurance Fund, which currently includes
only deposits of natural persons.

The Risk Assessment Matrix shows events that could materially alter the baseline path discussed in

Exchange Arrangement:
The currency of the FYR of Macedonia is the denar. The FYR of Macedonia maintains a
managed floating exchange rate system with a de facto stabilized arrangement against
the Euro. Households can transact through commercial banks or through foreign
exchange bureaus that act as agents of banks; enterprises can transact through the
banking system. The reserve requirement on foreign currency deposits is set at
13 percent, while that on FX-indexed denar deposits is set at 20 percent.
At end-December 2012, the official exchange rate was 46.7 denars per U.S. dollar and
61.5 denars per euro. The FYR of Macedonia has accepted the obligations of Article
VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 with effect from June 19, 1998.
Article IV Consultations:
The first consultation with the FYR of Macedonia was concluded in August 1993. The
last consultation was concluded on June 1, 2012 (IMF Country Report 12/133). The FYR
Macedonia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle, while PostProgram Monitoring is expected to take place every 6 months.

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
Background
The Bank and the Fund country teams on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia maintained
close collaboration, seeking synergies and harmonizing policy recommendations. Close coordination
has resulted in largely shared views of the economic situation in the country, particularly in the
context of the latest Public Expenditure Policy Based Guarantee (PEPBG), for which the Fund
provided an Assessment Letter in November 2012. The area of public financial management has
been at the center of discussions over the last year, and the measures supported by the PEPBG on
public finance management have benefited from the findings and recommendations of the recent
IMF TA mission.

Key Areas of World Bank Involvement
The World Bank program in FYR Macedonia focuses on three pillars: (i) faster growth by improving
competitiveness; (ii) more inclusive growth by strengthening employability and social protection,
and continued improvement of social programs; and (iii) more sustainable resource use and an
analysis of options for “greener” economic growth. Because FYR Macedonia’s future growth and
development depends fundamentally on the pace of EU accession, virtually every intervention in the
program is designed to help it prepare for the EU membership.


A series of two budget support operations (Competitiveness DPL) has been made available to
the Government with the aim to improve the competitiveness of the economy to develop a
stronger export-oriented enterprise sector. The first of these has been approved and is under
implementation; the second loan is under preparation.



The World Bank also provided recently two Policy Based Guarantees for two loans the
Government contracted with commercial Banks, together in the amount of €380 million. The
Policy Based Guarantees supported critical reforms needed to strengthened robustness of public
financial management and help mitigate the impact of the euro zone turmoil.



The Real Estate Cadastre and Registration Project (US$26 million) is supporting the digitalization
of cadastral maps and securing land and real estate titles. The Regional and Local Roads
Program Support Project (US$105 million) is helping with the rehabilitation of the regional and
local roads and provides institutional support to improve the management of roads. The World
Bank finances the energy sector through the Electric Power Development Energy Community of
South East Europe Project APL3 (US$44 million) to improve the transmission grid, including an
interconnection with Serbia. Local development is assisted through the Municipal Services
Improvement Project (US$75 million), which is helping to improve transparency, financial
sustainability and delivery of targeted municipal services in selected municipalities. The World
Bank is also active in the human development sector through the Conditional Cash Transfer
Project (US$25 million).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 30, 2013)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Areas that
would benefit most from further improvement are national accounts and government finance
statistics.

National accounts: Significant progress has been made in improving the scope and quality of
national accounts. Quarterly GDP data in constant prices from the production approach have been
published since September 2011. Improvements with regards to estimates of changes in inventories
and household consumption expenditure are needed. Employment data from the company survey
continue to be unreliable.
Price statistics: Improvements to the CPI have been introduced in accordance with international
standards and EU regulations concerning the treatment of seasonal products and the use of the
geometric mean for the calculation of elementary indices.
Government finance statistics: Data coverage on government below-the-line financing from the
National Bank deposits is inadequate, as a result of different coverage of accounts between the
Ministry of Finance and the National Bank – the government does not regularly report Treasury Single
Account and budgetary FX account balances. Debt data for the broader public sector are not available
on a regular basis. Macedonia does not report government finance statistics to the Fund for
publication in either the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSMY) or the International
Financial Statistics (IFS).

Monetary sector: EUR receives a monthly electronic report of monetary statistics, covering the
balance sheet of the central bank, the commercial banks and other depository corporations.

External sector: External sector statistics meet international standards. In additional to monthly
balance of payments data, the authorities compile and disseminate international investment position
(IIP) data, reserve assets and foreign currency liquidity data, and external debt statistics.
II. Data Standards and Quality
FYR Macedonia participates in the General Data
Data ROSC published on September 29, 2004.
Dissemination System (GDDS), and, since
November 2011, in the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 26, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation and
First Post-Program Monitoring with the Former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia
On June 14, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation and First Post-Program Monitoring with
Macedonia.1
Background
Following a shallow recession in 2012, a modest recovery is forecast for 2013, with
baseline growth expected to reach 2 percent. So far, industrial production has
strengthened in February and March, but indicators do not yet point to a solid recovery
in domestic demand. Nonetheless, the baseline growth forecast remains feasible,
provided that public infrastructure works and foreign investment projects accelerate as
planned. The weak external environment and difficult liquidity conditions for the
domestic private sector present important downside risks.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
The central objective of PPM is to provide for closer monitoring of the policies of members that have
substantial Fund credit outstanding following the expiration of their arrangements. Under PPM,
members undertake more frequent formal consultation with the Fund than is the case under
surveillance, with a particular focus on macroeconomic and structural policies that have a bearing on
external viability.

2
Inflation is expected to moderate to 2.5 percent in 2013, as the effects of energy price
hikes wear off and food prices decline. Cost side pressures are limited, with nominal
wage growth of 0.2 percent in 2012, and 1.2 percent in early 2013. The current account
widened to 3.9 percent of GDP in 2012, with the impact of weaker trade partly offset by
high private transfers. Private financial flows, particularly FDI flows, have been modest,
but public sector net external borrowing has helped build up reserves, which remain
adequate.
Weaker revenues and the start of the arrears clearance process widened the 2012 cash
deficit to 3.8 percent of GDP. Keeping the cash deficit contained required expenditure
compression beyond the ceilings established in the supplementary budget, and the
adjustment fell mainly on capital expenditure. Central government debt rose to 33.8
percent of GDP at end-2012.
The deficit for the first quarter of 2013, at 2.4 percent of projected 2013 GDP, already
represents two thirds of the annual target of 3.5 percent of GDP. The revenue outturn
was dominated by large VAT refunds, in accordance with the authorities’ commitment to
clear arrears. On the expenditure side, subsidies and other transfers rose substantially
relative to the same quarter of the previous year. While this appears to be an
intra-annual reallocation of expenditure, further expenditure compression will likely be
needed to meet the deficit target. The authorities were not considering a supplementary
budget at the time of the discussions, noting that on current revenue trends the required
adjustment could be accommodated within normal buffers.
Substantial net domestic issuance in 2012 as well as in the first quarter of 2013 has
helped finance the higher deficits. In line with previous IMF advice, the Treasury has
continuously sought to lengthen debt maturities. As a result, longer dated securities
currently make up 25 percent of the total debt stock, up from 5 percent at end-2011.
Banking sector indicators suggest that the system is in overall sound shape, but
non-performing loans (NPLs) are increasing. As of December 2012, the capital
adequacy ratio stood at 17.1 percent, and over 29 percent of total assets were highly
liquid. Deposits provide the main funding source. The NPL ratio rose to 11.7 percent in
February 2013, but provisions exceed NPLs.
After steadily decelerating in 2012, credit growth is expected to remain subdued in 2013.
Loan growth declined from 5.2 percent (year-on-year) in December 2012 to 4.4 percent
in February 2013, even as deposit growth accelerated from 4.4 percent to 5.1 percent.
The absence of pressures on the exchange rate allowed the National Bank of the
Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) to lower the policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.5 percent
in January 2013, and to gradually reduce its stock of outstanding central bank bills (its
main sterilization instrument) over the last six months. In addition, in order to stimulate
private credit growth, the NBRM lowered reserve requirements by the amount of new

3
loans to domestic net exporters and electricity producers, effective January 1, 2013.
Adoption of amendments to the banking law early this year closed some long standing
gaps in the crisis management framework. The amendments ensure that the NBRM is
able to impose fit-and-proper requirements on bank management and owners, and pave
the way for the central bank to widen the class of collateral that banks may use to
access liquidity support.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their economic management, which
has helped maintain financial and external stability despite difficult circumstances. While
the economy is poised for a moderate recovery in 2013, underpinned by acceleration in
public investment and FDI projects, it still faces a challenging external environment but
with limited policy space. Directors called for continued commitment to sound policies
and structural reforms. Efforts should focus on reducing risks to the outlook, preserving
macroeconomic stability, generating stronger growth, and boosting income convergence
and employment.
Directors agreed that the near-term policy mix should remain supportive to sustain the
still fragile recovery, particularly given monetary policy constraints. However, as the
crisis subsides, fiscal policy should be anchored in a well-articulated and credible
medium-term strategy. The strategy should strike a balance between increasing growth
and ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability, reducing debt and the deficit over time. They
emphasized that a greater focus on multi-annual budgeting would provide a good
framework for assessing fiscal space and avoiding payment arrears. Directors
commended the clearance of arrears and encouraged the authorities to implement
measures to improve fiscal management, including public financial management. With
some infrastructure spending shifting off-budget, they urged tight control on the pace of
indebtedness of public sector enterprises. Directors highlighted the need to analyze the
evolution of, and risks to, the broader public sector debt in setting budgetary targets and
prioritizing spending.
Directors took note that the exchange rate peg has served Macedonia well. They
generally agreed that the still-weak growth, contained inflation, adequate reserves, and
the absence of immediate balance of payments pressures may allow for an
accommodative stance to stimulate credit growth. However, the central bank should
stand ready to raise rates in the event that risks materialize and exchange rate
pressures emerge.
Directors noted that the banking sector is sound, with high capital adequacy ratios and
ample liquidity. Nonetheless, they emphasized that continued vigilance is necessary in
light of potential shocks. It will also be important to monitor the increasing nonperforming
loans. Directors commended the authorities for the recent changes to the banking law,

4
which have closed all but one of the identified gaps in the crisis management
framework.
Directors welcomed the improvements in the business climate and the progress made in
attracting foreign direct investment. Further structural reforms will be essential to
generate sustainable strong growth, speed up income convergence, and reduce
unemployment. Developing stronger linkages between FDI projects and the domestic
economy, building the needed infrastructure, and strengthening education and training
opportunities should be key priorities going forward.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2013 Article IV Consultation and First Post-Program Monitoring with
Macedonia is also available.

Statement by Mr. Snel and Mr. Hadzi-Vaskov
on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
June 14, 2013
The Macedonian authorities would like to thank the IMF team for the open and constructive
discussions during the mission and the useful analysis and recommendations included in the
staff report. They consider that the report adequately reflects the macroeconomic situation in
Macedonia and presents a well-balanced assessment of the strengths and risks, especially
those related to the challenges in the eurozone. Moreover, the authorities’ macroeconomic
projections are generally in line with staff’s. The authorities consistently value Fund advice
on fiscal, monetary, financial, and other issues and make use of it in favorable as well as in
challenging times. Following a well-established practice, they have continued to implement
policies in line with Fund advice. In particular, they have made progress in deepening
domestic debt markets, lengthening domestic debt maturities, and strengthening the crisis
management framework.
Economic Developments and Outlook
The recovery in economic activity in the second half of 2012 was not sufficient to offset the
decline in the first half, resulting in an overall output drop of 0.3 percent. Economic activity
is expected to moderately recover in 2013 with a growth rate of about 2 percent, primarily
driven by investments, exports and public infrastructure projects, and to further accelerate to
3 percent in 2014 against the backdrop of stronger domestic consumption and an increase in
exports from new production facilities. This will help close the negative output gap in the
second half of 2014. Several recent positive developments point to better growth prospects.
Following a continued 16-month long decline, largely reflecting lower external demand
related to the crisis in the eurozone, industrial production has been increasing in each of the
last three months by more than 4 percent yoy. The gradually increasing number of
export-oriented FDI facilities is expected to continue broadening the export base and to
further advance the geographic diversification of export markets, thereby strengthening the
economy’s resilience to external shocks.
After peaking in September 2012, headline inflation has further decelerated in Q1 of 2013
and is expected to gradually decline and gravitate around 2 percent in line with staff’s
projections. The external position is expected to remain stable and favorable. The current
account deficit is expected to widen in the next two years, against the backdrop of higher
import demand related to new investment projects. Strong capital inflows are expected to be
more than sufficient to cover the current account deficit, leading to a further steady
accumulation of foreign exchange reserves beyond the current historically highest level,
which can serve as a buffer against possible future shocks. Given the solid fundamentals,
including ample liquidity and adequate capitalization of banks, the ongoing recovery, and the
accommodative monetary policy, it is expected that the banking sector will provide further

2
support to the economy through growth in credit activity of about 7 percent in 2013 and
about 8 percent in 2014.
The unemployment rate has been continuously declining (by 6.3 percentage points over the
last 7 years), reaching its lowest level in the last 10 years in Q4 of 2012. Moreover,
Macedonia has been a rare example in Europe where the unemployment rate was reduced by
about 3 percentage points since the beginning of the crisis in 2008. The continued reduction
in the unemployment rate on a sustainable basis remains the authorities’ key priority.
Fiscal Policy
The fiscal deficit in 2012 was raised to 3.8 percent of GDP and the fiscal deficit target for
2013 to 3.5 percent of GDP in order to mitigate the adverse effects from the protracted
eurozone crisis on the domestic economy, including full clearance of accumulated arrears.
The authorities emphasize that they were the first in the wider region to publicly announce
the amount of arrears and to present a robust action plan for their clearance, which was
successfully completed as promised by the end of February 2013. The clearance of arrears
and the execution of all payment orders on a regular basis since then have significantly
improved the liquidity of the private sector. In order to prevent reoccurrence of arrears, the
authorities have undertaken comprehensive measures, including improved procedures,
strengthened reporting requirements for multi-annual commitments, and enhanced control
functions of the Treasury system.
The authorities proceeded with the transformation of the Agency for State Roads into Public
Enterprise for State Roads (PESR) in order to accelerate the implementation of projects. The
newly established enterprise will operate under the same legal framework as all other public
enterprises. Given the legal obligation of these enterprises to submit their financial plans and
quarterly and annual reports to the Ministry of Finance and the Government for approval, the
authorities emphasize that they have full control over their indebtedness process.
The authorities are fully committed to maintaining prudent fiscal policy and ensuring debt
sustainability. They are currently preparing a medium-term fiscal strategy, which will include
forecasts and commitments for sustainable fiscal targets and will be submitted to Parliament
together with a debt management strategy in the second half of 2013. In the coming period,
the authorities will be focused on gradually reducing the level of central government deficit,
giving priority to the full implementation of the capital infrastructure projects. They point out
that the pace of adjustment will depend on several factors, especially the strength of the
domestic recovery and prospects for economies in Europe.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
Notwithstanding pressures related to the challenging external environment, the National

3
Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) successfully extended its strong track record of
maintaining price stability and ensuring stability of the financial sector. The NBRM
authorities continue to be fully committed to basing monetary policy on the overriding
objective of protecting the exchange rate peg and ensuring price stability. They share staff’s
view that the exchange rate peg has served Macedonia well, delivering low inflation and a
stable real exchange rate.
The changes in the monetary policy operational framework introduced in 2012 contributed to
higher flexibility, more active use of different instruments by banks in their liquidity
management, and creating conditions for further development of money markets. In January
2013, the NBRM reduced the policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.5 percent against the
backdrop of decelerating inflationary pressures, faster-than-expected pace of foreign reserves
accumulation at end-2012, subdued economic activity, and weak credit growth. Towards the
end of 2012, monetary policy has been further relaxed with a change in reserve requirements,
aimed at stimulating credit for sectors that directly contribute to reducing the economy’s
external vulnerability. The authorities continue to view the monetary policy stance as
appropriately accommodative and would like to reiterate their readiness to adjust interest
rates if needed to respond to any potential future exchange rate pressures.
Financial Sector
The banking system in Macedonia remains stable, liquid, and well-capitalized. While
nonperforming loans (NPLs) continued to increase somewhat, they remain more than fully
covered by provisions. The authorities expect the level of NPLs to stabilize given that the
recent rise can be entirely attributed to a few weak clients. The Macedonian banks, including
subsidiaries of parent banks from the eurozone, are mostly financed by domestic resident
deposits, do not depend on external wholesale funding, and have very limited credit exposure
to countries or clients from the eurozone.
By adopting amendments to the Banking Law in accordance with past Fund advice, the
authorities have strengthened the crisis management framework. In particular, these changes
ensure that the NBRM can impose fit and proper requirements on bank management and
owners, and create scope for widening the class of collateral that banks may use to access
liquidity support from the NBRM.
The short-lived episode of deposit withdrawals from the Macedonian subsidiary of a
Slovenian bank in late March, triggered by high uncertainty related to the situation with
Cyprus, was an isolated case, swiftly contained thanks to the bank’s strong liquidity and the
authorities’ timely public reaction. The authorities continue to closely monitor developments
in the banking sector on a daily basis and, based on their adequate crisis management
framework and appropriate set of instruments, remain confident that they can react promptly
and effectively to tail risk events.

4
Business Environment
The authorities’ strong track record demonstrates their full commitment to the continued
implementation of comprehensive structural reforms aimed at further improving the business
environment, accelerating economic growth, attracting foreign investments, and enabling
faster job creation. The pursuit of decisive regulatory reforms aimed at improving the
business environment continued to be acknowledged by respected international rankings. The
latest World Bank Doing Business report ranked Macedonia as 1st in its region, 23rd in the
world, and 5th best reformer in the world on the list of countries that have most narrowed the
distance since 2005. Moreover, during roughly the same period Macedonia progressed by 35
places on the Index of Economic Freedom, 45 places on the Forbes list of best countries for
business, and 15 places on the Global Competitiveness Index. All of these rankings place
Macedonia at the top in its region.
Macedonia has been successful in attracting FDI projects recently. The extensive pipeline of
ongoing and planned FDI projects provides tangible and important recognition of the
improvements in the business environment, complementing the progress recorded by the
international rankings.
Moreover, the authorities pay particular attention to matching improvements in the regulatory
framework with the implementation of capital infrastructure projects. In this way, they aim to
strengthen the position of Macedonia as an attractive destination for foreign investors, but
also to facilitate linkages and spillovers with the domestic economy and enhance
competitiveness. Some of the key infrastructure investments include: construction of the last
remaining highway section of Corridor X, reconstruction and rehabilitation of several railway
sections along Corridors VIII and X, as well as construction of new energy generation
capacities and enhancement of the electricity transmission network.
Concluding Remarks
The Macedonian authorities are fully committed to preserving Macedonia’s sound economic
fundamentals, extending the strong track record of prudent economic policies, and
maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability. They also remain committed to the
continued implementation of structural reforms aimed at further improving the business
environment, enhancing competitiveness and strengthening the job-creating capacity of the
economy. Through investments in infrastructure, education, and training, the authorities aim
to capitalize on their success in attracting FDI and further strengthen linkages with the
domestic economy, in order to accelerate economic growth and reduce unemployment on a
sustainable basis. The authorities are aware of the risks, mainly stemming from outside,
continue to closely monitor the developments, and remain ready to undertake necessary
measures to mitigate possible adverse effects on the domestic economy and preserve
stability.
