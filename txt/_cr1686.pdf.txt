IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Gabon1
On February 19, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Gabon.
Gabon’s economy is facing mounting headwinds. Economic activity benefited from a one-off
boost in oil production in 2015, due to the introduction of new oil fields and productivity
improvements, which are expected to help maintain overall growth around 4 percent in 2015.
However, the slowdown in non-oil economy activity continued, led by construction, transport,
commerce, and services. An important factor in slowing non-oil activity are falling oil prices and
oil-related revenue, which is reducing aggregate demand and spurring a large fiscal
consolidation. Even so, the strains on the budget are intensifying, leading to a shift of the fiscal
balance (commitment basis) from a surplus of 2.5 percent of GDP in 2014 to a deficit of
2.3 percent in 2015, a rise in public debt above the government’s self-imposed ceiling of a debtto-GDP ratio of 35 percent, and a decline in government deposits and foreign reserves. This
substantial terms-of-trade shock is also impacting the external position, which turned from a
surplus of 8.3 percent of GDP in 2014 to a deficit of 1.9 percent in 2015. Consumer price
inflation (CPI) has come down sharply over the past year and expected to be about zero percent
in 2015.
Gabon’s economy remains heavily dependent on oil, and as such the medium-term economic
outlook has deteriorated in tandem with weakening prospects for that sector. In 2016, overall
growth is expected to decline to 3.2 percent, largely due to declining oil production. Ongoing,
large-scale investments in the agricultural sector, especially in cash crops such as palm oil and
rubber, are expected to accelerate significantly in 2017–18, could lift growth to around 5 percent
in the medium term. Realization of this scenario will depend on sustained progress on Gabon’s
economic diversification strategy, the Plan Stratégique Gabon Emergent (PSGE), which needs to
be carefully prioritized given the tight financing constraints posed by the current juncture.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms
the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

The main downside risk to the outlook remains weak fiscal adjustment to sharply lower oil prices.
In the event of weaker-than-projected performance on oil revenues or government spending, the
government would be forced to substantially draw down on its deposit buffer and/or significantly
increase borrowing. Other risks concern a stronger-than-expected spillover of the oil price shock
to non-oil economic activity (including to the financial sector), a weaker global economy,
tightening international financial conditions, as well as persistent fragility at three small distressed
state-owned banks.
Executive Board Assessment21
Directors noted that the low oil price outlook and the secular decline in oil production continue to
test Gabon’s macroeconomic resilience and weigh on the country’s medium-term growth
prospects. Directors underscored the critical importance of redoubling efforts to foster economic
diversification, continuing fiscal adjustment in response to the oil shock, buttressing financial
sector stability, and invigorating structural reform.
Directors stressed the need for stronger efforts to ensure fiscal and external sustainability in the
face of lower oil revenue. In this context, they supported the authorities’ focus on containing the
public wage bill, and commended the recent elimination of diesel and petrol subsidies. They
emphasized the importance of prioritizing measures to reverse the recent erosion of the revenue
base by curbing tax exemptions and enhancing revenue administration. Other priorities include
reducing inefficient spending in favor of productive expenditure, fostering private sector
participation in infrastructure projects, and safeguarding social spending. Directors welcomed the
ongoing public financial management reforms and encouraged the authorities to adopt the
recommendations of recent Fund technical assistance, including strengthening treasury
management.
Directors noted that while Gabon’s financial system is broadly sound, the weak financial condition
of public banks needs to be addressed urgently. They underscored the need for vigilance on
macro-financial linkages that could amplify the impact of the oil shock. They recommended close
monitoring of nonperforming loans, given the strong links between the oil and non-oil sectors and
the large role of government projects in the financial performance of Gabon’s banking sector.
They also encouraged regional and national authorities to move rapidly to address troubled public
banks. Directors highlighted the importance of financial deepening and economic diversification
in enhancing the resilience of the financial sector.
Directors emphasized the need to continue to foster diversification and reduce Gabon’s
vulnerability to oil price fluctuations. In this context, they welcomed the progress the authorities
have made in developing the country’s infrastructure since embarking on their economic
diversification plan in 2010. Given the reduced availability of financing, Directors encouraged

reprioritizing the reform agenda. They recommended avoiding revenue-eroding tax holidays and
focusing on high-impact infrastructure projects and productivity-boosting structural reforms,
including strengthening education and institutions, and increasing labor market flexibility.
Directors also encouraged the authorities to promote deeper intraregional integration and trade
liberalization in CEMAC.
Directors called for a higher priority on improving the quality and timeliness of macroeconomic
data to strengthen surveillance.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Gabon will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
February 5, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. The recent collapse in oil prices is a major test to Gabon’s macroeconomic
resilience. It has substantially worsened the growth outlook, government revenue
performance, and the external position. The shock highlights the need to accelerate the
implementation of Gabon’s plan to diversify its economy (Plan Stratégique Gabon Emergent,
or PSGE), but also considerably lowers available domestic financing. At the same time,
foreign financing has become increasingly costly. The implementation of further policy
adjustments will be complicated by the political environment prior to the 2016 elections. As a
key member of the CEMAC currency and economic union, Gabon’s economic policies have
significant regional implications and spillovers.
Outlook and Risks. The oil price shock has negatively affected domestic demand and GDP
growth in 2015. Some positive momentum is expected in the medium term as non-oil natural
resource projects ramp up. The main risk to the outlook remains insufficient fiscal adjustment
to weak oil prices that could further deplete fiscal buffers and weaken the external position.
Ancillary risks concern a stronger-than-expected spillover of the oil price shock to non-oil
economic activity, and persistent fragility at three small distressed state-owned banks.
Key Challenges. The discussions centered on the challenge posed by lower oil prices,
especially for the budget and the financial sector. Another key issue was how to reassess and
reprioritize the government’s diversification plan (PSGE) so that it can be sustainably
financed. Staff also assessed progress on the implementation of the PSGE and structural
reforms, as well as addressing economic data shortcomings.
Policy Recommendations. Staff recommended adjusting to the major terms-of-trade shock
through fiscal adjustment, mainly by eliminating inefficient and costly tax exemptions and
curbing the outsized wage bill, while protecting critical capital and social spending. At the
regional level, Gabon should advocate tighter fiscal and monetary policies to ensure
continued viability of the monetary union. Prompt corrective actions are needed to arrest the
deterioration of the financially weak public banks. The authorities should also undertake
structural reforms to promote productivity and export diversification, and redouble ongoing
efforts to address major weaknesses in economic statistics.

A CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
1.
Despite progress in implementing its transformation plan, Gabon is still oil-dependent
and therefore highly vulnerable to the recent oil price shock. After a decade of lackluster
economic growth, in 2010 the government embarked on the Plan Stratégique Gabon
Emergent (PSGE), which aims to diversify its economy by 2025.1 In its first phase (2010–14), high oil
revenues funded a scaling up of public investment that helped propel overall growth to nearly
6 percent on average, led by construction and services. While there are initial promising signs of
diversification, structural transformation is a gradual process, and as of 2014 oil still accounted for
roughly 40 percent of GDP, 45 percent of government revenues, and nearly 85 percent of exports.
The low oil price outlook and secularly declining oil production will reduce available financing for the
second phase of the PSGE (2016–20). As part of the oil-dependent CEMAC monetary union, Gabon’s
success in adjusting to oil price shocks also hinges on the ability of other member countries to
appropriately implement fiscal adjustments and their own diversification agenda.
2.
Economic activity has significantly decelerated in 2015. Statistical data through
September 2015 indicate higher-than-expected oil production (thanks to the introduction of new
wells and performance improvements), mining (manganese), and agriculture (due to a large, ongoing
international agribusiness joint venture). However, the sharp fall in oil prices has prompted the
government to slow capital spending, and oil companies to rein in operating and development
expenditures. This reduced domestic demand led to significant contractions in large non-oil sectors,
including construction, transportation, commerce, and services. At the same time, broad money and
credit to the economy are contracting.
3.
Despite significant fiscal adjustment since the second half of 2014 and delays in the
implementation of the capital spending, fiscal buffers are contracting rapidly. Since 2012,
public debt has more than doubled from 20 to 43 percent of GDP (above the 35 percent indicative
ceiling of the government), in part due to US$1.5 billion and US$500 million Eurobond issuances in
December 2013 and June 2015, respectively.2 About two-thirds of the increase in the debt-to-GDP
ratio since 2014 is due to the depreciation of the CFA franc and the decline in the oil GDP deflator.
Moreover, between December 2014 and October 2015, government deposits at the BEAC (net of
Eurobond receipts) declined by 57 percent, and gross international reserves by 30 percent. Foreign
financing has become increasingly costly, as rating agencies have downgraded the sovereign debt of
oil exporters, including Gabon, contributing to a significant increase in spreads in recent
months (Figure 1).
4.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are expected in the second half of 2016. No
official election dates have been announced, but the process of electoral list revision began in
January 2016. Opposition parties boycotted the 2009 parliamentary elections, and the governing
Parti Démocratique Gabonais won 113 of the 120 seats in the National Assembly. The run-up to the

A DETERIORATED OUTLOOK, AND RISKS ARE RISING
5.
The growth outlook has deteriorated (Figure 2). In light of a weak performance during the
first nine months of the year, the forecast of 2015 GDP growth has been revised down from
4.4 percent to 4.0 percent, driven by a slowdown in non-oil activity (5.8 to 4.0 percent). Inflation is
expected to be around zero percent in 2015, much lower than in 2014. Continued weakness in the oil
sector is expected to weigh on prospects for oil exploration and government revenue, leading to a
further deceleration of overall growth in 2016 to 3.2 percent. A pick-up of growth is expected
in 2017–18 as large-scale palm oil and rubber production by Olam International ramps up. However,
the negative outlook for the oil sector has led to a downward revision of the overall medium-term
growth rate to around 4.5 percent per annum, a decline of more than one percentage point since
the 2014 Article IV consultation.

6.
The main downside risk to the outlook remains insufficient fiscal adjustment to lower oil
prices (Risk Assessment Matrix, Annex I). As seen in Text Table 1, if government spending items were
to grow in line with non-oil GDP, or oil prices remain at US$5 per barrel below the current baseline of
the IMF’s World Economic Outlook3, the government would be forced to deplete available deposits,
and significantly increase borrowing and arrears. At the same time, slower global growth and tighter
international financing conditions will entail additional headwinds to the Gabonese economy. Ancillary
risks concern a stronger-than-expected spillover of the oil price shock to non-oil economic activity
(including to the financial sector), as well as persistent fragility at three small distressed state-owned
banks, one of which recently experienced severe liquidity problems prompting government
intervention.
7.
Several risk scenarios would require further fiscal tightening and, therefore, spending
prioritization (Annex I). Such would be the case if oil prices or non-oil revenues are lower than
projected, as well as scenarios that demand unexpected additional spending due to regional
insecurity or political turmoil. If the oil price shock or existing problems in public banks were to
significantly affect banking stability, the national and regional authorities would need to take decisive
action through the relevant supervisory and regulatory institutions to strengthen compromised
banks (through restructuring and recapitalization if needed), and minimize contagion risk.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: CONTAINING THE IMPACT OF
THE OIL PRICE SHOCK
8.
The principal theme of the 2015 Article IV consultations was the impact of lower oil
prices on the economy, especially on the budget and the financial sector. Another key issue was
how to reassess and reprioritize the PSGE so that it can be sustainably financed. Staff also assessed
progress on other important issues and recommendations discussed during the 2014 Article IV
consultations, including on the PSGE, structural reforms, and economic data shortcomings (see
Annex II). As indicated in Annex II, there has been an improvement in the implementation of previous
Article IV recommendations.

A. Fully Adjusting to a New Oil Price Outlook
9.
The continued drawdown of fiscal buffers increases the risks to fiscal sustainability and
the adequate financing of needed investment (Figure 3). While there was a slowdown in the
execution of the 2015 budget (only 62 percent of budgeted capital spending was executed by
September), non-oil revenue was lower than in 2014 and the government repaid large domestic arrears
and temporary external arrears.4 Financing pressures likely persisted in the last quarter considering the
expected acceleration in spending. Taking into account these developments and the 2015 amended
budget, the staff projects a fiscal deficit on a commitment basis of 3½ percent and on a cash basis of
9 percent of non-oil GDP (including large reimbursements of VAT-related and other arrears).

Staff welcomes the authorities’ aim to continue fiscal consolidation, as outlined in
the 2016 budget draft and in the Medium Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF), but has substantial
reservations on the underlying assumptions.5 While the assumed US$42 per barrel of Gabonese
oil was conservative when the budget was prepared, the acceleration of the decline in international
oil prices suggests there is a need to amend the budget accordingly. Furthermore, the 2016 initial
budget optimistically assumes a 20 percent increase in non-oil revenues relative to the
authorities’ 2015 projection. It also proposes a small 3.5 percent increase in current spending, which
will be politically difficult in an election environment and crowds out much-needed productive public
investment by including two stadia to host the 2017 African Cup of Nations, which account for
15 percent of total capital spending.6 The 2016–18 MTFF proposes spending paths that imply a
freeze in current spending in nominal terms and a reduction in capital spending by 8 percent
between 2015 and 2018. Under these assumptions the government expects that the overall fiscal
deficit would gradually decline and reach a small surplus in 2018.
11.
The staff baseline scenario proposes a more substantial adjustment to preserve fiscal
sustainability. Staff proposes that the non-oil revenue base be widened over time with the
elimination of overly generous tax exemptions; wages and salaries would grow at 2 percent per year
in nominal terms throughout the period; and other main current spending items and capital
spending grow in nominal terms but at a rate significantly below non-oil GDP growth (Figure 4).
Under those assumptions, a debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows Gabon’s projected debt level
peaking at 50.1 percent of GDP in 2016, and decline slowly from 2019. That said, shocks considered
in the DSA could lead to much higher debt-to-GDP ratios, and a growth shock could propel debt
significantly above the CEMAC ceiling (70 percent of GDP) by 2021. Given the large proportion of US
dollar-denominated debt, exchange rate fluctuations constitute a significant risk to Gabon’s external
debt sustainability7.

5

Since the CFA franc is pegged to the euro, fiscal policy is the main policy mechanism to adjust to the terms-of-trade
shock.
6

Note that only 55 percent of planned improvements to the main road corridors have been finalized.

7

About half of Gabon’s public debt is denominated in US dollars, with Eurobonds accounting for most of it. The
authorities continue to rely on the US dollar-denominated Eurobonds considering them their only feasible alternative
to obtain large amounts of new budget financing.

The outsized and still growing wage bill is a major threat to fiscal sustainability. The
wage bill grew by 70 percent between 2010 and 2015 (an 11 percent average growth rate per year),
mainly due to a 30 percent increase in the number of public servants, the conversion of temporary
workers to permanent status, and the introduction of an ill-designed performance incentive system
in 2014 that was later converted into base pay in 2015. After this period of very high growth, in 2015
the wage bill accounted for 34 percent of total government spending and was equivalent to
38 percent of total revenue. As seen in Figure 5, by 2015 the wage bill was equivalent to 9 percent of
GDP and to 60 percent of non-oil revenue; and the growth rates of these ratios in recent years have
been high in the subregion.

Staff commends the authorities for the implementation of major reforms to public
financial management. The main axis of these reforms is the implementation of the budgétisation
par objectifs de programme (BOP), which aims to better align the budget process with public policy
objectives, gauge performance, and increase decentralization and accountability. As part of the BOP,
the authorities have aligned budget execution and public spending principles with CEMAC directives,
significantly computerized the expenditure chain, started decentralizing budgetary execution, and
adopted a single account at the BEAC, among other important measures.
14.
Adjusting to the unfavorable oil price outlook while ensuring the financing of the
government’s diversification plan requires a wide range of strong measures. The authorities
need to:


Foster non-oil revenues by widening the tax base, mainly by reducing tax exemptions and
improving tax administration. In a fiscally-challenging environment, it is hard to justify the recent
elimination of taxes and fees for over 171 products as part of the so-called “policies against high
living costs”, and the prohibition of importation of vehicles over three years old, which represent
a revenue loss of 0.7 percent of GDP in 2015. A review of these policies is urgently needed,
especially in the context of rapidly rising real public wages. More generally, staff recommends a
thorough review and reform of the tax policy regime.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

GABON



Prepare a revised budget for 2016, given the worsening growth and oil price outlook, to preempt unfavorable public debt dynamics and avoid the accumulation of arrears.



Further enhance tax administration, drawing on extensive IMF and AFRITAC technical assistance
by implementing measures such as formalizing the collaboration between tax and customs
directorates, moving the collection of customs revenues from the Treasury to the customs
department, modernizing customs drawback system, and adopting a risk-based approach to VAT
reimbursements.



There is also a critical need to curb inefficient and/or poorly targeted current spending, while
protecting social spending. Most importantly, the public wage bill needs to grow below inflation
in the medium term.



With public investment considerably lower than in recent years, private sector participation for
infrastructure construction should be encouraged by accelerating development of an appropriate
Public Private Partnership (PPP) framework. Key projects under the PSGE should be reviewed and
reprioritized while minimizing projects with limited long-term economic payoff such as sports
infrastructure.8



Staff recommends anchoring medium-term fiscal policy by targeting a steady reduction in the
debt to non-oil GDP ratio through a progressive strengthening of the nonoil primary deficit,
which would allow the authorities to rebuild fiscal buffers. Throughout the adjustment, and
financing permitting, annual reductions in the non-oil primary deficit should not exceed 2
percent of non-oil GDP so as to limit the negative fiscal impulse.



The implementation of the BOP should continue, taking into account recent recommendations
by IMF technical assistance, emphasizing measures to improve treasury management and to
avoid further accumulation of arrears, especially external arrears.

Authorities’ views
15.
Amidst a worsened economic outlook, the authorities underlined that they are firmly
committed to implementing measures in line with staff recommendations. To this end, as a
major sign of their commitment, they eliminated petrol and diesel subsidies on February 1, 2016, and
introduced an automatic fuel-pricing mechanism. Now their major concern is the need to reduce the
outsized wage bill. In addition to recently undertaken measures (incentives for early retirement,
recruitment freezes, and the elimination of an inefficient incentive system), a major civil service
reform is being designed with assistance from the World Bank. Potential measures could include
improvements in human resource management such as merit-based recruitments and promotions.
The government also aims to continue reducing tax exemptions, although it noted that not all tax
incentives—especially those enshrined in law—can be easily eliminated. The authorities are studying

the possibility of partly reversing the recent restriction on second-hand vehicle imports, and the
World Bank is assisting them on the rationalization of the tax exemption regime. In view of continued
declines in the oil price, the authorities indicated that they would limit expenditure in line with cash
flow constraints, and prepare a revised 2016 budget with a lower oil price assumption. The
authorities welcomed staff’s recommended public financial management reforms, and reiterated
their commitment to proceed with BOP reforms.

B. Addressing the Financial Sector’s Vulnerability to Macroeconomic
Shocks and Weak Bank Governance
16.
The government has started addressing Gabon’s public banks’ deep-seated structural
problems. The problems culminated in the temporary closure of Poste Bank’s branches in midOctober 2015. To stabilize the bank, the government replaced its CEO, injected liquidity, provided a
blanket deposit guarantee, and imposed a limit on individual depositors’ withdrawals. Furthermore,
with the intervention of the regional supervisor (COBAC), all three public banks now have temporary
administrators in place with a mission to propose restructuring plans within six months. Although the
three public banks are relatively small (total assets of 3 percent of GDP and 9 percent of total
banking system assets (Table 7)) and have limited links to the rest of the banking system, tackling
their current situation is crucial to preserve financial stability and foster deepening and inclusion,
especially in the rural areas where Poste Bank is well-established. 9
17.
Gabon’s financial system is generally sound on aggregate levels, but it has shown
significant sensitivity to macroeconomic shocks. Aggregate bank capital and liquidity levels
appear adequate. Nonetheless, a stress test performed in the 2015 FSAP for CEMAC revealed Gabon
is the second most vulnerable country in the sub-region to credit and liquidity shocks (Table 5
and 6). Gabon’s non-performing loan ratio surged from 2.8 percent in June 2012 to 8.4 percent in
November 2014 in part due to government arrears, before subsiding to about 4 percent in
February 2015.10 This illustrates the financial sector’s vulnerability to developments in the oil sector
through the government channel (Figure 6).
18.
Analysis indicates a significant causal link between oil price shocks and financial sector
fragility (see accompanying SIP).11 This vulnerability has manifested as liquidity tensions in some
commercial banks following the ongoing oil price shock, which forced them to resort to their parent
companies or tap BEAC refinancing. The worsening growth and fiscal outlook is likely to increase
NPLs significantly. The microfinance sector12 also experienced a sharp deterioration in asset quality in

The preferred options should be restructuring and recapitalization to preserve the value of the branch network.

10

Most recent observation provided by the authorities during the Article IV mission.

11

A 40 percent oil-price shock (roughly the magnitude of the fall between June 2014 and December 2014) leads on
average, to a 40 percent deterioration in asset quality across oil exporters. Such shock is transmitted through the
government and the economic activity channels, and its magnitude depends on existing institutional frameworks,
fiscal and financial buffers, and developments in the oil and non-oil sectors.
12

The microfinancial sector, which consists of 10 institutions, has experienced a rapid increase in deposit and lending
activities in recent years, with a deceleration in 2013 and contraction in 2014.

Although the underlying causes are unclear, the situation poses a serious threat to financial inclusion.

Staff noted that financial inclusion has improved in recent years, but there has been
little impact on financial deepening. Physical outreach, as measured by the number of bank
branches and ATMs per head, has substantially improved since 2004, bypassing frontier markets but
remaining substantially below emerging markets levels (Figure 7). However, access to financial
services is concentrated in a few urban areas and financial deepening, as measured by deposit- and
loan-to-GDP ratios, is low at approximately a third of frontier markets averages and a quarter of
emerging markets averages.13 A lack of information on potential borrowers’ credit history, high
collateral requirements, and high lending rates are the main hurdles to credit supply.

13

Financial access and deepening in Gabon and CEMAC remain below emerging and frontier markets levels, even
when measured in terms of non-oil GDP.

Staff recommended decisive measures to safeguard the stability and development of
the financial sector. Key actions recommended are:


Swiftly resolve pressing governance issues at the state-owned banks. Available options for bank
resolution (restructuring or winding-down) should be assessed through careful cost-benefit
analysis. Prior to injecting additional funds to restore regulatory capital, the government should
ensure fundamental changes to banks’ business models, risk management, and governance.



Accelerate the PSGE economic diversification agenda to strengthen the financial sector’s
resilience to macroeconomic shocks by allowing the banking sector to better diversify its lending
portfolio.



Promote financial deepening and inclusion, by improving SMEs’ access to financial services;
creating credit bureaus and upgrading the operations of land and commercial registries;
streamlining procedures for recording and enforcing guarantees; and strengthening creditor
rights enforcement.

Authorities’ views
21.
The authorities acknowledged the urgency to solve the deep-seated governance issues,
while noting the limited systemic risk posed by state-owned banks. They underscored that
important decisions had been taken by the COBAC, notably the appointment temporary
administrators with the mandate to deliver timely resolution plans. They indicated that Post Bank is
the most serious case and they prefer to pursue a restructuring because its extensive rural branch
network provides a strong platform for improving financial inclusion. A prerequisite for the bank’s
resolution would be a clear separation of operations of the post office (La Poste) and Poste Bank. For
all public banks, they reassured staff that sound governance, business strategy, and risk management
will be established prior to any commitment of government funds. On financial deepening, the
authorities indicated their intent to further reduce barriers to finance, in particular through settingup a credit registry and adopting new technology innovations in the banking sector.

C. Promoting Non-oil Growth under Tighter Budget Constraints
22.
The recent decline in oil prices is proving a stark reminder of Gabon’s oil dependence,
underscoring the need to foster non-oil growth and employment. Econometric evidence
presented in the 2015 CEMAC regional consultation staff report shows that shocks like the recent
decline in oil prices could lead to negative non-oil GDP growth in Gabon, with effects from both
fiscal pro-cyclicality and from direct linkages between the oil and non-oil economies. The current
strong fiscal response of the authorities and increased non-oil production is expected to soften the
impact during the current oil price slump. Still, the ongoing deceleration and vulnerable fiscal
outlook highlights the importance of the authorities’ PSGE, which seeks better stewardship of natural
resources, infrastructure and human resource development, and moving up along the value chain.
23.
The authorities have been able to attract foreign non-oil investment, but partly relying
on costly schemes. As part of the PSGE, the government has appropriately allocated a portion of the
oil windfall to strength the country’s transport and energy infrastructure. The authorities have
16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GABON

embarked on a major rehabilitation of the Trans-gabonais railway line with the support of the IFC.
This should significantly remove bottlenecks for wood-related and mineral exports. Gabon has also
partnered with Olam International in one of the largest agri-business investments currently underway
in sub-Saharan Africa. The government has provided a land bank to Olam of 300,000 hectares, of
which over one-sixth is already under oil palm and rubber cultivation. To date, Olam’s foreign direct
investment in Gabon has totaled US$1.5 billion, including plantations and the development of the
Special Economic Zone and port capacity. Further impetus is expected to come from the GRAINE14
program, a joint venture of Olam and the government to address food security and rural income
issues in Gabon. These investments will increase both cash crop and subsistence farming, boosting
real growth by one percentage point, although the tradeoff is government financing for related
infrastructure and foregone revenue in the form of a long tax holiday.
24.
There is substantial room to implement more cost-efficient reforms to attract
additional investment. The focus should be on improving the business climate, especially
considering that Gabon’s standing in the World Bank’s Doing Business report and in other rankings is
very low, below comparator countries (Figure 8 and 9), as well as undertaking additional horizontal
structural reforms aimed at reducing factor costs.

With the oil price shock weighing on private sector activity, PSGE growth and
diversification objectives need to be protected and structural reforms accelerated. In the
present tight budgetary context, the authorities should aim to maximize the return on limited
resources.


Investor tax incentives should be avoided, as these undermine revenue generation and are
unlikely to trigger a self-sustaining process of economic diversification.



Investment should be reprioritized to focus on transport and energy projects with potential
growth spillovers.



In the same vein, priority should be on horizontal structural reforms aimed at raising economic
competitiveness and productivity, notably in the areas of education, infrastructure, and
institutions.



Even prior to adopting a road map for Phase 2 of the PSGE, business climate reform should be
accelerated, notably improving labor market legislation15, strengthening anti-corruption efforts
and the AML/CFT framework, and cutting red tape, as recommended in an action plan developed
with the IFC.



Deeper regional integration in CEMAC and more trade openness of the region would facilitate
economic diversification in Gabon. Gabon should take a lead role in taking the necessary
regional reforms forward. Similarly, Gabon should review its investment program against projects
already underway in neighboring countries to ensure that possible synergies at the regional level
are fully exploited.

Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities concurred that in a tight budgetary environment the investment
program should focus on projects with long-term spillovers. The completion of corridors
connecting growth poles, the continued development of SEZs, and the setting up of an investment
promotion agency would help improve the business climate and boost FDI and exports in the near
term. The authorities place great store in agro-industrial projects to boost non-oil growth. They
underscored the catalytic role they expect from the redevelopment of the Trans-gabonais railway line
which would ease transportation bottlenecks faced by the mining and wood industries. They noted
that sports infrastructure projects would generate immediate employment as well as foster local
development. Nevertheless, the road map being prepared for the second phase of the PGSE would
focus on social transformation, including administrative reform, employment training, and health
infrastructure.
15

Gabon fares better than the average of comparator countries (Figure 8) on the Global Competitiveness Index for
labor market efficiency (68 of 140 countries), but several aspects need to be improved. While redundancy costs have
been considerably reduced lately, there is a relatively high level of female participation, Gabon is relatively poor
performer on some survey-based measures of labor market efficiency such as managerial proficiency (ranked 91) and
on linking pay to productivity (ranked 114).

D. Ensuring External Sustainability and Improving Competitiveness
27.
Gabon’s external sustainability has deteriorated significantly due to the oil price shock.
The current account balance is projected to drop sharply from a surplus of 8.3 percent of GDP
in 2014 to a deficit of 1.9 percent in 2015, then slowly recover but remain negative over the medium
term. The recovery is predicated on the development of non-oil exports, which are projected to
increase by 64 percent between 2014 and 2020 (mainly manganese and processed wood). The
current account balance prospects, however, are vulnerable to spillovers from China, where
rebalancing has reduced demand for commodity imports.
28.
Official external reserves appear adequate, but downward pressure has intensified
since the oil price shock. Although Gabon’s contribution to reserves at the BEAC is among the
highest in the CEMAC region, the principle of reserves pooling implies that Gabon’s external
sustainability hinges on the sustainability of the CEMAC region where overall reserves have declined
even more dramatically (Figure 10). The BEAC recently adopted extraordinary measures to help
countries cope with the oil price shock, through a 50-basis-point discount rate cut to 2.45 percent in
July 2015 and a 52.4 percent increase in regional statutory advances in August 2015. 16 By end-2015,
all countries had substantially drawn down on their deposits at the BEAC, and, except Cameroon and
Gabon, they exhausted their available advances.17

29.
Model-based approaches strongly suggest that the real effective exchange rate (REER)
is overvalued by 3 to 16 percent. Despite the stability of Gabon’s REER, both the Bems and
Carvalho (2009) and Araujo et al. (2013) methodologies point to an overvaluation of the exchange
rate, ranging from about 3 to 16 percent (Annex I).

16

The overall increase in statutory advance was granted through the restoration of the statutory advances ceiling
to 20 percent of the previous fiscal year’s domestic revenue for each member state and a resetting of the reference
year to 2014 from 2008.
17

As of November 2015, Gabon had used up CFAF 340 billion out of CFAF 453 billion (ceiling).

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GABON

30.
Given the significant real exchange rate overvaluation, staff recommended addressing
competitiveness issues through:


Fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to promote exports diversification. The implementation
of reforms under the PSGE should be continued, with increased focus on projects with the highest
socio-economic returns and on improving the business climate. More horizontal reforms that
better adapt education and training to the needs of the economy should also be embraced.



Successful lobbying by Gabon to promote more efficient regional integration, trade, and
implementation of regional policies that would help reduce external vulnerabilities notably by:
(i) increasing the level of international reserves through the full repatriation of reserves by member
states and more ambitious fiscal consolidation policies across member states; (ii) continuing the
removal of barriers to regional trade (simplifying customs procedures and restoring fully the
common external tariff; implementing the rules of origin; and creating common merchandise
standards).



Advocating greater coordination between regional and national authorities in the areas of regional
governance, business climate, taxation and public investment.18 This would ensure a greater
efficiency in public investment, improve the attractiveness of the region to investors, and help relax
pressures on the current account.

E. Addressing Data Weaknesses and Fund Jurisdictional Issues
31.
There remain serious weaknesses in data comprehensiveness, availability, and quality
in Gabon. As described in the 2014 Article IV staff report, the main weaknesses include: (i) balance of
payments inconsistencies; (ii) untimely financial soundness indicators; (iii) non-comprehensive fiscal
statements; and (iv) scarce basic social indicators. Ratings agencies cite data weaknesses as a factor
negatively affecting Gabon’s sovereign debt ratings.
32.
The authorities have made progress in addressing some of the shortcomings. Notably,
the government issued the law establishing a national system of statistics and adopted a decree
creating the National Agency for Statistics, and Demographic, Economic, and Social Studies. In
addition, the 2013 demographic census has been finalized (estimating total population at 1.8 million)
and through IMF technical assistance they are working toward the production of quarterly national
accounts data. The authorities have also significantly improved the timeliness of the fiscal, monetary,
and price data provided to the IMF.
33.
Staff encourages the authorities to redouble their efforts to strengthen their statistics
services. Special attention should be given to the quality of the data and to producing high frequency
indicators.
18

The management of public investment projects should be improved through the creation of monitoring
committees within the CEMAC Commission for major national and regional projects, focusing on projects that
generate growth, with a more pronounced role for the regional development bank, the BDEAC, in supporting regional
development projects.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

GABON



Improving the quality of the data is a major requisite for the proper design and monitoring of the
PSGE and to improve Gabon’s access to international financial markets.



The elaboration and publication of high frequency indicators is needed to improve economic
surveillance, as well as the incorporation of more analytical elements to the Note de Conjoncture (a
report published quarterly by the Ministry of the Economy).

34.
Fund jurisdictional issues: As noted in previous Article IV staff reports, Gabon maintains a
1.5 percent tax on wire transfers abroad that is not consistent with Gabon’s obligations under
Article VIII, Section 2(a) of the Articles of Agreement. The proceeds of this tax are used to fund Gabon’s
health insurance scheme. The authorities note that they have exempted a number of transactions from
this tax (notably, all interbank transfers), but do not propose eliminating the tax.
Authorities’ views
35.
The authorities indicated that they are strongly committed to improving statistical
systems, as well as data quality and timeliness. To this end, the government is negotiating a loan
with the World Bank to support the national statistical development strategy. Its key components
include; (i) institutional reforms; (ii) human resource development; (iii) enhancement of quality and
timeliness of statistics; and (iv) improvement of warehousing and dissemination of statistics.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The recent collapse in oil prices represents major terms-of-trade shock for Gabon,
demanding an equally exceptional policy reaction from the authorities. As part of a monetary
union with a currency pegged to the euro, efforts should center on adjusting government finances to
the new oil price outlook. Besides helping preserve internal and external macroeconomic balances,
fiscal adjustment is also a prerequisite to ensure proper financing of the authorities’ non-oil economic
growth strategy. The magnitude of the terms-of-trade shock also requires careful monitoring of its
likely negative impact on the financial sector. While implementing these measures the authorities also
need to maintain focus on long-term reform efforts such as the improvement of its statistics system.
Given its prominent role in the CEMAC, Gabon should play a key role as a champion for reform.
37.
Given medium-term projections that put the international oil price at less than half of its
pre-2015 levels, the government needs to make additional efforts to cut spending while
judiciously increasing non-oil revenues and protecting social spending. The authorities are taking
significant steps to this end, especially with their efforts to rein in the outsized wage bill. Staff
welcomes the recent elimination of all diesel and petrol subsidies, and the introduction of an
automatic fuel-pricing mechanism. However, there is urgent need to reverse recent measures that
erode the revenue base (tax and fee exemptions to control the cost of living and restrictions on
imported used vehicles), avoid clearly inefficient spending such as sports infrastructure, foster PPP
participation for infrastructure development, and protect social spending. Given considerable changes
in underlying macroeconomic conditions since the draft 2016 budget was prepared, staff believes an
early revision to the budget is warranted to avoid escalating fiscal imbalances and increase policy
credibility.
22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GABON

38.
Ongoing public finance management reforms would contribute to fiscal adjustment. The
ongoing implementation of the BOP is an important step to address the major public finance
management weaknesses that were identified in the 2013 Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) performance assessment. Results are already showing up, but recent
recommendations by IMF technical assistance need to be taken into account, while emphasizing
measures to improve treasury management and to avoid further accumulation of arrears, especially
external ones.
39.
The massive terms-of-trade shock requires the government to carefully monitor
macrofinancial linkages that could amplify its economic impact. The regional and national
authorities need to aggressively address currently troubled public banks. In addition, and considering
the dominance of oil and government activities to bank creditors, the entire banking system needs to
be closely monitored, focusing on the likely increase in NPLs. The financial sector’s resilience to
macroeconomic shocks needs to be enhanced, by promoting economic diversification which would
foster the diversification of the banking sector’s lending portfolio. At the same time, the authorities
should not lose track of their long-term goals to promote financial deepening and inclusion.
40.
Fiscal adjustment should take into account the evident need to foster Gabon’s economic
diversification and reduce its vulnerability to oil price fluctuations. In the present tight budgetary
context, the authorities should aim to maximize the return on limited resources and avoid incentives
for investors, while focusing spending on infrastructure development, prioritizing horizontal,
productivity-boosting structural reforms, notably in the areas of education, infrastructure, institutions,
labor flexibility, bureaucratic procedures, anti-corruption, and AML/CFT. Gabon could also advocate for
CEMAC external trade liberalization, as well as deeper intraregional integration. Such productivity
enhancing measures are also needed to address current real exchange rate overvaluation.
41.
Staff commends the authorities for their efforts to address major weaknesses in
economic statistics, while noting that they are still a major hindrance on economic surveillance.
The negative impact of weak statistics on Gabon’s sovereign debt rating is noteworthy. Ongoing
measures to improve the quality and timeliness of high-frequency macroeconomic indicators and
social indicators are crucial, but work is also needed to improve the very weak balance of payments
and financial stability statistics. Staff encourages the authorities to implement measures under the
forthcoming World Bank-supported statistics reforms.
42.
Gabon maintains a tax on wire transfers, which is inconsistent with its obligations under
Article VIII. Staff does not recommend approval of this restriction.
43.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Gabon be held on the
standard 12-month consultation cycle.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff).

The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below
10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source
of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex II. Traction of Past IMF Recommendations
1.
Gabon’s track record in implementing the recommendations of the previous Article IV
consultation has improved substantially (see Table 1). The government eliminated some tax
exemptions, reduced wage bill growth, eliminated subsidies to diesel and petrol, and liberalized fuel
importation. On the other hand, several products have been added to the list of tax exemptions.
Public finance management (PFM) reforms as part of the BOP reform should improve the quality of
investment. An investment promotion agency has been set up to improve the business climate,
important initial steps have been taken to improve economic statistics, and the government is taking
action to strengthen weak public banks.

Annex III. External Assessment
Protracted oil-price shock and secularly declining oil production continue to hamper Gabon’s external
position as evidenced by recent trends in global trade shares. The Bems and Carvalho (2009) and
Araujo et al. (2013) methodologies suggest that the real effective exchange rate (REER) is overvalued
by 3 to 16 percent. This result is predicated on the sharp decline in the current account balance
following the recent commodity price shock, notwithstanding the decline in the REER over the past year
on account of the strong dollar.
1.
Gabon’s real effective exchange rate has declined since last 2014, after a long period of
relative stability compared to CEMAC countries. The downward pressures are attributable to the
US dollar appreciation against the euro, to which the CFA franc is pegged, and low domestic
inflation. Gabon’s consumer price index, after averaging 4½ percent in 2014—owing to high level of
international commodity prices—subsequently embarked on a downward trend through 2015, and is
expected to remain low in the medium term.
2.
Results from the methodology of Bems and Carvalho1 point to real exchange rate
overvaluation of about 8 to 16 percent, assuming that trade balance elasticity relative to the
real effective exchange rate is -0.6. The norms from this first methodology, derived under the
permanent income hypothesis and with no account for future returns on public investment, are
significantly above Gabon’s medium term current account path, given the current context of public
investment scaling-up.
3.
The methodology of Araujo et al. (2013) is more appropriate in the current context to
take into account the significant public investment in Gabon, and also suggests that the
effective real effective exchange rate is overvalued. This methodology solves for a current
account norm resulting from a welfare maximization problem in which productive investment needs
may be financed by contracting external debt to be repaid with income flows from oil resources
windfalls. The model takes into account many frictions common to developing countries, and
suggests an overvaluation of 3 and 7 percent under cost overrun assumptions of 60 and 40 percent,
respectively. Higher cost overruns lead to relatively higher investment needs and imply a lower
current account balance norm.

4.
The evolution of Gabon’s share in global trade has coincided with oil price fluctuations,
pointing to significant external sector vulnerabilities. The country’s high reliance on the oil sector
has been demonstrated during recent oil-price slump episodes. During the 2008 oil-price shock,
Gabon’s exports share dropped to
0.04 percent from 0.05 percent. Starting

value of non-oil exports has somehow
stagnated during past years, reinforcing
the need for structural reforms to
increase manganese, wood, and other exports. In particular, these reforms could target the weak
productivity and structural bottlenecks that hinder competitiveness and amplify Gabon’s external
vulnerability (see Sections C and D of the staff report).



Relations with the Fund. Gabon has been a member of the International Monetary Fund
since 1963. Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) member
countries accepted the obligations of Article VIII in June/July 1996. The three-year SBA for
about US $118 million expired in May 2010, with only the first three reviews completed.
Recurrent fiscal slippages made it difficult to sustain the Fund-supported program. The
last Article IV Consultation was concluded on February 18, 2015.



Relations with the World Bank. The World Bank is providing technical assistance on
several areas, most importantly on statistics, public service wage bill, and institutional
development. A US$ 58 million IBRD Loan for the Central African Regional and National
Backbone project (CAB4) supporting the development of high speed telecommunication
infrastructure was signed in May 2012. The World Bank has more recently approved two
US$ 100 million loans, one to finance basic urban services and another to strengthen
youth training.



Exchange rate regime: Gabon is a member of CEMAC. The common currency, the CFA
franc, is pegged at the fixed rate of 655.957 CFA franc per euro. Gabon’s tax on wire
transfers constitutes a restriction on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2 (a) of the
Articles of Agreement.

Statistical Issues. Gabon has subscribed to the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS). While data are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, staff analysis
was affected by the timeliness and coverage of fiscal data, the poor quality of balance of
payments and financial stability data, and the limited information on labor cost and
productivity.

Safeguards Assessments:
The Banque des États d’ Afrique Centrale (BEAC) remains subject to close IMF monitoring of
safeguards “rolling measures” in the context of new program requests and reviews for the Central
African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) countries. This follows governance challenges
and control failures that emerged in 2009. A safeguards staff visit to the BEAC was last conducted in
April 2015. Staff concluded that while the BEAC had continued the implementation of its reform plan,
slippages had occurred and progress on implementing the safeguards rolling measures has been
mixed, including on priority recommendations on amendments to the BEAC charter and adoption of
an internationally recognized financial reporting framework (IFRS). The BEAC has requested IMF
technical assistance to advance the implementation of the above two recommendations, and work is
underway. Progress on implementation of the latter will remain subject to monitoring by the IMF, as
a condition to continuing new program requests and reviews for CEMAC member countries.
Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The regional currency is the CFA franc. From 1948 to 1999, it was pegged to the French franc.
Since the euro was introduced in 1999, it has been pegged to the euro at the rate of
CFAF 655.957 per euro.
Like other members of CEMAC, Gabon accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 on
June 26, 1996. Gabon levies a tax on wire transfers, including for the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, which gives rise to an exchange restriction subject to
Fund approval under Article VII, Section 2(a) of the Articles. The authorities have exempted certain
transactions from the tax; however, the tax continues to apply to other transfers subject to Fund
jurisdiction.
Article IV Consultations:
Gabon is on a 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The Executive Board concluded the last Article
IV consultation with Gabon on February 18, 2015
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
A national module for Gabon of the joint IMF/World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) was completed in 2002 and discussed by the Executive Board in March 2002 (IMF Country
Report No. 02/98). The first regional Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was carried out
January-March 2006, and a regional FSAP Update was carried out during November 2014 to
January 2015. Regional Reports on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSCs) were done in the
areas of monetary and financial policy transparency, banking supervision, and anti-money laundering
and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) in June 2006.
Resident Representative:
The Fund no longer has a resident representative nor a local economist in Libreville.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
GABON—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX

As of January 20, 2016
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General. Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Staff’s analysis
is affected by shortcomings in the accuracy, reliability and adequacy of periodicity and timeliness for
certain data, as well as consistency between datasets. The statistical producing agencies do not have
sufficient access to source data and lack an institutional framework in which to share information and
coordinate compilation efforts. To monitor progress in the implementation of PSGE, household surveys
should be conducted and disseminated regularly.
Gabon participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), but has not updated the metadata
or plans for improvement since 2002. Except for consumer prices, the authorities do not report any real
sector or government finance statistics (GFS) to STA for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS)
or for electronic dissemination. Detailed economic and financial statistics, including long historical time
series, are published in the Tendances de l’Économie, issued twice a year by the General Directorate of
Statistics and Economic Studies (DGSEE) of the Minister of Sustainable Development, Economy,

Investment Promotion and Prospective. More recent sectoral developments are described in detail in
the Tableau de Bord de l'Économie, issued quarterly by the Ministry of the Sustainable Development. Due
to capacity constraints, Gabon does not provide IIP data, which is required for all IMF members under
Article VIII, Section 5. The authorities have not taken any step to fill this gap.
National Accounts. Central AFRITAC (AFC) is working with authorities to incorporate the System of
National Accounts 1993 methodological recommendations. A new series of national accounts, covering
the period 2001-2009 has been prepared. Compilation of national accounts for 2010-2013 is underway,
and the whole new series should be released soon after the 2010-2013 accounts have been completed.
AFC is also assisting Gabon with the implementation of quarterly national accounts and related indicators.
Employment and unemployment. Data on unemployment and the total labor force are not
systematically available.
Price Statistics. In 2007 the authorities began publishing an improved CPI index, which covers the same
basket of goods and services as the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC)
Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HCPI) and uses a weighting scheme derived from Gabon’s 2005
household expenditure survey. The CPI only covers the capital city of Libreville.
Government Finance Statistics. A major shortcoming is limited institutional coverage, as social security
operations are not included in the Statement of Operations of either the central or the general
government. Audited accounts of oil sector operations are generally available annually and sometimes
quarterly, but with a significant reporting lag. Other needed improvements include the recording of
government-owned capital formation financed by oil companies and the recording of government
arrears. Data provided for surveillance purposes are based on GFSM 1986. Gabon does not provide GFS
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GABON

data to the IMF for inclusion in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook nor the International Financial
Statistics.
Monetary and Financial Statistics. The Bank of Central African States (BEAC) regularly reports in
electronic form monthly monetary, interest rate, and exchange rate statistics for Gabon and other CEMAC
member countries for publication in the IFS, but delays occur sometimes in the submission of data.
Institutional coverage of the monetary statistics for Gabon is comprehensive, but accuracy is affected by
cross-border movements of currency among CEMAC member countries.
In mid-2007, the BEAC started a project to migrate monetary statistics of CEMAC member countries to the
methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). As part of this project, a regional
workshop was organized by the BEAC in December 2007 to finalize the mapping of source data from
commercial banks to the MFSM concepts and framework. STA participated in this workshop to provide
guidance and advice. The BEAC has recently submitted test monetary data for Gabon using the
standardized report forms for the period January 2000–December 2007.
Financial Sector Surveillance.
Gabon Does not report Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) to STA.
External Sector Statistics. Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the national directorate of the
BEAC and the estimates are validated by staff from BEAC headquarters. Data are disseminated with
considerable delay and they have not been submitted for publication in the IFS since 2006. Since 1995,
compilation of balance of payments statistics has conformed to the Balance of Payments Manual, 5th
edition. Source data are collected through: (i) surveys of enterprises by the central bank (the main source
of data); (ii) reports from banks and the postal administration on foreign exchange transactions of other
enterprises, retailers, and private individuals; and (iii) BEAC reports on banknote movements between
Gabon and other BEAC countries. External trade data are mostly based on estimates, which are not crosschecked with customs data. Data on other items of the current account are not very reliable or accurate
due to low response rates to enterprise surveys, despite partial correction through adjustments. Foreign
direct investment in the financial account is likely to be underestimated owing to insufficient detail in the
oil sector survey. The magnitude and detailed breakdown of private capital flows, particularly short term,
suffer because data are not comprehensive.
There are comprehensive data on the stock of external public debt and its composition, as well as detailed
projections on debt service due. Data are provided, usually to Fund missions, by the General Directorate
of Public Debt (Direction générale de la dette publique) of the Minister of Sustainable Development,

Economy, Investment Promotion and Prospective.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Prepared By

Prepared by the staff of the International Monetary Fund

Anne-Marie GuldeWolf (AFR) and Bob
Traa (SPR)

While Gabon’s public and external debt remain at moderate levels, they have
considerably increased since the previous Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), published
last year. In the context of plummeting oil prices and with the need to repay large arrears,
the overall fiscal balance on a cash basis reached 9 percent of GDP 2015. Under a
baseline scenario that assumes that a substantial adjustment takes place, debt is
projected to reach 50 percent of GDP in 2016, exceeding the government’s public debt
ceiling (of 35 percent of GDP), and gradually decline only from 2020. Lower than
projected GDP growth, fiscal revenues, or current account balances could lead to a
dramatic increase in debt indicators, far above the CEMAC ceiling.

GABON

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
Public debt level and structure. Gabon’s public debt stood at CFAF 3,177 billion
(US$5.4 billion) by end-September 2015. It has rapidly increased this decade as the government
sought funds to finance the PSGE, to build the infrastructure needed for the soccer African Cup of
Nations in 2012 (jointly with Equatorial Guinea), and more recently, to make up for lower revenues
following the oil price shock. Thus, from approximately 16.7 percent of GDP in 2008, total public debt
reached 32.6 in 2014 and is projected to have increased further to 43 percent in 2015. The increase in
the debt ratio from 2014 to 2015 was largely due to the issuance of a US$500 million Eurobond in
June, the Euro-CFAF depreciation, and the considerable decline in nominal GDP resulting from the
collapse in oil prices. About two-thirds of the increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio since 2014 is due to
the depreciation of the CFA and the decline in the oil GDP deflator. Gabon’s government debt is
mostly external (external debt accounted for 85 percent of total public debt in 2014) and mediumto-long term. It is worth noting that while the CEMAC regional group sets a public debt ceiling at
70 percent of GDP (deemed too high in recent CEMAC regional surveillance staff reports), Gabon sets
a more conservative ceiling of 35 percent of GDP, which was surpassed in 2015.

Baseline scenario. The proposed baseline scenario reflects projections made in the
macroeconomic framework described in Tables 1 to 6 of the staff report. Staff’s baseline scenario
assumes that non-oil revenue base would be widened over time with the elimination of overly
generous tax exemptions; wages and salaries would remain constant in real terms; and capital
spending would grow at a rate lower than non-oil GDP growth. International oil and other
commodity prices, as well as exchange rates reflect World Economic Outlook projections
through 2021. The public DSA shows that the macroeconomic framework presented in this staff
report would result in debt levels that reach 50 percent of GDP in 2016 and decrease only from 2020.
3.
Shocks. A historical scenario, in which the fiscal balance is much higher than in the baseline,
translates into a reduction in public debt levels over the projection period (see Figure 1). On the
other hand, a 1 percentage point decline in real GDP growth in the projection period (a supply
shock) combined with a reduction in government revenues by 2 percentage points of GDP would
lead to a sharp increase in public debt up to 85 percent of GDP by 2021. A contingency liability shock
would have a smaller impact on the debt-to-GDP ratio, but would still bring it above CEMAC’s
70 percent ceiling.22

22

This scenario assumes a one-time increase in non-interest expenditures equivalent to 10 percent of banking sector
assets leads to a real GDP growth shock (see above): growth is reduced by 1 standard deviation for 2 consecutive
years; revenue-to-GDP ratio remains the same as in the baseline; deterioration in primary balance lead to higher
interest rate; decline in growth leads to lower inflation.

1/ Public sector is defined as central government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
4.
External debt level and structure. After a considerable restructuring and consequent
reduction in the late 2000s, Gabon’s external debt went up from US$2.1 billion in 2009 to about
US$4.3 billion in 2013 (equivalent to 24.8 percent of 2013 GDP). Such an increase is partly the result
of the issuance of a US$1.5 billion Eurobond in 2013 (US$ 610 million of which was used for partial
repayment of a US$1 billion Eurobond issued in 2007) and later US$500 million in 2015. By end2014, debt to multilateral institutions accounted for 14 percent of total external debt, bilateral debt
for 23 percent, debt to commercial institutions and debt placed in financial markets accounted for
the remaining 63 percent.
5.
Baseline scenario. The baseline scenario is the same as in the public debt sustainability
analysis, reflecting projections made in the macroeconomic framework described in Tables 1 to 6 of
the staff report. With respect to external debt, the macroeconomic framework assumes that the
international bond for US$1 billion that was issued in 2007 is rolled over. Under this scenario, the
external debt sustainability framework projects that the external debt-to-GDP ratio should surpass
40 percent from 2016, and gradually decline only from 2020.
6.
Shocks. Alternative scenarios include a historical scenario in which main variables are
assumed to be the same as in the past ten years, and others that incorporate a 0.25 standard
deviation applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and the current account balance. While the
historical scenario, in which financial needs are much lower than in the baseline, lead to a drastic
reduction in external debt, other shocks to the baseline lead to a dramatic debt escalation. Most
notably, shocks to the non-interest rate current account and the real exchange rate lead to an
increase in external debt by 2021 up to 56 and 62 percent of GDP, respectively.

Statement by Mr. Yambaye, Executive Director For Gabon
February 19, 2016

On behalf of my Gabonese authorities, I would like to express my appreciation to management
and staff for their continued support and technical assistance provided to Gabon. My authorities
appreciate the candid and constructive discussions with staff during the Article IV discussions in
Libreville in November 2015. They welcome staff recommendations and inputs in their
economic policy agenda.
Economic activity and the country’s finances were severely affected in 2015 by the sharp
decline in oil prices, despite significant fiscal adjustment that started in the second half
of 2014. My authorities have continued to adapt their policy program to changing economic
conditions. As I mentioned in my Buff statement on Gabon last year, my Gabonese authorities
decided to slow down pace of implementation of their national development plan, Plan
Stratégique Gabon Emergent (PSGE), in order to align related expenditures with the absorptive
capacity of the country and the level of budgetary resources, and preserve fiscal sustainability.
The 2014 budget was revised accordingly in July 2014 with notably a halving of the public
investment spending, before the oil prices even begun their inexorable decline. As international
oil prices declined sharply toward end-2014, the draft 2015 budget was reviewed with more
conservative revenue assumptions at the time. Later, the 2015 budget was revised again, as oil
prices declined further and remain much lower than projected throughout 2015, which further
complicated the implementation of the PSGE.
With oil prices continuing to fall in early 2016, the authorities are taking additional
measures to tighten the budget. As in the past, given the regional fixed exchange rate regime in
place, my authorities intend to respond to the projected tighter resource constraint by further
scaling down expenditures related to the implementation of the PSGE, while speeding up
structural reforms to foster economic diversification and increase the resilience of the economy
to exogenous shocks.
I.

Recent economic developments

The persistent low oil prices affected negatively the macroeconomic performance in 2015.
Growth is estimated at 4.0 percent in 2015, down from 4.3 percent in 2014. This slowdown came
mainly from the non oil sector which was hit by the lower public demand that resulted from
declining oil revenues (4.0 percent in 2015 against 5.0 percent in 2014). Oil production,
however, increased from 1.8 percent in 2014 to 4.2 percent in 2015 thanks to the drilling of new
wells and the application of new enhanced oil recovery techniques. Inflation has remained flat
with sluggish domestic demand; the current account balance turned negative in 2015 due to
lower oil export value and international reserves have declined.

2

Budget execution in 2015 has been prudent. Public investment spending was slowed down as
both oil and non-oil revenue collection continued to underperform projections. External arrears
that emerged in 2014 were settled. Large domestic arrears were also paid thus limiting their
impact on economic activity and the financial sector. However, arrears payments led to a sharp
deterioration of the overall fiscal balance. Public debt remains moderate at 43 percent of GDP,
although it has increased in the past few years following the issuances of the two Eurobonds
(US$1.5 billion and US$ 500 million) whose proceeds are being used to finance the PSGE.
Some progress has been made in the implementation of fiscal reforms. My authorities
pursued the implementation of the Budgétisation par objectifs de programme (BOP) in
accordance with CEMAC regional directives to strengthen public financial management. As part
of the BOP, the authorities have aligned budget execution and public spending principles with
CEMAC directives, significantly computerized the expenditure chain, started decentralizing
budgetary execution, and adopted a single account at the BEAC, among other important
measures. These actions are in line with the 2013 PEFA recommendations. More recently, petrol
and diesel subsidies were eliminated and an automatic petroleum price-setting mechanism was
introduced.
The health of the financial sector is good and troubled banks are being resolved. Banks are
well capitalized. The repayments of government domestic arrears kept the NPLs at a low level.
My authorities are addressing the three troubled banks in cooperation with COBAC, the regional
banking supervision agency. In particular, three banks, which represent 9 percent of total
banking system assets, have been placed under provisional administration. The temporary
administrators are tasked with delivering resolution plans to improve governance, business
strategy and risk management in the banks. Asset quality in the microfinance sector is also
deteriorating with the slowdown in the non-oil economy. Financial inclusion has improved in
terms of physical outreach.
Structural reforms to foster economic diversification in the context of the PSGE are also
advancing well. The implementation of projects launched since 2010 to upgrade infrastructure
in the transport and energy sectors and to develop agri-business is proceeding well. Furthermore,
as indicated earlier, in order to forcefully address unemployment and poverty, my authorities
launched in 2014 several initiatives that aim, among others, at promoting income-generating
activities, developing human capital and improving the social conditions of the most vulnerable
segments of the population. In particular, an agricultural program, Programme GRAINE,
developed in partnership with a Singapore-based multinational corporation, was launched to
promote the development of agriculture through the provision of a multiform assistance to
producers organized in cooperatives. The implementation of this program is accelerating.
Through this program, my authorities expect to increase individual empowerment and tackle
rural exodus while improving land use planning and contributing to economic diversification.

Significant progress was made towards addressing data weaknesses. The timeliness of the
fiscal, monetary and price data provided to the IMF has improved. The 2013 Demographic
census has been finalized. Work is underway with the assistance of the World Bank for the
production of quarterly national accounts data. A national system of statistics has been
established and a national agency for statistics has been created
II.

Policies for 2016 and beyond

Gabon is undeniably facing a challenging economic environment. The country’s medium
term growth outlook has deteriorated, with dimmer prospects of an oil price recovery in the near
term. GDP growth will decline further in 2016, driven by a continued slowdown of the non-oil
sector as a result of a constrained public demand. Inflation is expected to remain well below the
related regional convergence criterion.
To address the downside risks, my authorities concur that a reprioritization of the
investment program is needed. As noted above, they will streamline the PSGE notably by
focusing on projects with greater long term socio-economic returns and on improving the
business environment. These include, as staff note, the road corridors that connect growth poles
identified in the PSGE, the agro-industrial projects and the rehabilitation of the railway line
which is key to the transportation of the production of the mining and wood industries to the
port. These projects will remove obstacles to private sector development while boosting non-oil
growth in 2017 and beyond.
The fiscal program for 2016 and the medium term envisages the adoption of several revenueenhancing and expenditure-reducing measures to reduce fiscal vulnerabilities stemming from oil
price developments, improve medium-term fiscal sustainability and put debt dynamics on a
sustainable path. In particular, the 2016–18 MTFF assumes a freeze in current spending and a
reduction in capital spending of 8 percent between 2015 and 2018.
Moreover, my authorities are now seeking to contain the growth of the wage bill. They have
taken several measures, in that regard, including incentives for early retirement, recruitment
freezes, and the elimination of an inefficient incentive system. With the assistance of the World
Bank, they will continue the development of the civil service reform that will overhaul the
existing framework from recruitment to administration to compensation.
As regard fiscal reforms, my authorities agree with staff, notably, on the need to enhance
tax administration and reduce tax exemption. They will pursue the BOP reforms, taking into
account the recent recommendations of IMF technical assistance. Tax exemptions will also be
reviewed with the assistance of the World Bank. However, all tax exemptions cannot be
eliminated for contractual and legal reasons. Nevertheless, a first step would be to eliminate tax
exemptions with no legal basis and not to grant new ones. Existing tax exemptions will not be
renewed at expiration.

4

As regards the tax on non-bank wire transfers, my authorities remain of the view that it does
not affect cash transfers and is consistent with proposals in the international arena to tax capital
flows. Furthermore, the removal of this tax still remains a politically sensitive issue as the
proceeds of this tax go to the health insurance fund.
Given the increased vulnerability of the financial sector to macroeconomic shocks according to
the stress tests performed in the 2015 FSAP for CEMAC, my authorities are committed to
strengthen the sector’s stability and pursue greater financial inclusion and deepening. They are
determined to carry out the resolution of the troubled banks. They will particularly focus their
efforts on a successful restructuring of the Post Bank because of its extensive rural branch
network which has contributed to improve financial inclusion. My authorities recognize that
further progress is needed to deepen the financial sector. In this regard they intend to further
reduce barriers to financial services and financial deepening, in particular through setting-up of a
credit registry and adopting new technology innovations in the banking sector. They will
continue to monitor closely the microfinance sector to preserve its soundness.
In conclusion, in spite of the major shock to the economy brought about by the significant fall in
oil prices, Gabon is pursuing its fiscal consolidation efforts in a determined way so as to preserve
fiscal sustainability, while also ensuring that the measures implemented do not have too much of
a negative impact on economic growth. In this regard, they will continue to implement
steadfastly measures that will reduce the fiscal deficit, and focus the investment program on
projects with positive long-term spillovers.
