Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with The Gambia
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Roger Nord and Jan Kees Martijn
July 9, 2010

Discussions were held in Banjul May 7 to 20, 2010, for the 2010 Article IV consultation.
The mission team comprised Mr. Dunn (head), Mr. Reinke, Mr. Vermeulen (all AFR),
Mr. Obiora (SPR), Mr. Tereanu (FIN), and Mr. Tjirongo (resident representative). The team
met with Minister of Finance Momodou Foon, Central Bank Governor Momodou Bamba
Saho, other senior officials, and representatives of commercial banks, the business
community, nongovernmental organizations, and The Gambia’s development partners.
The Gambia’s exchange rate regime is a managed float. It accepted the obligations under
Article VIII, sections 2(a), 3, and 4, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement on January 21, 1993.
In 2008, the authorities notified the Fund that for security reasons, and in line with UN
Security Council resolutions, they imposed some restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. These restrictions still remain in effect.
The Executive Board approved a three-year arrangement for The Gambia under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) on February 21, 2007 in the amount of SDR 14 million
(45 percent of quota). The Executive Board approved an augmentation of SDR 6.215 million
on February 18, 2009 and, at the time of the completion of the sixth review on February 19,
2010, a one-year extension of the ECF arrangement and an additional augmentation of
SDR 4.67 million to a total amount of SDR 24.88 million (80 percent of quota).
The Gambia reached the completion point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative in December 2007, seven years after reaching the decision
point. In addition to debt relief under the HIPC Initiative, The Gambia was approved for the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).
The previous Article IV consultation was concluded on September 8, 2008. The staff report

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Gambian economy has held up well through the global economic crisis, despite sharp
drops in tourism and remittances. However, a deterioration in fiscal discipline and high
levels of costly short-term government domestic debt create risks to macroeconomic stability.
Macroeconomic stability through the global crisis: Real GDP growth averaged 6 percent a
year during 2007–09, while inflation remained in single digits. During the global economic
crisis, growth remained high (5.6 percent) in 2009, as a further rebound in agriculture
cushioned the impact of sharp drops in tourism and remittances. External current account
deficits have widened, financed mostly by foreign direct investment and official loans and
grants. Official international reserves are at a comfortable level, aided by the SDR allocation.
Deteriorating fiscal discipline: As a result of large spending overruns, the deficit in the
basic fiscal balance increased to nearly 2 percent of GDP in 2009, against a budget target of a
small surplus. In early 2010, revenue shortfalls led to additional fiscal slippages. The deficits
have been largely financed by a build-up of costly domestic debt, almost all of which has
been short-term T-bills.
Opportunities and risks from rapid expansion in banking sector: Between 2007 and
early 2010, the number of banks doubled. Financial intermediation has grown substantially,
but intense competition among banks and weaker earnings from crisis-hit tourism and
construction eroded banks’ earnings, credit quality, and capital adequacy. To preserve
solvency, the authorities are phasing in a large increase in the minimum capital requirement.
Exchange rate assessment: The exchange rate remained stable against the U.S. dollar
throughout 2009 and early 2010, with the central bank mostly refraining from market
interventions. Notwithstanding, staff analysis suggests the dalasi was slightly overvalued in
2009. In real effective terms, the dalasi depreciated by about 10 percent by end-year.
Positive outlook, provided that fiscal discipline is restored: As the sectors affected by the
global slowdown are expected to recover only gradually, real GDP growth is projected to
slow down slightly this year, while inflation is projected to remain low. Over the mediumterm, GDP growth is projected to pick up to about 5½ percent a year, as key sectors recover
(tourism, construction), while others (wholesale and retail trade and agriculture) maintain
solid growth. Restoring fiscal discipline, especially in light of high rollover risks of domestic
debt, will be important for achieving this positive outlook.
Performance under the Extended Credit Facility: Through the sixth review, performance
was broadly satisfactory, but recent fiscal slippages led to the postponement of the seventh
review. Performance relative to other end-March 2010 quantitative targets and structural
benchmarks was satisfactory.

4
I. BACKGROUND: ACHIEVING MACROECONOMIC STABILITY,
WHILE DEALING WITH A HEAVY DEBT BURDEN
1.
Following a period of instability during the early 2000’s, the Gambian economy
improved with the implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and important
structural reforms. 1 Key sectors driving growth included construction, tourism, financial
services, and telecommunications, as well as domestically oriented wholesale and retail trade,
which all helped to overcome The Gambia’s diminishing role as a regional entrepôt. In more
recent years, 2007–09, real GDP growth picked up to 6.0 percent a year on average, which
outpaced growth in many countries in the region. 2 Even during the global economic crisis,
real GDP growth remained high (5.6 percent in 2009), as a continuing rebound in agriculture
largely outweighed the impact of a sharp drop in tourism and remittances from Gambians
working abroad—the latter being a leading source of financing for home building. Inflation
has been kept at single-digit rates since 2004, averaging only 4.8 percent during 2007–09.
Reflecting monetary restraint by the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) and steadier food
prices, inflation fell to 2.8 percent in 2009. Also, regulated prices on electricity and fuel
remained fixed during the year (Tables 1–7 and Figures 1–3).
2.
The Gambia still faces a heavy debt burden, despite having received extensive
debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries and Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiatives in late 2007. 3 As of end-2009, external debt stood at 34 percent of GDP, while
total public sector debt was 54 percent of GDP, reflecting significant—and costly—domestic
borrowing. Interest on debt consumed nearly 20 percent of government revenues in 2009
(down from nearly 35 percent a few years earlier), of which just over three-fourths was paid
on domestic debt. Moreover, domestic debt consists almost entirely of short-term T-bills,
which poses high roll-over risks.
3.
The banking sector has expanded at a rapid pace in recent years. Between 2007
and early 2010, the number of banks doubled (to 14), helping to fuel a deepening of financial
intermediation. During this period, credit to the private sector and public enterprises relative
to GDP grew by about 4½ percentage points, to nearly 17 percent of GDP. The new banks
1

The authorities’ policies were supported by a Fund staff monitored program during late 2005–mid 2006, and
an arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF; formerly, Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility)
during 2007–10. At the authorities’ request, the Fund’s Executive Directors approved a one-year extension and
augmentation of the ECF arrangement in February 2010. All semi-annual program reviews under the ECF were
completed in a timely manner, although the 7th review—the first under the extension—has been delayed
because of fiscal slippages.
2

The Gambia Bureau of Statistics revised GDP data using 2004 as the base year. For 2009, the rebased GDP
figure is 30 percent higher than the figure presented in the staff report for the 6th ECF review (Country Report
No. 10/61).
3

Based on the most recent joint World Bank-IMF debt sustainability analysis (Country Report No. 10/61)
completed in January 2010, The Gambia is classified as being at high risk of debt distress.

are mostly foreign-owned, which also generated substantial foreign direct investment. The
situation, however, has strained the CBG’s capacity for banking supervision, while intense
competition among the high number of banks in a relatively small market has contributed to
increased risks to the banking system.
4.
The Gambia has made good progress on improving the quality of life for the
poor, but poverty is still widespread.4 Several Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
are expected to be met, mainly in the areas of education and health (Table 8). The incidence
of poverty, however, fell only modestly to 58 percent in 2008, well above the MDG target.
Although the authorities adopted a target that 25 percent of government revenues should be
used for priority spending identified in The Gambia’s Second Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP II), such expenditures have only accounted for about 20 percent of revenues in
recent years.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK:
WEAKENING FISCAL DISCIPLINE HAS COMPLICATED MACROECONOMIC POLICIES
5.
Since late 2008, fiscal discipline has deteriorated, reflecting both unanticipated
spending and, more recently, revenue shortfalls. In 2009, excessive spending, including
supplementary expenditures that were not financed by additional revenues or fiscal savings,
was the principal reason for the poor fiscal performance. 5 For the year as a whole, the basic
fiscal balance—tax and nontax revenues less total expenditures, excluding foreign financed
capital spending (projects)—was in deficit by 1.8 percent of GDP, compared with the budget
target of a slight surplus (0.1 percent of GDP). During the first five months of 2010, although
spending was roughly contained within budget limits, government revenues fell well short of
expectations. In particular, rising world fuel prices eroded revenues from the fuel tax, which
is the residual after suppliers’ costs and other taxes have been subtracted from fixed retail
prices according to a set formula.

4

The June 2010 Millennium Development Goals Report Card produced by the U.K. Overseas Development
Institute places The Gambia in the top five African countries making progress toward achieving the MDG
targets.
5

See Country Report No. 10/61for a description of some of the main items accounting for the spending
overruns in 2009. To a large extent the overruns reflected insufficient coverage of the budget on items that later
became political priorities or legal obligations, such as government’s buying back shares of GAMTEL after a
failed privatization, and investment in a satellite link by the Gambia Radio and Television Service.

9

6.
Government’s domestic borrowing has had costs for both government and the
economy. The short-term nature of the government’s outstanding domestic debt has meant
that additional borrowing has also increased the roll-over costs of debt. Moreover, in the
highly competitive banking sector, high T-bill yields have raised the cost to banks of
attracting large depositors, which has cut into banks’ profitability and increased risks to the
banking system. Government has also resorted to financing deficits through overdrafts from
the CBG, 6 which has resulted in substantial liquidity injections. As a result, the CBG has
often reacted by suddenly having to mop up unanticipated excess liquidity—causing greater
unpredictability in the money market and T-bill auctions. Overdrafts paying zero interest
have also weakened the CBG’s balance sheet.

6

The statutory limit on direct lending to government by the CBG has been exceeded since November 2008. In
January 2009, the limit was temporarily raised from 10 percent of the previous year’s government revenues to
20 percent, but this too has been continuously exceeded.

Gross international reserves recovered to a comfortable level in 2009 (equivalent
to 6 months of imported goods and services), 7 largely because of the Fund’s SDR
allocation and budget support from the World Bank and African Development Bank
(AfDB). At the same time, the dalasi traded in a tight range against the U.S. dollar (26–
27 GMD/US$), with relatively little intervention by the CBG. In May 2010, the dalasi broke
out of this range, depreciating to just over 29 GMD/US$ by the end of the month, even
though the CBG sold a moderate amount (US$3 million) of foreign exchange. In real
effective terms, the dalasi depreciated by about 10 percent during 2009.
8.
During the last Article IV consultation, concluded in September 2008, there was
broad agreement between the Gambian authorities and Fund staff on the policy agenda,
leading to implementation of some key recommendations (Box 1).
9.
Performance under the program supported by the Fund with an arrangement
under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) worsened beginning in late 2008, with the
emergence of fiscal slippages. Waivers were required for these slippages in two of the last
three semi-annual reviews of the ECF arrangement and the 7th ECF review, based on endMarch 2010 performance criteria (PCs), has been postponed. As noted, spending overruns
were mainly responsible for the fiscal slippages in 2009, while revenue shortfalls were the
principal cause of slippages in 2010. In addition to shortfalls in revenues from fuel taxes, 8
corporate income taxes and other taxes on international trade underperformed. Meanwhile,
non-fiscal PCs were met and there has been good progress on structural benchmarks in the
areas of public financial management (PFM), debt management, liquidity management, and
financial sector development, although there were some delays.

7

Without the SDR allocation (equivalent to US$39 million), the import coverage of gross reserves amounted to
4.7 months of imported goods and services at end-2009.
8

In April, world oil prices exceeded budget projections (based on projections by the Fund’s Research
Department for the October 2009 World Economic Outlook) by just over 10 percent.

Fiscal Issues

Advice

Status

Improve fiscal discipline, including budget
planning and spending controls.

Fiscal discipline has deteriorated during 2009
and 2010.

Reduce domestic debt to regain fiscal space.

There have been setbacks on the path for
reducing the stock of domestic debt.

Reform the fuel price mechanism to allow
pass-through of international prices.

The authorities are considering a reform of the
fuel pricing formula.

Financial Sector
Establish a credit reference bureau to support
financial deepening.

The credit reference bureau became operational
in June 2009.

Improve liquidity management.

Improvements were made, but the recent
deterioration in fiscal discipline has made liquidity
forecasting more difficult.

Maintain restrained monetary policy and a
floating exchange rate in aid of
macroeconomic stability.

Fully met. The authorities limited exchange rate
interventions to attempts to smooth adjustments
in the market determined rate.

Aim for reserves of five months of import
cover.

In part due to the SDR allocation, reserves have
exceeded the target since mid-2009.

Structural measures
Implement civil service reform to attract and
retain qualified employees.

Civil service reform is ongoing. There were some
delays in raising wages due to fiscal pressures.

Governance issues
Accelerate PFM reform and improve debt
management.

Major progress has been achieved in both areas.

Improve macroeconomic data to allow timelier
and better informed decision-making.

Some progress on data quality was achieved with
the publication of quarterly balance of payments
statistics; national accounts data remain weak.

13
Outlook and Risks
10.
The outlook for the Gambian economy is generally positive for both the near and
medium terms. In 2010, real GDP growth is projected to be just over 5 percent, while inflation,
which edged up in early 2010, is expected to remain low (at about 5 percent), despite some
pressures arising from increased fuel prices and the recent depreciation of the dalasi against the
U.S. dollar. Sectors affected by the global slowdown have stabilized, but their growth is expected
to recover only gradually. The external current account deficit, excluding grants, is projected to
narrow modestly relative to GDP in 2010, while the overall balance of payments is expected to
slip into deficit, mainly reflecting a substantial shortfall in grants arising from delays in budget
support from the European Union (EU). Gross international reserves are projected to fall to
US$178 million by the end of the year (equivalent to 5.8 months of imports).
11.
In the baseline medium-term scenario, real GDP growth is projected to pick up to
nearly 5½ percent a year, while annual inflation would remain at about 5 percent.
Projections for GDP growth are driven by the gradual strengthening in the tourism and
construction sectors, as well as continued solid growth in major sectors, such as agriculture and
wholesale and retail trade. The underlying policy framework is anchored upon achieving small
surpluses in the basic fiscal balance (see Table 3) and a prudent monetary stance. Improved fiscal
discipline would allow a gradual reduction in domestic debt (relative to GDP) by about
5 percentage points to just under 16 percent of GDP by end-2015. The external current account
deficit, excluding grants, is projected to narrow gradually to about 12 percent of GDP and would
be financed by slightly rising private capital inflows (foreign direct and other investment) and
fairly steady grants and net official lending (about 3½ percent of GDP a year). To maintain gross
international reserves at a minimum of 5 months of import cover, the CBG would need to start
accumulating reserves beginning in 2013.
12.
As a small open economy, The Gambia is vulnerable to external shocks; but at the
same time some of the major risks to the economy are domestic in origin. Shocks to The
Gambia’s terms of trade or demand for its exports of goods and services significantly impact the
economy. In addition, shortfalls in private remittances and official transfers can create financing
problems. Adverse weather conditions also pose a risk to The Gambia’s predominantly rain-fed
agriculture. Weak fiscal discipline remains a serious risk to macroeconomic stability, especially
as spending pressures build during the run-up to elections in 2011.

14
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: STRENGTHENING FOUNDATIONS FOR
SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION
13.
Discussions centered around core macroeconomic policies to support high
sustainable rates of economic growth and a substantial reduction in poverty, as outlined in
the authorities’ revised PRSP II. The issues included:
•

Achieving greater fiscal discipline to anchor macroeconomic stability;

•

Reforming the tax system to raise and stabilize revenues and to improve the business
environment;

•

Improving public financial management to maximize the effectiveness of government
spending;

•

Strengthening prudential supervision to ensure a sound financial sector; and

•

Maintaining an appropriate exchange rate policy and level of international reserves to
guard against external shocks.

To address the high incidence of poverty, the authorities intend to shift the focus of their poverty
reduction strategy toward increasing economic growth and employment, including through a
stepping up of infrastructure investment. They have initiated preparations of the Program for
Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE), which would succeed PRSP II in 2012. Although
quite preliminary—the first draft of PAGE is scheduled to be completed in early 2011—the
mission discussed concerns about debt sustainability of the new strategy.
A. Macroeconomic Policies
14.
Fund staff emphasized the key role of fiscal policy in a sound macroeconomic
framework to provide a stable foundation for private-sector led growth in The Gambia. In
particular, by reducing the stock of debt and easing pressure on T-bill yields, the government
would reduce the risk of instability inherent in its large rollover requirement of short-term debt,
while also generating substantial fiscal savings, which could be used to help finance priority
government programs. Moreover, consistent implementation of a moderately tight fiscal policy
would facilitate liquidity management and enhance monetary policy. Indeed, by contributing to a
more predictable low-inflation environment, monetary policy could further ease pressure on
T-bill yields, and interest rates more generally in support of greater financial intermediation.
15.
Improving fiscal operations depends upon achieving a reliable stream of
government revenues, together with firm expenditure control. In this regard, revenue
increasing measures and tax reform and PFM reform are critical elements of the macroeconomic
policy agenda. Continuing to improve The Gambia’s track record on PFM reform, including debt
management, could eventually lead to greater access to foreign financing and grants. PFM
reform would also lead to increased value-for-money on government spending, which regardless
of foreign assistance is critical for a resource constrained government.

15
The authorities’ response
16.
The authorities were in agreement with this broad approach in principle, as
evidenced by the policy framework for 2010, although the implementation was derailed by
shortfalls in tax revenue. 9 The government’s budget approved in December 2009, targeted a
near-zero basic fiscal balance for the year, which would have led to a small nominal decrease in
the stock of domestic debt. The authorities also agreed that improvements to monetary and
foreign exchange operations could help reduce T-bill yields further, and initiated efforts to
improve liquidity forecasting and management. In another step to avoid excessive T-bill
issuances, the policy framework called for a “spend and absorb” approach to using donor budget
support, whereby liquidity generated by donor financed government spending would be sterilized
by CBG sales of the corresponding foreign exchange receipts. Finally, over the next couple of
years, the authorities shared the view that the CBG could take steps to enhance competition in
the T-bill auction, which would also tend to drive up prices and push down yields.
Fiscal Policy: Restoring Fiscal Discipline
17.
The mission emphasized that positive results from the envisaged macroeconomic
framework hinge upon consistent implementation of a moderately tight budget. The mission
proposed strong corrective actions, including immediate revenue measures, to get the basic fiscal
balance back on track with the broad objectives of the 2010 budget over the second half of the
year. That is, even though the basic fiscal balance for the year as a whole would slip to a deficit
of nearly 1 percent of GDP, over the second half, spending would be aligned with revenues so
that the basic balance during this period would have a small surplus. During the second half, the
government would curb its domestic borrowing needs, helping to ease pressure on T-bill yields
going forward. If in the end, revenue measures are insufficient to fully recover the recent
shortfalls, spending restraint would be necessary to achieve this objective. In addition, the
mission cautioned that the periodic deterioration of fiscal discipline, typically after the passing of
a program test date, would weaken credibility and the positive effects of a tighter fiscal stance.
18.
The mission encouraged the authorities to pursue a comprehensive tax reform over
the medium term (Box 2).

9

Discussions have continued to re-establish a path for fiscal policy that would lead to a gradual reduction in
government’s domestic debt.

16
Box 2. Fund Staff’s Proposals on Tax Reform
The Gambia’s tax system undermines the business climate, yet revenue is volatile and remains
below the regional average. The Gambia Revenue Authority (GRA) became operational in 2007 and has
made major progress in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of tax collection. Nonetheless,
domestic revenues account for only about 15 percent of GDP. Revenue has also been volatile, partly
because of fixed retail fuel prices (so tax revenues absorb changing import prices) and varying tax
collection priorities. Poor scores on tax compliance and tax payer services are an important reason for the
low ranking of Gambia’s business climate.
The mission urged the authorities to pursue a comprehensive tax reform, centered on the
introduction of value added tax (VAT) by 2013. A broad based VAT has proven to be a reliable
revenue source in many countries throughout the world, including sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover a shift
toward a more consumption based tax system with improved tax payer services could form the
cornerstone to a more enabling environment for business and investment. Preparing for a successful
launch of VAT, however, requires that existing systems and policies are improved. This includes an
overhaul of the small business tax, further roll-out of self-assessment, the establishment of a tax refund
system, and improvements in taxpayer services. Additional steps include the widening the base of the
current sales tax and enforcement of excise taxes on domestically produced goods. Capacity constraints in
tax administration will guide policy choices to ensure that a new tax system can be run efficiently within
the resource constraints faced by the GRA. Also, revenue estimates to be prepared by the GRA will guide
policy decisions on questions such as tax rates and exemptions.
Complementary measures are needed to make the tax system efficient and friendlier to tax payers.
Several “nuisance” taxes—taxes with low revenue potential but high administrative and compliance
costs—could be abolished. This would free resources at the GRA to pursue more revenue-relevant
activities and improve the tax environment for the private sector. Tax payer services could be improved
by the establishment of a tax and customs tribunal.

The authorities’ response
19.
Reflecting their desire to get back on track with fiscal objectives, particularly with
the goal of generating fiscal savings from lower interest costs, the authorities implemented
significant revenue measures following the mission. In June, the authorities raised fuel prices
for the first time in two years to increase the government’s revenue from the embedded residual
tax. The authorities are also considering a revision to the fuel pricing formula, which would
preserve tax revenues, while allowing flexibility in retail prices to reflect the pass-through of
changes in world prices. The authorities were also prepared to apply strict limits on spending for
the remainder of 2010, but due to the severity of the slippage, it appeared unlikely that original
budget targets for the year could be met.
20.
The authorities agreed that the tax system is in need of reform. They also clearly
stated their commitment to the introduction of a VAT in the context of their membership in
ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States). However, they have yet to decide on
the timing of the preparatory intermediate steps to be taken. In particular, they did not commit to

17
broadening the general sales tax in 2011. They did note that the GRA is in the process of
implementing the collection of excise taxes on domestically produced goods, both as a revenue
measure and to meet WTO commitments. They also stressed their long-term goal of reducing
corporate income tax to enhance the competitiveness of The Gambia within the ECOWAS
region.
21.
Delays and uncertainty in budget support grants from the EU (€25 million over
3 years or about 1½ percent of GDP a year) further complicate fiscal operations. In the
absence of the initial disbursement, which was expected in May, the authorities are arranging a
bridge loan from the CBG to cover a portion of the shortfall. However, should the delay be
extended further, the authorities agreed that a corresponding fiscal adjustment would be
necessary to maintain macroeconomic stability. The authorities’ dialogue with the EU—mainly
on political and human rights issues—is ongoing.
PFM reform
22.
The budget process and expenditure control continue to pose major challenges for
the government. Although the authorities have made significant progress with PFM reforms,
and going forward they have embraced a new and comprehensive strategy (adopted by cabinet in
February 2010), budget planning for many ministries is still weak. Substantial expenditure needs
are often not incorporated in the annual budget and sizeable supplementary budgets during the
year have become typical, often putting additional strain on the fiscal balance. The mission
encouraged the authorities to continue progress on the PFM reform, particularly in the area of
expanding the coverage of the budget and strengthening the budget process, while in the nearterm adhering to strict spending limits. 10 The mission also emphasized the need to strengthen the
IFMIS for budget monitoring and execution and internal and external audit procedures. In
particular, in line with the next phase of the Integrated Financial Management and Information
System (IFMIS) project, the mission supported the emphasis to develop the interface for the
CBG by end-2011, which strengthens the tools available for maintaining strict compliance with
spending ceilings.
The authorities’ response
23.
The authorities agreed that expenditure control needed to be strengthened. They
recently announced tight spending limits in an effort to generate basic balance surpluses each
month. The authorities also welcomed Fund technical assistance on PFM issues, notably on
helping to set priorities for the new reform strategy and to strengthen the budget process. The
authorities are keen to pilot a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) based on the
10

A technical assistance mission from the Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department visited Banjul in June. Advice focused
on strengthening the budget process, piloting MTEF, and setting priorities for the PFM reform strategy. Although
coverage of the 2011 budget could be expanded, extensive preparations for more substantive reforms would take
place during 2010-11 and phased-in beginning with the 2012 budget. The mission’s advice was well received by the
authorities.

18
successful case of the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education. With support from the World
Bank and other donors, the authorities are making good progress expanding the coverage of
IFMIS and advances have been made with both internal and external audits of government
expenditures. The authorities aim to have the IFMIS interface for the CBG implemented by the
end of 2011.
Monetary policy and liquidity management
24.
Monetary policy has been effective in helping to control inflation. Targeting broad
money as the intermediate instrument and reserve money as the operational instrument has
generally worked well. The mission, however, encouraged a greater focus on average reserve
money each month, which has a stronger correspondence to broader monetary aggregates than
does the end-period figure. The mission encouraged the authorities to introduce a high degree of
predictability and transparency in liquidity management. For example, a desirable goal would be
the CBG to eventually announce the size of T-bill auctions well in advance, which would enable
banks to better plan ahead and reduce the excess reserves they typically carry. The mission also
highlighted the need to project demand patterns for liquidity, as well as the supply side, again, to
ensure stability in the money market. In addition, the mission suggested that the authorities
explore ways to increase competition in the T-bill auction, such as eventually shifting to a
fortnightly auction. But much preparation would be necessary for these longer-term objectives.
To lengthen the period between T-bill auctions, it would be necessary for the CBG to develop
new short-term instruments, such as REPOs.
25.
Through an analysis on the optimal level of official international reserves for The
Gambia, the mission advised the authorities, that the CBG could forego accumulating
additional foreign reserve assets for the remainder of this year (Appendix 1). In particular,
by explicitly assigning a cost to holding and accumulating reserves and simulating shocks that
reserves would typically be used to guard against, policy makers could make more informed
decisions on holding international reserves. However, given a considerable margin of error in the
model, the mission recommends a cautious approach to adjustments in reserve levels.
26.
To preserve the CBG’s independence and capacity for conducting monetary and
foreign exchange operations, there was broad agreement that a reconciliation of the
government’s accounts in the CBG is in order. The prolonged period of government’s
resorting to advances and overdrafts from the CBG for financing—well beyond the statutory
limit—had compromised the CBG’s balance sheet. As a corrective action, the Ministry of
Finance agreed to securitize its net obligation to the CBG with a fixed-term instrument,
consistent with the rules for such assets under the CBG Act, paying a positive real rate of return
(exact terms are being negotiated between CBG and the Ministry of Finance). Staff suggested
that it would be desirable if at least a portion of the claim on government could be met with
marketable T-bills, which would facilitate the CBG’s introduction of REPO instruments.

19
The authorities’ response
27.
The authorities were in broad agreement with the mission’s proposals. They noted
that information on fiscal operations from the Ministry of Finance was now available through the
new interagency committee and they expect improvements to liquidity forecasting. It is hoped
that during 2011, the CBG would be in position to announce the size and distribution of T-bill
auctions one month in advance. The authorities agreed that the CBG’s stock of international
reserves is currently at a comfortable level, and that the optimization model offers valuable
insights. Nevertheless, they too favored a cautious approach to adjusting reserve levels as
opposed to an active sell-off. They pointed out that T-bill purchases, instead of more reserve
accumulation, would also facilitate the CBGs introduction of REPO instruments.
28.
The authorities welcomed a reconciliation of the government’s accounts at the CBG
and emphasized that transactions with the government going forward should be in strict
compliance with the CBG Act. In particular, any bridge loan to offset delays in budget support
must meet this standard.
B. Financial Sector Policies
29.
As a result of strong competition and a challenging macroeconomic environment,
risks to financial stability have increased. 11 With the entry of seven new banks since 2007,
competition for deposits, loans, and qualified staff has intensified significantly. In 2009 and early
2010, this led to a sharp rise in the cost of funds, provisions, and staff remuneration, respectively.
In addition, the adverse effects of the global crisis on the tourist and real estate sectors (the latter
is largely funded by remittances) amplified the pressures on banks’ earnings and credit quality.
Earnings for the banking sector as a whole turned negative in 2009, partially driven by increased
provisioning for loan losses, although the latter failed to keep pace with the increase in nonperforming loans (NPLs: see Table 1 in Appendix 2). The weakening in earnings and credit
quality put pressure on bank capitalization. With a capital adequacy ratio of 19 percent, the
banking sector at large is still adequately capitalized, but the aggregate number masks a wide
dispersion across banks while NPLs are likely to increase further.
30.
Staff commended the authorities for taking steps to mitigate emerging risks, but
urged them to take further steps. Policy measures introduced by the CBG include: (i) raising
the capital requirement in two steps from GMD 60 million now to GMD 150 million by end2010 and to GMD 200 million by end-2012; (ii) introducing a PCA framework, effective January
2010; and (iii) establishing a Credit Reference Bureau in July 2009. However, additional steps
are needed to strengthen banking supervision. In the short-term, the CBG needs to: (i) step up its
micro-prudential surveillance capacity by addressing resource constraints (e.g., staffing, IT) and
using the PCA framework as a dynamic instrument for allocating supervisory attention; (ii) step
up its macro-prudential surveillance capacity to identify emerging systemic risks early on and
11

For a more in-depth analysis, see Appendix 2, “Banking Supervision in a Rapidly Expanding Banking Sector”.

20
take prompt preventive action accordingly; (iii) closely monitor banks’ capital raising efforts to
ensure that they meet the end-year minimum and that parent banks abide to commitments made;
(iv) resolve weaknesses in the regulatory framework (see Appendix 2); and (v) resolve start-up
problems of the CRB.
The authorities’ response
31.
The authorities agreed with the need for additional steps to enhance the resilience of
the financial system and strengthen banking supervision. Earlier this year, banks were
required to submit plans on how they would raise the resources to meet the first increase in the
capital requirement by the end-2010. The authorities agreed with the mission that requiring
banks to meet a portion of the increase by end-September would provide a meaningful signal on
whether the banks are indeed able and willing to meet their obligations. By identifying troubled
cases in advance, the CBG would have an opportunity to help resolve problems prior to the endDecember action. Furthermore, the CBG is actively seeking new staff to meet critical shortages
in the banking supervision department. Finally, subject to available financing, the CBG intends
to upgrade its IT infrastructure to free-up staff time that is currently lost on manually entering
and processing data.
C. Exchange Rate Assessment and International Competitiveness
32.
A floating exchange rate policy has served The Gambia well by absorbing part of
the shock during periods of adjustment. The CBG has intervened to smooth adjustments to
changes in market conditions, without a predetermined path for the exchange rate, ultimately
allowing the rate to be fully market determined. Since September 2009, the CBG has remained
largely out of the foreign exchange market, entering only to purchase a modest amount of foreign
exchange (about US$2 million) in March 2010 to meet a predetermined reserve target and to sell
modest amounts (about US$1 million and US$3 million, respectively) in April and May for
sterilization purposes. The mission encouraged the authorities to make a clear distinction
between foreign exchange sales for sterilization purposes and those for interventions, where the
former becomes a very predictable process. An analysis by Fund staff suggests that the dalasi
was slightly overvalued during 2009 (Appendix 3).

21
33.
Developments in the REER as well as survey indicators suggest a modest gain in
competitiveness for The Gambia in 2009. The real effective exchange rate depreciated by

Doing Business Index Survey for 2009 and is only behind Ghana and Nigeria among the
countries of the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ). Similarly, The World Economic
Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index for 2009 indicates a slight improvement in The Gambia’s
competitiveness as compared to 2008. Although these survey indicators do not necessarily
reflect developments in the real exchange rate, they are useful indicators of inherent structural
weaknesses that may undermine external stability in the future.
The authorities’ response
34.
The authorities agreed with the mission’s assessment. They agreed that systematically
using foreign exchange sales to sterilize liquidity generated by government expenditures
financed by donors budget support—that is, a “spend and absorb” approach to aid—is
appropriate for The Gambia, but they have yet to develop a separate transparent procedure for
sterilization operations. On the assessment of the dalasi’s alignment with economic
fundamentals, they appreciated the insights obtained from the variety of approaches used, but
noted that the exchange rate is market determined.

12

Senegal is one of The Gambia’s most important trading partners and is similar in climate and thus has the
potential to produce similar agricultural goods. Cape Verde is a strong competitor to The Gambia as a tourist
destination for European travelers while Benin serves as a major re-exporter of goods to Nigeria and Togo whereas
The Gambia is a major re-exporter of goods to Senegal and Guinea-Bissau

22
D. Accelerating Growth
35.
The mission focused its attention on the implications for debt sustainability of the
authorities’ plans for financing large scale public investments. Given that the Gambia’s debt
burden remains high, the mission urged the authorities to adhere with its commitment in the
country’s recently-adopted Medium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) to maintain debt sustainability
by seeking grants and highly concessional loans to finance these investments. The mission also
underscored the point that such new borrowing be channeled toward highly-productive
investments with strong growth potentials, which should be verified through in-depth project
evaluations. The mission cautioned the authorities, however, that further work is needed on the
MTDS. In particular, questionable assumptions underlying the strategy create a bias in favor of
domestic borrowing, which is already quite costly. While the mission agreed with the need to
establish longer-term maturities for domestic debt, it noted that interest on these bonds is very
high in real terms. 13 The mission urged the authorities to first make progress on easing the
pressure on T-bill yields by curbing new borrowing, before issuing significant amounts of
longer-term bonds. Indeed, it will be important to establish greater credibility that the
government aims to reduce its domestic debt over a sustained period to achieve lower yields on
government bonds.
36.
The mission encouraged the authorities to explore private sector participation as an
alternative form of financing. However, many public-private partnerships require a well
developed institutional framework and caution is warranted. Others, such as a joint publicprivate telecommunications venture into an international gateway that opens the door to
competition can be more immediately viable.
The authorities’ response
37.
The Ministry of Economy, National Planning, and Industrial Development was
established in February 2010, with the main objective of developing and implementing
PAGE. The authorities plan to have a number of stakeholders meetings during the drafting
process. The first draft of the PAGE is expected to be completed by early 2011, with the aim of
having a final draft ready for cabinet approval toward the end of the year and implementation
beginning in 2012. The authorities explained that an important element in the PAGE will be a
major stepping-up of infrastructure investment to address the country’s severe shortcomings and
to help create a more enabling business environment. The Ministry will coordinate departmental
investment plans and carry out cost/benefit analysis on all large investment projects. At present,
implementation capacity and institutional details remain to be developed.
38.
The authorities placed much emphasis on maintaining debt sustainability. They will
continue to seek grants or loans on concessional terms to finance designated projects that pass a
thorough cost-benefit analysis. The authorities are open to private sector participation in
13

In February 2010, the government issued 3-year bonds for the first time, but demand was limited.

23
infrastructure investment. Indeed, they recently initiated negotiations with the private telecom
companies to help finance GAMTEL’s connection to a new international submarine fiber-optic
cable expected to be completed in 2012.
39.
The authorities acknowledged the need to exercise caution when issuing longer-term
government bonds, given the high cost. They are seeking technical assistance to help update
the MTDS with more realistic assumptions and risk analysis.
IV. ECONOMIC STATISTICS
40.
Economic data has shortcomings but are broadly adequate for surveillance.
Although substantial technical assistance efforts in recent years led to some improvements, data
accuracy, timeliness and coverage remain weak. The Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBoS), with
the mandate to compile national accounts and price data, suffers from capacity constraints and
has yet to implement several recommendations from previous technical assistance missions in
national accounts. Data compilation at the Ministry of Finance and the CBG, although stronger
overall, also suffer from inadequate resources and technical bottlenecks. In addition,
administrative bottlenecks on sharing information with the Fund has impaired analysis and
policy discussions. As a result, data submissions have been late, incomplete, and require detailed
scrutiny.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
The Gambian economy has performed well in recent years with strong economic
growth and low inflation. Thanks to a rebound in agriculture, the economy was cushioned from
the severe impact of the global crisis on tourism and remittances, which are now expected to
recover gradually. The Gambia has made good progress on several MDGs, but poverty is still
widespread. Staff encourages the authorities to strive to meet the targets for spending on PRSP II
priorities.
42.
The deterioration in fiscal discipline over the past year and a half, threatens The
Gambia’s positive economic performance. The large roll-over of short-term debt implies that
upward pressure on yields could sharply increase interest costs, which already consume one-fifth
of government revenues. The mission welcomes recent measures to increase government
revenues, but strong political will is also needed to ensure that spending is contained. By the
same token, a credible program to reduce domestic borrowing through greater fiscal discipline
could generate substantial fiscal savings.
43.
Recent revenue measures, particularly the increase in fuel prices, would need to be
bolstered to have a sustained positive impact. In the near-term, a new pricing formula for
fuels, which preserves tax revenue and allows the pass-through of changes in world prices is
called for. In addition, embracing a comprehensive tax reform, including intermediate steps to
ensure smooth implementation of a VAT in 2013, would help to build much needed credibility in
the government’s commitment to fiscal discipline over the longer term.

24
44.
There has been good progress on public financial management in recent years, and
the adoption of the new PFM reform strategy bodes well for further progress in the future.
While it will take a couple of years to implement some of the far-reaching measures, such as the
IFMIS interface for the CBG or piloting an MTEF and program budgeting, it will be important to
implement effective nearer-term measures. In particular, to guard against spending overruns and
large supplementary expenditures, the budget for 2011 would be need to fully cover all
ministries and spending agencies from the start. Election year spending pressures, however, will
create some risks for the budget.
45.
Government’s past recourse to central bank overdrafts has weakened the CBG’s
balance sheet. If it persists, it could impair monetary and foreign exchange operations.
Reconciliation of the government’s accounts vis-à-vis the CBG is a positive step, but statutory
limits would need to be observed going forward to safeguard economic stability. In this light,
care is needed with the design of the CBG’s bridge loan to cover the shortfall in budget support
from donors. Should the delay in budget support persist, the loan should be converted to an
interest bearing instrument in line with the CBG Act.
46.
Liquidity forecasting and management are set to improve substantially with the
information sharing on fiscal operations provided by the recently formed interagency
committee. Depending upon improved fiscal discipline, there is good potential for greater
predictability and stability in money market conditions which would facilitate financial
intermediation and could help lower interest rates.
47.
The rapid expansion in the number of banks in recent years has created
opportunities for deepening and access to financial services, but has also increased the risks
to the banking system, especially under the intense competition among banks. The CBG has
appropriately raised the minimum capital requirement, but vigilance and a strong effort to
expand the capacity of banking supervision are also needed.
48.
A floating exchange rate policy has served The Gambia well. Although the dalasi was
deemed to be slightly overvalued in 2009, there has been some adjustment since. The Gambia
has a comfortable stock of international reserves, thanks in part to the SDR allocation. The
authorities’ cautious approach to maintaining reserves is also appropriate.
49.
The authorities have highlighted The Gambia’s need for infrastructure, which is
expected to be a central theme in the next strategy for reducing poverty. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ commitment to maintain debt sustainability and to conduct careful project
evaluations to make sure that investments are highly productive. Staff also welcomes the
authorities’ considering private sector participation in infrastructure investment, particularly
when competitive market situations can be created.
50.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held in accordance with
the provisions of Decision No. 12794 of July 15, 2002, as amended, on consultation cycles. In
the event a review is completed under a Fund arrangement within the next 15 months, the next
Article IV consultation will take place within 24 months.

APPENDIX 1. RESERVE ADEQUACY IN THE GAMBIA
The recent SDR allocation boosted the stock of international reserves in The Gambia to relatively
comfortable levels. Analysis using both traditional indicators and optimization models suggests, however,
the need for a prudent approach to reserve use, conditional on risks to the economic outlook.
At the end of 2009, gross international reserves covered 6 months of imports of goods and services,
with net reserves covering about 5 months of imports. While elevated by historical standards, these
levels are compatible with risks facing a small open economy, with significant import dependence and
absence of export diversification. In addition, the Gambia lacks access to international capital markets and
has relied on remittances, some FDI, and budget support to finance its current account deficit.
Optimization models complement standard metrics for international reserve coverage to yield a
more complete picture of reserve adequacy.1 Indicators such as reserve coverage of imports place The
Gambia relatively well within a regional sample of countries (figure). However, cost benefit analysis,
where shocks to terms of trade and remittances are balanced against an opportunity cost of holding
reserves mainly guided by the high domestic treasury bill yields, allows for more informed conclusions.
In particular, a baseline scenario including a likelihood of shocks to terms of trade based on
historical probabilities together with a loss of aid/remittances suggests an optimal level of reserves
coverage of 4.6 months of imports. However model results are sensitive to parameter calibration. For
example, modifying the baseline by doubling the opportunity cost indicates a lower level of optimal
reserves at 4.2 months of imports. If, in addition, the likelihood of terms of trade shock is increased
(together with a faster recovery from the shock state), the resulting optimal level of reserves is 5.1 months
of imports. Finally, a baseline scenario where real depreciation in the shock state is doubled to 20 percent
suggests optimal reserve coverage of about 7 months of imports.
Notwithstanding model caveats (notably parameter sensitivity and data quality), the combination of
traditional indicators of reserve coverage with model simulations indicates that the current level of
international reserves is broadly aligned with macroeconomic risks faced by a small open economy like
The Gambia.

APPENDIX 2. BANKING SUPERVISION IN A RAPIDLY EXPANDING BANKING SECTOR 1
The entry of seven new banks since 2007 significantly changed the banking landscape. With
14 banks now active in the Gambia, the availability of finance is improving. 2 Credit growth
accelerated from late 2007 and easily outpaced GDP growth and deposit growth. 3 As a result,
credit to GDP rose from less than 10 percent at end-2005 to about 17 percent in the first quarter
of 2010, while the loan-to-deposit ratio increased by 6 percentage points to 47 percent over the
same period (still relatively low in regional comparison). Financial deepening may raise The
Gambia’s growth potential by more effectively channeling savings into productive investments. 4
Moreover, to the extent that the new banks exploit business opportunities in sectors that were
credit constrained, the entry of new banks contribute to private sector development. Indeed,
while coming from a low base, non-traditional sectors like manufacturing and construction seem
to have benefited more from the credit boom than the more traditional growth sectors like
agriculture and tourism (Figure 1).
The quantity effect is more pronounced than the price effect. While the amount of
outstanding loans nearly doubled since end-2006, bank lending rates seem to have come down
only marginally and remain at high levels (about 25 percent). With a shallow corporate loan
segment, a small number of large firms has the bargaining power to negotiate lower lending
rates. However, the majority of firms and households continue to be credit constrained as rising
funding, provisioning, and operating costs prevented banks from significantly lowering rates.
While increased competition narrowed banks’ interest margins, this primarily reflects rising
deposit rates as new entrants in particular compete aggressively for time deposits in a market that
is characteristically concentrated. 5 For those banks that lack a core local deposit base,
competitive biddings for large deposits have significantly driven up funding costs, occasionally
to such extent that deposit rates exceeded T-bill and the CBG’s rediscount rate. As a result, the
monetary policy transmission has been weakened, with virtually no pass-through of the
December 2009 cut in the rediscount rate into lending rates.
Increased competition adds to the challenges for financial stability and supervision. Fierce
competition for deposits, loans and qualified staff led to a sharp rise in the cost of funds,
provisions, and staff remuneration, respectively. Combined with the deterioration in the

Credit growth averaged over 30 percent y/y between 2008q1 and 2010q1, relative to about 17 percent between
2005q1 and 2007q4. Deposit growth for the same time periods averaged 19 and 12 percent, respectively, while real
(nominal) GDP growth averaged 5.5–6 (11–12) percent and 3.2 (5.8) percent.

In 2010, The Gambia ranks 135 out of 183 countries in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business indicator for
getting credit (up from 131 in 2009). The Gambia scores particularly poorly (0 out of 6) in terms of the
subcomponent measuring the depth of credit information (scope, access, and quality), See www.doingbusiness.org.

operating environment stemming from the impact of the global crisis on key sectors like tourism
and construction, this led to an erosion in banks’ earnings and capital adequacy (see figure 1).
Moreover, new entrants cite a relatively lengthy licensing process as the culprit for incurring
large losses in the first year of starting operations (e.g. restrictions on expanding branch networks
and product range, including a six-month exemption from forex transactions). The following risk
factors were identified as the key risks facing the Gambian banking sector:
1. Credit risk: In a bid to increase market shares, 6 banks seem to have relaxed credit standards
at a time when credit quality was already weakening due to a deteriorating operating
environment. This combined effect, is evidenced in a sharp rise in non-performing loan
(NPL) ratios. With NPL growth outpacing credit growth and profitability entering negative
territory in 2009, regulatory capital didn’t keep pace (see figure 1). Even though at
18.7 percent, the aggregate capital adequacy ratio (CAR) far exceeds the regulatory
minimum of 8 percent, the facts that NPLs are likely to rise further and that provisions only
cover 52 percent of NPLs call for vigilance.
2. Liquidity risk: Given high degrees of deposit concentration and price elasticity for large
deposits (from e.g. parastatals and large corporates), banks are vulnerable to a funding
liquidity shock from aggressive, large depositors. Moreover, as most new entrants are
subsidiaries of Nigerian banks, they are vulnerable to a parent bank funding shock should
banking sector conditions in Nigeria deteriorate further. That said, market signals suggest
that large depositors increasingly weigh rates against risks in allocating deposits, with some
banks seeing tentative signs of a flight to quality.
3. Operational risk: Competition for qualified staff significantly raises operational risk
through: (i) rising overhead costs; (ii) a loss of expertise; and (iii) hiring falling short of asset
growth (i.e., credit risk).
This is confirmed by a weakening of Gambia’s financial soundness indicators (FSIs) and
prompt corrective action (PCA) ratings. Gambia’s FSIs deteriorated across the board (Table 1),
with the period averages reported here showing a milder deterioration than end-of-period figures.
The PCA framework that the CBG implemented in 2010 stipulates that supervision should be
incrementally stepped up for higher PCA ratings, with banks that report a rating above three for
any of the PCA components subjected to intensive supervision. In line with the deterioration in
FSIs, the aggregate PCA ratings have worsened in 2009 and early 2010, which holds in particular
for those for asset quality and earnings (see Table 1).
The aggregate numbers mask vulnerabilities at the bank level. As risks tend to be
concentrated in the tail of the distribution, focusing on aggregate FSIs and PCA ratings may not
yield an accurate assessment of the soundness of the banking system. Indeed, Table 2 shows that
6

In the first quarter of 2010, the seven banks that entered since 2007 together accounted on average for nearly
25 percent of total loans, against 18.5 percent of total deposits and 22 percent of total assets. This reflects their
aggressive build-up of market share, which is likely to have caused a weakening in credit standards across the board.

36
aggregate FSIs (i.e., size-weighted averages) mask a wide dispersion of risks across banks.
While the new banks tend to be highly capitalized, some of the oldest and largest banks have
significantly lower CARs. For instance, the CAR of the top 7 banks that account for 86 percent
of banking system assets averages 15.1 percent (ranging from 9.3 to 24.9 percent) against
36.4 percent for the bottom 7 banks (ranging from 17.6 to 51.9 percent). Hence, the shock
absorption capacity of some of the largest banks is significantly lower than the headline CAR
suggests. Similarly, the dispersion in NPL ratios shows that again the older and larger banks
struggle more with loan quality issues than the new banks. However, given that they just opened
shop, it is likely that new banks will face a weakening of their loan portfolio down the road. The
opposite holds for banks’ earnings: 8 of the 14 banks are loss-making, most of which are new
banks. As a result, the majority of banks perform worse than the aggregate ROA suggests.
Looking at individual banks’ PCA rating over time confirms that asset quality and
profitability deteriorated significantly in the past year (Figure 2). Moreover, it supports the
view that credit risk is the key risk facing the Gambian banking system today. While the number
of banks with a PCA rating for asset quality of 5 increased from 4 to 7 between 2009q1 and
2010q1, the percentage of system assets these banks represent jumped from 16 to 65 percent,
meaning that nearly two-thirds of the system should be subjected to intense supervision.
Moreover, risks may be underestimated by weaknesses in the
regulatory framework. These include:
1. Loan classification and
provisioning rule: In line with
international best practices (Basel
Core Principle 9), regulation should
ensure that asset quality is properly
and transparently recorded, as well
as provisioned for, in banks’
financial accounts. 7 The Gambia’s
asset classification and provisioning
rule (see text table) shows
weaknesses in three key areas. First,

stipulates that they "… will have been classified as non-accrual credits ".
Source: CBG

To this end, asset classification and provisioning rules need to be designed such that weakening asset quality can
be detected at an early stage and is provisioned for in line with realistic repayment and recovery expectations. This
typically entails an asset classification rule based on quantitative and more forward-looking qualitative parameters
like delinquency, financial ratios, and business prospects. Assets are typically classified into five categories that
allow assets to be upgraded or downgraded in a granular fashion depending on certain performance parameters.
While no formal consensus on best practices exists, a prudent asset classification rule comprises: (i) standard/current
(no delinquency); (ii) watch/special mention (1-90 days past due); (iii) substandard (90-180 days past due);
(iv) doubtful (180-360 days past due); and (v) loss (> 360 days past due), with a provisioning rate of 1, 5, 20, 50,
and 100 percent, respectively. For a more detailed discussion, see IMF (2006), Financial Soundness Indicators
Compilation Guide, Washington D.C.

37
it relies primarily on the delinquency parameter, with forward-looking judgment on loan
performance only marginally embedded in regulation. 8 Second, it only includes four
classification categories. Loans are classified as current up to 90 days of delinquency, with a
corresponding provisioning rate of only one percent. The classification regime does not
include a watch or special-mention category that typically captures loans that are delinquent
up to 90 days, and require a provisioning rate of 5 percent. Third, the regulation governing
restructured loans is too lenient and allows banks to provision for restructured loans at a rate
of 5 percent only. 9 As restructured loans are not recorded as non-performing, NPLs are
understated and do not accurately reflect loan performance in bank books.
2. Single-borrower limit: The limit is set at 25 percent of capital, but only applies to unsecured
credit. This loophole in CBG regulation, flagged in recent Fund Technical Assistance (March
2010), allows banks to build up concentrated exposures beyond a level that is deemed sound.
Moreover, given weaknesses in collateral registration and enforcement that reduce recovery
rates on secured credit, this distinction is somewhat arbitrary. CBG’s limited capacity to
monitor concentrated exposures was revealed recently by a large borrower defaulting on its
debt that far exceeded the legal limit and hence left the bank concerned undercapitalized.
Against this background, increasingly stretched supervisory resources are cause for
concern. Based on the PCA thresholds, 13 out of the 14 banks should be subjected to intense
supervision for at least one of the PCA components. As the CBG already faced difficulty in
meeting the additional staffing needs for the expansion of the banking sector, the deterioration in
banking sector conditions only adds to the CBG’s supervisory capacity constraints. With 17 fulltime staff in CBG’s Financial Supervision Department (FSD), the number of supervisors per
bank falls short of its targeted minimum of 3 supervisors per bank. That means that there is little
room to step up the intensity of supervision or the frequency of on-site visits consistent with the
PCA framework. 10 To alleviate staffing pressures, CBG intends to hire 4 more staff and – subject
to funding – introduce an IT platform to digitalize regulatory returns.

8

CBG Guideline Paragraph 7: “Non-accrual credits are defined as loans and advances on which interest is not
being accrued due to the existence of reasonable doubt as to the ultimate collectability of principal or interest”.
9

Prudent regulation governing the restructuring of problem assets should ensure that: (i) the debt service and
repayment capacity of the counterparty is restored; (ii) any implicit (NPV) loss is written off; and (iii) the
restructured asset can only be upgraded after debt service has been observed according to the restructured terms for
a specified minimum amount of time and will be classified as non-performing until meeting that criteria.
10

Currently, on-site visits take place at an annual frequency, where CBG decides it to be a full-scale or follow-up
visit based on off-site analysis.

APPENDIX 3. IS THE DALASI ALIGNED WITH THE ECONOMY’S FUNDAMENTALS?
A number of complementary approaches were adopted to assess The Gambia’s exchange rate in order
to provide best estimates for staff’s assessment. These alternative approaches, proposed by the IMF’s
Consultative Group on Exchange Rate Issues (CGER), include the macroeconomic balance approach, the
equilibrium exchange rate approach, and the external sustainability approach. In addition, staff also examined
the sustainability of the current account deficit based on the evolution of key variables in the balance of
payments. These alternative approaches, however, produce different results.
The macroeconomic balance approach suggests that the dalasi may be overvalued. This approach finds
that the country’s current account deficit as of 2009 (14¼ percent of GDP) is higher that its economic
fundamentals would suggest (11¾ percent of GDP). The underlying fundamental driving this result is the large
fiscal deficit for 2009. With an estimated current account norm of about 4 percent, roughly in line with
estimates in past assessments, a depreciation of 11¼ percent would be needed to restore sustainability.
Results from the equilibrium real exchange rate approach suggest an overvaluation of between 5 and
7 percent. Staff adopted a vector error correction mechanism (VECM) to estimate the REER because of the
presence of Cointegration between the REER and its fundamentals. Given the relatively small sample size
(1973—2009), staff also used an autoregressive distributed lag model (ADL) which is better for small samples.
While the VECM indicates that the exchange rate may be overvalued by 7 percent, the ADL suggests a slightly
lower overvaluation of about 5 percent. In both cases, government consumption was the most significant
explanatory variable. To the extent that such consumption is more on non-tradables than tradables, the
exchange rate is likely to appreciate and tend toward being overvalued.
With an underlying current account balance of 11¾ percent, the external sustainability approach
indicates that the Gambia’s long-run NFA would be unsustainable at about 132 percent of GDP. In order
to bring the NFA to sustainable levels of either 50 percent or 70 percent of GDP (associated with different
assumptions on FDI flows); the exchange rate would require a depreciation of between 8 and 11 percent with
corresponding current account deficits of 4½ percent and 6¼ percent of GDP.
On the basis of flows of key variables, the balance of payments seems sustainable. Although the average
trade deficit has increased from about 6 percent (1997–2004) to about 15 percent (2005–09), this has been
offset by a modest increase in the surplus on net services over the same period. More also, the associated
deterioration in the current account balance (from 6 percent to 11½ percent) has been financed by non-debt
creating flows in the capital account including grants, loans, FDI and inflows to commercial banks.
Taken together, these assessments suggest The
Gambia’s exchange rate may be slightly overvalued.
On average, our assessments indicate the Dalasi is
overvalued by about 6½ percent. As in most low-income
countries (LICs), data weaknesses and uncertainties
regarding optimal methodology make it difficult to reach
a conclusive assessment. However, in light of the
consistent agreement of the results from various
methodologies, we conclude that the Gambia’s exchange
rate is slightly overvalued.

Safeguards assessments
Safeguards assessments of the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) were completed in
February 2004, February 2007, and November 2009. The 2007 assessment concluded that the
CBG had initiated steps to improve its safeguards framework and recommended additional
measures to strengthen the CBG’s internal controls and financial reporting practices. The
2009 update report concluded that the CBG had made good progress in implementing
safeguards recommendations. The central bank continued to be audited by a reputable audit
firm and implemented International Financial Reporting Standards. The assessment stressed
that key safeguards should remain in place; most important, the term of the current audit firm
expires after 2009 and a timely appointment of a reputable external auditor for 2010 and
beyond will be needed. The assessment also recommended that the central bank formalize a
framework for extension of credit to government to ensure compliance with the statutory
limits.
Exchange rate arrangement
Until January 20, 1986, the Gambian currency, the dalasi, was pegged to the pound sterling
at a rate of D5 = £1. On January 20, 1986, an interbank market for foreign exchange was
introduced, and since then the exchange rate has been determined by market forces. Effective
June 30, 2002, the exchange rate arrangement of The Gambia was reclassified from
independently floating to managed float with no preannounced path. As of end–December
2009, the midpoint exchange rate in the interbank market was D26.94 per U.S. dollar. The
Gambia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 and maintains an
exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions. The Gambia maintains exchange restrictions for security
reasons, based on UN Security Council Resolutions, that have been notified to the Fund for
approval (EBD/08/86, 08/13/08) under the procedures set forth in Executive Board Decision
No. 144-(52/51).
Last Article IV consultation
The Executive Board concluded the 2008 Article IV consultation (EBS/08/98) on September
8, 2008.
Technical assistance
The Fund has been providing The Gambia with extensive technical assistance in
macroeconomic, fiscal, and monetary areas, and in improving the compilation of

The Gambia: Relations with the African Development Bank
(As of February 18, 2010)
The African Development Bank (AfDB) Group began lending to The Gambia in 1974. As of
December 31st 2009, it had approved 57 operations with total commitments (net of
cancellations) of UA213.82 million (US$332.32 million) in the following sectors: transport
(24 percent); agriculture (22 percent); social (24. percent); public utilities (12 percent); multisector (10 percent); environment (6 percent); and industry (2.0 percent).6 About 85.4 percent
of the Bank Group’s net commitments were made from the resources of the African
Development Fund (ADF), 8.6 percent from the ADB nonconcessional window, and
6 percent from the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF).
As of December 31st 2009, 42 operations had been completed, 2 were cancelled at the
government’s request, and 12 others continue, including 3 multinational projects, all in
agriculture. Implementation of the portfolio is generally satisfactory; it achieved a rating
score of 2.55 (on a scale from 0 to 3) during the Bank Group’s 2009 portfolio review. The
portfolio has a relatively low project-at-risk (PAR) rate of 33.3 percent, which compares well
with the Bank-wide average of 45 percent as indicated in the AfDB’s 2008 Annual Portfolio
Performance Review (APPR).
The AfDB is also a major participant in The Gambia’s enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative program, under which it is to grant debt relief of US$15.8 million
in net present value (NPV) terms (23.6 percent of total debt relief under the program). Of
this, $6.3 million in end-1999 NPV had been paid as interim relief. Additionally, MDRI
relief from the AfDB will yield annual debt service savings (net of HIPC assistance)
averaging US$1.6 million over the 5 years following completion and US$3.9 million over
the remaining 39 years.
The AfDB prepared a Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS) with the World Bank in early 2008 to
cover 2008–11. The JAS is based on two main pillars—(1) strengthening the institutional
framework for economic management and public service delivery, and (2) enhancing growth
and competitiveness and the productive capacity of the economy. The JAS was prepared to
help support the Government’s national priorities through the main channels of budget
support and project finance in the context of growth poles and enhanced service delivery.
The strategy was approved at the World Bank in February 2008 and at the AfDB in March
2008. A Mid-term Progress Report is currently being prepared to assess the implementation
of the strategy at mid course. The JAS is anchored to the Gambia’s Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper PRSP II (2007–2011) and has been supported by both new lending and the
ongoing portfolios of the AfDB and World Bank. Table 2 summarizes the on-going portfolio
of the AfDB while Table 1 below describes some of the recent projects in the portfolio:

Under ADF–10 and ADF–11, The Gambia is a grants-only recipient. Additional resources
can be made available if there is improvement in both performance under the Country
Policy Institutional Assessment (CPIA) and portfolio performance.
The AfDB’s strategy is implemented through both lending and non-lending activities.
Lending activities will comprise project finance and budget support. Non-lending
intervention is designed to strengthen policy dialogue between the government and
stakeholders and focuses mainly on studies, funded through grants, to improve governance,
mainstream gender, enhance efficiency of infrastructure, and improve the energy supply.
The AfDB prepared a Governance Profile for The Gambia in 2007 and has recently
collaborated with the World Bank and the U.K. Department for International Development
(DfID) in the preparation of a study on Civil Service Reform. A Gender Profile is
programmed for 2010.

The Gambia: Statistical Issues
Data provision has shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance. While the
authorities have made some progress in improving the compilation of economic and financial
statistics, substantial shortcomings remain in national accounts, balance of payments, and
external debt statistics. Data reporting to the Fund is somewhat irregular. The country
participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), with its metadata last
updated in the second half of 2003.
The National Assembly passed a new Statistics Act in December 2005 and work began in
June 2006 to implement the plan for transforming the Central Statistics Department (CSD)
into The Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBoS). GBoS is now the single official source for
important macroeconomic series, including balance of payments, national accounts, and price
data, but data output continues to be affected by capacity weaknesses. A mission visited
Banjul in February 2005 to prepare a data ROSC, which was published by the Fund in
November 2005.
Real sector
The main constraints to improving national accounts include inadequate source data due to
low response rates of surveys (manufacturing, trade, and business services industries), as
well as poor quality of external data and inattention to other important sources (such as the
household budget survey, livestock census, and census of industrial production). The GBoS
continues to face human and financial constraints to undertake such surveys and process the
data.
STA missions on national accounts in 2007, 2008 and 2009 assisted the GBoS to implement
the 1993 System of National Accounts methodology and rebase the national accounts to
properly reflect the country’s output levels, economic structure and relative prices. In this
context, STA missions have helped the authorities: (1) process the data collected for the 2004
Economic Census; (2) rebase the GDP series using the results of the 2004 Economic Census;
and (3) improve the GDP estimates by the production approach and begin compiling GDP
series by the expenditure approach. The authorities now publish improved real and nominal
GDP series compiled by the production approach for the period 2004–08 (with a base year of
2004). GDP series by the expenditure approach, while published, are still under review.
However, the data continues to suffer from shortcomings and a number of recommendations
provided by TA missions have not been implemented. In May 2007, the country began
participating in the second phase of the GDDG Project for Anglophone Africa on national
accounts, which is funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DfID).
The authorities have also been recently invited to participate in a follow-up DFID supported
program with a similar focus on macroeconomic statistics, the Enhanced Data Dissemination
Initiative (EDDI), starting in July 2010.
The World Bank has been providing technical assistance to the GBoS to update the consumer
price index (CPI) using the 2003 household expenditure survey to better reflect current
consumption patterns. The GBoS began to publish in early 2007 a new national CPI with
representative expenditure basket as of August 2004.

15
Government finance
The authorities release data on central government transactions with a lag of about four
weeks for both revenue and expenditure. Inadequacies persist in compiling data on an
economic basis and in tracking foreign-financed expenditure. Monthly data on domestic
government financing are available with a delay of six to eight weeks. At a meeting with
STA in October 2007, the authorities expressed interest in technical assistance to facilitate
the migration to GFSM2001. No data are being reported for publication in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook or in the IFS.
Monetary data
The Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) has improved data reporting to the Fund, but
sometimes the reports are delayed. Following earlier STA TA missions in April–May 2006
and April-May 2008, another follow-up mission in February 2010 signaled CBG’s poor
progress in implementing earlier recommendations for compilation of monetary and financial
statistics. This is mainly due to a delay in the reform of the source data for the central bank
and other depository corporations (ODCs). A bridge table for compiling the standardized
report forms (SRF) for the central bank and a new report form for ODCs designed in the
2008 mission were not implemented. Therefore, the 2010 mission redesigned bridge tables
that could automatically generate the SRFs for the central bank and ODCs from the data that
the CBG has used for its operational work. As a result, the CBG should now be in a position
to compile the SRFs and submit the SRF-based monetary data to the Fund for publication in
International Financial Statistics (IFS). Finally, the mission recommended the CBG to collect
a wider range of interest rates, including lending and deposit rates by type of currency
denomination of loans and deposits.
External sector statistics
Despite significant improvements, balance of payments statistics continue to be affected by
shortcomings. These include modest delays in the collection of trade, customs, and tourist
arrival data; outdated methods of estimating re-export trade; poor data on capital flows; lack
of a register of firms and establishments engaged in external transactions; poor classification
of balance of payments data; and lack of consistent methodology. Institutional weaknesses
have also been a major impediment to improving statistics. Official grant and loan
disbursements and repayments are generally well recorded, but there are some gaps in project
disbursements.
The CBG produces balance of payments statistics according to the Balance of Payments
Manual, 5th edition (BPM5). These statistics are published in International Financial
Statistics (IFS) and in the 2007 IMF Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY
2007). The CBG has been compiling quarterly balance of payments statistics through a Fundadministered technical assistance project funded by DfID. The most recent data available are
for the last quarter of 2009.

16
With DfID assistance the CBG conducted an enterprise survey in March 2006 to collect data
for the international investment position. In April 2006, the CBG also initiated a survey
funded by the World Bank to collect data on selected components of the current account.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on The Gambia
August 19, 2010
This statement provides an update to the staff report for recent developments in the
areas of fiscal performance, exchange rate policy, and inflation. These developments do
not alter the overall thrust of the staff report, although the significantly smaller-thananticipated fiscal slippage in 2010:H1 is a welcomed positive outturn.
1.
The government achieved a surplus of GMD 41 million in the basic fiscal balance
during the month of June—a significant turnaround from the substantial deficits incurred
during April and May. As a result, the shortfall in the basic fiscal balance during 2010:H1,
relative to the budget target, was about GMD 160 million (0.6 percent of GDP), rather than
the estimated shortfall of about GMD 270 million (nearly 1 percent of GDP) underlying the
fiscal projections for 2010 in the staff report. The fiscal slippage during 2010:H1 was the
result of revenue shortfalls, while government spending was held to about 95 percent of
budgeted allocations.
Staff welcomes this improved performance. Continued progress on strengthening the fiscal
performance would be key to achieving the policy objectives of easing pressure on T-bill
yields and generating fiscal savings.
2.
In June, the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) intervened fairly heavily in the
foreign exchange market. 1 Since early July, however, the CBG has refrained from further
interventions. After a brief appreciation in late June, the dalasi has since depreciated to its
previous level against the U.S. dollar (about 29 GMD/USD) on the interbank market.
Despite the interventions, the CBG maintains an ample stock of international reserves. As of
end July, gross reserves stood at US$163 million (5.3 months of imports). However, with the
recent decline in reserves, the CBG may need to move up its eventual accumulation of
reserves to maintain them at the target level of 5 months of imports, should imports grow as
projected by staff.
3.
After holding steady at 4.1 percent in June, the 12-month inflation rate increased to
6.2 percent in July, mainly because of a sharp price increases in various food staples,
particularly sugar. Transportation prices also rose substantially, reflecting the full impact of

In late June, the Office of the President announced the introduction of new administrative procedures for
international transactions in U.S. dollars and stated that the dalasi’s “natural” exchange rate was 27 GMD/USD.
The procedures were soon removed and it is unclear whether they were ever actually put into effect. Staff is
investigating whether these actions may have resulted in foreign exchange restrictions or if there were any other
consequences of these announcements, although it appears that the market has remained orderly overall.

the previous month’s increase in regulated fuel prices. Still, non-food inflation increased only
slightly to 2.9 percent in July. As a result, inflation for 2010 as a whole may exceed the
projection in the staff report (5 percent) by a small margin.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
The Gambia
On August 25, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Gambia. 1
Background
Despite challenging global, and by extension domestic, conditions, the Gambian economy has
performed well in recent years. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by an average of
6.0 percent a year during 2007-09, up from an average of 3.6 percent during 2004–06. Even
during the global economic crisis in 2009, real GDP growth was strong at 5.6 percent led by a
continued rebound in agricultural production, which helped cushion the impact of sharp drops in
tourism and remittances from Gambians working abroad. Throughout this period, inflation was
held to low single-digit rates, as the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) generally exercised
monetary restraint. In 2009, inflation fell to 2.8 percent. Inflation edged up marginally in early
2010 (4.1 percent in May), but is expected to remain low (about 5 percent) for the year as a
whole.
Despite having received extensive debt relief in late 2007, The Gambia still faces a heavy debt
burden. As of end-2009, external debt stood at 34 percent of GDP, while total public sector debt
was 54 percent of GDP, reflecting substantial—and costly—domestic borrowing. Interest on
debt consumed nearly 20 percent of government revenues in 2009, most of which was paid on
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

domestic debt. Moreover, domestic debt consists almost entirely of short-term T-bills, which
poses high roll-over risks.
Since late 2008, fiscal performance has deteriorated, which led to more domestic borrowing and
upward pressure on T-bill yields. In 2009, the basic fiscal balance was in deficit by nearly
2 percent of GDP—compared to a small surplus targeted in the budget. Spending overruns,
including supplementary expenditures that were not financed by additional revenues or fiscal
savings, were the main cause of the fiscal slippage. In the first half of 2010, fiscal performance
suffered from revenue shortfalls, while spending was contained within budget limits. In large
part, the shortfalls were due to rising world fuel prices that eroded revenues from fuel taxes. In
June, fuel prices were raised, which has helped to restore revenues.
The number of banks in The Gambia has doubled to 14 since 2007, contributing to a rapid
expansion of much needed financial services. But it has also strained the CBG’s resources for
banking supervision. Moreover, competition among the high number of banks in a relatively
small market has added to risks to the banking system, especially in the current environment
with weaknesses in key sectors of the economy. This is evidenced in a recent weakening of
credit quality, profitability, and capital adequacy.
The Gambia’s external current account deficit, excluding official transfers, has widened in recent
years. In 2009, a recovery in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows—in part due to the entry of
foreign banks—and increased donor grants, together with the Special Drawing Rights
(SDR)allocation more than financed this deficit, allowing a substantial buildup in official reserves
to a comfortable level of 6.4 months of imports by end year. In 2010, however, delays in
expected disbursements of donors’ budget support has weighed on the overall balance of
payments.
The Gambia has made impressive progress implementing structural reforms, particularly in the
areas of public financial management, debt management, and financial sector development.
Good progress has also been achieved toward meeting several of the Millennium Development
Goals, most notably in health and education. However, poverty is still widespread.
The Gambia’s macroeconomic policies have been supported by an arrangement with the IMF
under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) since February 2007. The program’s objectives draw
on the strategic priorities set out in The Gambia’s second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
which include: (i) macroeconomic stability and effective management of public resources; (ii)
pro-poor growth and employment through development of the private sector; and (iii) improved
provision of basic services. While the performance under the ECF has been broadly
satisfactory, recent fiscal slippages have led to the postponement of the seventh review.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the Gambian economy has performed well through the global
crisis with relatively strong growth and low inflation, despite a sharp drop in tourism and
remittance receipts. Directors observed that the outlook for the economy is generally positive
provided a sound macroeconomic policy framework is maintained. They also stressed the

3
importance of continued progress toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
and targets on poverty reducing expenditures.
Directors expressed concern about the fiscal slippages over the past year and a half. Further
slippages would pose major risks to the economy by increasing the already high cost of
domestic debt, especially given the large roll-over needs of the mostly short-term debt. Directors
therefore welcomed the recent turnaround in the basic fiscal balance and called for continued
strengthening of fiscal performance to anchor macroeconomic stability and reduce the debt
burden. This could generate significant fiscal savings which could be directed to other spending
priorities.
Directors noted that revenue shortfalls have been the main source of fiscal slippages in 2010.
They commended the authorities for recent revenue measures, including the increase in fuel
prices, and encouraged them to further widen the tax base. Directors strongly supported tax
reform centered around the introduction of a VAT by 2013, which would bolster revenues and
improve the business environment over the medium term. To achieve a smooth transition to a
VAT, it would be necessary to adopt appropriate tax policy and revenue administration
measures in the 2011 budget.
Executive Directors commended the authorities for actively pursuing public financial
management reforms. They particularly welcomed the plans for more effective budget
procedures and efforts to strengthen execution. Ensuring that the 2011 budget fully covers all
ministries and spending agencies would be critical for guarding against spending overruns.
Directors supported recent improvements in debt management and stressed the importance of
debt sustainability as the guiding principle for future financing options to address infrastructure
needs.
Directors emphasized that a healthy central bank balance sheet provides a solid foundation for
monetary policy. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to observe statutory limits on
government overdrafts. Directors agreed that a floating exchange rate policy has served The
Gambia well. They encouraged the authorities to allow the exchange rate to adjust to ensure
sustainable external balances and preserve competitiveness.
Directors observed that rapid expansion of the banking system creates opportunities for the
economy, but also carries risks. They supported steps to improve bank soundness, notably the
timely increase in the minimum capital requirement, and stressed that building capacity in bank
supervision should be given high priority.

Statement by Samuel Itam, Executive Director for The Gambia
August 18, 2010
Introduction
1.
My Gambian authorities appreciate the Fund Executive Board and Management for
their continued engagement and support. They are grateful for the productive policy dialogue
and counsel proffered by the Fund Mission during the Article IV consultation discussions.
The authorities agree broadly with the staff report. Despite some misgivings, my authorities
consent to the publication of all the related staff papers.
Recent economic developments
2.
The Gambian economy has performed well in recent years. During 2007-2009, the
economy grew on average by 6 percent per annum on account of sound macroeconomic
policy implementation. Despite the adverse effects of the global financial crisis, real GDP
growth remained fairly strong at 5.6 percent in 2009, led by the continued rebound in
agriculture. Consumer price inflation declined to 2.8 percent in 2009, due largely to the tight
monetary policy stance of the central bank and the relatively steady prices for food and fuel.
Despite a slight acceleration in early 2010, inflation has remained low around 4 percent. The
increase in government expenditure offset the relatively strong revenue performance in 2009,
resulting in a moderate fiscal deficit and an increase in domestic borrowing requirement
during the year. Consequently, in spite of a stronger-than-expected fiscal performance during
the first three months of 2010, the target on the cumulative (12 month running) basic fiscal
balance for end-March 2010 was exceeded by 0.3 percent of GDP.
3.
The external current account deficit, excluding official transfers, narrowed in 2009
despite a marked decrease in tourism receipts and inward remittances. The improvement
largely reflected the decline in global food and fuel prices and the recovery of re-export
trade. Helped by the IMF SDR allocation and budget support from the World Bank and the
African Development Bank, gross international reserve reached the equivalent of 6.4 months
of import cover at the end of 2009.
Program performance
4.
All the performance criteria for end-2009 and end-March 2010 were met, with the
exception (as indicated earlier) of the basic fiscal balance. Expenditure overruns were the
main cause of the fiscal slippage in 2009. As explained during the sixth review, the fiscal
slippage reflected the increase in capital expenditure as a result of my authorities buying back
Gambia Telecommunication Company’s (GAMTEL) shares after a failed privatization and
government purchasing a satellite link by the Gambia Radio and Television Services. These
additional capital expenditures could not have been avoided, as The Gambia would have lost
its broadcast assets due to an under-performing investor. Moreover, the expenditures were
guided by legal obligations and not a reflection of deterioration in fiscal policy.

2
5.
Underperformance of revenue was responsible for missing the target on the basic
balance in 2010. This underperformance was mainly due to over optimistic revenue
projections. The revenue from fuel taxes, the difference between the fixed retail price of
petroleum products and the suppliers’ costs, decreased significantly in light of the
unexpected increase in world oil prices during the first half of the year. Also, the impact of
the reduction in the corporate tax rate (from 35 percent to 33 percent) to bring in more
businesses under the tax net and spur economic activity was optimistic. Furthermore, the
slower-than-expected recovery in Europe, which is a major trading partner as well as a major
source of tourism to The Gambia, adversely impacted tourism and related activities. As a
result, though expenditures were largely restrained, the target on the basic fiscal balance was
missed. In light of these developments, my authorities are working closely with staff to
prepare more realistic projections for the rest of 2010 and will be requesting the Executive
Board to consider a modification of the fiscal target in due course.
Fiscal policy
6.
The authorities have identified corrective actions for the fiscal slippages to help get
the basic balance back on track as well as reduce the outstanding stock of domestic debt. As a
result of these actions, new issuance of treasury bills will be less than maturing issues, which
would substantially ease pressure on yields and ultimately lead to savings from lower interest
expenses on domestic debt. As these savings are realized, resources would then be directed to
other priority areas to accelerate growth and reduce poverty.
7.
To achieve the basic balance target, my authorities have implemented new measures
in June 2010 that will increase revenues from excise and fuel taxes. These include a reform
of the mechanism for determining domestic fuel prices to allow for the full pass through of
changes in world oil prices and exchange rate movements. On the expenditure front, the
authorities have frozen non-priority hiring in the public sector, restricted travel of
government officials and limited business class travel to only those at the ministerial level
and above. Additionally, a special directive has been issued to all ministries, departments and
budgetary agencies to curtail non-essential expenditures. In any event, if supplementary
expenditures are necessary, equivalent revenue sources or savings from cutbacks in other
expenditure areas will have to be identified. Even with these further constraints, my
authorities will continue to allocate at least 20 percent of revenues to priority sectors for
poverty reduction.
External debt management
8.
The focus of my authorities’ external debt management strategy will now shift to
securing the necessary funding for national development while maintaining medium- and
long-term debt sustainability. To achieve these objectives, government will (i) secure debt
relief committed under the HIPC initiative from non-Paris club creditors through an intensive
campaign in cooperation with other former-HIPCs, major OECD governments and
international organizations including OXFAM; (ii) continue to mobilize concessional
financing for social and poverty reduction financed projects while accommodating less
concessional loans for high-return capital intensive projects in sectors such as

3
telecommunications, electricity, water and roads; (iii) link the medium term debt strategy
with the overall national aid mobilization strategy through adherence to the Paris Declaration
on aid quality and effectiveness; and (iv) reduce its aid dependence over the long term
through reforms to increase domestic revenue effort and improve PFM and competitiveness.
The development of the strategy would be supported by in-house capacity building to
regularly analyze the cost-risk trade-offs and monitor implementation.
Monetary and financial sector policies
9.
The current monetary framework has served the country well in achieving price and
exchange rate stability. Given the recent increase in inflationary pressures, the Central Bank
of The Gambia (CBG) will maintain the tightened monetary policy stance.
10.
My authorities concur with staff that improving the predictability and transparency of
liquidity management will enable commercial banks and other investors in government
securities to plan and better manage their portfolios. To this end, as liquidity forecasting
improves with the coordination of the interagency committee, the central bank will be able to
announce regularly auction sizes one to two months in advance. By mid-2011, with the
development of REPO instruments, the CBG would move to a fortnightly auction schedule.
Such innovations would assist to increase competition in auctions and help lower interest
rates.
11.
To correct the government borrowing from the CBG over and above the statutory
limit, the CBG and government have reconciled the government’s net position.
Government’s net liability to the CBG was transformed to a 30-year Government Bond at an
interest rate of 6 percent per annum. The principal repayments of this bond will be in two
equal semi-annual payments each year during the life of the bond. This has resulted to the
CBG compliance with the statutory requirement of lending to government not exceeding 10
percent of the previous year’s tax revenue. In addition, to help mitigate the impact of the
temporary shortfall in the 2010 budget, as a result of delays in budget support, the CBG has
provided a bridge financing loan to government. The terms of this facility include interest of
6.5 percent per annum and full repayment of the credit upon receipt of the initial
disbursement of the budget support.
12.
The banking sector is relatively sound and competition has been increasing.
Generally, the banks are profitable and adequately capitalized. The risk-weighted capital
adequacy ratio was 18.7 percent in March 2010, higher than the minimum requirement of 8.0
percent. All banks met the minimum capital requirement. Non-performing loans as a ratio of
gross loans deteriorated from 12.0 percent in December 2009 to 16.9 percent in March 2010.
However, all loans were adequately provisioned.
13.
The CBG continues to place emphasis on the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)
framework with continuous assessment of banks in line with international best practices. This
is geared towards promoting a safe and sound financial system by ensuring that corrective
actions are taken in response to deteriorating performance of a bank. Additionally, a
corporate governance framework has been introduced to better govern the operation of banks

4
and improve the governance in the banking sector. Furthermore, significant progress has
been registered in setting up of the necessary framework for the implementation of a riskbased supervisory approach to keep pace with the rapidly expanding banking industry. CBG
also plans to introduce an electronic data reporting system to ease the reporting burden on
banks and, at the same time, allow supervisors more time to conduct quality checks on the
data.
Exchange rate policy
14.
The central bank will continue to maintain the current floating exchange rate regime,
which has served the country well, intervening in the market only to preserve orderly market
conditions. While mostly abstaining from entering the market for foreign exchange, the CBG
will, however, carry out a limited amount of foreign exchange sales for sterilization purposes
to mop up liquidity generated by donor financed spending. The Gambia subscribes fully to
Article VIII and currently has no restrictions on the import and exports of capital.
Repatriation of capital by both residents and nonresidents can be made in any currency.
Conclusion
15.
My Gambian authorities remain mindful of the importance of prudent fiscal and
monetary policies to achieve and maintain macroeconomic stability. In this regard, they
regret the recent fiscal slippages and have accordingly implemented appropriate revenue and
expenditure measures that will help achieve modest fiscal surplus as the key to reduce the
debt burden and related interest expenses. My authorities appreciate the continued support of
Management and the Executive Board and development partners in realizing their
development objectives.
