ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with the Islamic Republic of
Mauritania
Approved by Amor Tahari and Anthony Boote
May 6, 2005


Discussions for the 2005 Article IV consultation were held in Nouakchott, from
January 8 to 22, 2005, and at headquarters from March 12 to 14, 2005. Staff met with
the new economic team appointed in July 2004—the minister of economy and
development, the minister of finance, the minister of mines and industry, the governor
of the Central Bank of Mauritania, and other senior officials.



The mission consisted of Messrs. Le Dem (head), Callier (Resident Representative),
Iradian, Wieczorek (all MCD), Hauge and Frerejacque (all FIN), Tazi (FAD),
Ms. Fisher (STA), and Ms. Albertin (PDR). World Bank staff participated in several
meetings.



Due to the large fiscal and monetary slippages that went unreported by the authorities
until September 2004, the program supported by a three-year Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, approved by the Executive Board on
July 18, 2003, was found to be off-track and on November 7, 2004, at the authorities’
request, the arrangement was canceled.



In addition to the standard Article IV consultation topics and the challenges that
Mauritania faces in preparing for oil revenues (expected to begin in 2006), this report
covers important data accuracy issues, which impeded the assessment of economic
developments and the formulation of policy advice.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Mauritania’s program, supported by a three-year PRGF arrangement approved in
July 2003, went off track as a result of large extrabudgetary expenditures in 2003–04,
which remained unreported by the authorities until September 2004. The resultant
cumulative fiscal deficit over 18 months starting in January 2003 exceeded 50 percent of
annual GDP and led to a drawdown of official reserves to less than a month of imports.
Important structural reforms stalled or backtracked, and the deterioration in the functioning
of the foreign exchange market was accompanied by a rise in the parallel market premium. In
the event, the program was found to be irretrievably off-track, and the initial disbursement
was found to be noncomplying. In November 2004, the authorities voluntarily repaid the
first and only disbursement and, at their request, the arrangement was canceled.
Data issues remain of primary concern. The safeguards assessment conducted in 2004
identified critical vulnerabilities in the Central Bank of Mauritania’s (BCM) financial
reporting. The external audit of BCM’s end-2002 balances was unable to reliably confirm
about 85 percent of its foreign reserves and previous audits made similar qualifications. The
authorities maintain that all end-2002 and prior data reported to the Fund were accurate.
However, the historic series are hard to reconcile with the revised 2003–04 data, most
notably for the inexplicable shifts in income velocity of money and nongovernment savings.
Following a government reshuffle in July 2004, a new economic team took actions to
tighten fiscal and monetary policies. Nevertheless, inflation has been on the rise and
official reserves have continued to decline. Given the authorities’ preference for maintaining
a stable exchange rate, policy discussions focused on the need for further fiscal and monetary
tightening during the first half of 2005 to safeguard the precarious external position.
The external outlook is expected to improve markedly later in the year, and substantially so
in 2006 with the coming on stream of oil revenues. In view of the deficiencies in public
expenditure management, a transparent and efficient management of oil revenues will
present a major challenge, and preparations for the oil era need to be accelerated.
Steps are being taken to resume the structural reform agenda with technical assistance of
the Fund and World Bank staffs, including in the public expenditure management and
financial sector areas. A new PRSP will be submitted to parliament by end-2005.
The authorities requested the use of the Fund’s emergency assistance for natural
disasters (EAND), on account of the locust invasion and the drought in 2004/05 crop year,
and expressed interest in a staff-monitored program (SMP) to help release donors’
suspended budget support and pave the way for a new PRGF arrangement. In addition to the
external audit of the end-2004 central bank financial statements, staff reiterated the need for
independent verification of the end-2003 central bank financial statements and full disclosure
of the information available to confirm the official reserves for 2001–02, before the request
for the use of Fund resources can be considered.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Mauritania had a long-standing good relationship with the Fund. During the
period 1989–2002, Mauritania completed four programs supported by the PRGF and its
predecessor the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF). Mauritania was among the
first countries to reach the completion point under the enhanced Initiative for Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC), in May 2002.
2.
In July 2003, a new PRGF arrangement was approved by the Board. However,
in September 2004, the authorities acknowledged substantial inaccuracies in data
reported since early 2003. The new economic team that was appointed in July 2004
revealed to staff that sizable policy slippages had occurred. In the light of these revelations,
the PRGF-supported program was found irretrievably off-track, and misreporting on the
implementation of a prior action for the approval of the arrangement rendered the first
disbursement noncomplying. On November 4, 2004, the authorities voluntarily repaid the
sum of SDR 0.92 million corresponding to the noncomplying disbursement, and, at their
request, on November 7, 2004, the 2003 PRGF arrangement was canceled.
3.
In the event, most recommendations of the previous Article IV consultation
(which was concluded on July 18, 2003 jointly with the approval of the PRGF
arrangement) were not implemented. Among others, the authorities failed to improve the
operation of the foreign exchange market, while transparency and governance in the public
sector deteriorated. On balance, there was also no improvement in public expenditure
management, which Directors thought essential for enhancing efficiency and ensuring the
success of the poverty reduction strategy. The sizable fiscal slippage in 2003–04 points to the
lack of progress in this area, although steps have been taken recently to improve budget
preparation and execution. The government’s intentions for the efficient and transparent use
of the forthcoming oil revenues (to start in early 2006) have been shared with staff, as
recommended by Directors, although preparations need to accelerate.
4.
The political tensions that persisted after the failed military coup of June 2003
have recently abated. The incumbent president’s large victory in the November 2003
elections was widely contested. Trials against opposition candidates for the conspiracy to
overturn the constitutional order and the reported mutinies of military officers further
clouded the political climate. However, in February 2005, the lenient outcomes of the trials
were welcomed at home and abroad as a sign of conciliation.
II. DATA REVISIONS AND ISSUES

The safeguards assessment conducted in 2004 identified critical vulnerabilities in
the financial reporting of the BCM.1 Opinions of the external auditor on end-2000 and

end-2001 financial statements of the BCM were heavily qualified, largely due to systemic
weaknesses in controls and accounting deficiencies. Concerning the end-2002 financial
statements, the auditor was unable to reliably confirm about 85 percent of the reported level
of foreign reserves, and qualified its opinion with regard to currency in circulation and
claims on the government (Box 1).

criteria as of end-September 2003 and
most other quantitative program targets
had been met. In reality, according to the revised data provided by the authorities,
exceptionally large program slippages occurred in 2003–04. The revised fiscal, balance of
payments, and monetary data, including data on commercial banks, revealed that the main
program parameters were missed by large margins. The authorities explained that in
early 2003, they had to initiate an off-budget emergency plan (mostly in-kind transfers to
protect vulnerable segments of the population from the effects of an unusually severe
drought2) as well as off-budget security-related outlays, which subsequently spiraled
following the failed military coup in June 2003. They also admitted that the parallel
weakening of budgetary oversight resulted in additional extrabudgetary expenditures.

2

Social expenditures in 2003 reportedly exceeded by nearly two-thirds the target set in the budget, and also was
largely above the budget target in 2004 (Table 2a).

-6-

Box 1. Safeguards Assessment and Status of Recommendations
The safeguards assessment carried out in January 2004 identified critical vulnerabilities in the BCM’s
financial reporting and internal controls, as well as severe vulnerabilities in its internal audit mechanisms and
legal structure. On the financial reporting, staff learned that about 85 percent of the official reserves at end2002 could not be reliably confirmed by the external auditor. The principal recommendations proposed by
staff were to:
•

Conduct a special external audit of the BCM’s foreign reserves to confirm the level and availability
of foreign reserves reported to the Fund at end-December 2003.

•

Publish future audited financial statements and audit reports in a timely manner.

•

Adopt internationally recognized accounting standards.

•

Modify the central bank law to grant fixed-term mandates for the governor and the other members
of the Board.

While the BCM has indicated that accounting problems preclude an external audit of the BCM’s foreign
reserves for end-2003, most other recommendations have been or are being implemented:
•

The central bank conducted an internal audit of official reserves as of end-August 2004, which
confirmed data communicated to staff in September 2004. An agreement was reached with the
treasury to consolidate the government claims and liabilities with the BCM, including the net
cumulative foreign exchange losses. The end-2004 accounts have been corrected in line with past
recommendations of the external auditor.

•

The Board of the BCM decided to carry out the external audit of the central bank’s financial
statements within five months of year-end from 2004 onward, but results are not to be published at
this stage.

•

The BCM Board also passed resolutions facilitating the future adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and establishing a new internal audit function. The transition to IFRS,
improvements in internal controls, and the development of a reserves management function will,
however, require long-term external technical assistance.

•

The BCM also adopted a recommended procedure for selection and rotation of an external auditor.

7.
The authorities proceeded with further data revisions in the ongoing effort to
clean the end-2004 balance sheet of the central bank. Revisions included writing off the
previously disputed foreign assets, reclassifying as foreign liabilities a number of items that
were previously reported as domestic liabilities, and correcting the stocks resulting from the
exchange rate-related valuation changes. Some revisions have been made retroactively;
others have been applied to the end-2004 financial figures only, while the BCM indicated
that a comprehensive treatment would require a retroactive correction over a longer period
(up to 20 years).
8.
Concerns remain with regard to the accuracy and consistency of key
macroeconomic data in 2003 and prior years. The main issues relate to the levels of

-7-

official reserves, the timing and composition of extrabudgetary spending, and the causes of
large discrepancies between commercial bank data reported by the central bank and those
published by the commercial banks, with the latter implying higher levels of monetary
aggregates. Discussions with the authorities left these three data issues unresolved:
•

Despite the lack of external confirmation for the 2000–02 official reserves data
reported by the central bank, the authorities maintain that most data prior to 2003
remain accurate.3 However, no evidence to support the authorities’ affirmation was
made available, and critical documentation on official reserves appears to have been
lost by the central bank and the external auditor.4

•

Details on some extrabudgetary spending (including on UM 30 billion, equivalent to
a quarter of off-budget spending in 2003) are not available. The extent to which these
expenditures have been pre-authorized by the then finance minister and approved by
the procurement committee remains unclear.

•

The authorities insist that data reported by commercial banks in their annual reports
(even if formally audited) are subject to reservations, and should not be seen as more
reliable than those reported by the central bank. However, the September 2004 BCM
revisions to commercial bank data have reduced the discrepancies in the 2003 data
between the two sources.

9.
The authorities have already undertaken steps to improve the quality of
financial and fiscal data reporting. In parallel with the cleaning up of the central bank
balance sheet, the BCM intends to submit all commercial banks to external audits of their
annual financial statements by reputable international firms, starting with their end-2005
accounts. At the finance minister's request, a FAD technical assistance mission is reviewing
budget accounting and reporting procedures. Also, Mauritania began participating in the
Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in September 2004.
10.
Staff stressed to the authorities that future access to Fund resources requires
their full cooperation in bringing the ongoing data verification process to a satisfactory
conclusion. Responding to the authorities’ expressed interest in restoring program relations
with the Fund, staff noted that further cooperation is needed to confirm that data
communicated to staff in the context of the PRGF arrangement approved in 1999 were
3

The revisions affecting data prior to end-December 2004 (¶7) resulted in: (a) a downward adjustment of about
US$29 million in foreign reserves for the 1997–2004 period, as a result of checks carried out in a BCM internal
audit at end-August 2004; and (b) an upward adjustment of approximately UM 3 billion in BCM credit to the
government, covering at least the 2000–02 period. The authorities argued and staff verified that these revisions
would not alter the conclusions regarding the compliance with the relevant quantitative performance criteria at
the dates for which staff had information.

4

Staff continues to seek clarification and information concerning the 2001–02 reserves data from the authorities
so as to ascertain whether there is evidence to pursue a case of misreporting under the 1999 PRGF arrangement.

-8-

correct. Mauritania has requested the use of the Fund’s emergency assistance for natural
disasters (EAND) on account of the locust invasion and the drought in the 2004/05 crop year,
and expressed interest in a SMP, with a view to building a track record that would form the
basis for a new PRGF arrangement. While agreeing with staff on the need to anchor program
relations on a solid starting point, the authorities argued that a non-qualified external audit of
the central bank financial statements as of end-2004 should be sufficient. Staff reiterated the
need for independent verification of the end-2003 central bank financial statements and full
disclosure of the information available to confirm the official reserves for 2001–02.
11.
In addition to dealing with data problems and the interpretation of recent
economic developments, key discussions with the new economic team focused on the
policies needed to address the challenges discussed below. The authorities were eager to
tackle the problems facing Mauritania now and hoped that staff would focus on the future
without dwelling excessively on the mistakes of the past. Staff insisted that resolving
outstanding data issues and avoiding future slippages would be equally important.
III. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
12.
On the basis of the revised data for 2003–04, Mauritania significantly departed
during the past two years from the long-standing prudent policies that had earned it the
reputation of a strong performer. Instead of capitalizing on its solid fiscal stance and
comfortable foreign exchange position to pursue the second generation of reforms, the
authorities backtracked on many objectives outlined in their PRSP.5 Important structural
reforms stalled, most notably in banking, the foreign exchange market, governance, and
capacity building. The moderate increase in public spending, which was programmed to
maintain macro-stability and respect capacity absorption limits, turned into an off-budget
spending spree. In the event, Mauritania registered two years of buoyant growth of close to
7 percent, exceeding the original objectives and historic averages, at the expense of seriously
compromised macroeconomic stability (Table 1).
13.
The revised data show that policies pursued during the 18 months from
January 2003 entailed large fiscal imbalances and a concomitant loss of foreign
reserves.6 Under the original program’s assumption of a broadly balanced budget for 2003–
04, the available foreign financing would have been sufficient to maintain the reported
reserve cover in excess of six months of imports of goods and services. In reality, the
extrabudgetary spending resulted in a cumulative fiscal deficit exceeding 50 percent of
annual GDP (Table 2). Imports directly paid for with the official reserves represented a large

5

The PRSP was discussed by the Board in January 2001 (EBD/01/6, 1/12/01). The latest (second) PRSP
Progress Report and its Joint Staff Assessment were presented to the Board in 2003 together with the request for
the approval of the 2003 PRGF arrangement.

-9-

proportion of the extrabudgetary spending, and by June 2004 the reserve cover had shrunk to
one month of imports (Table 3).
14.
In mid-2004, Mauritania found itself in need of radical stabilization to avert the
prospect of a balance of payments crisis and tame a double-digit inflation. The new
economic team, appointed in July 2004, took coordinated measures to reverse the unraveling
of macroeconomic stability by curbing extrabudgetary expenditures and withdrawing central
bank financing. The BCM raised reserve requirements to mop up some of the excess liquidity
and stepped up foreign exchange interventions in defense of the ouguiya. However,
macroeconomic conditions continued to deteriorate in the second half of 2004 with inflation
pressures unwinding progressively and the parallel foreign exchange market premium
coming under recurrent stress.
Policy Slippages in 2003 and the first half of 2004
15.
The upsurge of extrabudgetary expenditures critically affected the fiscal policy
stance. Overall, on the basis of the data provided by the authorities, one-half of the
extrabudgetary expenditures undertaken in 2003 and about 60 percent of those undertaken in
the first half of 2004 were attributed to emergency needs and security-related outlays. The
remaining part comprised diverse or unidentified outlays directly paid for by the central
bank. The fiscal impulse enabled a significant increase in private sector activity generating
additional tax revenues but their impact on the fiscal deficit was dwarfed by the magnitude of
extrabudgetary spending.
16.
Monetary developments in 2003
and the first half of 2004 were dominated
by the uncontrolled growth of the

government’s financing needs (Table 4).

monetary developments is still subject to
important qualifications pertaining to the
difficulties in explaining the sharp decline in the income velocity of broad money.7

As suggested in ¶8, monetary data may have been underreported prior to 2003. The stabilization of the
nominal exchange rate against the U.S. dollar since 2001 could explain only a limited fraction of this decline.

experienced difficulties in obtaining
cash from the BCM, which culminated in a brief run on deposits. In retrospect, this episode
was probably less related to the BCM’s efforts to stem an ongoing parallel market
speculation against the ouguiya (as explained to staff at that time) than to the BCM’s
temporary difficulties in meeting the fast-expanding demand for cash.
Policy tightening from mid-2004
18.
The fiscal and monetary tightening in the second half of 2004 was substantial,
but did not suffice to strengthen the ouguiya. Reportedly, no extrabudgetary expenditures
were committed after the new economic team took office, although some previously
committed outlays were left unpaid.8 The BCM curbed its financing of government
operations, which resulted in a large reduction in the fiscal deficit. In July 2004, the BCM
raised the reserve requirements on bank deposits from 4.5 to 8.0 percent and eliminated the
facility set up a year before to offset the liquidity impact of transferring government deposits
from commercial banks to the central bank. As a result, growth in all monetary aggregates
slowed down in the second half of 2004.9 Meanwhile, the BCM stepped up its foreign
exchange interventions to contain the recurrent widening of the parallel market premium.
Developments in the real and external sectors in 2003–04
19.
Preliminary data provided by the authorities on the real sector seem to indicate
that the impulse from the sizable extrabudgetary spending had an immediate impact on
economic activity and a large, albeit delayed, impact on inflation. With strong exogenous
shocks on agricultural output in the background—a rebound in 2003 and a decline in 2004
8

An amount equivalent to 7 percent of GDP of the off-budget spending committed before end-July 2004 is
estimated to have been left unpaid for at that date, of which a fifth (UM 7 billion) was not yet regularized by
end-2004.

However, the BCM relaxed somewhat the monetary tightening in December to ease bank liquidity during a
comprehensive exchange of the 1974 generation of banknotes for new and more secure ones.

- 11 -

under the impact of locust invasion—real GDP growth increased from 3 percent in 2002 to
nearly 6½ percent in 2003 and is estimated to have reached nearly 7 percent in 2004
(Figure 3). The 12-month CPI growth remained subdued in 2003, but accelerated markedly
in 2004, reaching 16.2 percent at year’s end, fuelled by the monetary expansion and the passthrough of the international oil price increases. An additional inflationary impulse came from
the Nouakchott real estate market, reportedly booming in the wake of the favorable oil
prospects.
20.
Mauritania’s external position deteriorated sharply in 2003–04, resulting in a
precipitous decline in foreign reserves to a level equivalent to about two weeks of imports
of goods and services at end-December 2004. While the current account deficit in 2003–04
reflected for a large part a surge in FDI-financed imports of oil production equipment,
imports of goods related to the extrabudgetary expenditure tipped the underlying current
account balance (excluding oil exploration related imports) from a small surplus in 2002 to
double-digit deficits in percent of GDP for two consecutive years. However, the
comparatively limited deterioration of the current account balance (half that of the fiscal
balance in 2003) implies a sharp increase in nongovernment savings (Table 5), and an even
less explicable significant private consumption drop in real terms.10 In 2004, the stabilization
of the current account deficit was due to a relatively good export performance and the midyear reversal of the expansionary fiscal stance.
21.
Competitiveness did not significantly erode in the past two years, although the
progressive widening of the parallel market premium foreshadowed a growing
disequilibrium. Given the large appreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, the de
facto pegging of the ouguiya/dollar rate led to a continued modest depreciation of the
average real effective exchange rate in 2003. In 2004, however, the depreciation was
reversed as the inflation differential between Mauritania and its trading partners widened
(Figure 4).
Structural reforms
22.
The structural agenda of the PRSP suffered from delays and setbacks, and
several key measures agreed upon under the 2003 program were put aside (Table 6).
While a reform of budget execution procedures is under way, the core issues that had been
identified in the 2002 fiscal ROSC have not yet been addressed. Deficiencies in the
functioning of the foreign exchange market and in the financial system, including
weaknesses in commercial banks’ supervision, have not been corrected. Programs to support
good governance and to reform public administration are still in the preparatory stages.
Progress has been made, however, on the restructuring of the social security fund and on the
reform of the labor market.
10

This suggests that in the 2003–04 period either: (a) the current account deficit is underestimated as possibly
suggested by the sharp increase in the balance of payments errors and omissions; or (b) the fiscal deficit is
overestimated, which would be the case if extrabudgetary spending had started before 2003.

- 12 -

23.
The full scope of fiscal mismanagement and misreporting came to the fore in the
aftermath of the sizable fiscal slippages. Major deficiencies in accounting, reporting,
control, and treasury management functions facilitated the extrabudgetary spending in 2003–
04 and its concealment (Box 2). In this context, steps that had been taken to improve budget
preparation and execution (such as the elaboration of a medium-term expenditure framework
in 2003 and the recently passed legislation enabling greater transparency and efficiency in
expenditure management, along with devolution of expenditure authorization) were of little
help.
24.
Reforms of the foreign exchange market encountered serious setbacks as the
BCM struggled with the growing pressures on official reserves. The functioning of the
market deteriorated significantly between mid-2003 and mid-2004, with the BCM resorting
to a discretionary rationing of foreign exchange to commercial banks and foreign exchange
bureaus. In September 2004, faced with growing complaints from private operators, the new
management of the BCM officially stopped the foreign exchange auctions and began to
prioritize the sales toward the payments for imports of key commodities (including
petroleum products and staple goods), the rest being allocated to banks according to
transparent criteria.11 External payment arrears surfaced in the private sector, reflecting the
rationing of foreign exchange. The BCM also withheld the elimination (scheduled for
September 2004) of the 70 percent surrender requirement on export proceeds from fishing.

11

The criteria include banks’ participation in export financing and their observance of credit concentration
ceilings.

Box 2. Main Deficiencies in Fiscal Management
Many deficiencies in fiscal management were noted in the 2002 Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes (ROSC), Fiscal Transparency Module, notably in the accounting system and other areas
where Mauritania had not achieved a sufficient degree of transparency. The following deficiencies were
also flagged in the periodic reviews of Mauritania’s tracking of poverty-reducing public spending:
• The budget is fragmented into an operating budget and a consolidated investment budget (BCI).
Operations carried out through two financially independent government agencies (including a substantial
proportion of social expenditures) are not subject to normal budget procedures.
• Ex ante controls of public expenditures are inefficient. For instance, until recently procurement
procedures allowed large public expenditures without proper verification that budget allocations were
available.
• Financial supervision, which until March 2005 was not subordinated to the minister of finance,
is weak. Information on public expenditures at each stage of the process is nonexistent and, as a result,
their control is poor and their tracking partial (including the tracking of the expenditures financed
through HIPC debt relief).
• Complete government accounting records have not been kept for several years, and the treasury
is unable to prepare the monthly treasury balance necessary for preparation of the consolidated fiscal
reports (TOFE).
•

Fiscal reporting is still not computerized (originally scheduled for 2004).

• The supplementary period for balancing the books exceeds the two months prescribed in the
financial legislation, which makes it difficult to close the books and carry out the year-end reconciliation
between the treasury and the BCM for the preparation of the Budget Execution Law.
• The treasury has only a partial view of its current and liquid assets, and management of public
funds and government cash holdings is compartmentalized.

25.
Over the years, Mauritania received a substantial amount of Fund technical
assistance, notably in the areas of tax policy, banking supervision, and foreign exchange
system reforms, but with a mixed effectiveness record. Some recommendations on tax
policy reforms were incorporated in the 2004 budget law, but technical assistance provided
in other areas is yet to produce its effects. Recently, the new economic team has actively
sought the Fund’s technical assistance, notably in public expenditure management, and has
already initiated the implementation of several technical assistance recommendations to
improve fiscal reporting.
26.
Since reaching the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative,
Mauritania has concluded debt relief agreements with all multilateral and most
bilateral creditors. Negotiations are currently conducted with Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates and the authorities plan to continue their discussions with those bilateral
creditors (Algeria, Brazil, Iraq, and Libya) that have not yet provided irrevocable HIPC debt

- 14 -

relief. Mauritania is also discussing with Kuwait and Libya the treatment of the “passive
debt,” which was excluded from HIPC relief calculations at the decision point.12
Poverty reduction
27.
The preliminary results of the ongoing household survey show improvements in
several social indicators in 2000–04, consistent with the PRSP targets. The provision of
health and education services has improved, as reflected in the literacy, primary school
enrollment, and child vaccination rates (Table 7). However, access to water and electricity
remains deficient. While the 2004 poverty incidence indicators for the entire country are not
yet available (46.7 percent in 2000), in Nouakchott, poverty incidence declined significantly
during the years 2000–02; inequality, however, increased markedly in that period.
IV. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND KEY CHALLENGES
28.
Mauritania’s economic outlook presents difficult challenges—both in the short
and in the longer term. At present, the authorities are confronted with the aftermath of
the 2003–04 slippages: a looming balance of payments crisis and rising inflation. Although
inconsistent data and inexplicable recent economic developments (including the actual
course of monetary and fiscal policy since 2001) make the design and implementation of
economic policies difficult, it is clear that further tightening is needed. This may run,
however, against domestic expectations that policies will be relaxed with the first offshore
oilfield expected to come on stream in 2006. Looking forward, Mauritania faces the
challenge of building the capacity for managing substantial government revenue
inflows from the nascent oil and other extractive industries. Restoring integrity in
financial data reporting, setting up safeguards against misuse of mineral resources, and
resuming structural reforms are the key tasks that the authorities should undertake without
further delays.
Near-term outlook
29.
Growth prospects for 2005 remain favorable despite the ongoing fiscal and
monetary tightening. The propitious business climate created by favorable oil, copper, and
gold prospects will help sustain the growth momentum of 2003–04. The boom in
construction and related sectors serving the domestic market is expected to continue and,
together with the anticipated partial recovery of agricultural production and the good
performance of traditional exports (particularly iron ore), will help maintain real GDP
growth above 5 percent.

12

The service on this debt (US$40 million to Kuwait and US$15 million to Libya) was suspended because the
creditors had not responded to the authorities’ requests for clarifying whether the debt ought to be included in
the HIPC relief calculations. Recently, both creditors asked for its repayment. In the ongoing negotiations, the
Mauritanian authorities' argue for relief on terms comparable to those agreed upon by the creditors who
participated in the enhanced HIPC initiative.

- 15 -

30.
An insufficiently tight policy mix, wage hikes, and exogenous factors will cause
inflationary pressures to abate only slowly. The remaining excess liquidity in the private
sector, the budgeted 16 percent increase in civil service wages (leaving them virtually
unchanged in real terms) and the 39 percent rise in the minimum wage in January 2005, the
planned oil cost-driven electricity tariff increase, and the poor agricultural 2004/05 crop year
will all exert upward pressure on consumer prices in the first months of the year. As a
consequence, and despite a projected further policy tightening (see below), the 12-month
inflation rate is unlikely to drop below 10 percent by end-2005.
31.
The consolidation of Mauritania’s fragile external position will depend on a
strict implementation of the policy framework envisaged by the authorities. The
expected improvement in the terms of trade will be a favorable factor. With the cessation of
extrabudgetary spending and the soaring international iron prices boosting nongovernment
savings, the large underlying external current account deficit (excluding FDI-related imports)
is expected to disappear in 2005. Outside the mining sector, imports of goods and services
are projected to contract, with the exception of emergency food imports to offset the locust
invasion impact on the 2004/05 crop.13 The capital account surplus (10.3 percent of GDP
in 2004) is expected to double in 2005, boosted by a massive increase in direct investments
in oil and other mining projects.
32.
The achievement of the central bank’s foreign reserve objective is also
predicated on the availability of external balance of payments support. For the BCM
reserves to reach the target of two months of imports by end-2005, an estimated financing
gap of US$65 million would need to be covered, possibly by EU grants and disbursements of
program loans from IDA and the African Development Bank. The authorities also intend to
approach the Arab Monetary Fund, and encourage foreign commercial banks to roll over
their import credits pending the arrival of oil export revenues in early 2006.
Medium- to long-term outlook
33.
The medium- to long-term economic outlook is increasingly favorable on
account of the rapid development of extractive industries. Exports of large quantities of
oil, and significant exports of gold and copper are to begin in 2006. Oil production is
expected to peak at some 150,000 barrels per day around 2010. The booming exports will lift
the per capita income above US$1,000 in a few years, allowing Mauritania to graduate from
IDA and PRGF status, and to reduce its reliance on official external financing.
34.
For the long term, staff has prepared two scenarios, based, among others, on
different oil price assumptions (Box 3). Both scenarios assume sound macroeconomic
policies, efficient targeting of investment in infrastructure and human capital, and savings for
13

Cereal imports needed to maintain human consumption at its level of the (successful) 2003/04 crop year is
estimated at 135,000 metric tons (US$22 million), to which exceptional imports of 66,000 metric tons of
livestock feed (US$12 million) have be to be added.

- 16 -

future generations (oil production is projected to end by 2024). The baseline scenario
assumes an oil price of US$43 a barrel in 2006 and high GDP growth during the 2006–10
period, declining thereafter (Table 5). Over time, the external current account surpluses are
matched by the amortization of the ongoing oil and mining investment projects and a
sizeable accumulation of official reserves. In parallel, the government savings (abroad) reach
a level sufficient to generate income covering a primary deficit in the range of 2–3 percent of
GDP during the post-oil period. A more conservative low-case scenario, assuming lower oil
prices and recoverable reserves, shows a less rapid growth and moderated financial asset
accumulation profile.
35.
Mauritania’s debt sustainability indicators are expected to improve dramatically
over the medium term (Appendix IV). Staff projections indicate a substantial reduction in
Mauritania’s gross public external debt and debt service, reflecting the favorable external
outlook and debt relief under the HIPC initiative. The net present value (NPV) of public
external debt to GDP ratio is projected to drop from 53 percent in 2004 to 20 percent
in 2010, while the domestic public debt (a heritage of the 2003–04 extrabudgetary
expenditures) is expected to decline from 38 percent of GDP to 13 percent during the same
period. A permanent adverse oil price shock portrayed in the low-case scenario induces only
a mild deterioration in the external debt and debt service indicators, while the main
adjustment is reflected in lower government savings (abroad).14
V. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Macroeconomic Policies
Exchange rate policy
36.
Staff urged the authorities to adopt a transparent and sustainable exchange rate
policy. While the new BCM management had initially indicated its a priori preference for
maintaining the exchange rate of the ouguiya stable against the U.S. dollar, it has recently
leaned toward a managed float, benchmarked on a trade-weighted basket of currencies.15
Staff acknowledged that an external nominal anchor could usefully contribute to abating
inflationary pressures, but noted that, given the risk of depleting official reserves, defending
the peg would likely entail an intensification of exchange restrictions. Staff argued that the
success of the authorities’ stabilization efforts would critically depend on an appropriate
combination of policy tightening and mobilization of balance of payments support in 2005.
The authorities agreed to prepare for the transition to a more flexible exchange rate system.

14

Standard stress tests suggest, however, that Mauritania’s external debt and debt service indicators are
relatively sensitive to negative shocks to export growth.

15

Mauritania’s exchange rate regime remains formally classified as a managed float.

- 17 -

Box 3. Mauritania’s Petroleum Potential and Oil Revenue Management Issues
Mauritania will become an oil exporter in 2006. The production will start in one offshore field, Chinguetti,
while another field, Tiof, could come on stream in 2008. Several other offshore and onshore fields are currently
under exploration (see Chapter I of the Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix, 2005 at (www.imf.org )) for
detailed analysis of the oil sector in Mauritania). The table below presents two scenarios based on different price
and production assumptions.

The expected budget revenues from oil are
sizable and even under conservative
assumptions (the low-case scenario) would on

nonoil GDP per year) over the medium term.
The Government intends to integrate the use of
oil revenues in its poverty reduction strategy. It
has also proposed to set up an oil stabilization
fund and to save for future generations.
Staff recommended that the following
principles be applied to the management of
oil revenues:



Continue to subordinate the conduct of fiscal and monetary policies to the objectives of maintaining
macroeconomic stability and the competitiveness of the nonoil sector.



Focus on the primary nonoil deficit in percent of nonoil GDP—an appropriate indicator of what the
government can afford to spend over the long-term without exhausting its assets—and align expenditures
with a long-term objective of saving funds sufficient to sustain fiscal policy in the post-oil period.



Make a clear policy statement on the use of oil revenues, including financial and other investments to be
financed from oil revenues. Ensure that oil revenues and oil stabilization and savings funds remain
transparent, fully integrated with the budget, and governed by a sound asset management strategy.
Ensure accountability by conducting regular audits of the fund, to be submitted to parliament and
published.



Make sure that oil companies comply fully with the tenets of good governance, particularly with respect
to accounting, auditing, and publication of accounts.

- 18 -

Meanwhile, they will manage the exchange rate so as to avoid its further significant
appreciation in real effective terms and take measures to improve the structure of the foreign
exchange market (see below).
Fiscal policy
37.
For 2005, the authorities plan a major tightening of fiscal policy compared
with 2003–04, but staff stressed the need to subject the spending during the year to the
imperative of safeguarding the external reserves position. The overall fiscal deficit
(including grants) is projected at 3⅓ percent of GDP in 2005, down from 20 percent in 2004.
Government spending in 2005 is expected to be almost halved (in percent of GDP) compared
with 2003–04, and to exceed the pre-2003 baseline (2001–02 average level) by no more than
3 percentage points of GDP, half of which is attributable to the increase in military spending
and the remaining half is related to the increase in spending on goods and services. The oneoff elements of the extrabudgetary spending in 2003–04 have been eliminated while some of
its recurrent elements, mainly increases in wages and benefits granted to military personnel,
have been accommodated.16 The budget law also authorized the suspension of UM 7 billion
(11 ⁄2 percent of GDP) in self-financed capital expenditures, pending the availability of
additional foreign financing. Given the projected high external vulnerability through mid2005, staff recommended that about 15 percent of the expenditures budgeted for the first six
months be postponed to later in the year, pending the anticipated repatriation of additional
revenues by the national mining company, SNIM, and the disbursement of the financial
compensation under the fishing agreement with the EU. There is also scope for curbing some
of the increase in spending on goods and services.
38.
On the revenue side, overall government receipts as a percentage of GDP are
projected to decrease, owing to a slowdown in the growth of taxable imports and the
diminished weight of nontax revenue (notably pertaining to the EU fishing compensation,
which is a constant amount in euros). The revenue impact of raising the corporate income tax
rate from 20 to 25 percent is expected to be negligible but this step represents an important
structural improvement by realigning the general regime with special provisions for most oil
producers and other mining operators prospecting in Mauritania. The authorities also
requested Fund technical assistance in tax administration to prepare for the introduction of
the General Income Tax, in line with the 2003 Fund technical assistance recommendations
on direct tax reform.
39.
The authorities agreed with staff that the government should make no recourse
to bank financing in the first half of 2005 and that there should be no accumulation of
arrears during the year. Staff also proposed that the automatic quarterly funding of the
16

The 2005 budget introduces also a uniform, tax-free monthly bonus of UM 8,000 for civil servants, which,
staff stressed, will lead to a further compression of the salary scale and add to the complexity of the government
compensation system. Staff did not support either the granting in March 2005 of a US$3,000 increase in Cabinet
Ministers’ monthly special budget allocations, which the government justified as an anti-corruption measure.

- 19 -

investment budget be replaced with a system that could track the use of previous allocations.
At the same time, staff emphasized that social expenditures should be executed as budgeted.
The allocations for social expenditures in the 2005 budget fell behind the existing 2004–06
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) targets but are still projected to grow (by
6 percent in real terms) compared with their 2002 level. Their decline compared with 2003–
04 reflects the withdrawal of the off-budget emergency expenditures.
Monetary policy
40.
The authorities agreed with staff on the need for further monetary policy
tightening in 2005 to reduce inflation and help rebuild the level of official reserves.
Given that the CPI inflation is not expected to fall to a single-digit level by end-2005, staff
argued for raising BCM reference interest rates, mostly unchanged for several years, to
positive levels in real terms. The authorities agreed to raise the discount rate by 2 percentage
points to 13 percent in early February 2005, and to consider raising interest rates further
should the inflationary pressure exceed expectations. Staff noted that interest rates on the
treasury bills also remained below the projected inflation rate, while additional sales of
treasury bills, even if costly for the budget, were essential to further signal monetary
tightening and to absorb the remaining excess liquidity in the banking system.17
41.
In view of the remaining inconsistencies in monetary data and the absence of
clear interpretations of the recent monetary developments, staff and the authorities
could not agree on projections for 2005. Staff argued that since the reported large and
sudden monetary expansion in 2003–04 could conceivably leave private agents with
undesired large money holdings at end-2004, portfolio preferences should lead them to
reduce these holdings, portending a sharp reversal of the 2003–04 decline in income velocity
of money. The BCM projected instead broad money growth of 14 percent, consistent with an
almost constant velocity, implying that the 2003–04 monetary policy slippages had led to a
permanent shift in money demand.
B. Structural Reforms and Poverty Reduction
42.
Discussions on the structural agenda for 2005 focused on urgent reforms in
public expenditure management, preparations for the petroleum era, and steps to
improve the functioning of the foreign exchange market. Other issues included the
ongoing financial sector reforms, the status of actions under the Poverty Reduction Strategy
for 2001–04, and the preparations for its successor.
43.
The authorities decided to strengthen public expenditure management and
eliminate the risk of extrabudgetary spending recurrence. They indicated that efforts to
strengthen public expenditure management should focus on reinforcing treasury functions,
17

The level of commercial banks’ free reserves with the BCM at end-2004 (5 percent of deposits on top of the
required 8 percent of deposits) indicates that some banks are still experiencing abundant liquidity.

- 20 -

together with the BCM disengaging from the day-to-day financial operations of the
government. In close coordination with World Bank staff, a Fund technical assistance
mission is currently discussing the implementation of a reform program that would cover
treasury reform, budget preparation and reporting, and the strengthening of financial
supervision, as well as measures to promote transparency and accountability in public
finance.
44.
Staff reviewed the framework and parameters for oil revenue projections and
discussed the government’s intentions with regard to the management and use of
forthcoming oil revenues beginning in 2006. The authorities intend to adopt sound principles
for oil revenue management, such as the inclusion of their totality in the budget. While they
are carefully considering various revenue-tracking frameworks, such as the one proposed in
the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI), they wish to use existing domestic
institutions to control oil-related operations (e.g., the Parliament and the General Audit
Office) and to develop their own model for the optimum use of oil resources. Staff
underscored the importance of preserving macroeconomic stability and competitiveness
outside the oil sector, focusing fiscal policy on a sustainable nonoil primary balance, and
ensuring transparency in oil revenue management.
45.
The envisaged steps toward a more transparent and sustainable exchange rate
policy should be undertaken in the context of a foreign exchange market reform. The
authorities agreed that the present system of foreign exchange rationing should be replaced
by a market-based system, with Fund technical assistance if needed. Staff argued that
transparent auctions could initially be used to channel the foreign exchange supply of the
public sector. For the medium term, an interbank foreign exchange market should be
developed, in close connection with the development of the money market. To this end, the
partial surrender requirement on proceeds from fish exports should be removed and
prudential ratios on banks’ foreign exchange positions more strictly and frequently enforced,
so as to promote the diversification of foreign exchange suppliers. The authorities stated that
the present rationing of foreign exchange was only a temporary and nondiscriminatory (visà-vis other Fund members) measure required by Mauritania’s precarious official reserve
position. They agreed to prepare the foreign exchange market regulations with the Fund’s
assistance, and to implement them as soon as official reserves rebound durably. Staff advised
the authorities that the present rationing constitutes a restriction on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions under Article VIII, Section 2(a). Staff
urged the authorities to eliminate the restriction as soon as the balance of payments
conditions permit. Moreover, the premium on the parallel market should be sharply reduced.
46.
The strengthening of the financial sector is a key priority for the authorities, as
well as for the Fund and the World Bank. Risk concentration, lack of confidence in
commercial banks, and their rising foreign exchange exposure are of primary concern. In
response to the authorities’ request, a joint Fund/Bank FSAP preparatory mission visited
Nouakchott in February 2005, and requested detailed financial data, including on individual

- 21 -

banks.18 This will allow a full mission, expected later this year, subject to data availability, to
assess the soundness and vulnerabilities of the financial sector; assess the provision of
financial services and identify missing services and markets; review the regulatory, legal and
judicial framework; and identify policy measures to address the vulnerabilities and the
obstacles to the effective provision of a broad range of financial services. The Fund is also
providing technical assistance on draft anti-money laundering and combating the financing
of terrorism (AML/CFT) legislation.
47.
The authorities intend to maintain an open trade regime but pointed out that
standards prevailing in developed countries are the main obstacle to market access.
Notably, sanitary and phytosanitary requirements to access EU markets hinder Mauritania’s
export diversification effort toward agriculture and livestock. The authorities also expressed
concerns about the implications for Mauritania (a net importer of grain) of the elimination of
subsidies on agricultural exports that are under discussion at the present round of WTO
negotiations.
48.
A new PRSP, expected to cover the 2006–10 period, is being prepared. The
authorities are taking stock of the experience under the first PRSP (2001–04) and are
preparing a new strategy that would include the plans for accelerating the poverty reduction
efforts with the use of oil revenues. The stocktaking will review monetary measurements of
poverty, expected to be available in July 2005, and the poverty-reducing impact of budgetary
expenditure on education, health and water resources. Building on this review, the new PRSP
is expected to be adopted by the government in September 2005 and forwarded to parliament
by December 2005.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
49.
The conjunction of weather-related, security, and—possibly—electoral
challenges pressured the Mauritanian authorities into short-sighted policies, sidelining
the ambitious economic and structural goals of the 2001 poverty reduction strategy and
the related PRGF-supported program, and revealing serious governance and data
integrity issues. These policies undermined the country’s macroeconomic stability and
capacity to absorb further shocks, and delayed the preparations for the oil era beginning
in 2006.
50.
Staff deeply regrets the sizable fiscal and monetary slippages that were
discovered in September 2004 and the 18-month delay in notifying the Fund. Based on
data reported by the authorities, Mauritania enjoyed at end-2002 a comfortable level of
official reserves and could well have accommodated some of the drought and security-related
spending under the PRGF-supported program at the time of the initial discussions or the
subsequent review. Instead, the slippages and the absence of adequate government and
18

Severe data inconsistencies need to be resolved before banking sector vulnerabilities can be assessed.

- 22 -

central bank control mechanisms rapidly led to an off-budget spending spree whose adverse
economic impact remains visible in Mauritania’s precarious foreign reserves position, higher
inflation, and persistent gaps between official and parallel foreign exchange rates.
51.
Unanswered questions on revised and prior data prevented a complete
assessment of economic performance and policies. Monetary developments between 2002
and 2004 are difficult to understand and the accuracy of data provided to the Fund prior
to 2003, including monetary and fiscal statistics, is still questionable. Staff urges the
authorities to collaborate fully in the verification and clarification of the remaining issues.
52.
The discussions on a possible SMP will require the authorities’ full cooperation
to establish a solid basis on which to anchor projections. Staff welcomes the ongoing
reconciliation of the BCM and the treasury accounts, and the BCM’s intention to submit its
end-2004 financial statements to an audit consistent with international standards. However, it
reiterated the need for independent verification of the end-2003 central bank financial
statements and full disclosure of information available to confirm the official reserves
for 2001–02, in order to restore trust in the data provided to the Fund. The restoration of
integrity in macroeconomic and financial data reporting will also require substantial
strengthening of fiscal accounting procedures as well as central bank internal and external
control to prevent the recurrence of the central bank financing of non-budgeted spending.
The authorities will need to make the best use of technical assistance that the Fund and
World Bank staffs have to offer in these areas.
53.
In the meantime, the authorities should proceed expeditiously with the
corrective policies in various areas. Given Mauritania’s preference for maintaining in the
short term a stable exchange rate against a currency basket, the fiscal and monetary restraint
needs to play a central role in restoring macroeconomic stability. The policies that the new
economic team initiated in July 2004 represent a much needed reversal that has so far warded
off a potential balance of payment crisis. However further policy tightening is needed until
the crisis is well out of the way. The ending of the extrabudgetary spending in the second
half of 2004 and the adoption of a strict budget law for 2005 need to be followed by further
cuts in nonpriority spending. The achievement of social expenditure targets, however, should
not be compromised. The central bank appropriately curbed its monetary financing of the
budget and tightened liquidity during the second half of 2004, but a tighter monetary policy
is urgently needed to tame inflation and avert the depletion of official reserves. The foreign
exchange rationing constitutes a restriction on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions under Article VIII, Section 2(a). Staff urges the authorities
to eliminate the restriction as soon as the balance of payments conditions permit. The
mobilization of external balance of payments support, and preparation for an orderly exit
strategy from the peg (including through a more flexible exchange rate policy) should also be
urgently pursued.
54.
Preparations for the oil era need to be accelerated. While the government’s
intentions regarding the management of forthcoming revenues point in the right direction, the
slippages demonstrate that a strong legal and fiscal framework for the collection and

- 23 -

management of oil revenues, full transparency, and multi-level controls are indispensable
safeguards against the risks of over- and misspending. In particular, the updated mediumterm expenditure framework should establish spending plans that reflect Mauritania’s
poverty reduction goals, as well as long-term savings objectives, macroeconomic stability
priorities, and absorption capacity limits. Furthermore, the operations of the projected oil
stabilization and savings funds should be fully reflected in the government budget and
subject to a rigorous appropriation process.
55.
For Mauritania to reap the benefits of prospective oil revenues, structural
reforms should resume rapidly. In addition to the needed overhaul of public expenditure
management, reforms in the financial sector should constitute key developmental priorities.
Mauritania needs a well-functioning foreign exchange market that avoids discriminatory
practices and helps the development of a modern banking system by reducing foreign
currency hoarding. Full cooperation, particularly on data, will be needed for the FSAP
mission to deliver the best possible advice on ways to strengthen the financial sector.
56.
Concrete steps to implement the pending government programs in support of
good governance and public administration reforms are needed, including the adoption
of a code of conduct and a modern system of remuneration for civil servants. Furthermore,
candid and far-reaching lessons should be drawn from the execution of the first poverty

position to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on a 12-month cycle.

Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

as defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the
implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
VIII. Safeguards Assessments
A full safeguards assessment of the BCM was completed on May 21, 2004. The assessment
identified serious vulnerabilities in the central bank's safeguards framework and concluded
that with the exception of appointing an international audit firm, the central bank had made
little progress in strengthening the framework since the 2002 transitional assessment of the
BCM's external audit mechanism. In particular, critical vulnerabilities were found in the
areas of financial reporting (including reporting of monetary data to the Fund), and controls.
A number of recommendations were made to address these vulnerabilities, including with
respect to audits of reserves and quarterly monetary program data, the preparation of
financial statements on the basis of International Financial Reporting Standards, and
measures to improve controls in reserves management. Measures have been taken in some
areas. At this stage, recommendations related to monetary program data remain relevant in
the context of possible future programs.
IX.

Exchange and Trade Arrangements

The currency of Mauritania is the ouguiya (UM). On December 31, 2004, US$1 was
equivalent to UM 256.2. Beginning in April 2000, the official exchange rate was fixed based
on the results of daily foreign exchange auctions (the Extended Exchange Market). In
August 2002, the BCM issued two circulars: the first sets limits on, and regulates, the
handling of foreign bank notes and the second reimposes a variant of a surrender requirement
where 70 percent of fishing export receipts should be repatriated via the BCM. Starting in
mid-2003 the BCM suspended the foreign exchange auctions and introduced foreign
exchange rationing, which constitutes a restriction on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions under Article VIII, section 2.

Last Article IV Consultation

Discussions for the 2003 Article IV consultation were held in Paris from April 14 to
25, 2003. The Country Report No. 03/314 was considered by the Executive Board on
July 18, 2003. The Executive Board approved the HIPC Completion Point document for
Mauritania on June 7, 2002.

vulnerabilities of the financial sector; assess the provision of financial services and identify
missing services and markets; review the regulatory, legal and judicial framework; and
identify policy measures to address the vulnerabilities and the obstacles to the effective
provision of a broad range of financial services. The Final Report on the Fiscal transparency
Module of the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was based on two missions,
respectively conducted from May 14 to 24, 2002 and from August 6 to 13, 2002. The final

APPENDIX II

Mauritania: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of March 25, 2005)
Partnership in Mauritania’s Development Strategy
1.
The Mauritanian government’s development strategy is set forth in the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), approved in early 2001. It focuses on four pillars:
(i) stimulating accelerated and redistributive growth; (ii) anchoring growth in the economic
environment of the poor; (iii) developing human resources and ensuring universal access to
basic infrastructure and services; and (iv) strengthening institutional capacities and
governance. The first and second PRSP Progress Reports (PRSP-PR), reviewing the first two
years of implementation of the PRSP, were discussed by the Boards of the World Bank and
IMF in June 2002 and July 2003 respectively. The next PRSP is due by September 2005, and
will be based on the findings of the ongoing national household survey.
2.
The World Bank and the IMF continue to cooperate closely in assisting the
government of Mauritania to implement its medium-term poverty reduction strategy with
each institution taking the lead in the policy dialogue in its areas of expertise. The Bank leads
the policy dialogue on sectoral structural reforms, as well as privatization and poverty
monitoring and evaluation. Areas of close collaboration include the PRSP, public
expenditure management, the nascent oil sector, financial sector, external debt sustainability,
poverty and social impact analysis, tax reform and private sector development.
Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy
The Country Assistance Strategy
3.
The World Bank supports the implementation of the PRSP through its Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS, FY03–05). In the CAS, the program of lending and nonlending
operations was specifically designed to support implementation of the four strategic axes of
the PRSP, with particular emphasis on capacity building. In the CAS it was assumed that a
series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC) would gradually become the main
pillars of the lending program but, as a result of the deterioration of macroeconomic
management in 2003 and 2004, the preparation of the first PRSC was stopped. Dialogue has
nevertheless continued on the reforms envisaged under this operation, notably in the sphere
of public expenditure management. As for the sectors included in the original PRSC-1 (i.e.,
health and nutrition, and water and sanitation), they will benefit from Bank’s investment
projects in FY2006. The next CAS will follow the finalization of the upcoming PRSP and
will continue to outline a Bank program that is closely aligned with the priorities of the
PRSP.
4.
To date the WB has approved 69 projects in Mauritania for a total of
US$1,019 million. The current portfolio has 11 operations for a total of US$279.4 million,
with an undisbursed balance of US$206.9 million. The Bank's program concentrates on rural
development, urban development and social sector operations, with other specific

- 40 -

APPENDIX II

investments in growth-stimulating sectors, such as mining, energy, and transport. In FY05
the Bank delivered a US$15 million Higher Education Project and for the rest of the fiscal
year one additional operation is planned: the second phase of an Integrated Development
Program for Irrigated Agriculture (US$39 million). In FY2006 the Bank will deliver the
second Health and Nutrition Project (tentatively US$10 million), a Capacity Building Project
(tentatively US$17 million), and a Water Supply Project (tentatively US$30 million).23 A
transport Project could be delivered in FY2007 (amount to be determined).
5.
The Bank’s program also encompasses Economic and Sector Work (ESW), the
provision of Institutional Development Facility (IDF) grants and Trust Funds (TF). A Public
Expenditure Review (PER) was completed in June 2004, but remained in Green Cover (not
published), given the macroeconomic developments in 2003–04 and related needs to revise
key data. A PER Update is under way and will be completed in FY2006, along with an
update of the HIPC Assessment and Action Plan (AAP). In collaboration with the IMF, the
Bank is also working on an Oil Sector Study, which should be delivered in FY2006. An
Investment Climate Assessment will be carried out by the Bank in Mauritania in FY2006.
The Bank is also providing US$448,000 in an IDF for the Justice Sector, US$900,000
through a Japan Social Development Fund for Legal Aid Services for the poor, US$350,000
through an IDF to strengthen the public procurement function and US$273,000 through an
IDF to support the accountancy profession. A PRSP-TF (US$500,000) is being executed by
the authorities to strengthen statistical capacity, and analytical capacity in the areas of
poverty analysis and PRSP monitoring and evaluation.
Main Policy Reform Areas
6.
In line with the PRSP, the government of Mauritania has focused in recent years on
fostering the development of the private sector (the main engine of growth), promoting urban
and rural (agriculture, livestock) sectors, improving health and education outcomes, and
strengthening institutions and governance. The World Bank fully supports this agenda.
7.
Promoting Private Sector-led Growth. One of the key objectives of the government is
to accelerate the implementation of reforms geared at stimulating private sector-led growth
and rendering Mauritania more attractive to foreign investors. The Bank’s policy dialogue in
this area focuses, inter alia, on: (a) lowering factor costs (energy, transport, labor);
(b) stimulating growth in the mining sector by opening competition in iron ore production;
and (c) improving the overall business climate by removing remaining barriers to
competition and factor mobility. The Bank is also promoting the growth agenda in its rural
operations, particularly through the activities supported by the PDIAIM, which works with
private sector operators in the Senegal valley area.
23

A budget support operation could be envisaged for FY2006 (e.g., SAC), depending on these factors: (i) the
re-establishment of macroeconomic stability and strengthening of public expenditure management (as
demonstrated by of good track record under an IMF SMP program); and (ii) the inclusion in the operation of a
stronger public expenditure management component that encompasses the management of the nascent oil sector.

- 41 -

APPENDIX II

8.
Achieving Broad-based Growth. Anchoring growth in the economic environment of
the poor is a key strategic objective of the government. This requires, above all, increasing
productivity in the livestock and agricultural sectors, which employ a large swathe of the
rural poor. In livestock, the policy dialogue focuses on the application of the new Livestock
Code and the elaboration of a coherent sector strategy, paying particular attention to key subsectors (e.g., cattle, meat, and leather). In agriculture, attention is being paid to improving
farm productivity by easing access to inputs and credit and promoting training schemes for
farmers. Efforts are also being undertaken to improve living conditions at the local level
(village communities) by stimulating income generating activities, expanding access to basic
socio-economic services, and improving natural resource management practices.
9.
Developing Human Resources. Education. The Bank’s operations and policy advice
support the objectives of the National Program for the Development of the Education Sector
(PNDSE 2002–10), prepared by the authorities, aiming at achieving universal access to basic
education, improving the quality of teaching and learning in the classroom and the efficiency
of the system. Efforts are also being undertaken to support the expansion of higher education,
focusing on the University of Nouakchott. Mauritania has also begun to benefit from the
Education for All Fast Track Initiative to accelerate the implementation of the national
education program. It received US$7 million in 2004, and a further US$2 million is expected
in 2005.
10.
Health. Additional efforts are needed to reduce (child and maternal) mortality rates
and malnutrition rates, at the levels needed to reach the MDGs by 2015. Priorities for action,
supported by the Bank mainly through the upcoming second Health and Nutrition Project,
include: (i) providing accessible and quality health services with emphasis on the rural poor
population; (ii) progressively increasing the availability of financial resources for the health
sector and limiting the impact of health expenditure on poor households; and (iii)
strengthening health sector performance by decentralizing activities and fostering the
involvement of local communities in the management and decision making process of health
care.
11.
Multisectoral HIV-AIDS Control Project. The authorities have adopted a multisectoral approach to combat HIV/AIDS. The leadership for this program is located in the
Prime Ministers’ office and has translated to date in strong cross-sectoral response at both
the central and decentralized levels.
12.
Strengthening Institutions and Governance. The government of Mauritania finalized
in 2004 a National Program of Good Governance (NPGG) and a Strategy for the
Strengthening of National Capacity. The first program aims at improving public expenditure
management, strengthening the judiciary system, improving the efficiency of the Parliament,
promoting human rights, and further consolidating the democratic process in the country.
The second focuses chiefly on improving institutional capacity in areas of strategic
importance, including the public administration, economic planning, project conception,
execution and monitoring, and PRSP progress and poverty monitoring and evaluation.

- 42 -

APPENDIX II

13.
The dialogue to ensure efficient and transparent allocation and use of public resources
focuses on the following: (a) improving the budget elaboration process with a view to
allocating resources more efficiently; (b) strengthening the capacity to execute and track
public expenditure (notably all poverty-reducing spending); (c) strengthening the controls on
the budget through the structures that exists and have the mandate to do so, especially in the
light of the breakdown of budget discipline in 2003–04. The Public Sector Capacity Building
Project (under preparation) supports further elements of the above-mentioned strategies,
including the consolidation of the rule of law, decentralization, the modernization of public
administration and strengthening of civil society capabilities.
Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas
14.
As part of its overall assistance to Mauritania––through lending, country analytical
work, and technical assistance––the Bank supports policy reforms in close collaboration with
the Fund, in the following areas:
Public Expenditure Management. The Fund and Bank jointly emphasize the need
to significantly improve public expenditure management, accountability, and transparency,
notably following the deterioration in macroeconomic management during 2003–04. On
budget formulation, it has been agreed with the authorities that: (i) the existing MediumTerm Expenditure Framework (MTEF) should be updated annually and used in the
preparation of the budget law; and (ii) ways should be sought to unify the recurrent and
(foreign) investment budgets. On budget execution, emphasis has been placed on the need to:
(i) execute spending under the 2005 Budget on the basis of the ceilings agreed by Parliament;
(ii) bring into the official expenditure circuit all the spending that is currently carried out by
institutions with an hybrid status, such as the Poverty Commissariat (CDHLCPI) and Food
Security Commissariat (CSA), as well as the spending that is carried by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs and Development (MAED) on the PASEP accounts; (iii) continue the
reforms to de-concentrate the order of payment issuance (towards line ministries and regions)
and simplify and computerize the expenditure circuit; and (iv) strengthen the capacity of the
Treasury to reconciliate accounts with the central bank, and produce in a timely manner
fiscal accounts and the treasury balance. On budget reporting, the Bank and Fund are
supporting Mauritania in its efforts to strengthen the capacity of audit institutions (i.e.,
Supreme Audit Institution) and improve the tracking of poverty reducing spending.24
•

Oil. With significant oil revenues looming on the horizon, the World Bank and IMF
have emphasized the need for the government to: (i) share oil sector information (e.g.,
investment, production, revenues) in a timely and transparent fashion; (ii) put in place
•

24

Recommendations on these topics are included in reports prepared by the Bank and IMF, e.g., a Country
Procurement Assessment Review (2002), a Report on the Observance of Standard and Codes (2002), a Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (2003), a Country Economic Memorandum (2003), a Public Expenditure
Review (2004 – to be updated) and a Public Expenditure Management: Country Assessment and Action Plan
(2004 – to be updated).

- 43 -

APPENDIX II

appropriate legal and fiscal regimes to accelerate the growth of Mauritania’s hydrocarbon
industry; and (iii) build the capacity for an efficient and transparent management of oil
resources through the State’s budget. The Bretton Woods institutions have also expressed
their willingness to provide technical assistance in the oil sector and have encouraged the
Mauritanian government to adhere to the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI).
The Bank and Fund are collaborating on the elaboration of an Oil Sector Study, which aims
at providing the authorities with a range of policy options geared at managing successfully
the transition to an oil economy. A joint IMF-World Bank and authorities study trip to oil
producing countries (one in Africa, and Norway) has also been planned for June 2005.
Financial Sector Reform. As part of the CAS, the Bank, in close collaboration with
the Fund, is helping the authorities in improving financial sector intermediation for private
sector development, and mobilizing savings, while promoting competition in the financial
sector. A Financial Sector Study was completed in 2004. An FSAP mission took place in
February 2005 with a follow-up visit expected in May 2005. The Bank is also providing
technical assistance to the central bank in the area of reserve management, following a
specific request from the authorities and in agreement with the IMF.
•

Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA). The Bank and Fund have agreed to
review closely the poverty and social impact of reforms that are being implemented. To date,
benefit-incidence analysis has been conducted in the health and education sectors to assess
the welfare impact of public spending on different groups of people. In the mining sector, the
PSIA is being conducted to evaluate the impact of reducing the services provided by the
national mining company (SNIM) to different groups of the people. Additional povertyrelated analytical work includes the following: (i) a study on Water and Poverty (first draft
received); (ii) an analysis of macro-micro linkages through the development of a poverty
analysis macroeconomic simulator (PAMS - ongoing); (iii) a survey on the dynamics of rural
labor markets (ongoing); and (iv) the elaboration of poverty maps (ongoing).

APPENDIX III

Mauritania: Statistical Issues
General
There are substantial weaknesses in Mauritania’s economic and financial statistics. The
September 2004 revisions made to the fiscal, monetary, and balance of payments accounts
have resulted in unexplained breaks in the series and hampered recent analysis of economic
developments. Data reporting by the authorities to the Fund has become increasingly
irregular over the past year.
With assistance from AFRISTAT, Mauritania became a GDDS participant on
September 1, 2004. Against this backdrop, the authorities are expected to make full use of
the West Africa regional technical center (once it becomes operational) to pursue statistical
improvement.
Real sector
National accounts data require substantial further improvement. In February 2005, the
authorities provided staff with a preliminary set of revised national accounts, which is
reflected in this report. The revisions of national accounts has been under way for several
years to take advantage of methodological refinements in the assessment of informal sector
activity. The new set of national accounts following 1993 SNA takes 1998 as a base year and
shows a significant (10–15 percent) increase in the recorded activity level compared to the
previous set based on 1985 accounts. Thus far, National Statistical Office (ONS) produced
final estimates for 1998 and 1999 and preliminary estimates for the 2000–04, which are used
in this report for the presentation of the historical time series and projections. Nevertheless,
technical assistance is still needed to conduct statistical surveys (current estimates are based
on data reported by tax authorities) and prepare estimates for the informal sector.
Regarding the CPI methodology, the 1996 STA mission made recommendations about
geographical and product coverage, updating of weights, improving computer resources, and
creating a specialized team. Based on results from the 2001 household expenditure survey
and with the assistance of AFRISTAT, the ONS started to publish in May 2004 a new CPI
index with an updated consumption basket, covering a wider range of markets albeit with a
geographical coverage still limited to Nouakchott.
Government finance
No monthly or annual government finance statistics are currently reported to STA. With
ongoing methodological improvements, the monthly statements of treasury accounts, which
are not being provided, could provide the basis for future reporting to STA, to cover
budgetary central government. However, no information is being provided on the accounts of
the Social Security Fund and on any of the largest local communities’ budgets.

- 45 -

APPENDIX III

The measurement of the execution of the Public Investment Program needs to consistently
reflect actual disbursements of foreign loans and grants and ensure that the estimated import
component is compatible with customs data. The current accounting system needs further
improvement to produce reliable and comprehensive information on budget execution. The
November 2002 Fiscal ROSC report set in place a set of recommendations that the
authorities should adopt in order to ensure that the government’s accounting system is
capable of producing reliable, comprehensive and timely annual government accounts and
monthly fiscal reports.
Money and banking
Data on monetary authorities and deposit money banks are reported on an irregular basis.
Monetary data have been perceived in the past as generally adequate for Fund surveillance,
but recent substantial revisions, apparent internal inconsistencies, and delayed submissions
raise serious questions about monetary data reliability. These issues will be further addressed
in the policy dialogue in the period ahead.
A monetary and financial statistics mission to Mauritania (January 9–22, 2002) assisted the
Central Bank (BCM) in revising and updating its monetary and financial data compilation
procedures to better reflect institutional and accounting developments in the financial sector
(banking and nonbanking). The mission set the ground for these statistics to be in accordance
with the Fund's Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) and for eventual MFSM
implementation. The mission also investigated data transmission problems and discrepancies
and prepared an action plan for following up on recommendations. The BCM is now
implementing some of these recommendations.
Balance of payments
The balance of payments methodology is being revised in light of the changes in the
exchange system. The foreign exchange record of the central bank is being supplemented by
secondary sources of information to capture the international transactions increasingly
carried out in cash or settlement transactions. However, significant weaknesses in the balance
of payments data remain, in particular concerning nonmining exports, short-term capital
flows, and private transfers as reflected in often large errors and omissions.
A balance of payments statistics mission (June 17–30, 2003), in a follow-up to the 1999
mission, noted that although the authorities have not implemented earlier recommendations,
they have successfully introduced the bank-reporting system through which the commercial
banks are required to report regularly to the BCM details of external transactions they

transactions. The BCM agreed with the work plan set up to implement the recommendations
of the mission. The latest balance of payments data reported to STA go back to 1998.
Regarding debt statistics, the databases that are maintained by the BCM and the Ministry of
Finance were recently unified, but data management needs to be strengthened. A new
software is being installed by UNCTAD, but personnel need to be trained.
Poverty and social indicators
Household expenditure surveys, at the national level, have been conducted for the
years 1990, 1996, and 2000. The results of these surveys are one of the main sources for
building poverty profiles and setting poverty reduction targets. A limited survey was
conducted in 2003 by the ONS in the capital city Nouakchott (which hosts about one-third of
the country’s population). A new household survey covering Mauritania is currently being
conducted, the results of which should be available in the summer of 2005.

APPENDIX IV

Mauritania: External and Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
This appendix assesses Mauritania’s external and public debt sustainability and reports on
the standard and country specific robustness checks.25 Under the baseline scenario, external
debt and debt service indicators improve substantially over 2006–25. The outlook is robust
to most of the standard stress tests and the country-specific one (low-case scenario). Under
extreme assumptions, Mauritania’s external debt and debt service indicators are sensitive to
external shocks and policy slippages. The results depend critically on policy assumptions
regarding the use of significant oil revenues in 2006–24.
External debt sustainability
1.
Under the baseline scenario, Mauritania’s external debt and debt service
indicators improve markedly over the medium term. With the oil coming on stream, real
GDP and exports growth rates are expected to surge in 2006–10. Reflecting prudent policies
and continued enhanced HIPC debt relief (in gradually declining amounts), the net present
value (NPV) of external debt drops from 53.2 percent to 20.3 percent of GDP and from
180.9 percent to 34 percent of exports between 2004 and 2010, while the debt service-toexports ratio declines from 9.2 percent to 2.4 percent. These indicators are expected to
further improve over the long term despite the projected moderation of real GDP and
exports growth, reflecting the gradual disappearance of oil production by 2024 (Table 1).
2.
The standard stress tests indicate high sensitivity of Mauritania’s debt
sustainability outlook to negative export shocks. Under a scenario based on the historical
average of export growth minus one standard deviation, the NPV of debt averages 53 percent
of GDP and 390 percent of exports in 2005–25, and the debt service-to-exports ratio exceeds
30 percent on average. Under the sensitivity test with key parameters reset to their historical
averages, the NPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio over the period 2005–25 averages about
100 percent while the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is double that amount (Figure 1).
However, these simulations disregard the link between oil exports and oil-related debit items
(imports of equipment, cost amortization and profit transfers). In addition, growth in public
investment-related imports is kept at the baseline level irrespective of lower oil revenues
(Table 2).
3.
The baseline debt sustainability outlook for Mauritania is robust to a negative
country-specific shock that would affect oil exports and revenues. Under the low-case
scenario (Box 3 of the main text), external debt and debt service indicators deteriorate only
mildly. With the main adjustment reflected in lower foreign assets (see below), an adverse oil
shock would raise the NPV of external debt by 4 percentage points of GDP and 13

APPENDIX IV

percentage points of exports on average, and the debt service-to-exports ratio would increase
by 2 percentage points over the 2006–10 period.
Fiscal sustainability
4.
At present, the combined level of Mauritania’s domestic and external public
debt appears relatively high and raises legitimate concerns as to its sustainability. At
end-2004, the public debt-to-GDP ratio exceeded 150 percent in nominal terms, and
90 percent in NPV terms. The heritage of the 2003–04 extrabudgetary expenditure weighs
significantly on the domestic public debt component, which grew from some 5 percent of
GDP at end-2002 to nearly 38 percent at end-2004. Of this amount, consolidated central
bank’s claims on the government constitute 87 percent.26 The remainder comprises T-bills,
and other short-term liabilities including arrears.
5.
Given the favorable medium-term outlook, it is expected that in 3–4 years
Mauritania’s public debt sustainability indicators will fall into a comfortable range and
continue to improve over the long term. Under the baseline scenario, the NPV and nominal
debt-to-GDP ratios will decline below 40 percent and the debt-service-to-revenue ratio will
decline to 11–12 percent in 2008–10.27 This is predicated on a pro-growth fiscal policy and
savings of some 50 percent of the oil windfall over 2006–24, leading to the net accumulation
assets of some US$4.5 billion (or 58 percent of GDP at end-2025) with gross assets
(66 percent of GDP) nearly three times the gross debts (Table 3). Under the low-case
scenario, the government runs a tighter fiscal position in line with lower oil revenues but is
able to save only a precautionary cushion of 9 percent of GDP; with the virtually unchanged
nominal debt flows, gross public debt would equal 25.3 percent of (a somewhat lower) GDP
in 2025.
6.
The standard sensitivity analysis results show a dramatically unfavorable but
highly improbable scenario. The shocks giving rise to the alternative scenarios labeled “no
reform” (primary balance in percent of GDP kept unchanged at 2005 level ) and “most
extreme stress test” (real GDP growth in 2006–07 at historical averages minus one standard
deviations) produce results similar in their pattern and magnitude (Figure 2). Both scenarios
depict the unconditional pushing forward with the expansionary fiscal stance, which in the
baseline scenario is contingent on the availability of oil revenues, and is moderated by
precautionary savings. As a consequence, given the implicit resource constraints, both
alternative scenarios appear highly unlikely (Table 4).

26

According to the agreement between the central bank and the ministry of finance, the government debt vis-àvis the BCM is consolidated in two types of instruments repayable over up to 33 years with three years of grace
and up to 40 years with ten years of grace at interest rates on average below the current domestic market rates.
27

Revenue projections assume a diminishing reliance on foreign grants and nontax revenue from fishing.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
May 27, 2005
1.
This statement summarizes information, which has become available since the staff
report was circulated to the Executive Board on May 9, 2005, pertaining to economic
developments since the beginning of 2005, technical assistance on public finances
management, and the audit of the central bank accounts at end-2004. The information does
not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Preliminary data for the first quarter of 2005 indicate a prudent fiscal policy stance,
with parts of spending on goods and services and domestically-financed investment held
back as recommended by staff. Overall fiscal position including grants posted a balance, with
expenditure execution at 4.5 percent of annual GDP. The authorities reported that about 2
percent of GDP in expenditure arrears were settled through sales of treasury bills to
commercial banks, and directly from treasury accounts. As a result, broad money in the first
quarter grew by 13 percent from its end-December 2004 level although interest rates on
government short-term instruments rose from about 7 percent to nearly 11 percent.
Inflationary pressure subsided only slowly as projected (the twelve-month CPI growth
decreased from 16.2 percent in December to 15.2 percent in April). At end-April, the Central
Bank of Mauritania (BCM) gross official reserves remained precariously low, broadly
unchanged from end-December 2004, and net foreign assets of commercial banks showed a
further drop. Foreign trade data for the first quarter show a net increase in exports with the
growth in the value of iron exports more than compensating for the drop in the volume of
fishing exports. The official exchange rate of the ouguiya against the U.S. dollar was quoted
at 265.5 on May 22 (a 3.6 percent depreciation since end-December 2004). Based on the
BCM statements, private business climate remains buoyant, particularly in services and
construction. No major delay is expected for the beginning of oil production, scheduled for
early 2006. The latest estimates regarding the impact of the drought and the locust invasion,
indicate that the January 2005 staff assessment remains broadly valid.
3.
A TA mission on public finances management, which visited Nouakchott in April,
held high profile discussions. The mission provided recommendations to strengthen treasury
operations, fiscal accounting, and reporting and budget preparation, execution, and control
functions. The mission emphasized that greater coherence and coordination in public
finances management reforms will be key to their success. The preliminary report was wellreceived and the authorities have already initiated improvements in fiscal reporting (e.g., the
identification of the cash and commitment bases in the reconciliation between fiscal and
monetary accounts). On the implementation of safeguards assessment recommendations, the
BCM communicated to staff a special report prepared at its request by the external auditor.
The report confirms 98.28 percent of the BCM’s end-2004 foreign exchange balances with
correspondent banks but does not address retroactive data issues. The external audit of the
end-2004 BCM financial statements is expected to be completed by mid-June 2005.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
the Islamic Republic of Mauritania and Reviews Noncomplying
Disbursement
On May 27, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.1 The Executive Board also
discussed the Managing Director’s report on the noncomplying disbursement that arose in the
context of Mauritania’s 2003 Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The
initial disbursement, which the authorities voluntarily repaid on November 4, 2004, was found to
be noncomplying as a result of inaccurate information provided to the Executive Board on the
implementation of one of the prior actions required for the approval of the arrangement. In light
of its voluntary repayment, the Executive Board decided to take no further action.
Background
Mauritania reached the completion point under the enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) in May 2002, and in July 2003 embarked on a new three-year program
supported by a PRGF arrangement in the amount of SDR 6.44 million (see Press Release No.
03/117). However, based on the revised fiscal and monetary figures for 2003 and the first half of
2004 that were submitted to the IMF staff in September 2004, the program was found to be
irretrievably off-track. On November 7, 2004, at the authorities’ request, the arrangement was
cancelled. The revised figures showed large extrabudgetary spending— which the authorities
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2reported to be in part related to the implementation of an emergency plan to protect poor people
from the effects of the 2002 drought and to security-related outlays—financed by monetary
expansion and a drawdown of official reserves. The resulting cumulative fiscal deficit during the
18 months from January 2003 exceeded 50 percent of annual GDP while currency in circulation
and broad money more than tripled.
In 2003–04, with the fiscal impulse and the buoyant construction sector, real GDP grew at an
estimated 6–7 percent per annum. In 2003, CPI inflation remained subdued (5.5 percent on
average) but in 2004 it increased to about 16 percent by year-end, reflecting a lagged effect of
the fiscal and monetary expansion through mid-year and upward adjustments in the retail prices
of petroleum products. Despite buoyant iron ore exports in 2004, the current account deficit
(excluding oil activity and other FDI-related imports) remained close to 16 percent of GDP for
two consecutive years, reflecting the rise in government imports in 2003 and the first half of
2004, related to the large extrabudgetary spending, and in international petroleum prices in
2004. The parallel foreign exchange market premium over the official exchange rate, surged in
the summer of 2003 and peaked above 20 percent in April/May 2004.
In July 2004, a new economic team took actions to tighten fiscal and monetary policies. Offbudget spending was discontinued, the Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM) curbed its financing
of government operations and raised reserve requirements on bank deposits to start mopping
up excess liquidity. The BCM stepped up its intervention on the foreign exchange market, but at
the same time officially stopped foreign exchange auctions and began to prioritize its sales
toward payments for imports of key commodities (including petroleum products and staple
goods). Broad money remained stable in the second half of 2004, and the parallel market
premium decreased gradually to an average of 16 percent in April 2005.
In 2003–04, progress in structural reforms was slower than planned (except for the restructuring
of the social security fund) and major weaknesses surfaced in fiscal, monetary, and exchange
rate management. Recently, however, the authorities took steps to resume structural reforms in
these areas, with technical assistance of the Fund and World Bank staffs. The quality of
financial and fiscal data reporting is expected to improve with the recent reconciliation of
treasury and central bank data and the planned external certification of the BCM financial
statements as of end-2004.
Mauritania is expected to become an oil producer in 2006 and has started to prepare for the
challenges of managing potentially significant oil revenues. The authorities intend to adopt
sound principles for oil revenue management and tracking (various frameworks, such as the
one proposed in the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative, are under consideration).
The authorities plan to budget all the forthcoming oil-revenue and to use it in accordance with
the priorities that will be set up in the 2006–10 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, to be
submitted to Parliament by end-2005.

-3Executive Board Assessment—Article IV Consultation
Executive Directors were disappointed that serious fiscal and monetary policy slippages in 2003
and the first half of 2004 undermined achievement of Mauritania’s ambitious macroeconomic
objectives and progress in implementing the poverty reduction strategy. Extra-budgetary
spending and monetary expansion in this period led to double-digit inflation and a drawdown of
foreign reserves. In Directors’ view, these policy slippages revealed serious governance and
ownership issues.
Directors expressed concern that weaknesses in, and unavailability of, crucial data prevented
staff from conducting a complete assessment of Mauritania’s economic performance and
policies and projecting monetary conditions in 2005. They welcomed the authorities’ recent
efforts to improve the quality of monetary and fiscal data, including the reconciliation of the
central bank and treasury accounts and the ongoing external audit of the central bank’s 2004
financial statements. They also welcomed the central bank’s intention to strengthen its financial
reporting and to implement most of the safeguards assessment recommendations. However,
many Directors emphasized that independent verification of the end-2003 central bank financial
statements and full disclosure of information available to confirm the official reserves for
2000–02 will be required before a request for use of Fund resources or for a staff-monitored
program can be considered. A number of Directors supported a prompt initiation of discussions
on a staff-monitored program, noting the urgency of reestablishing program relations, and a few
Directors considered the authorities’ request for Emergency Assistance justifiable in light of the
drought and locust invasion. Directors strongly urged the authorities to cooperate fully with the
staff to resolve swiftly the remaining data issues.
Directors welcomed the return to fiscal and monetary restraint by the new economic team
appointed in July 2004. They commended the coordinated measures taken since then to curb
extra-budgetary spending, withdraw central bank financing of the budget, and reduce excess
liquidity. They urged further tightening of fiscal and monetary policies and a re-engagement with
structural reforms—with particular emphasis on data integrity, public financial management, and
central bank controls—in order to bring inflation down, rebuild external reserves, and combat
vulnerabilities related to the narrow export base. They also advised the authorities to step up
efforts to mobilize external balance of payments support for Mauritania. Directors considered
Mauritania’s medium-term prospects to be favourable in light of the expected oil wealth and
expansion in other extractive industries, provided the authorities continue to implement sound
policies and structural reforms.
Directors welcomed the projected narrowing of the fiscal deficit in 2005, particularly the
significant decline in government spending. They advised further cuts in non-priority spending,
while emphasizing that social spending should continue to be protected, and encouraged
broadening of the tax base and strengthening of tax administration to boost non-oil revenue.
Rigorous execution of the 2005 budget law and adoption of a strict budget law for 2006 will be
important steps toward maintenance of a prudent fiscal policy, which should be anchored in a
medium-term expenditure framework. Directors called on the authorities to implement

-4expeditiously the recommendations of the fiscal ROSC. They supported the proposed focus on
the non-oil fiscal balance, in view of the volatility of oil prices.
Directors stressed that monetary and fiscal policies should be compatible with the de facto
exchange rate peg. They welcomed the authorities’ willingness to prepare for the transition to a
more flexible exchange rate, and encouraged the early adoption of a strategy for orderly exit
from the de facto peg. They also urged the authorities to eliminate the current restriction on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, as soon as balance of
payments conditions permit, noting that this would reduce recourse to the parallel market for
foreign exchange.
Directors called for accelerated implementation of measures to ensure transparent and efficient
management of the emerging oil boom, and for equitable distribution of the oil wealth among
regions and ethnic groups. They stressed that a strong legal and fiscal framework for the
collection and management of oil revenue will need to be established, with due attention paid to
absorption capacity, macroeconomic stability requirements, and long-term savings objectives.
The legal framework should explicitly promote transparency, through measures such as an
annual independent audit of the oil accounts, disclosure of all transactions, and publication of
oil-related contracts. Directors recommended that the operations of the envisaged oil
stabilization and savings funds be fully integrated into the government budget, which should be
subject to a rigorous appropriation process. They encouraged Mauritania to participate in the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
Directors urged the authorities to resume implementation of the structural reforms as quickly as
possible. They stressed that the overhaul of public finance management, transparent fiscal
reporting, and multi-level expenditure controls will be indispensable safeguards against overand mis-spending. They called for concrete steps to implement the pending government
programs in support of good governance and public administration reforms, including the
adoption of a code of conduct and a modern system of remuneration for civil servants. Directors
emphasized the need for a well-functioning foreign exchange market that bans discriminatory
practices—this will help the development of a sound banking system, which currently faces high
risk concentration and foreign exchange exposure and a lack of confidence. Directors also
urged the authorities to cooperate fully on data issues to maximize the effectiveness of the
planned FSAP mission.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to gear medium-term spending plans toward
poverty reduction. They observed that, to achieve significant progress toward Mauritania’s
Millennium Development Goals, a comprehensive medium-term strategy should guide the
allocation of the oil revenues to priority sectors while safeguarding macroeconomic stability.
In this regard, Directors looked forward to the completion in the coming months of the new
PRSP covering the period 2006–10. They hoped that candid and far-reaching lessons will be
drawn from the execution of the 2001–04 PRSP, including on ways to improve the targeting of
social expenditures.

Noncomplying Disbursement
The Executive Board reviewed the matter relating to one noncomplying disbursement to
Mauritania, in the amount equivalent to SDR 0.92 million, that was made in July 2003 following
the approval of the Executive Board of a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) arrangement for Mauritania.
The issue of misreporting arose because of inaccurate information provided to the IMF relating
to the implementation of one of the prior actions required for the approval of the arrangement.
Revised data for 2003 and the first half of 2004, provided to the IMF in September 2004,
showed large extrabudgetary spending and corresponding central bank financing in the first
quarter of 2003 that were excluded from data provided to the IMF in May 2003 and on the basis
of which the arrangement was approved.
Directors regretted the occurrence of misreporting under the 2003 PRGF arrangement.
They stressed that the provision of inaccurate information to the IMF on the PRGF-supported
program over a period of one and a half years was a very serious matter. Accurate reporting of
data is crucial in maintaining trust between the IMF and its members, which is fundamental to
the work of the IMF as a cooperative institution. However, given the authorities’ voluntary
repayment of the noncomplying disbursement on November 4, 2004, Executive Directors
agreed that no action be taken.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director
for Islamic Republic of Mauritania
May 27, 2005
Introduction
On behalf of my Mauritanian authorities, I would like to express their deep
appreciation to Management and the staff for their continued support and policy advice, over
the years. The ambitious programs put in place enabled Mauritania to be one of the first
countries to have benefited from Fund assistance under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF) in 1989, and was also among the first countries to reach the completion point
under the HIPC Initiative, in 2002. Since the mid-1980s Mauritania has received valuable
financial and technical assistance under various Fund-supported programs and has
successfully implemented a wide range of macroeconomic and structural reforms that have
contributed to stabilize the economy and improve the life of a large proportion of the
Mauritanian population, while actively promoting the development of the private sector. My
authorities have demonstrated a strong commitment to the programs and ownership of the
reforms, notwithstanding repeated shocks and a difficult environment. With the support of
the international community and perseverance in their adjustment efforts, Mauritania should
continue to make progress in meeting the MDGs. They are grateful to the Board,
management, and staff for their sustained support throughout the years and for the quality of
the work that they have realized in favor of Mauritania.
My authorities very much regret the fact that the last PRGF went off-track, and under
the circumstances described in the staff paper. A series of unfortunate shocks happened
almost simultaneously and led to the large unmonitored extrabudgetary expenses. The way
the shocks were dealt with also indicated weak government capacity and control, which have
since been addressed. First, on the extrabudgetary expenses, they were caused by:
- An unprecedented drought that required immediate intervention, especially
in the more remote areas to prevent loss of life;
- At the same time the country was faced with a severe internal security
problem. It should be noted that Mauritania has had a stable political and security situation
over the past 20 years, and the attempted coups were a major shock to everyone, and called
for immediate and urgent actions on the part of the authorities. Security related expenditure
increased significantly;
- Additional outlays were also needed to prevent a deterioration of the
economic and financial situation.
In July of 2004, a new economic team was put in place. It included, among others, a
new Governor of the Central Bank, a new Minister of Finance and a new Minister of the
Economy. This team put an end to extrabudgetary spending and the depletion of foreign
exchange reserves, and notified Fund’s management of the slippages that had occurred and
discussed corrective measures. On the basis of these discussions, a number of strong actions

-2were taken, as outlined below. But above all, the authorities voluntarily took on themselves
to repay the noncomplying disbursement which was done on November 4, 2004.
Moreover, immediately after his appointment, the Governor of the central bank traveled to
Washington to inform management of the important revisions underway to the data that had
previously been communicated to the Fund. The central bank Governor also reported a
number of significant corrective measures that were being implemented and invited staff to
visit Mauritania as soon as possible.
Addressing Policy Slippages
At the Mauritanian authorities’ initiative, new corrective policies were introduced in
the summer of 2004 by the newly appointed economic team that coordinated their efforts to
tighten fiscal and monetary policies. Extrabudgetary expenditures were immediately stopped
and the central bank ceased its financing to the government. To mop up excess liquidity and
mitigate inflation risks, the central bank raised the reserve requirement of commercial banks.
Later, in 2005, following discussions with staff, monetary policy was further tightened with a
2 percentage points increase in interest rates. To address the tensions that appeared on the
foreign exchange market and to bolster the national currency, the central bank cancelled its
discretionary rationing of foreign currencies to commercial banks and started allocating
foreign currencies on a transparent basis.
Other important measures were introduced to correct the 2003-04 slippages. An audit
of the foreign exchange reserves at end-August 2004 was carried out and its results –showing
a significant drop in the level of foreign reserves–, were immediately communicated to staff.
Most of the recommendations of the 2004 safeguards assessments have also been
implemented since. Starting in 2005, an annual external audit of the central bank’s financial
statements will be performed regularly by an international firm. The authorities are also
currently reviewing budget accounting and reporting procedures with technical assistance
from the Fund.
As a result of the new policies, the fiscal deficit (including grants) that had
considerably deteriorated in 2003, started to decrease in 2004 and is now expected to drop to
5 percent of GDP, in 2005.
My Mauritanian authorities are confident that the measures taken will prevent any
recurrence of the problems. It is their strong wish to continue the close relationship with the
Fund and they look forward to the start of discussions on a strong program of economic
adjustment and reforms, consistent with the PRSP, and that can receive Fund support under a
new PRGF arrangement.
Recent Economic Developments
Although real GDP growth increased in 2003 and in 2004 as a result of the
expansionary fiscal stance, economic conditions in rural areas remained difficult and were
aggravated by the 2002 drought and the 2004 locust inflation, and the inflationary impact of

-3monetary financing of fiscal deficits. For these reasons, my authorities are requesting the use
of Fund’s emergency assistance for natural disasters (EAND).
Mauritania’s current account deficit deteriorated in 2003 and 2004, contributing to the
depletion of foreign exchange reserves. Imports rose sharply. The current account balance
went from a surplus in 2002, to deficits in 2003, and in 2004. In 2004, the deficit stabilized
due to a good exports performance, and the bringing to an end of extrabudgetary spending.
On the fight against poverty and the implementation of the PRSP, several health and
education indicators have improved during the 2000-04 period, notably the literacy, primary
school enrollment, and child vaccination rates. However, access to water and electricity
continue to lag behind. In addition, in the capital, Nouakchott –representing approximately
one third of the population–, the level of poverty declined, though inequality increased.
My Mauritanian authorities agree that the current favorable external environment
represents a welcome opportunity that will assist them in their efforts to strengthen the
economy.. The current situation in the iron ore sector –with high prices pulled by rising
demand in Asia–, along with the coming on stream of oil production, gold, and copper in
2006, will contribute towards strengthening both the fiscal and the current account deficits,
while enabling the monetary authorities to build up foreign exchange reserves again. With
regard to the prospects in the nascent oil sector, my authorities agree with the challenges
ahead, notably the need to build capacity to manage the transition from a $300-$400 per
capita GNP economy, to more than $1000, in 3 or 4 years. They intend to pursue their
cooperation with the Fund, in order to accelerate the preparation for the oil era.
The Issue of Past Data
My authorities have authorized Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC) –in charge of
auditing the level of the reserves–, to cooperate fully and directly with staff on the audit of
the reserves. In 2004, following a recommendation by the safeguards assessment mission to
Mauritania, the task of auditing central bank reserves was entrusted to PwC. At the time, staff
raised no objection to the choice of the audit firm. My authorities regret the present situation.
Nonetheless, they consider that they have cooperated fully and made their best efforts to
assist the mission in obtaining all the information they requested.
Conclusion
Mauritania is today at a crossroads. Undeniable macroeconomic and structural
progress have been achieved since the mid-1980s, with the assistance of the Fund; the near
future looks bright with the beginning of oil production early next year; although the overall
economic and financial situation will remain vulnerable to shocks like the recent locust
invasion that destroyed the livelihood of a large proportion of the population in rural areas,
and for which my authorities are requesting the use of Fund’s emergency assistance for
natural disasters (EAND).

-4My Mauritanian authorities understand the challenges ahead and the need to pursue
rigorous policies and ambitious reforms. They apprehend the risks and opportunities
associated with the considerable resources expected next year, in terms of development
potential and acceleration of the fight against poverty. In such delicate times, we call on the
Fund to continue its financial and technical support to Mauritania and assist the authorities in
their efforts to see through the difficult reforms underway.
