The mission met with Governor Baccar (Central Bank of Tunisia), Minister
Kechiche (Finance), other cabinet members, and government officials. The staff
also met with the main trade union, the private business association, and with
representatives from the banking sector. Mr. Rouai, Senior Advisor to the Executive
Director, attended most of the meetings. A press conference was held at the end of
the mission.

•

At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultations on July 25, 2003, Executive
Directors endorsed the authorities’ plans to undertake fiscal consolidation over the
medium term to lower government debt, and welcomed the planned move to a
floating exchange rate regime and an open capital account. They recommended that
the authorities should move vigorously to strengthen the banking sector, so as to
allow for the proper functioning of the new monetary policy framework and, in due
course, permit capital account liberalization. They welcomed trade liberalization
achieved with the European Union (EU). Nevertheless, they expressed concerns
about the restrictiveness toward non-EU countries and the high nontariff barriers in
general.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

The policy discussions took place against a backdrop of continued strength in the Tunisian
economy. Strong agriculture production and robust nonenergy exports contributed to high
growth and a narrowing of the external current account deficit. A rebound in tourism, stronger
European demand, and continued real depreciation of the dinar is projected to sustain this
strength in 2004.

•

Monetary policy remains prudent and inflation under control. Greater exchange rate flexibility
and the appreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar have led to a real depreciation of the
dinar, contributing to strengthen Tunisia’s external position.

•

The central government fiscal deficit was 3.5 percent of GDP in 2003, about 0.8 percentage
point higher than the budget deficit target, mainly due to a low tax buoyancy. The 2004 budget
deficit target (2.7 percent of GDP) is likely to be met thanks to higher-than-expected nontax
revenues.

•

Nonperforming loans (NPLs) as a share of bank assets increased by three percentage points to
24 percent in 2003, in part due to difficult economic conditions in certain sectors such as
tourism, as well as competitive pressures, which Tunisia is facing in the context of growing
openness. Although not a systemic risk in the short term, these weaknesses constitute
inefficiencies which hamper growth.

•

While Tunisia’s economic performance is one of the strongest in the region, catching up with
lower-tier OECD income levels remains a key challenge. This will require strengthening the
macroeconomic framework and accelerating structural reform.

•

Tunisia is preparing to gradually open up the external capital account. The authorities and staff
agree that this move should be preceded by a gradual transition toward a floating exchange
rate supported by a new monetary policy framework, and deeper money and exchange
markets.

•

Any significant progress toward capital account liberalization necessitates a strengthening of
the banking sector. The authorities share this view and are taking corrective measures. Staff
stressed that reducing NPLs in a lasting manner will require stricter provisioning rules, the
adoption of modern methods of credit appraisal, and the enforcement of sanctions against
banks with insufficient provisioning or capital.

•

Reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio will be important for maintaining confidence in the currency
as the exchange rate becomes more flexible and monetary policy takes on a more active role.
Reducing the weight of the wage bill and improving tax buoyancy will be crucial. Regarding
the latter, the authorities are considering requesting technical assistance from the Fund.

•

On the structural front, aside from strengthening the banking sector, the discussions focused
on trade liberalization and labor market reform.

Fund surveillance in recent years has focused mainly on the need to accelerate
structural reforms and to gradually adapt the macroeconomic framework to Tunisia’s
increasing integration into the global economy (Box 1). The authorities recognize that
further transformation of the economy is necessary to maintain, let alone improve, the growth
performance recorded thus far. The imminent expiration of the Multifiber Agreement (MFA),
which will likely slow textile exports, underscores the importance of structural change.3 In
this regard, a renewed impetus to structural reforms could improve productivity and create a
business environment in which the private sector can better identify and take advantage of
new export opportunities. The authorities also acknowledge the need to reform the
macroeconomic framework, to bolster the impact of structural reforms.

Box 1. Past Fund Surveillance in Tunisia
After exiting Fund-supported programs in the early 1990s, Tunisia has maintained a close and
productive dialogue with Fund staff. Over the years, the Fund has played the role of a trusted policy
advisor. The authorities have reacted favorably to staff’s advice, but have retained full ownership of the
economic reform program that has progressed at a gradual, yet steady, pace. Tunisia embraced a policy
of transparency at an early stage. In recent years, the policy dialogue has focused on three major areas:

3

•

The reform of the macroeconomic framework. The authorities requested Fund advice on how
to gradually liberalize the external capital account and staff has proposed a three-phase plan
(Box 3). Staff has also worked closely with the authorities in formulating a strategy for exiting
the REER targeting exchange rate regime and assisted the authorities in developing a new
supporting monetary policy framework.

•

The need to accelerate structural reforms. While the authorities agreed on this need, they
stressed that the pace of reform should take into account Tunisia’s particular conditions,
especially the need to maintain social cohesion.

•

The policy response to the heightened tensions in the Middle East and the global economic
slowdown in 2002–03. In this context, the authorities took measures to contain emerging fiscal
pressures and build up an international reserve buffer.

Textiles account for over 1/3 of total exports.

Nontariff barriers are also
important. For these
reasons, Tunisia scores 8 out of 10 on the Fund’s trade restrictiveness index. The business
climate still does not correspond to that of a dynamic emerging economy, and has been one of
the main focuses of the World Bank’s activities in Tunisia under the Economic
Competitiveness Adjustment Loans (ECAL I-III, supported by the EU and the African
Development Bank). While the offshore sector enjoys significant economic freedom, onshore
activities are still hampered by relatively heavy regulations.4 Despite measures to liberalize
the labor market, inefficiencies remain. Moreover, there are serious weaknesses in the
banking sector (Box 2).

4

Policy options for phasing out the onshore-offshore dichotomy were discussed in the context of the 2003
Article IV consultations (IMF Country Report 03/259).

-9-

Box 2. Tunisia: Banking Sector Reform and Nonperforming Loans
In 1997, the government launched a comprehensive plan to tackle nonperforming loans (NPLs).
The plan entailed government assumption of banks’ claims on certain public enterprises in return for
noninterest bearing 25 year notes. Legislation allowing the transfer of NPLs to Asset Management
Companies (AMCs) was also introduced and banking supervision was strengthened. As a result, NPLs
fell from 25 percent in 1996 to 19 percent in 2001.
However, NPLs have remained high and have recently increased. The 2002 FSAP found that a
weak credit culture and insufficient use of the central bank’s powers to impose sanctions explained the
high level of NPLs. The weak credit culture was attributed to the significant presence of the government
in the banking sector, central bank refinancing policies that privileged priority sectors, and excessive
reliance on real estate guarantees in provisioning regulations and credit policies. Adequate provisioning
was also discouraged by a lack of full tax deductibility and regulations that did not permit writing off
loss category loans backed by real estate collateral. Weak enforcement of sanctions reflected insufficient
central bank autonomy, itself related to the presence of the government in the banking sector and in the
credit allocation process. Vulnerabilities have recently been exacerbated by shocks to the tourism sector
and by ongoing trade liberalization putting competitive pressure on the industrial sector.
The high level of NPLs imposes an efficiency cost to the economy. The 2002 FSAP estimated that the
ratio of interest received by banks to performing loans was 100 to 200 basis points higher than it would
have been if all loans were performing. Moreover, weak banks’ vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations
could impede market development and monetary policy reform. These vulnerabilities stem from
indexation of high corporate debts to the money market interest rate.
FSAP recommendations to address the nonperforming loans included: (a) reducing the presence of
the government in the banking sector; (b) eliminating priority sector considerations in the BCT’s
refinancing policies; (c) encouraging banks to adopt modern credit appraisal policies; (d) reducing the
role of collateral in provisioning policies; (e) facilitating the transfer of NPLs to AMCs; (f) taking
advantage of banks’ current profitability to request increased provisioning and bank capitalization;
(g) promulgating a law on consolidation accounting to enhance banks’ appreciation of group and related
party risks; and (h) reinforcing the BCT’s independence.
Authorities have already taken action in these directions: Priority sectors no longer play a role in
monetary policy; a banking law strengthening supervision has been promulgated; banks with insufficient
provisions can no longer distribute dividends; a law on consolidation accounting and another defining
groups have been promulgated; conditions allowing loan write-offs and judicial procedures for loan
recovery have been eased; and a small public bank has been privatized, with another one in progress.

regime, to retain a degree of
monetary independence and avoid giving foreign investors any implicit exchange rate
guarantees. The flexibility of the dinar will also be an important factor in preserving
competitiveness. A flexible exchange rate will in turn necessitate further fiscal consolidation
and a monetary policy ensuring continued price stability. The BCT (in collaboration with
Fund staff) has begun preparing the introduction of a money targeting policy framework.5
The authorities recognize that the high level of nonperforming loans (NPLs) has put Tunisian
banks at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis foreign banks, calling for caution in liberalizing
the capital account. Banking sector weaknesses could also limit the margin of maneuver for
monetary policy. Hence, the authorities have placed the objective of strengthening the
banking sector at the top of the policy agenda.

Box 3. Tunisia: External Capital Account Liberalization
Staff has proposed a three-phase plan for liberalizing capital flows:
•

Phase 1 includes steps that could be taken immediately to liberalize medium to long-term
flows such as nonresident direct investments and long term loans to listed firms, and limited
nonresident investments in local currency government securities.

•

Phase 2 involves liberalizing direct investment by Tunisians abroad, and allowing overseas
portfolio investments by institutional investors and portfolio investments by nonresidents in
debt instruments. This stage would require that the banking system be on a solid footing to
enable it to withstand international competition. Progress would also be needed in the conduct
of monetary policy to give a greater role to market forces and in the development of
government securities markets to increase market liquidity. Prerequisites are the establishment
of a flexible exchange rate regime and a deepening of the foreign exchange market.

•

Phase 3 (full convertibility) entails liberalizing domestic portfolio investment abroad and
loans by residents to nonresidents. Moving to this stage would require a robust financial sector
and a resilient balance of payments position.

Box 4. Is Tunisia’s Net International Reserves Position Adequate?1
Foreign exchange reserves in Tunisia have increased over the last decade, from 1.6 months of
imports and 63 percent of short-term debt in 1992 to about 3 months of imports and 100 percent of shortterm debt in 2003.
The demand for foreign exchange reserves is well explained by fundamentals. Foreign exchange
reserves are positively correlated with economic size and current account vulnerability, and negatively
correlated with exchange rate flexibility and the opportunity costs of holding reserves.
The estimated long-run relationship between foreign reserves holdings and their determinants
yields a demand for reserves that is lower than currently forecasted in Tunisia’s macroeconomic
framework. Given balance of payments forecasts, the model estimates that 2.5 months of import
coverage would be sufficient, compared to 3 months of imports targeted in the medium-term
macroeconomic framework.
The gradual move toward a flexible exchange rate should, in time, further reduce the demand for
reserves, although a security buffer may be needed in the transition period.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Short-Term Outlook
7.
The policy discussions took place against a backdrop of continued strength in
the Tunisian economy. Real GDP growth exceeded 5½ percent in 2003, driven by strong
agriculture and robust nonenergy exports. Growth is expected to remain strong in 2004,
supported by a rebound in tourism, stronger European demand, and continued real
depreciation of the dinar. The external current account deficit is projected at 2½ percent of
GDP, ½ percentage point of GDP lower than in 2003, underpinned by strong tourism receipts
and continued growth in nonenergy exports. This, in conjunction with significant
privatization receipts, 8 will enable Tunisia to reduce its external debt by 7 percentage points
of GDP (to 57½ percent) while maintaining a level of reserves equivalent to three months of
imports of goods and services.
8.
Monetary policy continues to be prudent. Money and credit grew more slowly than
nominal GDP in 2003. This increase in velocity was attributable to a steepening of the yield
curve, which resulted in a fall in money demand in favor of medium- and long-term
government securities. The yield curve tilted as the BCT lowered its main short-term policy

interest rate by an accumulated 87.5 basis points (to 5 percent) during 2003. Moreover, the
treasury halted its short term issues to extend the maturity of its debt. Although the rate of
inflation began to pick up in 2003, it resulted from adjustments in administered prices and
supply factor-driven increases in certain food prices. As evidenced by the relative stability in
nonfood prices, neither exchange rate pass-through nor demand pressures appear to have
played an important role. Inflation is expected to return to normal levels (below 3 percent)
by 2005. In this context, staff did not recommend any change in the BCT’s policy stance,
absent further price pressures.

Greater exchange rate flexibility has led to a depreciation of the dinar in real
effective terms. This has improved Tunisia’s competitiveness and helped strengthen its
external position. Staff did not find any evidence of exchange rate misalignment, supported
by a continued relative decline in unit labor costs and a broadly unchanged market share in
the EU. 9 Looking forward, the authorities agreed on the importance for monetary policy to
focus on maintaining price stability to prevent inflation from eroding competitiveness gains
achieved so far.
9

The real effective exchange rate based on unit labor costs depreciated by 4 percent in 2003 (end of period).

- 15 -

10.
Banking sector indicators deteriorated further in 2003. NPLs as a share of bank
assets increased by three percentage points to 24 percent in 2003. Meanwhile, the rate of
provisioning decreased slightly to 43 percent of NPLs, although in part due to write-offs and
transfers of fully provisioned NPLs to asset management companies (AMCs). Banks’
aggregate capital adequacy ratio also decreased, and three banks no longer comply with the
minimum requirements. The authorities pointed out that these developments reflect difficult
economic conditions in certain sectors such as tourism, as well as competitive pressures,
which Tunisia is facing in the context of growing openness. Nevertheless, they agreed with
staff on the need to implement the FSAP recommendations and aim at reversing the trend in
NPLs in 2005.
11.
On the fiscal front, a low tax buoyancy did not permit further consolidation
in 2003, despite the recovery in economic activity. The central government deficit
remained at 3.5 percent of GDP in 2003 (excluding grants and privatization receipts). Tax
revenues as a share of GDP decreased by 1 percentage point to 20.5 percent in 2003,10
because: (a) growth was driven by agriculture and exports, which are little taxed;
(b) domestic demand remained sluggish; and (c) ongoing tariff reduction continued to impact
customs revenues. For 2004, continued weak tax collection will be offset by a windfall profit
transfer from the state-owned telecoms company.11 On the expenditure side, the authorities
have mitigated the impact of higher oil prices on subsidies by adjusting retail prices in
early 2004, but a budgetary overrun is still expected in the absence of further adjustments of
retail prices. In all, the central government deficit is projected at 2.8 percent of GDP in 2004,
close to the budgetary target. Staff stressed the importance of attaining the budgetary target
for 2004 and maintaining the deficit below 3 percent of GDP in 2005, or lower in case of
continued strong nontax revenues, to maintain the pace of deficit reduction consistent with
the medium term consolidation objective (see below). This will require significant efforts
in 2005 to compensate for the one-off nontax revenues collected in 2004. This includes
efforts to improve tax collection and a reduction in current primary spending of ½ percentage
point of GDP.
12.
Against this background, the remainder of the policy discussions focused on:
(a) the strategy to strengthen the banking sector; (b) the strategy for fiscal consolidation; and
(c) the medium-term strategy for solidifying conditions for strong and sustainable growth,
with the goal of eventually catching up with lower-tier OECD income levels.

10
11

Tax Revenues decreased by half a percentage point of nonagricultural GDP in 2003.

The actual profit transfer turned out more than ½ percentage point of GDP higher than projected in the
budget.

- 16 -

B. Strengthening the Banking Sector
13.
While banking sector weaknesses do not pose systemic risks in the near term,
staff urged the authorities to step up efforts to address the issue for reasons of efficiency
and to support the gradual liberalization of the capital account. Banks remain profitable
in the aggregate. The fiscal cost of maintaining required capital adequacy in public banks
would be limited, even in the event of a write-off of most collateralized NPLs.12 However,
current lending practices dampen Tunisia’s growth potential and undermine monetary policy
reform and any substantial progress toward an open capital account.
14.
The authorities share staff’s view regarding the urgency to address these
weaknesses and the BCT is accordingly implementing corrective measures. In 2003 the
BCT established a unit charged with monitoring the stability of the financial system.
Regulatory changes include a ban on dividend distributions for banks with insufficient
provisioning and an accounting law facilitating the monitoring of consolidated risks.
Moreover, the authorities intend to make provisions fully tax deductible and further facilitate
loan write-offs. Staff welcomed these measures and stressed the need to acknowledge
problem loans by provisioning, and if need be increase capital, while relying less on collateral
and guarantees. This will encourage banks to fully factor credit risks in their lending policies
and should improve allocation of credit toward the most profitable sectors. The authorities
indicated that they intended to promote stricter loan collection by encouraging banks to
realize collateral and guarantees. They also plan to take measures to facilitate debt
rescheduling in the tourism sector. Staff emphasized that to reduce the NPL burden in a
lasting manner there is a need for adopting modern credit appraisal methods, enhancing the
autonomy of the BCT to ensure stricter enforcement of sanctions against banks with
insufficient provisions or capital, and diminishing the government’s presence in the financial
sector.

12

The 2002 FSAP estimated this cost at around 1 percent of GDP.

- 17 -

C. Strategy for Fiscal Consolidation
15.
Although fiscal

staff has advocated reducing

confidence and increase
flexibility in fiscal policy. At

authorities to take advantage of Tunisia’s favorable growth prospects, combined with low and
fixed interest rates on a significant portion of its external debt, to reduce the public debt-toGDP ratio to below 50 percent. Accordingly, the fiscal deficit should be kept below 3 percent
of GDP in the near term and be gradually reduced to 1½ –2 percent over the medium term.
The authorities share this view but are challenged by a weak tax buoyancy and a high wage
bill.

16.
The authorities have taken steps to improve tax collection and agree with staff
that more far-reaching tax reforms may be needed. Going forward, pressures on revenues
will be accentuated by the inevitable reduction of customs revenues as a result of tariff
reform,13 the economy’s increasing export orientation, and an expected drop in profit
transfers from state-owned enterprises in the medium term, as these are privatized.
Consequently, the authorities are taking measures to improve tax collection. Notable is the
extension in 2003 of the VAT to telecommunications services. Staff also advised the
authorities to phase out tax exemptions and broaden the tax base for direct taxation.14 The
authorities are considering requesting technical assistance from the Fund in these areas.

13

The bulk of the impact of tariff reduction has already taken place, with trade taxes declining from around
5 percent of GDP in the early 1990s to 1.7 percent in 2003. Nevertheless, this ratio is projected to decline by at
least another ½ percentage point of GDP over the medium term.
14

Most tax exemptions are in favor of the off-shore sector. For a discussion, see IMF Country Report 03/259,
8/21/03.

- 18 -

17.
On the expenditure side, the wage bill, at 12 percent of GDP, continues to weigh
on government finances and represents a rigidity for fiscal policy. Consequently, staff
has advised the authorities to consider a civil service reform covering both the remuneration
system and the size of public employment. The authorities, however, saw little scope for any
significant reduction in the wage bill in the medium term, underscoring that education and
health personnel account for a large share of wage outlays. They emphasized the key role of
education for the success of Tunisia’s development strategy. Regarding other expenditures,
subsidies on petroleum products and food staples represent an annual cost to the government
of approximately ½–1 percent of GDP. Moreover, swings in world commodity prices leave
the government with little control over these costs, as seen by the impact of the recent
increase in oil prices. The authorities agreed that the pursuit of full price liberalization, in
conjunction with well targeted transfers, could produce substantial savings. A major reform
that could in time improve the efficiency of public expenditure is the planned introduction of
a performance-based budget system.
D. Medium-Term Strategy to Accelerate and Sustain Growth
18.
Tunisia has the potential to improve its already strong economic record and in
time place itself at par with lower tier OECD income levels. This will require both
changes in the overall macroeconomic policy framework and policies that favor private sector
investment and overall productivity growth in the economy. Further liberalization and
improvement of the business climate will hence be key. Export orientation will continue to be
the cornerstone of Tunisia’s development strategy, ensuring both high growth and external
sustainability. In this regard, the imminent expiration of the MFA constitutes an additional
challenge. Against this background, the ongoing integration with the EU in the context of the
New Neighborhood Policy initiative presents a timely opportunity to accelerate structural
reforms. To fully benefit from this initiative, Tunisia faces the challenge of harmonizing
political, economic, legal, and institutional frameworks with European standards. Staff
recommended stepping up efforts to conclude an ambitious program with the World Bank in
the context of ECAL IV.

- 19 -

Box 5. Tunisia: 2005–09 Macroeconomic Framework
The medium-term macroeconomic framework projects an average annual real GDP growth of
6 percent over 2005–09, consistent with a continued significant decline in unemployment. This growth
objective would require an increase in gross investment of about 0.5 percentage points of GDP over the
medium term and an average annual total factor productivity growth of 0.8 percent. This performance
will be feasible only if supported by a strengthening of the macroeconomic framework and an
acceleration of structural reforms.
The external current account deficit is projected to narrow from 3 percent of GDP in 2005 to
2.7 percent in 2009. This improvement would mainly result from higher nonenergy merchandise exports
and tourism. After an initial soft patch in export growth due to the expiration of the MFA in
January 2005, average annual export growth is projected at around 6 ½ percent during 2006–09 on
account of diversification and improved competitiveness.
New external borrowing is expected to remain fairly constant over the medium term, allowing a
gradual decline in the level of external debt from 58½ percent at end-2004 to 47 percent of GDP at end2009. Reserves are projected to remain around 3 months of imports
The central government deficit is projected to fall from 2.8 percent of GDP in 2004 to 1.7 percent
in 2009 (excluding grants and privatization receipts). As a result, the consolidated government debt
would fall from 59 of GDP at end-2004 to 46 ½ percent at end-2009.

Reform of the macroeconomic policy framework
19.
To complete the opening of the Tunisian economy, the authorities are preparing
a gradual liberalization of the external capital account in close cooperation with Fund
staff. In addition to strengthening fiscal policies, this liberalization will necessitate parallel
changes in the conduct of monetary and exchange rate policies.
Development of financial markets and the monetary policy framework
20.
Preparations to make monetary policy more dynamic in the context of broad
money targeting are at an advanced stage. The BCT has set up a forecasting framework
for base money (the operating target) and broad money, which is being tested in parallel with
the existing framework. Moreover, the BCT recently introduced quantitative tenders of base
money at multiple interest rates, consistent with the base money targeting strategy. The
authorities and staff agree that the BCT could adopt an explicit inflation targeting framework
once financial markets have deepened, an inflation forecasting framework has been
developed, and currency risks have abated.
21.
The mission reiterated that base money targeting should be accompanied by a
larger role for the money market in the recycling of liquidity. A deep and wellfunctioning money market is necessary for interest rates to be responsive to liquidity
conditions, in turn a prerequisite for a strong monetary policy transmission mechanism. In

- 20 -

this vein, a new law on repurchase agreements was passed in 2003 and is awaiting
implementation. A deepening of the market will also depend on the availability of
government securities, which are the preferred assets for securing money market transactions.
Accordingly, it is important to maintain a presence on the securities market at all maturities
and the recent decision to shift the maturity structure of treasury bills away from the shortest
maturities may thus need to be reconsidered.
Exchange rate policy and the opening of the capital account
22.
Given the limited access of the private sector to international capital markets,
much of the balance of payments has been financed by government borrowing.
Tunisia’s investment grade sovereign debt rating has greatly facilitated the government’s
access to international capital markets (Box 6). However, a significant foreign currencydenominated public debt has emerged. Allowing the private sector to tap foreign capital will
have the advantage of diversifying balance of payment financing and providing additional
sources of foreign exchange.

- 21 -

Box 6. Recent Developments in Tunisian Sovereign Debt
The premium on Tunisian sovereign debt compared to other emerging economies with similar
ratings (BBB-/BBB/BBB+) has narrowed significantly over recent years. Tunisia’s spreads are now
broadly at par with South Africa’s and Croatia’s, and has long been lower than Mexico’s.
Tunisia’s latest Eurobond issue in March 2004 captured EUR 450 million, at a spread of 119 basis
points. The issuance was initially announced for EUR 300 million, but was increased as the bond was
oversubscribed by nearly 3 to 1. The maturity was 7 years.

23.
In addition, to the extent that nonresidents are willing to hold dinar
denominated debt, Tunisia’s exposure to currency risk can be diminished. In this vein,
the authorities began opening the local securities market to limited foreign participation
in 2004, in line with IMF and World Bank recommendations. Staff noted the importance of
further improving public debt management to promote market liquidity, necessary for the
success of this measure.
24.
The authorities and staff share the view that full dinar convertibility should be
preceded by a gradual introduction of a flexible exchange rate regime. Accordingly, in
recent years, they have increasingly deviated from the earlier policy of maintaining the REER
constant. Staff has underlined the importance of a deep and efficient foreign exchange
market, to allow for fully market-determined exchange rates. It welcomed a recent reduction

- 22 -

in surrender requirements and advocated their elimination.15 Staff further encouraged the
BCT to promptly discontinue the obligation for banks to transfer their end-of-day foreign
exchange balances to the central bank (nivellement). The authorities indicated that they were
preparing the relevant legislation to abolish this requirement. Staff also reiterated that the
BCT should end posting bid/ask spreads for foreign exchange, to expand the role of market
forces in the determination of the exchange rate. Such a measure would not prevent the BCT
from intervening in the market to implement its exchange rate policy.
Structural Reforms
25.
While the World Bank is taking the lead in supporting the authorities’
structural reforms, staff urged the authorities to minimize structural impediments to
sustained strong growth. In addition to financial sector reform, discussions focused on trade
and labor market liberalization.
Trade liberalization
26.
Tunisia’s traditional focus on trade integration with the EU has been
appropriate, given the geographical proximity and historical ties. Nevertheless, a large
untapped potential for trade exists with non-EU countries (Box 7). In light of this, and
considering the still high level of MFN tariffs, staff recommended that Tunisia further
liberalize trade on a multilateral basis, in parallel with the integration efforts with the EU.16
Staff also emphasized the need to liberalize services, including communication, distribution,
and transportation services. The authorities pointed out that multilateral trade liberalization is
underway, with the lowering and simplification of MFN tariffs in the 2004 budget law being
just a step in an ongoing process. In this regard, they indicated that the 2005 budget law
would provide further MFN tariff cuts. Moreover, they reiterated that the Fund trade
restrictiveness index overstates the closedness of Tunisia’s trade regime, since it does not
adequately reflect the liberalization that has taken place with the EU.

15
16

Surrender requirements were reduced from 50 percent to 30 percent of export receipts.

Average MFN tariffs are 32.7 percent for all products, 22.5 percent for industrial products, and 68 percent for
agricultural products.

- 23 -

Box 7. Is Tunisia Trading to Its Potential?1
The analysis uses a gravity model of bilateral trade taking into account trading partners’ size,
geographical location, economic structure, and linguistic and colonial ties. The model yields the
following main results:
Tunisia’s aggregate trade with the EU widely surpasses model predictions, but an important trade
potential remains nonetheless. A closer look at EU-Tunisian trade reveals that the large wedge between
predicted and actual trade levels is explained by significant over-trading with a few countries, especially
France and Italy. Meanwhile, Tunisia still under-trades with half of the EU countries, most notably the
UK.
By far the largest untapped trade potential lies outside the EU, especially in the US and Japan.
This underscores the need for Tunisia to accelerate trade liberalization on a multilateral basis, in parallel
with the more advanced integration process with the EU. Within the region, Algeria presents a
considerable potential to increase trade. Stepped up efforts to enhance regional integration may therefore
have a measurable impact on Tunisia’s total trade.
The wide disparity in Tunisia’s trade performance with EU countries suggest that the AAEU have
not introduced serious distortions in the trade regime. Estimated substantial over-trading with a large
number of non-EU countries reinforces this notion, although a richer analysis including changes in the
trade performance over time would be useful before drawing firm conclusions.
_______________________

27.
Staff also noted the importance of reducing nontariff barriers. In this regard, the
authorities have streamlined customs procedures through the integrated customs network
“Tunisia Trade Net,” the recent introduction of selective customs inspection procedures, and
simplified technical controls. Nevertheless, although customs clearance delays have been
substantially reduced, further progress is needed, in particular to allow Tunisia to maximize
the benefits from its geographic proximity to Europe. The authorities indicated that they had
begun studying options for a potential dismantling of state import monopolies.17
Increased labor market flexibility
28.
The mission discussed with the authorities the need for labor market flexibility
to facilitate the reallocation of labor in response to structural changes in the economy.
With employment creation high on the authorities’ agenda, they have introduced temporary
work contracts, which have already helped reduce the unemployment rate by one percentage
point in the past two years, to 14.3 percent. Other important measures include active labor
market policies to match labor supply and demand and programs to retrain labor in line with
changing employment needs.
17

Government monopolies include imports of petroleum products, cereals, pharmaceuticals, coffee, and sugar.

- 24 -

Box 8. Would the Removal of Firing Restrictions Reduce Unemployment in
Tunisia?1
The government is well aware that promoting employment and facilitating the reallocation of labor in
response to structural changes in the economy require flexible labor markets.
Tunisia’s protective and complex labor regulations hamper the flexibility of the labor market. Job
termination regulations are still rigid and protective: dismissals for economic reasons are heavily
regulated, and there is strong government interference.
Growth has only partially contributed to employment generation. While average economic growth
was about 5 percent per year over the last decade, the unemployment rate decreased by only 2 percentage
points over the period.
Simulation results show that a removal of firing restrictions would contribute to increasing
employment, although it will not solve Tunisia’s unemployment problem. Results from a matching
model with firing restrictions show that removing restrictions on dismissals would reduce unemployment
by 1 percentage point. Although positive, this impact is not sufficient to bring unemployment to
acceptable levels.
_______________________________
1
See the selected issues paper “Employment Protection and Unemployment: Tunisia’s Experience,”
forthcoming.

29.
Staff noted, however, that the complex regulations and procedures covering
dismissals could limit the creation of permanent employment. Simulations show that
removing restrictions on dismissals would have a beneficial impact on job creation, although
it would not solve Tunisia’s unemployment problem (Box 8). In this regard, maintaining
strong and sustainable growth remains the key to reducing unemployment in Tunisia.
E. Other Issues
30.
A law against money laundering and the financing of terrorism has been
adopted. The enactment of this law represents a substantial improvement of the country’s
regime to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The central bank is
preparing its implementing regulations.
31.
Staff encouraged the authorities to maintain efforts toward increased regional
integration. The authorities agree that large untapped markets remain in the Maghreb region
that could constitute an additional source of growth.
32.
Tunisia continues to improve the quality and dissemination of economic and
financial statistics within the framework of the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS), to which it has adhered since 2001.

- 25 -

III. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
The Tunisian economy continues to do well, ranking among the leaders in the
region in terms of growth and market-oriented reforms. After showing resilience to
shocks during 2001–02, the economy is recovering while the external position is
strengthening. This performance is a result of strong forward-looking macroeconomic and
structural policies. The main challenge is now to enhance this performance to reach lowertier OECD income levels and further reduce unemployment.
34.
The short-term outlook is favorable, with Tunisia well positioned to benefit from
the expected pick up in European demand. The rebound in tourism, the favorable export
performance, and the continued strength in agriculture augur well for a broad-based recovery.
35.
In this context, the monetary policy stance remains appropriately prudent. The
recent pick up in inflation does not appear to result from either demand pressures or exchange
rate pass-through and thus does not call for a monetary tightening. On the other hand, with
the recovery gaining momentum, the scope for further declines in the BCT’s policy rates
seems to have been exhausted.
36.
The gradual increase in exchange rate flexibility has translated into improved
external competitiveness and a strengthened external position. Continuing this approach
will help contain the impact of recovering domestic demand on the external current account
and is consistent with the authorities’ objective of eventually adopting a floating exchange
rate regime.
37.
Over the years, fiscal policy has aimed toward gradual fiscal consolidation and
has ensured fiscal sustainability. The consolidation efforts were maintained even in 2002,
in the context of sluggish growth. These efforts aim at reducing the government debt-to-GDP
ratio, which remains above that of emerging countries with similar credit ratings. However,
weakening tax revenues prevented a deficit reduction in 2003. Moreover, a narrowing of the
deficit will likely occur in 2004 only thanks to significantly higher-than-budgeted nontax
revenues. To enhance the credibility of the authorities’ medium-term public debt reduction
objective, it will be important to take measures to maintain the 2005 fiscal deficit at the 2004
level, despite the projected fall in nontax revenues. The steps that the authorities have taken
to counter the downward trend in tax revenues are encouraging. Nevertheless, staff
recommends a broad review of the tax-system aiming at improving its buoyancy.
Accordingly, the authorities’ interest in Fund technical assistance in this area is welcome.
38.
As regards expenditures, the authorities’ strategy of gradually reducing the
budgetary cost of food and oil-price subsidies should be complemented by efforts to
reduce the burden of the wage bill. The authorities should consider the benefits of a broadbased civil service reform, which could not only produce expenditure savings but also
improve service delivery.

- 26 -

39.
The conditions of the banking sector are cause of concern. Although unlikely to be
a source of macroeconomic instability in the near term, banking sector weaknesses raise the
cost of capital and hinder the authorities’ plans to liberalize the external capital account and
reform the monetary policy framework. If not addressed, these weaknesses constitute a major
vulnerability that could hamper Tunisia’s medium-term growth prospects. It is reassuring that
in addition to implementing several FSAP recommendations, the authorities have stepped up
efforts to encourage the realization of collateral and thus enforce better collection of NPLs.
However, reducing NPLs in a lasting manner will require stricter provisioning rules, the
adoption of modern methods of credit appraisal, and the enforcement of sanctions against
banks with insufficient provisions or capital. Disengaging further the government from the
financial sector would certainly facilitate this task.
40.
Over the medium-term, reinvigorating structural reforms is essential to bring
Tunisia close to lower-tier OECD income levels. The imminent expiration of the MFA
renders the need for higher productivity growth and private investment all the more
compelling. The authorities’ structural reform strategy is shaped in the context of the EU’s
New Neighborhood Policy initiative and the preparation of the World Bank’s ECAL IV that
place appropriate emphasis on improving the private investment climate.
41.
Trade integration with the EU has served Tunisia well, substantially opening the
economy to foreign trade and investment. However, further progress in multilateral trade
liberalization could provide significant additional benefits. Staff encourages the authorities to
further lower MFN tariffs within the 2005 budget law. Liberalizing services, in particular
distribution and transportation, could also help boost the country growth potential.
42.
Reducing Tunisia’s high unemployment rate requires not only growth-oriented
policies but also increased labor market flexibility. The recent increased flexibility in
hiring—with the introduction of temporary work contracts—appears to have contributed to
the decline in the unemployment rate. The authorities should consider reducing the
constraints on dismissals, which could help facilitate labor market adjustment to structural
changes in the economy.
43.
The authorities are making progress in strengthening their monetary and
exchange rate policy framework. These changes are needed not only to support efforts to
liberalize the external capital account, but also to bolster the impact of structural reforms. The
BCT is now ready to adopt a money targeting framework. Implementing this framework will,
however, require continued efforts to deepen the money market.
44.
The authorities’ exchange rate policy has already departed from the REER rule
and aims at gradually introducing a floating exchange rate—a condition for preserving
a degree of monetary policy independence under an open capital account. Further
reducing the BCT’s role in determining the exchange rate calls for a deepening of the
exchange market. The limited opening of the government securities markets to foreign
investors, the reduction of the surrender requirement, and the elimination of the “nivellement”

- 27 -

will help create more scope for market forces to determine the exchange rate. In this context,
the BCT should also refrain from posting bid/ask spreads for the exchange rate.
45.
Staff supports the authorities’ gradual approach to capital account
liberalization. Removing capital controls could benefit investment, help develop the
domestic financial markets and facilitate the financing of the balance of payments. However,
further progress toward capital account liberalization requires addressing the persisting
weaknesses in the banking sector.
46.
Staff commends the authorities for their continued commitment to transparency
of economic policies. Tunisia has published the concluding statements of Fund missions and
routinely publishes staff reports of Article IV consultations.
47.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultations take place within the standard 12month cycle.

1/ Gross debt of the General Government (Central Government and Social Security system).
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ The volatility of the residual is exaggerated by the calculation of the exchange rate effect, which assumes that all foreign debt is denominated in U.S. dollars. This
effect is particularly pronounced in 2003 when the Tunisian dinar appreciated against the U.S. dollar, while depreciating against all other major currencies.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance) remain at the level in percent of GDP/growth rate of the last projection year.

B1. Real interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
B2. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006

dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency
(e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and both non-interest current
account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

APPENDIX I

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange System
Tunisia accepted the obligations of Article VIII Sections 2(a),3, and 4 effective
January 6, 1993 and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers on current international transactions, except that Tunisia maintains
(a) a multiple currency practice resulting from honoring exchange rate guarantees extended
prior to August 1988 to development banks, which will automatically expire after the existing
commitments have matured; and (b) certain restrictions relating to Iraq and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), pursuant to UN Security Council

TUNISIA: FINANCIAL RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of August 31, 2004)
1.
The World Bank’s portfolio in Tunisia has a total of 16 active operations and 113
closed loans, of which 10 International Development Agency (IDA) credits amounting to
US$75.2 million net of cancellations. Cumulative net commitments represent US$4.9 billion.
Of this total, US$2.8 billion has been repaid. Net commitments for the 16 current investment
operations amount to about US$0.8 billion.
2.
A new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was approved by the Board on
June 3, 2004. It proposes to assist the Government of Tunisia in addressing three key
challenges: (a) strengthen the business environment to support the development of a more
competitive, internationally integrated private sector and improve competitiveness of the
Tunisian economy; (b) enhance skills and employability of graduates and labor force in a
knowledge economy; and (c) improve the quality of social services through enhanced
efficiency of public expenditures.
3.
Bank lending is a mix of long-term investments in infrastructure and social sector
financing, and development policy lending to support reforms at the sector and
macroeconomic levels. Recent loans include an ICT Sector Development Project
($13.3 million) approved by the Board on July 1, 2004, a second-phase Export Development
Project ($37.6 million) approved on June 28, 2004 and a second-phase Education Quality
Improvement Project ($130.3 million) approved on March 8, 2004.
4.
Preparation of a new Development Policy Lending operation (ECAL IV) has begun,
jointly with the African Development Bank and the European Union. The program is
intended to support mutually reinforcing reforms to improve competitiveness and promote
sustained growth by: (a) strengthening Tunisia’s investment climate and expanding
opportunities for private investment; (b) reinforcing the financial sector’s soundness and its
capacity to finance productive investment; and (c) maintaining a sound and reactive mediumterm macroeconomic framework.
5.
Despite the fact that the quality of the portfolio is satisfactory, cumbersome
procurement procedures and slow implementation pace—especially in the rural development
and education portfolios—are affecting the portfolio performance. A Country Portfolio
Performance Review (CPPR) was carried out in 2003 followed by a Country Procurement
Assessment Review and an Independent Procurement Review. The various recommendations
from these activities are being discussed with Government, and in some cases, already being
carried out.
6.
Recent analytical work includes studies of employment challenges, poverty trends,
private participation in infrastructure, public debt management, and tourism. A Development
Policy Review was prepared in 2003 in order to assess Tunisia’s key challenges and policy

- 44 -

APPENDIX II

priorities in the years ahead. This provided the analytical basis for the new Country
Assistance Strategy and is intended to inform the Government’s thinking on the next fiveyear plan (2007–2011). Other recent work includes Country Financial Accountability and
Procurement Assessments, and analytical work in specific sectors such as education.
7.
The World Bank is currently preparing a rural sector-wide review and a Public
Expenditures Review with special focus on performance-oriented budgeting. In addition,
technical assistance is provided on a regular basis on issues such as public debt management
and the promotion of the knowledge-based economy. The Bank will also provide multi-year
support on employment and labor market issues as part of a Programmatic Economic and
Sector Work.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Available economic and financial data have generally been provided to the Fund on a
regular and timely basis; most of those data are also made available to the wider public.
Tunisia subscribed to the SDDS in June 2001 and its metadata are posted on the
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
Real Sector
2.
IFS coverage of data on real sector developments is satisfactory and most data are
reported in a timely manner, although export and import price and volume indices are
reported with a long lag. Data on employment, unemployment, and wages should be collected
and reported on a more frequent basis.
Government Finance
3.
In addition to information reported in the SDDS, government finance data are
collected by the staff at the time of the Article IV consultation mission. Regarding data for
publication, GFS data up to 2002 are published in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook 2003 Data cover consolidated central government. Tunisia does not report monthly
or quarterly data for publication in IFS.
Balance of Payments
4.
Statistics for Tunisia’s balance of payments (BOP) and international investment
position (IIP) are compiled by the Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT), following the methodology
of the Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5). The BOP statistics are prepared
on a quarterly basis and the IIP on an annual basis, complying with SDDS requirements. The
CBT issues preliminary monthly statistics, mostly prepared on the basis of banks settlements
with nonresidents. BOP statistics are generally adequate for annual surveillance, although
greater detail on the financial account would be desirable. As an SDDS subscriber, Tunisia
reports reserves data following the International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity—
Operational Guidelines (Reserves Template) since June 2001.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
5.

Monetary and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Tunisia
On October 27, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Tunisia.1
Background
Over the past decade, Tunisia’s economic performance has been one of the strongest in the
region, reflecting gradual but continuous structural reforms, well-targeted social policies, and
prudent macroeconomic policies. Tunisia signed an Association Agreement with the EU (AAEU)
in 1995, marking the beginning of a significant opening to trade with the EU. Fiscal and
monetary discipline has contributed to macroeconomic stability, in the context of a real effective
exchange rate (REER) targeting framework with controls on capital flows.
The strength of the Tunisian economy continued in 2003 and the short-term outlook is
favorable. Favorable agriculture production and robust nonenergy exports contributed to high
growth and a narrowing of the external current account deficit in 2003. A rebound in tourism, a
pickup in European demand, and continued real depreciation of the dinar is projected to sustain
this strength in 2004. Monetary policy remains prudent and inflation under control. Greater
exchange rate flexibility and the appreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar have led to a
depreciation of the dinar in real effective terms. This flexibility has improved Tunisia’s
competitiveness and helped strengthen its external position.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during
the October 27, 2004 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

On the fiscal front, a low tax buoyancy did not permit further consolidation in 2003, despite the
recovery in economic activity. The central government deficit remained at 3.5 percent of GDP
in 2003 (excluding grants and privatization receipts), about 0.8 percentage points higher than
the budget target. Nevertheless, this allowed for a reduction in the public debt by
0.7 percentage points of GDP, to 61 percent. The 2004 budget deficit target of 2.8 percent of
GDP is within reach thanks to measures on the VAT and on subsidies expenditures and higherthan-expected profit transfers from state-owned enterprises.
Banking sector indicators deteriorated further in 2003, in part due to difficult economic
conditions in certain sectors such as tourism, as well as competitive pressures, which Tunisia is
facing in the context of growing openness. NPLs as a share of bank assets increased by
three percentage points to 24 percent in 2003. While these weaknesses do not pose systemic
risks in the near term, current lending practices dampen Tunisia’s growth potential by increasing
the cost of capital.
Despite Tunisia’s favorable economic performance, its objective of approaching lower-tier
OECD income levels has not been met, and unemployment remains high. Meeting this
challenge will require strengthening the macroeconomic policy framework and accelerating
structural change. Regarding the former, the authorities are preparing to gradually open up the
external capital account. To maintain a measure of monetary policy independence, the
authorities have begun a gradual transition toward a floating exchange rate regime. They are
also in the process of developing a new monetary policy framework, which should be
implemented shortly.
On the structural side, the authorities are implementing reform supported by the World Bank,
the African Development Bank, and the EU, under the Economic Competitiveness Adjustment
Loan. Aside from banking sector weaknesses, impediments include a still restrictive trade
regime (especially vis-à-vis non-EU countries), labor market rigidities, and a business climate
not yet fully conducive to private sector dynamism. On trade, measures were taken in 2004 to
lower and simplify MFN tariffs and streamline customs procedures.
Tunisia continues to improve the quality and dissemination of statistical data and increase the
transparency of its economic policies. Tunisia has published all Executive Board documents
and staff mission statements in recent years, and intend to publish the 2004 Article IV Staff
Report and Selected Issues papers.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Tunisian authorities for the success in maintaining the
economy’s resilience and strength, notwithstanding recent shocks and sluggish growth in
Europe—Tunisia’s main export market. Directors noted that forward-looking and outwardoriented structural policies, in conjunction with prudent macroeconomic management and welltargeted social policies, have put Tunisia among the leaders in the region in terms of growth
and market-oriented reforms. They praised the authorities for maintaining close and productive
dialogue with the Fund.

Directors noted that, while the economic outlook for 2005 remains favorable—underpinned by a
rebound in tourism, agriculture, and exports—the main challenge for Tunisia is to solidify
conditions for strong, sustainable growth to attain lower-tier OECD income levels and reduce
unemployment. They therefore encouraged the authorities to take advantage of the current
environment to accelerate reforms aimed at raising the economy’s potential and creating a
business environment conducive to private investment. Appropriate sequencing of these
reforms while maintaining social cohesion will be key to the success of such efforts.
Directors welcomed the fact that the mix of monetary policy and gradual increase in exchange
rate flexibility has helped improve external competitiveness and strengthen the external
position. They agreed that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate, but encouraged
the authorities to remain vigilant against price pressures as the economy expands, in order to
safeguard the competitive gains that have been achieved thus far.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ phased approach to liberalizing capital flows and plan to
eventually float the dinar. They underlined the need to lay the groundwork for such a transition
by strengthening the banking sector, reducing public debt, and deepening the development of
money and foreign exchange markets. Directors welcomed the recent steps to increase the role
of market forces in determining the exchange rate—including decisions to reduce the surrender
requirement and to eliminate the requirement for banks to transfer foreign exchange balances to
the central bank on a daily basis, the “nivellement”—and encouraged the authorities to
discontinue posting bid/ask spreads for the exchange rate. They noted the considerable
progress that has been made in developing a monetary framework aimed at price stability,
which is a prerequisite for a floating exchange rate.
Directors expressed concern that banking sector weaknesses, especially the high level of
nonperforming loans (NPLs) could potentially constitute a major vulnerability. They welcomed
the steps taken recently to strengthen supervision and accounting standards, reduce NPLs, and
increase provisioning. However, Directors noted that additional measures are needed and
urged the authorities to adopt stricter provisioning rules, enforce sanctions against banks with
insufficient provisioning or capital, and reduce the government’s role in the financial sector.
They also encouraged the authorities to broaden the banking sector reform agenda in line with
the FSAP recommendations. In this connection, Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to
request an update to the 2002 FSAP. They underscored the importance of consolidating the
banking sector before any substantial progress is made toward an exchange rate float and
capital account liberalization.
Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to contain the negative impact of high oil prices on
the 2004 budget and supported their intention to carry out a broad reform of the tax system, with
technical assistance from the Fund. They stressed the need to adopt a budget for 2005
consistent with the objective of reducing the public debt-to-GDP ratio, especially external debt,
over the medium term. This, together with prudent debt management, will help strengthen
confidence in the currency. Directors urged the authorities to redouble their revenue-enhancing
efforts, through improving tax collection and administration, phasing out tax exemptions, and
widening the tax base. They also encouraged the authorities to undertake a reform of the
subsidies system and to consider a broad-based civil service reform to enhance the efficiency of

the public administration and contain the wage bill, while protecting allocations for health and
education. In this regard, the planned introduction of a performance-based budgeting system
should help guide budget decisions.
Directors commended the authorities’ structural reform efforts and noted that emphasis should
remain on enhancing the business climate, attracting foreign direct investment, and improving
the regulatory framework. They welcomed, in particular, the progress in integrating trade with
the European Union and the continued efforts to enhance regional integration within the
Maghreb region. Directors nevertheless highlighted the benefits of accelerating trade
liberalization on a multilateral basis, in terms of improved productivity and greater trade
opportunities. To this end, they encouraged the authorities to continue lowering most-favorednation tariffs within the 2005 budget law, and to reduce nontariff barriers, including by pursuing
further reforms in customs administration, and liberalizing the distribution and transportation
sectors. Directors welcomed the decision to study options for dismantling state import
monopolies.
Directors noted that the recent measures to enhance labor market flexibility are important steps
to reduce unemployment and support labor reallocation in response to changes in the economic
structure. They encouraged the authorities to streamline labor regulations, continue to pursue
active labor market policies, and explore further ways to enhance labor market flexibility, with a
view to ensuring that growth translates into reduced unemployment.
Directors commended the authorities’ record of transparency. They welcomed the ongoing
efforts to improve the quality and dissemination of statistics within the framework of the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), as well as the intention to update the 1999 data ROSC.
Directors welcomed the recent creation of a Financial Intelligence Unit and the adoption of a law
on anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). They looked
forward to the full implementation of the law, which is expected to contribute to a significant
improvement in the country’s AML/CFT regime.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Abbas Mirakhor, Executive Director for Tunisia
and Sadok Rouai, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
October 27, 2004
Key Points:
•

The Tunisian economy is continuing its recovery from the severe shocks experienced
in 2002;

•

The authorities strive to maintain a stable macroeconomic framework, move
gradually toward a floating exchange rate, and liberalize capital movements. They
intend to continue working closely with the IMF on macro-relevant issues, and with
the World Bank in identifying and prioritizing structural reforms;

•

Attention will be focused on (i) strengthening the banking sector and reducing NPLs,
and (ii) developing a comprehensive fiscal strategy to lower the ratio of public debt
to GDP;

•

Consolidation and modernization of the banking sector and moving toward capital
account liberalization are high on the authorities’ action plan for the
period 2004-09; and

•

A legislative framework for AML/CFT was introduced, and a Financial Intelligence
Unit (FIU) created. The authorities are planning an update to the 2001 FSAP and
the 1999 data ROSC.

Our authorities value their cooperation with the Fund that has contributed to advancing
Tunisia’s integration into the world economy. They express their gratitude to the Executive
Board, management, and staff for their support and advice. They also appreciate the wellbalanced staff report and the useful Selected Issues paper, and concur with staff’s
conclusions and policy recommendations.
The authorities agree that using the lower-tier OECD countries as benchmark helps identify
the remaining challenges facing Tunisia and serves as a practical framework for
implementation of the cross-country approach under Fund surveillance. Staff’s conclusion
that Tunisia needs to maintain a per-capita growth differential of 2-4 percent over a decade in
order to catch up with Poland and Mexico is a strong reminder to the authorities of the
important and multifaceted agenda of reforms that should be implemented. The authorities
recognize that short-term achievements, though encouraging, should not divert attention from
the importance of sustaining and accelerating reform efforts. In this connection, they
recognize three major challenges:
a) Sustained annual growth rate of more than 6 percent to reduce unemployment,
especially among young graduates.
b) The banking sector, both public and private, played a pioneering role in the launching
of private entrepreneurship in Tunisia, at times with little consideration to soundness. This
has contributed to the emergence of a weak credit culture and the build-up of a large stock of

-2NPLs, as highlighted in the FSAP and the staff paper. While measures for strengthening the
banking sector have been taken, much remains to be done to consolidate its financial
structure so as to enhance its competitiveness in a more open environment, thus allowing
banks to adequately support the private sector’s participation in the economy.
c) Tunisia is a country of narrow resource base with a limited domestic market and,
therefore, has little choice but to integrate into the global economy. While the authorities are
anchoring their economy to the European economy through the Association Agreement with
the European Union (AAEU) and the New Neighborhood Policy, they are persuaded that the
Maghreb region, as well, offers enormous untapped potential. In this context, they welcome
Fund’s efforts to assist in strengthening regional integration. To ensure further integration
into the global economy, they are committed to the maintenance of a stable macroeconomic
framework, to move gradually toward a floating exchange rate, and to liberalize capital
account. They intend to maintain close collaboration with the Fund on macro-relevant issues
and with the World Bank in identifying and prioritizing structural reforms.
As an indication of the authorities’ strong commitment to address these challenges and other
priorities, the President’s program for the 2004-09 term identifies a number of important
reforms and provides a detailed action plan. Consolidation and modernization of the banking
sector and the move toward capital account liberalization are high priorities in this program.
I.

Policy Focus:

The recovery of the Tunisian economy from the severe shocks experienced in 2002 (the
aftermath of the September 11 event and four consecutive years of drought) is well
underway, demonstrating that diversification and structural reforms have enhanced the
resilience of the economy. It also reflects the authorities’ ability to implement
macroeconomic policies under changing circumstances while maintaining a medium- to
long-term vision for adjustment and reform. In 2004, real GDP growth is expected to remain
robust as in 2003 (5.6 percent); the current account and fiscal deficits are to decline to less
than 3 percent of GDP; inflation is moderating after the pick-up in 2003 (2.6 percent year-toyear as of end-September 2004) and is expected to return to under 3 percent on average
by 2005; the external debt to GDP ratio is expected to decrease by 7 percentage points of
GDP in 2004; and unemployment continues to decline. The strength of economic growth is
being underpinned by greater flexibility in exchange rate and prudent monetary policies.
As the staff report suggests, the policy discussions focused on: (i) strengthening the banking
sector and reducing NPLs; and (ii) developing a comprehensive fiscal strategy to lower the
ratio of public debt to GDP.
The authorities share staff’s concern regarding the pick-up in NPLs. They agree with staff’s
conclusion that while their level does not pose systemic risks, it imposes efficiency costs on
the economy, contributes to a weakening of the banking sector, and hinders efforts to further
liberalize capital movements. During the 2004 Annual Meetings, the Governor of the Central
Bank reiterated to staff that reduction of NPLs is a priority not only for the Central Bank but
for the political authorities at the highest level. The objective of the Central Bank over the

-3next two fiscal years is to bring down NPLs to their 2001 level, i.e., 19 percent of total
outstanding credits, and to increase provisioning substantially. In addition to the actions
taken (Box 2 of the staff report), in particular the ban on dividends distribution by banks with
insufficient provisions, the implementation of the following measures is underway:
¾ The minimum delay for writing off a NPL has been reduced from two years to one,
and the rules for seizing collateral are being clarified and strengthened;
¾ Full tax deductibility for provisions will be introduced in the 2005 Budget Law;
¾ Asset management companies are being established to manage and dispose of hotels
seized as collateral for defaulted loans; and
¾ The Central Bank will play a proactive role in the loan recovery efforts of public
banks in a few large transactions. This is expected to send strong signals to both
debtors and creditors.
The authorities appreciate FSAP’s role in strengthening and prioritizing banking sector
reform since 2001, and, as detailed in Box 2 of the staff report, remain committed to
implementing staff’s recommendations. They agree that an update to FSAP will add
momentum to banking sector reforms; the timing of the update will be discussed in the next
staff visit.
During discussion with staff, the authorities expressed concern regarding the lack of agreed
international norms on the computation of NPLs, classification of bad loans, and
provisioning. They believe that regulations in Tunisia are stricter than in other countries,
placing the country in a disadvantageous position in cross-country analyses. Nevertheless,
they consider their approach as more prudent as it provides a better assessment of strength
and weaknesses of the banking sector. They urge the Fund to look into this issue as part of
the forthcoming review of the FSAP policy.
Despite the limited fiscal vulnerabilities revealed by the debt sustainability exercise, the
authorities concur with staff on the importance of further fiscal consolidation to enhance
flexibility in fiscal policy and to support the ongoing reform of the macroeconomic policy
framework. The objective is to reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio to 45 percent by
end-2009. To achieve this goal, the authorities are in the process of launching, with FAD
technical support, a major reform of tax policy and administration. They expect this reform to
improve the private sector environment, strengthen tax collection, and contribute to improved
competitiveness of the Tunisian economy.
The requirements of the two priority sectors, health and education, as well as the need to
modernize public administration and attract and retain skilled personnel impose constraints
on efforts to retrench the wage bill in the immediate period ahead. However, the authorities
are confident that the introduction of performance-based budgeting will lead to improved
efficiency and increased savings in public expenditures.
The authorities are presently in the process of finalizing the 2005 Budget and note with
concerns recent developments in oil markets which have a direct adverse impact on the fiscal
position and the balance of payments. In 2004, the authorities have implemented two
adjustments in retail prices and have introduced legislation to promote efficient use of

-4energy, including through mandatory audit for large users and encouragement of greater
reliance on renewable resources.
II.

Effectiveness of Surveillance:

It is worth noting that the recent biennial review of the implementation of the Fund’s
surveillance suggested that: “After exiting from an IMF-supported program in 1992, Tunisia
has maintained a close and productive policy dialogue with the Fund in the context of
surveillance. There seems to be a sense of appreciation for Fund’s policy advice as
contributing to the authorities’ success in achieving high economic growth and financial
stability. The authorities have consented to publication of country reports, which helped
reinforce investors’ positive view on the economy. The Fund’s policy advice also seems to
have been a useful input into the internal policy debate.”
Between 1986 and 1992, the authorities implemented adjustment and reform programs
supported by a SBA and an EFF, which allowed Tunisia to achieve three main objectives:
(i) to reestablish and maintain macroeconomic stability; (ii) to implement necessary
structural reforms leading to the diversification of the economy and strengthening its
resilience to shocks; and (iii) to establish an investment grade rating which allowed access to
international capital markets on favorable terms. In this context, Tunisia’s participation over
the years in Fund’s transparency, FSAP, and standards and codes initiatives has helped the
attainment of the above objectives, particularly in achieving a favorable perception among
investors. The following list is a record of this participation:
¾ PINs published since June 1997.
¾ Staff concluding statements published since June 1999 and Article IV staff reports
published since September 1999.
¾ SDDS subscriber since June 2001.
¾ FSAP and associated ROSC modules completed in 2001-2002 and the FSSA
published on June 2002.
¾ Dissemination by the Central Bank of daily monetary and financial indicators,
including international reserves, on its website.
¾ A press conference is held by staff at the conclusion of every Article IV mission.
¾ A press communiqué is issued following the monthly meeting of the Board of the
Central Bank.
In 1992, toward the end of the Fund-supported EFF, the authorities took two major
operational decisions regarding future relations with the Fund. First, they aligned the
macroeconomic framework underlying their Five-Year Development Plans with staff’s
medium-term projections. This process is still continuing during the design stage of each
Plan which helps to instill transparency and consistency in economic policy. Second, they
opted for regular staff visits between consultations. These visits receive the same degree of
attention as the regular Article IV consultation and culminate in the publication of staff’s
concluding statement. These visits produce an agreed framework of a monetary program for
the following year with quarterly indicative targets. These visits allow close coordination on
the content and coverage of the next Article IV consultation and agreement on the selected

-5issues to be prepared by staff to support specific policy conclusions and/or recommendations.
The following is a list of such papers prepared in recent years:
¾ Real exchange rate targeting—Tunisia’s experience (May 2001).
¾ Liberalization of the capital accounts—Progress achieved and prospects for full
convertibility (May 2002).
¾ Strengthening the monetary framework and instruments (July 2003).
¾ Assessing reserves adequacy in Tunisia (October 2004).
¾ Is Tunisia trading to its potential (October 2004).
¾ How does employment protection legislation affect unemployment (October 2004).
The authorities and staff have been successful in placing the Tunisia-Fund relations within a
multi-year work program involving a limited number of policy priorities. It is worth noting
that the 2004 biennial review of Fund surveillance has acknowledged the effectiveness of
such an approach. The current multi-year work program was developed in 2002 as a byproduct of the FSAP exercise. It focuses on the strategy to achieve capital account
convertibility and builds on the operational approach considered by the Board in 2001.1 This
strategy has allowed the authorities to: (i) confirm the absence of exchange rate misalignment
and gradually move away from targeting the REER; (ii) define the sequencing of capital
account liberalization; (iii) develop a monetary policy framework; (iv) assess the adequacy of
international reserves; and (v) advance banking sector reforms. Tunisia’s gradual strategy to
liberalizing capital movements will be assessed by the IEO as part of the forthcoming
evaluation of the IMF’s approach to capital account liberalization.
We conclude by reiterating that, as before, the authorities look forward to Board discussion
of this year’s staff report and value immensely Directors’ views, guidance, and support.
