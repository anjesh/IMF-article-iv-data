STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND THIRD POST-PROGRAM MONITORING DISCUSSIONS

KEY ISSUES
Context: Iceland’s economy is on a path to recovery and the outlook is for continued
gradual expansion, although legacy vulnerabilities weigh on growth. The newly-formed
coalition government has stated its main policy priorities: creating an investment-friendly
environment—including through tax cuts—and providing further household debt relief.
The fiscal implications remain unclear, although the government has acknowledged the
need to maintain fiscal discipline. In staff’s view, the overarching policy challenge is to create
a foundation for durable growth by resolving crisis legacy problems.
Capital controls: An orderly lifting of capital controls is needed to remove potential
growth-hindering distortions while safeguarding the external position. This will require a
comprehensive approach that addresses potential balance-of-payments drains stemming
from the winding up of the old bank estates, from the liquid offshore krona overhang, and
from portfolio rebalancing by residents.
Monetary policy: The central bank’s monetary stance is appropriate. With the recent
softening of economic activity, little change in the policy rate is needed to gradually bring
inflation down to the 2½ percent target.
Fiscal policy: Adhering to the medium-term fiscal targets is key to ensure fiscal
sustainability, preserve confidence, and cement market access—crucial for an orderly lifting
of controls. Recognizing the fiscal slippages so far in 2013, the authorities signaled their
intention to meet the 2014 target of a balanced budget. High quality measures will be
important to ensure the durability of fiscal consolidation efforts.
Debt restructuring: Further reductions in household debt will require intensified efforts
under existing restructuring frameworks. The authorities are also considering additional
across-the-board debt relief. However, there is little fiscal space for additional relief.
Any new measures should therefore be targeted on distressed households.
Financial sector policy: Safeguarding financial stability calls for heightened supervisory
oversight and a stronger financial stability framework, including clear procedures for
emergency liquidity assistance, a permanent legal framework for bank resolution, and a
strong deposit insurance scheme. High bank capital and liquidity buffers should be
maintained. A comprehensive plan to reform the Housing Financing Fund is critical.

COMPLETING THE RECOVERY
The authorities’ decisive and comprehensive response to the 2008–09 crisis has put the
Icelandic economy on a path to recovery. The prospect is for continued gradual
expansion, but legacy vulnerabilities are creating headwinds.

2.
The authorities responded decisively. Their policies were characterized by strong
ownership and were supported by a Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund. The key policies were:


Halt the krona depreciation by imposing capital controls and tightening monetary policy.



Put public finances on a sustainable path with a multi-year fiscal consolidation, phased so as
to give rein to automatic stabilizers designed to provide a cushion for vulnerable groups.



Rebuild the banking system and support private debt restructuring, while limiting the public
sector’s absorption of bank crisis costs. Strengthen supervision and prudential regulation.

3.
The newly-elected government is formulating its policies. The two-party coalition which
took office in May has expressed support in principle for key elements of the previous government’s
macroeconomic and financial program, but also plans extensive tax cuts and large write-downs of
household debt. The authorities are still working on developing measures that would render these
policies consistent with the broader objective of maintaining economic stability and staying on
course with fiscal consolidation.

B. Recovery in the Face of Headwinds
4.
Four years on, strong implementation is bearing fruit and the economy is gradually
recovering (Annex I). The capital controls ended a vicious depreciation-inflation spiral and helped
stabilize the economy. The fiscal consolidation shifted the primary balance from deficit to surplus
and has put public debt on a declining path. Iceland’s new banks, subject to tougher supervision, are
liquid and well capitalized and nonperforming loan ratios have declined. Household and corporate
debt levels are falling. The external position has improved and gross international reserves exceed
short-term debt. Growth turned positive in 2011, unemployment has declined, and inflation has
come down. Iceland has benefitted from rating agency upgrades and regained market access.
5.
The policy adjustment was supported by a real depreciation, which boosted
competitiveness. The krona depreciated by 40 percent in real terms at the onset of the crisis and
then stabilized. While the response of

undervalued, but note the uncertainty
surrounding the size of the undervaluation and the speed at which it will unwind while private and
public entities continue their FX deleveraging and capital controls are lifted.
6.
However, legacy vulnerabilities weigh on growth. Real output is still 10 percent below its
pre-crisis peak. GDP growth, which reached 2.9 percent in 2011, slowed to 1.6 percent in 2012 amid
private sector deleveraging and weak external demand.


Deleveraging is constraining consumption and investment. Private consumption
weakened in the second half of 2012, as one-off supporting factors (early pension
withdrawals and mortgage interest subsidies) waned and households and firms continued
paying down debt (Box 2). Fiscal consolidation, while necessary to reduce high public debt,
is limiting the public sector contribution to growth.



Slow progress in removing the capital controls is undermining confidence. While the
controls safeguarded external and financial stability during the crisis, slow progress in lifting
them is undermining confidence and inhibiting investment. At the same time, uncertainty

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

ICELAND

about exchange-rate developments following the lifting of controls has hindered the
anchoring of inflation expectations.


Legacy risks in the financial sector are holding back credit expansion. Banks are still
burdened by bad assets and continue grappling with uncertain loan valuations and risks
stemming from their reliance on captive funds locked in by capital controls.



The challenging external environment is weighing on exports. In 2012, less favorable
terms of trade and weak external demand for real goods exports more than offset the
improvement in services exports, notably tourism.
Box 1. Iceland: External Competitiveness
Iceland has maintained its post-crisis gain in external competitiveness. The krona depreciated
by around 40 percent in real effective terms at the onset of the crisis and its value has stayed low.
As a result, the trade balance has improved and export shares to European countries have
increased. However, Iceland’s share of world exports has remained flat, likely reflecting the
sluggish demand, relative to the rest of the world, in its largely European trading partners.

Staff analysis suggests that the REER is moderately undervalued relative to medium-term
fundamentals. This assessment is unchanged from the 2012 Article IV. The three standard CGER
methodologies point to a real undervaluation in the range of 4 to 20 percent. The macroeconomic
balance (MB) approach points to a slightly greater undervaluation compared to 2012, reflecting
Iceland’s stronger growth relative to trading partners. The external stability (ES) approach
estimates a current account deficit of slightly less than 3 percent of GDP to stabilize net foreign
assets at the end-2012 level of -61 percent of GDP and a misalignment of 7 percent. The
equilibrium exchange rate approach, which is influenced by the considerably more appreciated
real exchange rate in the past, points to a bigger misalignment, some 20 percent.
The assessment is complicated by the capital controls. Despite the medium-term real
undervaluation, pressures for nominal depreciation will likely emerge when the capital account is
liberalized and as highly indebted companies continue to deleverage.

Box 2. Private Sector Deleveraging
Debt has declined significantly, but further deleveraging should be expected. The restructuring of
exchange rate-indexed loans (following a court ruling that such loans were illegal) and banks’ voluntary
restructuring of other loans have reduced household debt by 14 percent and corporate debt by
45 percent, larger reductions than in other countries during current and previous crises. International
experience, however, suggests that further household adjustment should be expected. Peak-to-trough
deleveraging of Swedish and Finnish households in the 1990s took as long as 8 years with debt declining
by 30 percentage points.

Unique characteristics of Icelandic household debt complicate the deleveraging process. Household
debt consists largely of home mortgages that are CPI-indexed, implying that the debt stock rises with
inflation. Moreover, 85 percent of mortgages were issued in 2005–07 and have long maturities and backloaded repayment profiles.
High private sector debt weighs on consumption and investment. Consumption is still 20 percent
below its pre-crisis peak and 10 percent below trend, somewhat stronger than in euro area program
countries but weaker than in other advanced economies. Domestic investment is about 20 percent below
trend despite significant corporate debt deleveraging, likely reflecting factors such as capital controls.
Growth will therefore likely remain modest for some time. To illustrate, average private consumption
growth in Sweden and Finland hovered around 1 percent during the deleveraging period before rising to
2½ percent post-deleveraging. Cross-country comparisons also show a negative relationship between
private sector balance sheet stress and growth.

monetary stance helps anchor inflation
expectations. Public and external debt ratios, though still high, are projected to decline as fiscal
consolidation continues, although some fiscal slippage from 2012 and 2013 is built into the baseline.
8.
The external balance is expected to be dominated by the lifting of capital controls.
Staff’s baseline scenario is based on the authorities’ capital account liberalization strategy and
assumes that adequate reserve buffers are maintained. Liquid offshore kronas are released via the
channels envisaged in the authorities’ strategy by end-2016, one year later than in the previous staff
report, reflecting weaker FDI and hence less foreign exchange available to help release offshore
krona. Some easing of capital controls starts in 2017, with proper measures to contain outflows from
residents as they rebalance their portfolios toward foreign assets. Starting in 2017, large foreign
currency payments by the old banks’ estates to foreign creditors are assumed to flow gradually and
be partially offset by government external borrowing, helping to keep reserves at comfortable levels.
Temporary inflationary pressures that may arise from the exchange rate volatility during the lifting of
controls are expected to be contained by an appropriate monetary policy response.
9.
The authorities are more optimistic on growth prospects than staff. They expect a
rebound in growth from 1.8 percent this year to 3 percent next year as private consumption and
investment return to trend. Staff acknowledged uncertainty surrounding the speed of private sector
deleveraging and its impact on growth. In this context, employer groups drew a distinction
between larger companies, which had made good progress restructuring their debt and might
therefore be in a position to resume investing and smaller companies, many of which were still
constrained by debt service payments, given that growth had turned out slower than expected.
10.
Staff and the authorities see risks to the outlook as tilted to the downside. Slow progress
in lifting capital controls could undermine confidence in an orderly liberalization while increasing the
risk that prolonged controls will fuel asset bubbles, inhibit investment, and reduce productivity (see
paragraph 13 for appropriate policy responses). Fiscal consolidation could be weakened by additional
spending to meet the policy priorities of the new government and reliance on uncertain, one-off

measures, putting at risk continued market access critical for capital account liberalization (see
paragraphs 19–20 for appropriate policy responses). Further delays in energy-intensive-sector
investments could reduce growth and damage confidence. While Iceland’s direct exposure to a
growth slowdown in emerging markets is limited, adverse euro area developments could have a
significant impact on Iceland through trade and FDI channels. The authorities however emphasized
that financial spillovers from the euro area will likely be muted by Iceland’s capital controls.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS—ADDRESSING LEGACY
VULNERABILITIES TO REINVIGORATE GROWTH
11.
Discussions with the authorities focused on policies that support strong and
sustainable growth by dealing with legacy vulnerabilities. A clear and comprehensive roadmap
for capital account liberalization is needed to remove potential growth-hindering distortions while
safeguarding Iceland’s external position. The monetary policy stance and framework should be
geared toward bringing inflation down to target. Fiscal consolidation needs to be completed in
order to reduce debt and protect growth. Debt restructuring needs to be concluded to strengthen
domestic demand and support growth. And financial sector risks must be addressed so as to
safeguard financial and economic stability.

A. Putting in Place a Credible Roadmap to Lift Capital Controls
Progress in removing capital controls has been limited. A comprehensive approach is needed
that begins with resolving the old bank estates, sets a clear time-bound strategy to deal with
offshore krona, and prepares for the lifting of capital account restrictions.
Background
12.
Progress in lifting capital controls has been limited. Key steps remain to be taken to set
the stage for orderly liberalization by addressing potential balance of payments drains related to the
winding up of the old bank estates, the liquid offshore krona overhang, and potential portfolio
rebalancing by residents. Furthermore, maturing external foreign currency loans by financial and
non-financial corporations could also add to the foreign exchange outflows.


Old bank estates. The winding-up of the estates will distribute a large stock of domestic
assets (40–50 percent of GDP) to nonresidents. In the process, the servicing of the
Landsbanki compensation bond could put additional pressure on the balance of payments.
Legislative changes in March 2012 and subsequent amendments gave the authorities tools
to contain the reserve drain from the distributions: the old banks will need to seek
exemptions to the capital controls in order to proceed.



Liquid offshore kronas. Under the current strategy, liquid offshore kronas are to be
released through auctions, swaps of krona securities into long-term Eurobonds, and an exit
levy. Two years into the strategy, only the auction channel has been opened and the uptake
has been limited—the stock of offshore kronas remains at 22 percent of GDP. To strengthen
incentives to participate in the strategy, recent legislation scrapped the terminal date for the
capital controls. Although this initiative was a necessary step, on its own it did not accelerate
the release of offshore kronas, suggesting that incentives are still not sufficient.



Lifting of restrictions on capital account transactions. A more general easing of controls
will begin only when the above two issues have been addressed and the appropriate

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ICELAND

financial and macroeconomic conditions are in place. Design of the macroprudential
measures to support lifting restrictions is still at an early stage.
Policy Discussion
13.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the need for a comprehensive approach to lifting
the controls. The new government supports the principle of a conditions-based strategy. Staff
emphasized the need to lay out a clear and credible roadmap, with the building blocks elaborated
and properly sequenced, to set appropriate incentives, build confidence in the strategy, and
minimize circumvention.


Resolution of old bank estates. The first step will be to develop a plan to handle old banks’
domestic asset distribution in a manner consistent with external stability.



Release of liquid offshore krona. Staff supported the authorities’ intention, once the old
banks estates have been resolved, to publish a strategy that sets a clear implementation
timeline, clarifies the treatment of holdouts, and ensures enforcement.



Lifting the restrictions on capital account transactions. Staff estimates that following the
lifting of controls, resident outflows from portfolio rebalancing could be in the order of 20 to
40 percent of GDP over a number of years.1 To prepare for this, staff encouraged the
authorities to explore options to protect external and financial stability while capital controls
are lifted. These could include “speed limits” on outflows, as is already foreseen for pension
funds, and a phased liberalization that takes into account the different types and maturities
of outflows. The authorities thought that staff’s estimates of potential resident outflows were
too pessimistic, in particular because they did not sufficiently account for possible offsetting
inflows. The authorities were therefore skeptical about the need for “speed limits” on nonpension-fund resident outflows. All agreed, however, that strong prudential regulations and
supervision would be needed to mitigate risks.

B. Securing Progress on Inflation
Decisive action from the central bank, including through foreign exchange intervention, has
helped bring inflation down towards the target. Foreign exchange purchases now need to
resume in order to build up non-borrowed reserves.
Background
14.
With inflation stubbornly above target, the central bank has taken action. It raised
policy rates by a cumulative 125 basis points in 2012 before pausing in November. During the
winter, the CBI also intervened in the foreign exchange market, reversing a depreciation that resulted

from temporary factors but threatened to
pass through to prices. Inflation—at
3.3 percent in June—has been moving back
toward the CBI’s 2½ percent target.
Monetary transmission remains weak,
however. Banks hold large excess reserves,
market interest rates hover at the bottom of
the policy interest rate corridor, and inflation
expectations have not yet converged to the
target rate of inflation (Figure 3).

C. Ensuring Sustainable Fiscal Consolidation
Iceland has made significant progress with fiscal consolidation since the crisis. The
challenge now is to complete the process in order to bring the public debt ratio down to a
prudent level, cement market confidence, and support durable market access.
Background
Iceland’s post-crisis fiscal consolidation has been impressive. The adjustment program

was well designed and effectively implemented: it was large enough to put Iceland’s public finances
on a sustainable footing, gradual enough to not undercut the recovery, and credible enough to
reassure markets. The consolidation was also designed in way that preserved the Nordic welfare
model and protected vulnerable groups (see panel). All in all, the primary general government
balance swung from a deficit of 6.5 percent of GDP in 2009 to a surplus of 0.6 percent in 2012,
putting the public debt ratio on a declining path. Iceland has regained market access with two
successful U.S. dollar-denominated bond issuances in 2011 and 2012, and has benefited from ratings
upgrades and a significant reduction in sovereign bond spreads (Figure 4).

15.
Staff supported the central bank’s monetary stance. With the recent softening of
economic activity, model-based projections suggest that little change in the policy interest rate is
needed to gradually bring inflation to the 2½ percent target. Staff encouraged the authorities to
take advantage of the recent seasonal appreciation of the krona to resume foreign exchange
purchases in order to build up nonborrowed reserves. The authorities explained that while this was
their medium-term objective, their priority was to reduce inflation as much as possible and promote
benign wage dynamics. The central bank agreed that more could be done through liquidity
management operations to position the interbank rate in the middle of the policy interest rate
corridor. They nevertheless highlighted structural issues with the interbank market—arising from, for
example, market dominance and capital controls—that weaken monetary transmission.

This consolidation has, however, increasingly relied on one-off or uncertain revenues,

while fiscal risks persist.


2013 budget implementation. Fiscal outcomes in 2013 have been significantly weaker than
expected. On current trends, the 2013 budget deficit target (1.3 percent of GDP) will be
missed by about 1½ percent of GDP, driven primarily by expenditure overruns (0.6 percent
of GDP), the materialization of fiscal risks (0.5 percent of GDP)—including lower-thanbudgeted dividend receipts and asset sales—and slower than projected growth (0.2 percent
of GDP).



2014 budget preparation. The existing target for 2014, a balanced budget, may come
under pressure from costly electoral promises—including those to lower taxes and to
increase household debt relief—the financing of which remains uncertain. Additional risks
stem from uncertain revenues from asset sales and dividend payments, amounting to
1 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

ICELAND



Medium term. The medium-term adjustment plan, which targets a 5 percent of GDP primary
surplus in 2016––compared to 0.6 percent of GDP in 2012—relies in part on uncertain asset
sales and unidentified fiscal measures. Furthermore, in the absence of restructuring, the
Housing Financing Fund (HFF) requires yearly transfers of about 0.2 percent of GDP to cover
its losses and may require further capital injections to bring its capital adequacy in line with
the target of 5 percent.

Policy Discussion
18.

The new government is still formulating its medium-term fiscal plan. Staff expressed

concern about the sizeable fiscal slippage in 2013 and risks for 2014 and stressed that adhering to
the existing fiscal targets for 2014 and 2016 was critical. They strike a good balance between
supporting growth, ensuring that debt is on a downward trajectory, and increasing fiscal buffers in
the face of new risks, including from the HFF. Conversely, unless fiscal slippages are addressed,
Iceland’s public debt and debt service will remain high (see Annex III, Annex Figure 1). Staying on
course will also support market confidence, which will contain borrowing costs and facilitate
continued market access, crucial for a successful lifting of capital controls. Moreover, as controls are
lifted, and captured funds are released, the government’s interest costs could increase, underscoring
the need to make progress now. Staff also advocated a swift passage of the draft Public Finances
Act—which the authorities plan to submit to parliament in the fall—to strengthen budget discipline
and accountability.
19.

The 2014 target, a balanced budget, is still within reach. Staff highlighted that the target

(adjusted marginally to account for slower-than-anticipated growth) could be reached with
measures of 1½ percent of GDP over the next 18 months. Measures could include reducing
agricultural subsidies, better targeting social transfers, and raising the lowest VAT rate (with
offsetting subsidies to the most vulnerable groups). These measures could generate over 2 percent
of GDP in fiscal adjustment, helping to address

past slippages and additional fiscal risks in 2014.

Measure

The authorities said that they would strive to meet
the target, but noted that this would be
challenging given the fiscal slippages in 2013 and
the policy priorities of the new government.
Nevertheless, they signaled that they would
consider rolling back some initiatives
implemented by the previous government and
identifying new measures.

For the medium term, staff encouraged the authorities to identify more durable

sources of fiscal consolidation. In this regard, cross-country analysis suggests that savings can be
achieved in health and education without compromising the quality of outcomes. In these sectors,

bridging half of the efficiency gap between Iceland and countries on the efficiency frontier could
generate 3 percent of GDP in expenditure savings.2 The authorities acknowledged the need to
improve efficiency in these sectors and have been working on implementing the relevant OECD
recommendations, particularly in health. They also emphasized that their planned policies—
including tax cuts and a more welcoming investment environment—would boost revenues, spur
growth, and help bring down deficit and debt ratios. While supporting the overall goal of improving
investment environment, staff noted that lowering tax rates is unlikely to generate higher revenue—
since cross-country studies suggest that Laffer curve effects occur at higher tax rates than present in
Iceland—and will likely have only a limited near-term impact on growth given the relatively low
multipliers.

D. Bringing Debt Restructuring to a Conclusion
Progress has been made with corporate and household debt restructuring, but the pace is
slowing. Efforts therefore need to be intensified to complete the remaining cases. There is little
fiscal space for additional household debt relief.
Background
21.

There has been progress with corporate and household debt restructuring. Banks

finalized the bulk of corporate debt restructuring in 2012 and the still outstanding cases are taking
time because of ongoing legal disputes or their inherent complexity. By end-2012, corporate debt
had reached 170 percent of GDP, down 205 percentage points from its 2008 peak (Figure 7).
Household debt restructuring has also advanced, albeit at a slower pace, with debt still high at
109 percent of GDP, 24 percentage points below the 2009 peak.
22.

The pace of resolving remaining cases has been slow. Still-pending Supreme Court

rulings on foreign currency-related financial contracts are delaying the resolution of many cases. In
the absence of legal clarity, banks have been reluctant to pursue collections or use the threat of legal
action to bring noncurrent borrowers to the negotiation table. The relevant government agencies
have also been slow in addressing cases, citing as reasons their lack of legal authority under the
existing framework and the inadequacy of resources. The HFF has only seen a limited decline in its
NPLs, reflecting weak effort in collection and debt restructuring.
Policy Discussion
23.

The new government reiterated its commitment to additional household debt relief, a

key electoral promise. The Prime Minister will oversee preparation of proposals (to be available by
November 2013) for further relief—which will likely include a reduction in the principal of inflation2

See Selected Issues Paper, “Assessing Efficiency of Public Spending on Health and Education in Iceland.”

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ICELAND

indexed mortgages. Staff emphasized that there is little fiscal space for new measures and that
across-the-board measures are costly and may not provide sufficient relief to households in most
distress. The authorities are of the view that this is not a fiscal issue since the initiative would most
likely be financed by a windfall obtained through haircuts on the asset distribution of the old banks
to their foreign creditors. Staff noted that such a windfall is uncertain and, in any case, if it does
materialize a better use for it would be to reduce still-high public debt.
24.

Staff instead urged the authorities to intensify efforts to complete the existing

restructuring process. This would address the problems of households in distress and support a
healthy resumption of credit. Within the existing framework, government agencies should be able to
match the progress made by the banks. Staff therefore encouraged the authorities to identify and
address bottlenecks, including by revising legislation and regulations where needed. In a welcome
development, the authorities have passed legislation to accelerate court procedures clarifying the
status of foreign-exchange-indexed loans. Accelerating resolutions by reducing the backlog of
appeals under the Debtors Ombudsman´s framework should also be a priority. Staff emphasized that
any new measures should be targeted on distressed households falling through the cracks of the
existing programs—including households with deeply-underwater guarantor or HFF mortgages, and
those who bought their first home during the boom years.

E. Reducing Legacy Risks in the Financial Sector
Financial sector conditions have improved, but legacy risks still need to be addressed.
A comprehensive plan is needed to deal with the loss-making HFF. And while there have
been welcome improvements, the financial stability framework needs further
strengthening.
Background
25.

The condition of the banking system has improved, but legacy risks remain high. The

three largest banks’ average capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is 25.5 percent. Nonperforming loans on a
facility basis declined from the peak of 18.3 percent at end-2010 to 6.4 percent at end-2012. Loan
valuation uncertainty is magnified by the possibility of legal challenges related to FX-linked loans.
Liquidity is strong, but banks are still reliant on captive and on-demand deposits (Figure 5).
26.

The HFF is in a difficult financial position. Losses are mounting (ISK 52 billion since 2008),

capital adequacy is weak (3.2 percent at end 2012), and the level of non-performing loans remains
high (14.8 percent at end-April). The fund faces significant prepayment risk, high asset impairments,
and elevated operating costs. Maintaining capital adequacy at the current level would likely require
annual capital injections of at least ISK 3-4 billion (0.2 percent of GDP).
27.

Financial supervision is being strengthened. The authorities are setting up a Financial

Stability Council, tasked with identifying and containing systemic risks. The Financial Supervisory

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ICELAND

Authority (FME) is advancing its reform agenda to improve risk-based supervision, reporting by
supervised entities, and its internal organizational structure.
Policy Discussion
28.

Staff emphasized that still-substantial risks call for heightened supervisory oversight.

Banks’ profitability is increasingly challenged by declining revenues from asset revaluations, weak
credit demand, and high operating costs (Figure 6). A new round of household debt restructuring
would also likely have adverse implications for the banks, as they may have to further write down
loan values, and borrowers may suspend payments in anticipation of restructuring. Staff therefore
argued that banks should conserve capital and build more stable sources of funding to address
liquidity risks. Staff encouraged the introduction of uniform rules for loan classification, including a
conservative prudential treatment for restructured loans, and noted that this would need to be
backed by intensive onsite supervision, requiring enhanced supervisory resources. A Basel Core
Principles ROSC assessment planned for March 2014 should help identify and address supervisory
gaps.
29.

There was broad agreement that the HFF requires an overhaul. Staff argued that given

the fiscal and financial stability risks emerging from the fund, its mandate and institutional set-up
need to be reviewed from the ground up, preferably by independent experts. Further recapitalization
should wait until a permanent and financially viable solution is agreed. The FME indicated that it
plans a supervisory review (SREP) of HFF’s capital adequacy this fall but noted that it does not have
sufficient legal powers to require corrective action; the HFF is under the auspices of the Ministry of
Welfare.
30.

Staff welcomed plans to strengthen the financial stability framework. The planned

capital account liberalization underscores the need for reinforcing regulations that limit maturity and
currency mismatches. The draft liquidity rules implementing the Basel III framework, strengthened to
reflect local risks (such as the reliance on captive and on-demand funds), go in the right direction. In
addition, the authorities shared staff’s views on the need to enhance financial safety nets in advance
of the capital controls removal. This would require introducing clear procedures for emergency
liquidity assistance, establishing a permanent legal framework for bank resolution, and
strengthening funding arrangements for the deposit insurance scheme. All agreed that
implementing the proposed inter-agency framework for tackling systemic risks should be a priority.

POST-PROGRAM MONITORING
31.
Iceland’s reserve position is comfortable. The baseline balance of payments outlook—
which incorporates gradual capital account liberalization and deleveraging of highly indebted
companies—shows reserves as staying above 100 percent of short-term debt for the projection
horizon. External debt is also projected to continue declining. Iceland’s contingent liabilities—and
economic uncertainty more broadly—have been reduced by the European Free Trade Association

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

ICELAND

(EFTA) court judgment that Iceland did not breach its obligations under the European Economic Area
(EEA) treaty in the so-called Icesave case.
32.
But risks remain. As set out in paragraph 10, risks arise from: the uncertainty surrounding
capital account liberalization; a weakening of fiscal consolidation; delays in investment in the energy
intensive sector; and adverse Euro area developments. Strong policy implementation would help
mitigate these risks. Taking a comprehensive approach to lifting the capital controls will safeguard
external and financial stability. Staying on course with fiscal consolidation will maintain market
confidence and support continued market access. Buttressing non-borrowed reserves through
foreign exchange purchases—taking advantage of seasonal krona appreciation—would help support
reserve adequacy.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
The recovery is continuing, but crisis legacies are restraining growth. Unemployment is
still declining but growth has slowed amid private sector deleveraging and weak external demand.
Financial conditions have improved but legacy risks are still holding back credit expansion.
Uncertainty about the lifting of capital controls is weighing on confidence and investment.
Competitiveness gains have been sustained, which should help attract investment and support the
recovery. In this regard, the authorities’ intentions to create a more inviting investment environment
are welcome.
34.
Legacy vulnerabilities need to be addressed. A clear and comprehensive roadmap is
needed to safely lift capital controls and remove potential growth-hindering distortions. The
monetary policy stance and framework should be geared toward bringing inflation down to target.
Fiscal consolidation needs to be completed in order to reduce public debt and protect growth.
Financial sector risks must be tackled so as to safeguard stability.
35.
An orderly lifting of capital controls requires a comprehensive approach. First, the
winding up of the old banks should be handled in a manner consistent with external and financial
stability. Second, incentives to participate in the authorities’ capital account liberalization strategy to
release liquid offshore krona need to be strengthened by publishing a well-defined strategy with a
clear implementation timeline. Third, potential resident outflows following the easing of controls can
be contained by imposing “speed limits” on outflows or by phasing liberalization by asset type. This
should be supported by strong prudential regulations and supervision.
36.
The monetary policy stance is in line with the central bank’s inflation objectives. With
the recent softening of economic activity, little change in the policy interest rate is needed to
gradually bring inflation to target. The foreign exchange interventions conducted in the winter
helped smooth a depreciation stemming from temporary factors. Looking forward, foreign exchange
purchases to build up nonborrowed reserves should resume.
37.
Recent slippages highlight the importance of adhering to Iceland’s existing fiscal
targets and improving the quality of the adjustment. The targets strike a good balance between

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ICELAND

supporting growth, ensuring that debt is on a downward trajectory, and increasing fiscal buffers in
the face of new risks. The authorities’ intention to maintain the 2014 target of a balanced budget is
therefore welcome. However, the adjustment should be supported by durable measures.
Consideration could be given to improving expenditure efficiency in health and education, reducing
agricultural subsidies, and better targeting social transfers. Fiscal discipline and governance would
also be strengthened by enacting the proposed framework budget law.
38.
There is little fiscal space for additional household debt relief. Any new measures should
thus be targeted on distressed households falling through the cracks of existing programs. There is
scope, however, to improve existing restructuring processes and to intensify debt restructuring
efforts at the HFF. In this context, the government’s initiative to accelerate court procedures
clarifying the status of foreign-exchange-indexed loans is welcome. In addition, the authorities
should identify and address bottlenecks in order to speed up resolution within the Debtors’
Ombudsman framework.
39.
Still-substantial risks call for strengthening financial sector oversight. Banks should
continue to maintain strong capital and liquidity buffers, improve their funding profile, and address
nonperforming loans. Plans to strengthen the financial safety net need to be advanced, and the
proposed inter-agency framework for tackling systemic risks should be implemented. The HFF
should be reformed, after a comprehensive review of its mandate and institutional set-up.

1/ Historical data are semi-accrual; projections are modified cash.
2/ Excludes write-offs recorded as capital transfers and revenues from the exit tax. Write-offs in 2008 are the result of CBI
recapitalization and securities lending contracts that failed following the banks' collapse. Write-offs in 2009 reflect the retroactive interest
paid to new banks to compensate for late capitalization. Write-offs in 2010 reflect called guarantees of the State Guarantee Fund and
HFF recapitalization. Write-offs in 2011 reflect recapitalization of the savings bank and does not include the state's revaluation of its
equity holdings in the Regional Development Institute and the NSA Ventures since these are valuation changes recorded in the balance
sheet of the government. Write-offs in 2012 reflect the recapitalization of the HFF.
3/ Excludes asset sales.
4/ Includes bilateral loans and international bond issuance to support foreign currency reserves at the Central Bank of Iceland (CBI). The
loan from the Norwegian government directly to the CBI is excluded from general government debt. Does not include Fund liabilities.
5/ Gross debt minus liquid assets at the CBI (including assets to support CBI reserves, which are assumed to be liquid).
6/ In percent of potential GDP. Structural estimates for 2008-2009 account for the impact of the asset bust price cycle.

Annex I. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF
Policy Recommendations
IMF 2012 Article IV Recommendations

Authorities’ Response

Fiscal Policy

Broadly Consistent

Complete fiscal adjustment in line with the
authorities’ medium-term fiscal objectives.
Contingency measures should be identified in
case implementation risks materialize in 2012.
Submit to parliament new legislation on an
organic budget law.

Monetary Policy
With inflation and inflation expectations above
the central bank’s inflation target, policy interest
rates should rise.
Capital Controls
A gradual approach remains essential. The speed
of liberalization will have to be adapted to the
strength of the balance of payments outlook,
reserve adequacy, and the need to safeguard
financial stability. The conditions for lifting the
controls may well take additional time (beyond
end-2013) to be fully met.

There were slippages relative to the mediumterm plan because uncertain one-off revenues
did not materialize—there were no
contingency measures—and expenditures rose
in an election season. The new government
aims to maintain the 2014 target but its
proposed tax cuts and spending hikes risk
producing less ambitious medium-term fiscal
outcomes. The draft Public Finances Act will be
submitted to parliament in the fall of 2013.
Consistent
The central bank took decisive action—raising
policy rates by a cumulative 125 basis points in
2012 before pausing in November.
Broadly Consistent
The 2013 legislative deadline for lifting the
controls was removed. The authorities are

maintaining a conditions-based approach.

Private Sector Debt Restructuring

Partly Consistent

Debt restructuring must be brought to
completion as soon as possible, and new calls for
across-the-board writedowns of household debt
should be resisted.

There has been progress with corporate and
household debt restructuring but the pace of
resolving the remaining cases is slowing. Plans for
additional relief have been announced.

Financial Sector

Broadly Consistent

Additional efforts needed to reduce
vulnerabilities. The HFF still needs to be fully
recapitalized. Financial sector supervision must be
further strengthened.

Banks are liquid and well-capitalized, but legacy
risks remain. The HFF was partially recapitalized
but remains in a difficult financial condition.
Financial supervision is being strengthened.

Annex II. Assessing Labor Productivity1
Iceland’s economy is recovering but its longer-term prospects depend on its ability to remain
competitive. The krona depreciation during the crisis has more than offset rising unit labor costs.
However, with continuing wage pressures and the possibility of an exchange rate appreciation in the
medium term, increasing labor productivity is critical. This annex assesses Iceland’s productivity by
decomposing total factor productivity into technology and efficiency—or how effectively a country uses
its factors of production. The annex concludes that Iceland’s efficiency compares well with its peers.
1.
Iceland’s labor productivity growth does well in comparison with other Nordic
countries. During 1993-2008, the growth of labor productivity—defined as GDP per hour worked—
averaged 2.4 percent, second highest
among the Nordics. Labor productivity

Labor productivity growth remained positive during the crisis, as hours worked declined, and turned
negative only in 2010–11 when hours worked recovered faster than output.
2.
Wages have increased faster than productivity, pushing unit labor costs up. Despite
increasing labor productivity, unit labor costs grew by 5½ percent from 1998 to 2011, more than
twice the Nordic average of 2½ percent. The sectors that saw the highest growth were construction
(7.8 percent)—which saw very little productivity growth—and financial services (7.4 percent). Both
sectors also grew strongly in other Nordic countries although growth rates were lower than Iceland’s.

3.
Nonetheless, competitiveness was restored at the time of the crisis when exchangerate-adjusted unit labor costs dropped significantly. During 1994–2007, unit labor costs adjusted
for the exchange rate grew on average by more than 6 percent annually before declining by some
40 percent during 2008–09, as a result of the krona depreciation. In 2010–11, rising wages and an
appreciating krona reversed the decline.
4.
Capital deepening contributed to the growth of labor productivity before the crisis. A
standard growth accounting approach shows that more than half of labor productivity growth came
from capital deepening from 1998–2008. This reflects the high rate of investment in the energyintensive sector and construction. In contrast, Finland and Sweden’s labor productivity growth is
accounted for largely by rising total factor productivity. However, growth accounting over time
shows that the contribution of capital deepening became more pronounced in the run-up to the
crisis, while that of total factor productivity (TFP) declined, reflecting growing resource misallocation
in the economy.

5.
A stochastic frontier model is used to estimate the components that drive TFP. TFP is
decomposed into 2 drivers: technology and efficiency (see box for details). With technology
diffusing more easily across countries, efficiency—or how effectively a country uses its factors of
productions—accounts for most of the variation of TFP over a cross-section of countries. Factors
such as governance, competition policy, labor market policies, ease of doing business, and
regulatory burden affect a country’s efficiency. An index that summarizes some of these factors—in
this case, the Fraser Institute’s economic freedom index—is used in the model to estimate the
efficiency rating of a cross section of countries.
6.
Estimates using a stochastic frontier model suggest that Iceland’s efficiency exceeds
that of European countries and lags only slightly behind its Nordic neighbors. In 2009, Iceland’s
efficiency is estimated at around 76 percent, compared to 80 (Denmark) to 86 percent (Norway) for
the other Nordics. The crisis has reduced these ratings significantly for all countries, especially for
Iceland where the recession was more severe. Despite the decline, Iceland and other Nordic
countries enjoy some of the highest efficiency ratings in the sample.

If we assume that the G7 countries have an efficiency rating of 1, we can use their (mean) level of
human capital to graph a best practice frontier for the world. Relative to that best practice frontier,
Iceland is just below the 70 percent band in 2009. Note that the best practice frontier represents a
specific efficiency and human capital level. Thus, the distance between Iceland and the best practice
frontier captures not only the small divergence in efficiency but also the human capital gap between
Iceland and the G7 countries.
7.
Nevertheless, efficiency ratings have declined in the last few years, underscoring the
need to improve resource allocation and address legacy vulnerabilities. For Iceland, the rating
fell from a peak of around 85½ percent in 2005 to 82 percent in 2007 and 76 percent in 2009.
Falling efficiency ratings in the run-up to the crisis point to resource misallocations, not only in
Iceland but also in many advanced economies. In Iceland, this was reflected in a rapidly expanding
financial sector, rising asset prices, and widening imbalances. Crisis legacies, including the
imposition of capital controls and a weak banking system, have further exacerbated the decline in
the last two years of the sample.

Stochastic Frontier Analysis
To evaluate total factor productivity growth more closely, a stochastic frontier approach
is used. To illustrate how efficiency enters the model (see Tiffin, 2006 for a more in-depth
discussion), define output as:
Output is determined by a production function, f(Z), where Z are inputs (labor, capital, labor
quality, technology), an efficiency term, , and a random term, e. The efficiency term is
assumed to fall between 0 and 1. For a country producing at the optimal level, =1, output
collapses to the standard production function with random term. The production function, f(Z),
follows a Cobb-Douglas specification:
t

where Ae is technology that varies over time, t, K is the capital stock, L is the labor force, and h
is a measure of human capital. Dividing by L and taking logs yield:

Let u = -log( ) be the inefficiency term. Defining y and k as log output per worker and log
capital per worker, respectively, the regression model is
The inefficiency term, u, is assumed to be truncated positive normally distributed, with mean, :
where z is the economic freedom index.
Estimation is conducted on an unbalanced panel of 178 countries over the period,
1950-2007. Data for the production function are from the Penn World Tables, except for
human capital which uses the Barro-Lee dataset. Real output and capital are measured in 2005
U.S. dollars, using purchasing power parity exchange rates. Human capital takes into account
not only the average education of the workforce but also the average level of workplace
experience. Estimation uses the one-step estimator for stochastic frontier models discussed in
Wang and Schmidt (2002).

Efficiency is identified in the model by structural indicators. We use the summary
rating of the Fraser Institute’s economic freedom index, which is the broadest panel data
(144 countries, 1970–2010 with gaps) among available structural indicators. The economic
freedom index looks at 5 areas, namely size of government, legal system and property
rights, sound money, freedom to trade internationally, and regulation (Gwartney, etal,
2012). The size of government criterion measures the extent of countries’ reliance on the
political process to allocate resources. Legal system and property rights refer to the
protection of persons and their property. Sound money refers to the absence of high and
volatile inflation and access to alternative forms of currency. Freedom to trade
internationally captures the absence of trade barriers and controls in the movement of
capital and people. Lastly, regulation measures freedom to engage in voluntary exchange
in business and credit and labor markets.

Efficiency and the economic freedom index are positively related, as shown by the charts
below. Countries with a low economic freedom index tend to have lower efficiency. The
relationship is weaker for high income countries, reflected by the flatter slope of the high income
sample.

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
Public and external debt are on sustainable paths, but risks remain elevated (Annex
Tables 1–2; Annex Figures 1–2). Although both public and external debt are projected to decline, the
still high debt ratios remain a challenge.

A. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
2.
Iceland’s public debt sustainability analysis (DSA) is based on the government’s
existing medium-term fiscal plan, adjusted for recent fiscal developments, including the
following:


The primary balance in 2013 is expected to be about 1½ percent of GDP lower than
projected in the Second Post-Program Monitoring Discussion report, owing primarily to
expenditure overruns (0.5 percent of GDP), the non-materialization of expected revenues
(0.4 percent of GDP) and capital transfers to HFF (0.2 percent of GDP). The overall deficit is
expected to reach 2¾ percent of GDP.



The 2014 target of a zero balance will likely be missed by about 1¾ percent of GDP, owing
to the 2013 overruns and to the reversal of some planned revenue increases (0.2 percent of
GDP). Over the medium term, the primary balance is expected to reach 3.7 percent of GDP
by 2017, which is lower by 1 percentage point of GDP than the latest DSA projections. The
overall deficit is not expected to close until 2017, following which the overall balance will
record a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period.



The baseline scenario includes yearly capital transfers of 0.2 percent of GDP to cover
projected HFF losses. HFF may also require equity injections to bring its capital adequacy
ratio in line with the target of 5 percent. Due to uncertainty over the equity needs, no equity
injection assumption has been made in the baseline projections.

3.
General government debt is estimated to reach 93¼ percent of GDP at end-2013
(Annex Table 1, Annex Figure 1). Because of the capital injection into HFF (0.8 percent of GDP), a
larger than projected deficit in 2013, and lower than expected nominal GDP, the debt-to-GDP ratio
in 2013 is higher by 3 percentage points of GDP than was projected in the Second Post-Program
Monitoring Discussion report. In light of this, and given the weaker primary balance profile, the
debt-to-GDP ratio is higher by 4 percent of GDP in the medium-term than in the Second PostProgram Monitoring Discussion report. Nonetheless, as in the previous DSA, debt remains on a
declining path throughout the forecasting period.
4.
The baseline debt trajectory is sensitive to growth shocks (Annex Figure 1). A standard
growth shock would reverse the downward path of public debt and keep it above 100 percent of
GDP in the absence of offsetting measures. An interest rate shock, a combined macro shock, and an
interruption of fiscal consolidation would flatten the debt path and stabilize debt in the
87-90 percent of GDP range. A 30 percent depreciation of the exchange rate would raise the debt

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ICELAND

ratio to 106 percent of GDP in 2014, leaving debt at 93 percent of GDP in 2018. Finally, a 30 percent
contingent liability shock could raise public debt above 120 percent of GDP in 2014. Under this last
scenario, public debt is expected to decline to 108 percent of GDP in the medium term.

B. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
5.

The baseline external debt path takes into account the following assumptions:



Available data on the three old banks' asset recovery up to March 2013 suggest that
recovery has been in line with previous estimates. The split between domestic and foreign
claims, however, has been updated based on a recent analysis of the Central Bank of Iceland
(CBI).2 According to the analysis, foreign claims account for about 95 percent of total claims
(compared to 86 percent assumed in the previous staff report). With a larger share of foreign
claims, the old banks’ external debt is higher than previously projected by about 2 percent
of GDP over the medium term.



The sale of Actavis (a large domestic multinational) to a nonresident company in October
2012 reduced Iceland’s external debt by about 200 billion krona (about 11 percent of GDP).3
This debt reduction was largely accounted for in the staff report for the Second PPM, where
part of Actavis’ debt was assumed to be transformed into equity. Therefore, this update does
not materially change the external debt ratio from the previous staff report.



The sale also prompted a downward revision of Actavis’ accrued interest payments, which in
turn reduces interest payments projection. As a result, the non-interest current account
surplus needed to stabilize the external debt-to-GDP ratio reduces from 3.8 percent of GDP
in the previous DSA to 1.2 percent of GDP in this DSA.



Interest rates for new borrowing throughout the projection period are assumed to be
slightly lower than in the last DSA, reflecting reduced global funding costs.



As before, external borrowing by the central government (aside from that from bilateral
official creditors) is assumed to be fully rolled over, and additional bonds are assumed to be
issued to cover 30 percent (on average) of the CBI’s external debt falling due between 2012
and 2016.



External debt rollover for the rest of the economy is assumed to be lower than in the
previous report, reflecting continued deleveraging. Central government corporations, local

Iceland, March 2013. This special publication is based on an examination of the underlying and actual owners
of the old banks’ claims.

However, following the transaction, there remains an Icelandic (resident) part of the multinational, which still
holds external debt of more than 40 percent of GDP. This amount remains Icelandic external debt.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ICELAND

municipalities, and local government corporations are assumed to roll over about 40 percent
(on average) of maturing principal during the next three years (compared with an average of
70 percent in the previous report). As before, corporations under financial stress are
assumed to be unable to roll over external debt. Lower rollover assumptions help bring
down Iceland’s external debt ratios more rapidly than in previous DSAs.


The easing of capital controls is assumed to start in 2017, one year later than in the previous
DSA. As part of its program to address the liquid offshore krona overhang, the government
is assumed to issue two long-term Eurobonds, one in 2014 and one in 2015, both
amounting to $0.8 billion. The Eurobonds will be exchanged for short-term krona assets held
by nonresidents. This will not affect the level of external debt, but will increase the
government’s foreign exchange exposure.



The final EFTA ruling on the Icesave dispute early this year eliminates the associated
contingent risks to the external debt path.

6.
External debt is expected to decline substantially over the medium term. External debt
is estimated at 222 percent of GDP at end-2012, and is expected to fall to around 145 percent of
GDP by 2018 (Annex Table 2). Around one-third of the 2012 debt stock is nonresident claims subject
to capital controls, although this ratio declines as offshore kronas exit and old banks’ liabilities are
paid out.
7.
Stress tests suggest that the downward trajectory is relatively robust. Standard shocks,
except in the historical scenario, would not disturb the downward trajectory of the external debt
ratio (Annex Figure 2). The historical scenario, however, would put the external debt ratio on an
upward trend because it assumes large capital outflows (as suggested by the 10-year historical
average of non-debt creating capital flows). With the assumption that capital controls would be in
place for most of the medium term, this scenario is highly unlikely. Nevertheless, this tail risk
scenario highlights the importance of an orderly lifting of the controls.

1/ General government gross debt (including borrowing by the central government to support central bank reserves; excludes IMF loans).
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of
foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Reflects called guarantees of the State Guarantee Fund.
6/ Includes capitalization of new banks, savings banks, and bilateral loans and international bond issuance to support CBI reserves.
7/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes. In 2009-17, the residual also reflects use of deposits at the central bank and sale of financial assets obtained during the
financial crisis.
8/ Defined as general government deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term general government debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
10/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP
growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes, inflows of extraordinary financing (and Fund repurchases), and external asset recovery and repayments of the old bank estates.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year. This estimate excludes old bank-related asset recovery in 2017, and large one-off projected liquidation of assets abroad, to service lumpy debt payment.

7/ Historical debt and interest data exclude old bank data (based on staff and Central Bank estimates).

Exchange Rate Arrangements: The Icelandic krona is floating effective October 2008. Iceland
accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 but maintains exchange
restrictions arising from limitations imposed on the conversion and transfer of (i) interest on bonds
(whose transfer the FX rules apportion depending on the period of the holding), (ii) the principal
payments from holdings of amortizing bonds, and (iii) payments on the indexation of principal from
holdings of amortizing bonds. In addition, Iceland has in place measures that constitute exchange
restrictions imposed for security reasons related to financial transactions based on UN Security
Council Resolutions. The Executive Board has approved these restrictions until March 18, 2014.
Safeguards Assessment: The 2009 assessment concluded that the CBI's overall control
environment was broadly appropriate for a small central bank, with good controls in the accounting
and financial reporting area. The CBI's external and internal audit procedures practices were not
found to be in line with international practices, however, and the foreign reserves management area
would benefit from development. The authorities have already taken steps to implement safeguard
recommendations, notably by appointing an international audit firm under the auspices of the
Auditor General to conduct annual external audits of the CBI in line with international standards,
starting with financial year 2009. Internal audit was also outsourced. Work on other
recommendations, such as the reserves management guidelines, is in progress.
Last Article IV Consultation: Discussions for the 2012 Article IV Consultation were held in Reykjavik
during February 21–March 22, 2012. The Staff Report (country report No. 12/89) was considered by
the Executive Board on April 6, 2012. Article IV consultations with Iceland are currently held on a
12-month cycle.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes. Iceland subscribed to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in 1996, and is in observance of the SDDS specifications for
coverage, periodicity, and timeliness, but uses a flexibility option on the timeliness and periodicity
for the production index and the producer price index (PPI). The Statistics Department (STA)
prepared a data module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (data ROSC) that
was published on November 22, 2005.
Data on a wide range of economic and financial variables are provided to the Fund in a timely
manner during and between consultations. In addition to periodic press releases, statistical
information is disseminated to the public through a range of monthly, quarterly, and annual
publications by three main institutions (The Central Bank of Iceland (CBI), the Ministry of Finance,
and Statistics Iceland), and is increasingly available on their internet sites. Provision of electronic
data in English has improved substantially in recent years, especially from Statistics Iceland.
As regards the national accounts data, the authorities shifted to ESA95 in August 2000 and revised
the corresponding time series back to 1990. Another revision was carried out in 2002. A breakdown
is disseminated by industry back to the beginning of the production approach in 1973. Data on GNP
and national income, in current and constant prices, as well as data on net savings for the economy
as a whole, are also disseminated. The quarterly data are seasonally adjusted.
The authorities publish a Treasury cash flow statement on a monthly basis, quarterly data on the
general government operations, and annual data on the general government operations and
financial assets and liabilities. Iceland reports government finance statistics in accordance with the
GFSM 2001 framework in the GFS Yearbook, and is an up-to-date contributor to the International
Financial Statistics (IFS). Balance of payments data deviate from the IMF’s Balance of Payments
Manual, fifth edition (BPM5) in certain respects. In particular, the CBI follows the methodology
applied by the European Central Bank (ECB) for the calculation of income payable by collective
investment institutions (e.g., mutual funds).
The CBI made good progress in improving external sector statistics based on 2011 TA mission’s
recommendations. Particularly, (i) the coverage was expanded by including the data on portfolio
investment in equity capital, as well as in securities on secondary market; (ii) data on FDI and on
other investment income are compiled in line with balance of payments methodology; (iii)
remittances data were improved based on information from money transfer operators; and (iv) the
old banks’ transactions are recorded broken down by instruments.
On monetary and financial statistics, the concepts and definitions broadly conform to the guidelines
of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Departing from the MFSM, M3/Broad
Money measure includes deposits of the central government, positions of commercial banks with
private nonfinancial corporations include some positions with public nonfinancial corporations, and
the latter include some positions with private nonfinancial corporations. Beginning in February 2010,
the CBI reports for publication in IFS monetary data for central bank and other depository
corporations using the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation and Third Post Program
Monitoring Discussions with Iceland
On August 1, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation and third Post Program Monitoring discussions with Iceland. 1
Iceland’s economy is on a path to recovery, but legacy vulnerabilities are weighing on growth.
GDP growth—which reached 2.9 percent in 2011—slowed to 1.6 percent in 2012 amid private
sector deleveraging and weak external demand. Unemployment has continued to decline
however, standing at 5.1 percent in May, down from a peak of 9.2 percent in September 2010.
Progress in lifting capital controls has been limited. Modest amounts of offshore krona have
been released through the channels opened up by the authorities’ liberalization strategy. But the
stock of liquid offshore krona remains high and could rise significantly as the estates of “old
banks” are wound up. Additional foreign exchange outflows could also arise from potential
resident portfolio rebalancing as capital controls are lifted.
Inflation has come down to 3.3 percent in June from a peak of 18.6 in January 2009, but remains
above the central bank’s target of 2½ percent. The central bank responded by raising policy rates
by a cumulative 125 basis points in 2012 before pausing in November. During the winter, the
CBI also intervened in the foreign exchange market, reversing a depreciation that resulted from
temporary factors but threatened to pass through to prices.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Fiscal consolidation is facing headwinds. On current trends, the 2013 budget deficit target will
be missed owing to slower than projected growth, expenditure overruns, and lower-thanbudgeted dividend payments and asset sales. The existing target of a balanced budget in 2014
may also come under pressure from costly electoral promises—including those to lower taxes
and to increase household debt relief—the financing for which remains uncertain. Medium-term
fiscal adjustment relies in part on one-off or uncertain measures.
The condition of the banking system has improved, but legacy risks remain. Banks are well
capitalized, liquid, and profitable. Nonperforming loan ratios have also declined. But banks are
still reliant on short-term funding and deposits captured by capital controls, and face continued
loan valuation uncertainty. There has been progress with corporate and household debt
restructuring, but the pace of resolving remaining cases has been slow. The Housing Financing
Fund (HFF) is in a difficult financial position.
Reserves remain at comfortable levels, with the ratio of gross reserves to short-term debt
projected to remain well above 100 percent over the medium term. The outlook is for modest
growth, declining inflation, and improving fiscal and external position. However, downside risks
prevail, including from disorderly or delayed capital account liberalization, weaker fiscal
consolidation, and possible adverse euro area developments.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the progress made by Iceland on the recovery path from the 2008
crisis and noted that the outlook points to a continued expansion, further disinflation, and
additional improvements in the fiscal and external positions. Nonetheless, Directors agreed that
the legacies of the crisis continue to pose challenges that must be addressed to reinforce the
foundations for durable growth.
Directors emphasized the importance of a comprehensive approach to lifting capital controls.
They urged the timely publication of a well-defined strategy to release the stock of liquid
offshore krónur—a key condition for removing the controls. Prudential regulations and
supervision would need to be strengthened in the run-up to full liberalization, and additional
measures, such as speed limits on outflows, could be considered.
Directors expressed satisfaction with the central bank’s actions to bring down inflation. They
encouraged the authorities to continue improving liquidity operations given the still weak
monetary transmission mechanism. Directors supported the central bank’s intention to purchase
foreign currency in the open market as opportunities arise, to boost foreign exchange reserves.
Directors welcomed the progress in fiscal consolidation, but expressed concern over recent
slippages. They emphasized the importance of adhering to the fiscal targets to reduce public
debt, preserve confidence, and bolster market access. Accordingly, they encouraged the

authorities to take measures to meet the balanced budget target for 2014, and to rely on more
durable sources of fiscal consolidation over the medium term. Directors also welcomed the
creation of a parliamentary committee to review public spending and looked forward to
enactment of the draft Public Finances Act to strengthen budget discipline and accountability.
Directors agreed that there is little fiscal space for additional household debt relief. In this
regard, they considered appropriate the authorities’ intentions not to undertake further household
debt relief unless fiscal space is created. Any new measures should be targeted to distressed
households not captured under existing programs. Directors also noted scope to improve
existing debt restructuring processes.
Directors welcomed improvements in the banking system. Nonetheless, they urged the
authorities to address legacy risks through heightened supervisory oversight and a strengthened
financial stability framework. They also recommended a comprehensive reform of the Housing
Financing Fund.

Statement by Audun Groenn, Executive Director for Iceland
and Ragnheidur Jonsdottir, Advisor to Executive Director
July 29, 2013

The Icelandic authorities appreciate the constructive and fruitful discussions during the
Article IV mission in June and welcome the Article IV report and Selected Issues Paper.
Our authorities broadly agree with the staff appraisal and recommendations. Substantial
progress has been made in some areas, as real disposable income has increased,
unemployment has come down to around 5½ percent, inflation has declined to below 4
percent, and there has been strong growth in several areas, including tourism, in recent years.
However, although economic growth has resumed, investment and growth rates have been
somewhat lower than expected in 2012 and 2013. The targets set for a balanced fiscal budget
in 2014 and surpluses thereafter are unchanged but will require some fiscal rebalancing, as the
outlook for the 2013 outcome is somewhat less favorable than planned. At present, reducing
uncertainties regarding the winding-up of the failed banks’ estates, refining and implementing
the strategy for lifting capital controls, and providing an environment conducive to higher
private sector investment and economic growth are considered the key challenges.
Fiscal policy
Staff points out that, in order to reach the 2014 balanced budget target, additional measures
equivalent to 1.5 percent of GDP must be undertaken over the next 18 months. The authorities
are in the process of formulating their fiscal plans, and the 2014 budget proposal will be put
before Parliament in early October. The fiscal measures suggested by staff will be taken into
consideration. In addition, the authorities will now focus on increased efficiency in public
spending. An ad hoc Parliamentary committee has been established to look into every aspect
of public spending and is mandated with presenting realistic proposals in coming months,
including in the health and education sectors, aimed at increasing efficiency and providing
savings, thus bringing public finances back towards the previously targeted path. In terms of
design and implementation, potential tax cuts will be made consistent with that path and will
not necessarily be predicated on Laffer curve effects.
The electoral promise of household debt relief aiming to reduce the principal of indexed
household mortgages will not be undertaken unless fiscal space is created to allow such a
move. The purpose is to mitigate the large financial shock sustained in the 2008 crash as a
result of mortgage loan indexation. This shock jeopardized the financial plans of even the
most prudent households. Otherwise, the existing restructuring process will be strengthened,
as suggested by staff.
A recent report on the status of the pension system in Iceland points to significant strength in
the system and the ability to cover its future obligations given the demographic trend. An
exception is the State Pension Fund, which is not fully funded and faces a significant deficit if
nothing is done. This situation, in addition to the high debt and Housing Financing Fund

problems, places an additional constraint on public finances, signifying the need for extremely
prudent fiscal management by the newly elected government.
Our authorities welcome the European Free Trade Association Court’s recent ruling that
Iceland was not in breach of its obligations under the EEA Agreement in the so-called Icesave
dispute. This conclusion reduced the uncertainty regarding large potential contingent
liabilities of the sovereign.
Monetary policy
Inflation has declined in recent months and has been moving towards the inflation target.
Underlying inflation and inflation expectations have also declined. The Monetary Policy
Committee therefore kept the policy rate unchanged at its June meeting.
In several recent publications, the Central Bank has argued that an inflation target coupled
with a managed float, rather than the free float prevailing prior to the crisis, might be better
suited for Iceland, given its small size and volatility of capital flows. Recent changes in the
Central Bank’s foreign exchange market intervention policy that are consistent with this view
appear to have contributed to greater exchange rate stability and provided a firmer anchor for
inflation expectations. This should facilitate more rapid disinflation than would otherwise
have occurred. Consistent with the goal of reducing exchange rate volatility around the
current exchange rate level, the Central Bank will take advantage of foreign currency inflows
during the peak tourist season to buy foreign currency to strengthen its foreign reserves. The
seasonal pattern of currency flows is far from stable, however, as the exchange rate is subject
to various forces at the current juncture, not least the variable pace of FX deleveraging.
The MPC has indicated that it will pay close attention to the upcoming wage negotiations this
autumn and will respond accordingly if it appears that wage increases will exceed the level
that is consistent with the inflation target. In addition, the Committee has emphasized that
monetary policy must at all times take account of fiscal policy and other factors that affect
demand.
Capital controls
Staff notes that progress in abolishing the capital controls has been limited, and the authorities
agree with the need to expedite the process. However, it should be noted that the auctions held
by the Central Bank have been rather successful in reducing the most volatile part of the
offshore krona overhang. Króna-denominated deposits held by non-residents in Icelandic
commercial banks have fallen from more than ISK 200 billion, which was approximately 13.5
percent of GDP at the time the controls were introduced, to the current balance of ISK 50
billion, or 3 percent of GDP. In addition, as of end-June 2013, the foreign currency auctions
had brought into Iceland foreign investments equivalent to roughly 9 percent of year-2012
GDP. These auctions are scheduled to continue until end-2013 and may be continued into
2014. Despite this progress, Iceland’s balance of payments situation remains vulnerable, as
liquid króna assets held by non-residents still amount 22 percent of GDP and the failed banks’
estates hold substantial domestic assets. Most of the failed banks’ creditors are non-residents.

This situation could potentially create disorderly capital outflows in the absence of capital
controls. It is clear that resolution of the failed banks’ estates in a manner consistent with
financial stability is a prerequisite for further progress towards lifting the capital controls.
The Act on the Central Bank of Iceland was amended in July so as to expand the Central
Bank’s authority to impose prudential rules, including rules on liquidity and the banks’
foreign currency balance. In addition, the amended Act empowers the Central Bank to
compile more detailed information on certain financial activities carried out by banks, and it
contains specified provisions on fines for violation of rules regarding financial activities under
the Central Bank Act. Prudential regulation and strengthened financial supervision will be
needed to control financial risks and reduce uncertainties in asset prices and exchange rates as
capital controls are lifted. Moreover, prior to lifting controls on domestic resident outflows,
there are plans to impose speed limits on pension fund investments abroad. Other resident
outflows will be liberalized as conditions allow. It should be stressed that the various
measures taken to prepare for the lifting of controls aim at reducing and mitigating the risks of
resident outflows following liberalization. The likelihood that such risks will materialize
depends on domestic and international economic and financial conditions at the time and
cannot be easily predicted based on simple models, especially if home bias and endogeniety
of the exchange rate are excluded from the analysis.
Financial sector
Structural reforms under the Stand-By Arrangement were aimed primarily at the financial
sector. In that area, work continues to be focused on strengthening supervision and regulation.
A draft bill of legislation for a Financial Stability Council is currently under review, and work
towards implementing Basel III, additional macroprudential rules, and more comprehensive
financial supervision in general is ongoing. A recent report on the Housing Financing Fund
reveals a difficult financial and operational situation with non-negligible fiscal risks. The
authorities will further investigate the situation before taking decisive action to define its role
and put its finances on a sound basis.
The authorities agree with staff that the banks need to maintain high levels of capital
adequacy and liquidity. During the last year, the commercial banks’ capital ratios rose from
22 percent to 25 percent. Non-performing loans at the three largest commercial banks remain
high; however, they have dropped from 23 percent of total lending to 15 percent in the past
year and are expected to fall still further this year.
The banks rely heavily on deposits for their funding. However, the banks operate behind
capital controls and have limited foreign market access thus far. Although this shields them
from spillover effects from adverse swings in global and European financial markets, it also
curtails their ability to provide FX financing for business investments. There is scope for
streamlining and efficiency gains in the financial sector. The authorities foresee the
emergence of a sound banking system capable of supporting investment and growth when the
capital controls have been lifted and financial conditions have normalized.
Structural reforms

The role of the authorities is to create an environment conducive to growth and development,
while the private sector must be the source of new employment opportunities and new
enterprises. A small economy with a limited domestic market must have access to foreign
capital and foreign markets. To this end, new capital inflows and associated future outflows
are unrestricted, but capital controls still create various impediments for cross-border
activities of Icelandic companies. The removal of capital controls is therefore important if
Icelandic companies are to grow beyond their limited domestic market, which in turn is
important for future growth. Economic growth potential would benefit from further
diversification and strengthening of secondary and tertiary activities. The tourist sector has
been growing rapidly, and there are no signs of a slow-down. There are many other
opportunities related to utilization of both natural resources and human capital. The
authorities will do their utmost to support new investments opportunities while increasing
efficiency in public services, education, and health.
