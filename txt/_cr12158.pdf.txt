Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation and Third Review Under the
Extended Credit Facility
Prepared by the African Department
(In collaboration with other departments)
Approved by Michael Atingi-Ego and Thomas Dorsey
December 8, 2011
Mission: Discussions took place in Ouagadougou during September 29–October 14, 2011 for the
2011 Article IV Consultation and the third review under the Extended Credit Facility. The team
comprised Ms. Kabedi-Mbuyi (head); Ms. Diouf; Ms. Adenauer (resident representative), and
Messrs. Gueye and van Houtte (All AFR). The team held discussions with Ministers Lucien
Marie Bembamba (Economy and Finance), Sungalo Ouattara (Public Works), Lamoussa Kaboré
(Mining), Arthur Kafando (Commerce), Jean Bertin Ouédraogo (Infrastructure), and Soungalo
Appolinaire Ouattara (Civil Service), Mr. Francois M.S. Zoundi (Deputy Minister in Charge of
Budget), Mr. Bolo Sanou (National Director of the regional central bank), and other senior
officials. Mr. Tall (OED) participated in policy discussions.
Program review. Performance under the program was satisfactory despite a difficult social
environment. At end-June 2011, all quantitative performance criteria were met, one indicative
target was missed, and most structural benchmarks were observed.
Exchange system: Burkina Faso is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary
Union (WAEMU). As such, it has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and
4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement, and has maintained an exchange system free of restrictions
on payments and transfers for current international transactions. The WAEMU common currency
is the CFA franc, pegged to the euro at a fixed rate; its monetary and exchange rate policies are
conducted by a common central bank.
Data provision: Burkina Faso participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).
Despites some weaknesses, data provision is timely and broadly adequate for surveillance.
Outreach: The team met with representatives of the donor community, the private sector, and the
media; and organized a seminar on debt sustainability, competitiveness, and the macroeconomic
impact of aid scaling-up for Burkina Faso.

Executive Summary
Macroeconomic developments are positive
The impact of adverse shocks in the earlier part of 2011 was minimal on the main sectors driving
economic growth, and price pressures have subsided. Consequently, real GDP growth is expected to
be in line with projections, and inflation to be moderate in 2011–12. The external current account
(excluding official transfers) improved in 2010 thanks to higher gold and cotton prices, and a
significant increase in gold production. It is forecast to deteriorate in 2011, mostly because of the
projected increase in imports demand, partly owing to higher global oil prices. Fiscal policy has
remained prudent, despite emergency measures to address the impact of adverse shocks. Mediumterm prospects are promising, reflecting the authorities’ resolve to maintain the momentum of
structural reforms and scale up investment; and the projected good performance in agriculture,
cotton, mining, and services sectors. There are, however, downside risks to the outlook, mainly
related to a potential downturn in the global economy and unfavorable weather conditions.
Performance under the program has been good despite the impact of the social turmoil
At end-June 2011, all quantitative performance criteria were met, the indicative target on pro-poor
spending was not observed, partly because of the impact of social turmoil on budget execution; and
most structural benchmarks were observed.
Staff recommends the completion of the third review under the Extended Credit Facility arrangement
based on the strength of the program, and the authorities’ policy commitments in the attached Letter
of Intent.
Key policy challenges
Burkina Faso’s main economic challenge is to increase and sustain economic growth to levels
compatible with a significant reduction in poverty, while maintaining macroeconomic stability and
supporting long-term debt sustainability.
Key recommendations


Maintain a prudent fiscal policy stance and strengthen revenue mobilization to safeguard
medium-term fiscal objectives.



Enhance debt policy and management capacity, and maintain a prudent borrowing policy to
support long-term debt sustainability.



Promote economic diversification, and deepen structural reforms to enhance prospects for
broad-based growth and poverty reduction.



Improve social policies, and develop comprehensive social protection systems to protect the
most vulnerable populations.

6
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Burkina Faso’s policy implementation has been generally satisfactory. The
authorities have maintained the momentum of structural reforms and sound policies that
have supported macroeconomic stability and poverty reduction. Continued reform
implementation led also to strong performance under IMF-supported programs, and good
progress on IMF policy advice following surveillance discussions (Box 1). This
performance has helped the authorities secure sustained financial support from the
country’s development partners.
2.
The Executive Board approved a three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
arrangement for Burkina Faso on June 14, 2010 with access of SDR 46.15 million
(76.67 percent of quota). The Board completed the first and second reviews under the
arrangement on December 3, 2010 and July 15, 2011 respectively.
II. OVERVIEW AND SURVEILLANCE ISSUES
A. Strong Growth despite a Narrow Productive Base
3.
Economic growth has been
sustained and above the average for the
WAEMU. The combination of growthenhancing policies and the significant
expansion in the mining sector since 2008
has supported economic growth in the last
five years. Real GDP growth averaged
5 percent in 2006–10, outperforming other
WAEMU countries (Text Figure 1). The
impact of exogenous shocks earlier in 2011
was marginal on the main sectors driving
growth. Consequently, real GDP is expected
to expand by 5.6 percent as anticipated
(Table 1, and MEFP ¶ 2).
4.
Despite generally good growth
performance, the productive base remains
narrow. Until the onset of gold production
in 2007, the primary and secondary sectors,
dominated by agriculture and ginned cotton,
respectively, were the main sources of
growth (Text Figure 2). As a result, real
GDP growth fluctuated significantly in
2004–10, because of climatic and terms-oftrade shocks.

(PFM)

Staff Recommendations During the
2009 Article IV Consultation

Outcome

Enhance revenue collection through the
implementation of tax reform and
administrative measures.

The authorities prepared a new tax reform strategy with
technical assistance from the IMF and financial support
from Switzerland, and implemented it in 2011. They
also took several revenue-enhancing measures,
including the connection of the majority of customs
offices to the main electronic server.

Reinvigorate expenditure management
reforms and enhance Treasury cash
flow management.

The authorities streamlined the documentation needed
for expenditure payment and adopted a new treasury
cash flow plan. They also took comprehensive
measures to prepare the transition to a program
budgeting system, and carried out organizational and
financial audits of expenditure commitment systems in
several line ministries. The authorities used the
outcome of the audits to define performance
assessment indicators to reduce delays in expenditure
payment.

Cotton sector

Continue the rehabilitation of the main
cotton ginning company (SOFITEX)
and implement cotton sector reforms.

For SOFITEX, key measures included strengthening
the company’s management based on the results of the
2009 audit; enhancing the information system;
recapitalizing the company in accordance with
OHADA laws, and preparing a business plan for 2010–
15. The authorities also adopted a new system to
finance the cotton price-smoothing fund, in
collaboration with other stakeholders.

Private sector
development

Improve the business environment
further and support economic
diversification.

The authorities set up two commercial courts in the two
majors cities; rationalized the employers’ tax; and
made further progress on some World Bank Doing
Business indicators.

Financial sector

Implement the financial sector strategy
to deepen financial intermediation and
broaden access to financial services.

The implementation of key measures under the
financial sector development strategy has been limited
for lack of funding. The authorities prepared a new
microfinance development strategy.

External debt

Maintain a prudent borrowing policy to
safeguard long-term debt sustainability.

The authorities have maintained a prudent borrowing
policy, and have enhanced debt management capacity.

Petroleum
Products Pricing
System

Adopt a new pricing and taxation
system for petroleum products.

The authorities completed a study on a new pricing and
taxation mechanism at end-2010. Based on the
outcome of the study, they plan to adopt a new pricing
system by December 2011.

8
B. Inflation Is Moderate
5.
Inflation has remained low. The
authorities put in place an incentive program
for agriculture production after the 2007
drought. The program has strengthened the
supply for agricultural consumer goods, and
has helped contain food inflation. After the
sharp rise in 2008 driven by the global food
and energy crisis, inflation has been trending
down, declining to -0.3 percent in 2010. It is
expected to inch up in 2011 because of the
hike in global oil prices, but would stay below
2 percent (Text Figure 3).

6.
The freeze in fuel retail prices has played an important role in containing
inflationary pressures. Since the 2008 global energy crisis, the authorities suspended the
implementation of the petroleum products price pass-through mechanism, and limited
subsidies to sensitive products for consumers and for power generation. This has helped
contain the impact of higher global oil prices on inflation, although it caused operating
losses for SONABHY.
C. External Position—Vulnerability to Exogenous Shocks
7.
The external position is structurally fragile. With cotton and gold accounting
for 75 percent of exports, and petroleum products representing some 30 percent of
imports, Burkina Faso’s current account is highly susceptible to exogenous shocks
affecting production conditions, particularly for cotton, and to fluctuations in commodity
prices. In 2010, the current account deficit narrowed to 7½ percent of GDP, down from
about 9 percent in 2009. Increased export earnings that compensated for the impact of
higher oil prices underpinned this improvement. This, however, is expected to be
temporary, mostly because of continued strong imports demand, partly reflecting higher
oil prices (Text Figures 4 and 5; and Table 2).

8.
The decline in inflation and the depreciation of the Euro provided some
competitiveness gains in 2010. The real effective exchange rate depreciated by
8.4 percent in 2010 compared with 2009, following years of appreciation (Text Figure 6).
Analysis using selected cost indicators also points to an improvement in 2010; and a
broader assessment of the REER suggests that it is broadly in line with economic
fundamentals (Text Figure 7), consistent with the regional assessment.1 Nonetheless,
Burkina Faso’s performance on non-price competitiveness points to the need for
continued improvement in the business climate to support private sector development
(Appendix II).

D. The Financial Sector—Sound with Shallow Financial Intermediation
9.
The financial system is dominated by banks, and financing activities are not
diversified. Although the system has expanded in recent years, commercial banks
account for the largest share of assets (Box 2). In addition, credit concentration remains
high: the financing of cotton production and commercial activities account for the largest
share of credit to the economy. The Herfindhal-Hirschmann index shows that credit
concentration is moderate, although above the WAEMU average.
10.
Vulnerabilities in the financial sector have abated. Progress in the
implementation of cotton sector reforms, and other recommendations from the 2008
FSAPreport (Box 3) have lowered vulnerabilities in the sector. In particular, the
authorities recapitalized SOFITEX in 2010, and assumed its liabilities to the banking
system. In addition, in collaboration with other stakeholders, the authorities set up a new
mechanism to contain the impact of price shocks on the financial situation of ginning
companies.

Box 2. Burkina Faso—Recent Developments in the Financial Sector
The banking sector has expanded significantly in the last six years. The number of banks increased from 8 in
2005 to 12 in 2011, with their balance sheets growing by 130 percent (figure below). Three banks hold almost 50
percent of the total banking system’s assets. Private sector deposits quadrupled, and there has been some
diversification and increased access in/to financial services offered by banks. Credit infrastructure improved
significantly with the strengthening of both the credit history center and the corporate balance sheet
centralization system.

At end-June 2011, the majority of banks met the new regional minimum capital requirement of CFAF 5 billion.
Compliance with the regional prudential ratios is generally good (Table below), and non-performing loans
remain low. In addition, years of profitability and sound management, as well as weaknesses in the private sector
credit market, have put banks in a comfortably liquid position, allowing them to participate actively in the
regional bond market, particularly for Treasury bills with 3-to-12 month maturities.

As of June 2011, Burkina Faso had 12 banks.

There are some weaknesses in the regulatory and judicial systems for banks. In particular, debt collection and
foreclosure on collateral are inefficient, and the judicial systems remain weak. Although competition has
increased in recent years, there is a lack of innovative financial instruments, notably those geared towards small
and medium-size enterprises.
The National Social Security Fund (CNSS), the postal service institution (SONAPOST), and microfinance
institutions (MFIs) are also key actors in the financial sector. In particular, MFIs have played an increasing role
in facilitating access to financial services in rural areas.

11.
Financial intermediation remains shallow and the maturity mismatch
between deposit and credit structure limits banks’ ability to finance the economy.
Financial sector development indicators show that comparator countries outpaced
Burkina Faso in the last decade (Text Figures 8 and 9; and Text Table 1). Financial
intermediation, as measured by the ratio of broad money to GDP is shallow, and credit to
the economy remains low, partly because demand deposits are the largest component of
banks’ resources. For 2011, credit to the economy is expected to increase by 11 percent
(Table 3).

E. Fiscal Policy—Sustained Consolidation Efforts
12.
The authorities have generally maintained fiscal discipline. They have
sustained revenue mobilization efforts and overall expenditure restraint, while addressing
the impact of exogenous shocks. Revenue collection has benefitted from continued efforts
to improve tax administration and combat fraud, tax reform measures, and increased
revenue from the mining sector (Box 4). Tax revenue increased from 11.7 percent of GDP
in 2005 to 13.0 percent in 2010 (MEFP ¶¶ 6, 9). The strong revenue performance and
high external budget support helped the authorities increase domestically financed
investment and pro-poor spending, and address exceptional needs triggered by adverse
shocks in 2009–11.2 Expenditure rose from 22.3 percent of GDP in 2005 to 25.7 percent
in 2010, with an increasing share of capital expenditure. This notwithstanding, the overall
budget deficit (including grants) rose from 5 percent of GDP in 2005 to 5.6 percent in
2010 (Table 4).
III. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
13.
Medium-term macroeconomic
prospects are promising. Economic growth
is expected to remain strong, mostly driven
by agriculture, cotton, mining, and services
sectors, as well as higher public investment
(Text Figure 10). In agriculture, production
would benefit from continued
implementation of measures aimed at
supporting higher productivity and
agricultural food supply. Regarding cotton,
improvement in the global market conditions,
and higher productivity, thanks to the
extended use of genetically modified seeds
should boost production in 2012–16. Valueadded in the mining sector is set to benefit
from the projected increase in gold and
manganese activities. Inflation should remain
moderate, consistent with the WAEMU
regional convergence criterion.

In 2009–11, exceptional spending was triggered by heavy floods (2009); the impact of the global
economic slowdown, particularly in the cotton sector (2010); spillover effects from the crisis in
Côte d’Ivoire (through February 2011); and the impact of social unrest (February–June 2011).

Box 4. Burkina Faso—Mining Sector Developments
Production. The mining sector has expanded significantly since 2007. Production has surged from 362 kg in
2007 to 31 tons in 2011, with the number of mines growing tenfold. Overall, Burkina Faso is a marginal gold
producer in Africa (chart below). Since 2009, the four largest mines account for about two thirds of the formal
production. The sector’s contribution to GDP has also risen tenfold in 2008–10.

Export. Gold has overtaken cotton as the main export for Burkina Faso. While cotton export grew by
25 percent in 2008–11, gold export has increased tenfold during the same period, reflecting both strong global
prices and increased production. At current gold prices, mining companies are expected to sustain production
and increase investment in new mines.
Taxation. Revenue from the mining sector covers mainly royalties and corporate income taxes. With the
expansion in the sector’s activity, revenue increased from about ½ percent of GDP in 2009 to about 1 percent in
2010, and a projected 1.8 percent in 2011 (text table below). In 2010, revenue from the mining sector accounted
for about 7 percent of total government revenue. Since 2010, the royalty rate moved from a single 3 percent rate
to a sliding scale system of 3–5 percent depending on global prices (US$1,500/ounce is the trigger level for the
higher rate, and US$1,300/ounce is the floor price for the lower rate). Mining companies pay corporate income
tax at a reduced rate during the 3-year tax holiday period. The State holds a 10 percent stake in mining
companies. There has not been a distribution of dividends so far.

Transparency. Burkina Faso has accompanied the development of the mining industry with a strong effort to
adhere to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). It has been a candidate country since 2008,
and has undertaken activities in three areas: capacity building, information dissemination, and reporting.
Burkina Faso’s full membership in the EITI required a judgment of conformity with 22 criteria by May 2011.
However, a six-month extension for the final assessment was granted because of the unrest of early 2011. The
first reconciliation report was published in March 2011.

15
Burkina Faso’s terms of trade are not expected to improve over the medium term. Exports
are projected to decelerate somewhat, while imports demand would remain firm, in line
with higher economic growth and investment.
15.
The balance of risks is on the downside, and mainly related to the economy’s
vulnerability to exogenous shocks. Should these risks materialize, they would
jeopardize economic growth and may generate additional spending, thus hampering fiscal
consolidation.


A global economic downturn with lower demand and commodity prices would
adversely affect the cotton sector, as was the case in 2008–09. Its impact on the
external current account would depend on developments in global oil and gold
prices.



An adverse change in climatic conditions that would affect the agriculture and
cotton sectors is an important downside risk for growth and the balance of
payments outlook.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS

16.
Considering medium-term objectives and challenges, policy discussions
focused on four areas:


Supporting fiscal sustainability.



Strengthening debt policy and management capacity.



Enhancing growth prospects and;



Improving social policies.
A. Supporting Fiscal Sustainability

rebuild treasury deposits and strengthen
their ability to address unforeseen exogenous shocks, particularly for vulnerable groups.
18.
The medium-term fiscal program assumes that revenue would increase from
15.8 percent of GDP in 2011 to 17.4 percent in 2016, supported by: (i) higher tax

16
revenue consistent with the projected economic growth, and higher imports;
(ii) additional administrative efficiency gains and; (iii) increased revenue from the mining
sector, reflecting expiring tax holidays, strong gold prices, and sustained production. As
mining revenue rises, the authorities would have to ensure that, medium-term expenditure
frameworks shield the budget from volatility in global gold prices, and account for the
exhaustible nature of mining revenue.
19.

The increase in public investment would
cover rehabilitation of roads and dams, including those damaged by the 2009 floods, new
infrastructure projects; and planned large investment projects, notably the Samendeni
dam, the Donsin airport, and the Bagré growth pole. The authorities plan to consider
private sector participation in these projects, under the Public Private Partnerships
legislation. During the discussions, the authorities agreed with staff on the importance of
addressing absorptive capacity constraints, and ensuring that selected investment projects
are consistent with PRSP objectives. They also concurred that financing options for the
scaled-up investment had to be consistent with the long–term debt sustainability
objective.
20.
The overall budget deficit is projected to decline from 3.0 percent of GDP in
2012 to 1.8 percent in 2016. It would be mostly financed with budget grants projected to
average some 2.7 percent of GDP.
B. Strengthening Debt Policy and Management Capacity
21.
The risk of debt distress remains high and debt policy should remain
prudent. Results from the DSA indicate that under current policies, the present value of
debt-to-exports ratio would breach its indicative threshold around 2026 in the baseline
scenario and under stress tests (Figure 1). The authorities agreed with staff that these
results highlight Burkina Faso’s narrow export base and the need to maintain a prudent
borrowing policy, relying mostly on grants and highly concessional loans. Nonetheless,
they insisted that flexibility in borrowing conditions under the current IMF/World Bank
Debt Limits Framework would help Burkina Faso broaden financing sources for the
investment scaling-up envisioned in the PRSP.
22. Staff called the authorities’ attention on results from the application of a
Dynamic General Equilibrium (DGE) model linking investment, economic growth
and debt sustainability on Burkina Faso (Appendix III):

17


Simulation results from the application of a DGE model show that, under certain
conditions, scaling-up investment to levels envisioned in the authorities’ new PRSP
would raise economic growth substantially in the medium to long term, boost private
investment, and increase consumption. They also indicate that financing options for
the scaled-up investment should be selected based on their implications for long-term
fiscal and debt sustainability. In particular, simulation results show that financing the
scaled-up investment through higher concessional borrowing, or access to commercial
loans, would lead to unsustainable levels of external debt.



Taking into account Burkina Faso’s particular circumstances, notably the membership
to a customs and monetary union, the high risk of debt distress under the 2011 DSA,
and the economy’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks, simulation results seem to
indicate that a better macroeconomic outcome would be achieved through moderate
and sustained increase in public investment, financed through higher grants and
concessional loans, as well as increased government revenue.

23.
The authorities welcomed the analysis and broadly agreed with the policy
recommendations. They found that the financing option with higher grants and
concessional loans was consistent with their approach for financing the scaled-up
investment envisaged in their new PRSP. In this vein, they expressed interest in using the
model’s results for the upcoming donors’ conference scheduled for early 2012. In the
discussion, the authorities found that under all simulation scenarios, the tax adjustment
was neither realistic nor feasible because of Burkina Faso’s obligations on VAT
harmonization as a member of a monetary and customs union. Nonetheless, they
concurred with staff on the need to continue enhancing revenue mobilization.
24.
The authorities agreed with staff that debt management capacity needs
further improvement (MEFP ¶ 24). In recent years, the authorities have taken measures
to strengthen debt management capacity by preparing a procedure manual, strengthening
the treasury cash flow management, and setting-up an integrated system to monitor
external financing. The 2011 World Bank DeMPA report concluded that most debt
management indicators had improved compared to the 2008 assessment, although some
weaknesses remain, particularly regarding debt management strategy. Staff encouraged
the authorities to seek technical assistance for the preparation of a well-articulated
medium-term debt management strategy in 2012, to further their debt management
capacity.

19
C. Enhancing Growth Prospects
25.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to growth-enhancing policies to
reach PRSP objectives. They have given priority to scaling up public investment,
notably in infrastructure; supporting productivity gains in agriculture; and enhancing
diversification in agriculture, mining, and agribusiness. Structural conditionality under the
ECF-supported program seeks to support the authorities’ objectives for macroeconomic
stability and growth.
26.
Staff emphasized that continued efforts to improve the business environment
are needed to support private sector led-growth. Measures taken in recent years to
improve the business climate have helped Burkina Faso’s ranking on the World Bank
Doing Business indicators (Figure 2). However, the authorities need to consolidate recent
progress with judicial reforms, as well as measures aimed at supporting productivity gains
in the private sector and reducing transactions costs. Staff argued that measures planned
for 2011–12 to increase efficiency and transparency in merchandise customs clearance
and in the public procurement system will play an important role in reducing transaction
costs for the private sector. Similarly, higher investment in infrastructure, and increased
power supply planned by the authorities and SONABEL for 2012, and in the mediumterm would support private sector development and enhance growth prospects.
27.
The authorities agreed with staff that continued progress in structural
reforms is essential to accelerating growth. They concurred that it was urgent to
accelerate the implementation of financial sector reforms to broaden access to financial
services, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. Staff urged them avoid any
delays in the implementation of the microfinance development strategy, and to progress
with the preparation of the SONAPOST strategy to enhance the quality of postal financial
services. Staff reiterated that recent progress and improved global prospects in the cotton
sector provided a good opportunity to accelerate reforms aimed at putting ginning
companies on a solid footing. The authorities are preparing a strategy for the gradual
reduction of the State’s stake in SOFITEX for 2012 (MEFP ¶¶ 26–30).
D. Improving Social Policies
28.
Social indicators remain weak despite recent improvements. The incidence of
poverty is estimated to have increased, particularly in urban areas, partly reflecting the
impact of adverse shocks in 2007–2010 that affected vulnerable groups. According to
World Bank estimates, the incidence of poverty rose from 42 percent in 2006 to
44 percent in 2009. In addition, Burkina Faso’s UN Human Development Indicator is
0.31, the ninth lowest in the World, making poverty reduction an important priority and
challenge for the authorities. Pro-poor spending rose from 17.5 percent of total
expenditure in 2001 to 28 percent in 2010 (Table 7).
29.
Progress towards the MDGs has been uneven. Burkina Faso is unlikely to meet
the MDGs. Nonetheless, the country has made progress in some indicators: (i) access to
safe drinking water; (ii) primary school net enrollment rate; (iii) reduction in maternal

20
mortality; (iv) the ratio of girls to boys in primary education and; (v) access to
antiretroviral drugs for the population with advanced HIV/AIDS (Figure 3 and Table 8).

In line with the PRSP, the authorities plan to intensify poverty reduction
measures and prepare social protection systems. For 2012, they intend to give priority
to measures aimed at reducing hardship and enhancing employment opportunities for
vulnerable groups (MEFP, ¶ 25).

V. PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND POLICY FOR THE REST OF 2011–12
31.
Performance under the program has been good despite the impact of social
turmoil in the first part of the year. At end-June 2011, all quantitative performance
criteria, and indicative targets, but one, were met (Text Table 2). The performance
criterion on the overall budget deficit (including grants), was met with a wide margin,
after adjustment for the shortfall in grants at end-June. The indicative target on revenue
was exceeded mainly because of a stronger-than-anticipated revenue from the corporate
sector following the implementation of the 2010 tax reform. However, poverty-reducing
social expenditure was below target, reflecting delays in budget execution, partly linked
to the social turmoil in early 2011.

32.
The authorities implemented most structural measures for the third review
(Text Table 3). An audit of the expenditure commitment systems in line ministries was
completed, and a new system integrating external financing flows was put in place as
expected. In the cotton sector, the study on new financing mechanisms for the pricesmoothing fund was completed. The study’s recommendations provided a basis for
setting the producer prices and bonuses for the 2011–12 crop. However, the second study
on the cotton inputs fund was completed with a two-month delay.
33.
The authorities recognized the need to maintain a prudent fiscal policy to
meet the programmed fiscal targets. In the 2011 supplementary budget, the basic
primary balance is projected to narrow to 4.2 percent of GDP (5 percent in 2010), as
anticipated at the time of the second review. Revenue mobilization is set to benefit from a
stronger than anticipated impact of the 2010 tax reform, and higher revenue from the
mining sector because of the end of the tax holiday for some mining companies, and
higher royalties (MEFP ¶19). Expenditure would be slightly above the original program
level, because some capital expenditure from the 2010 investment program was executed
in early 2011. Current expenditure is expected to be on target, with the wage bill slightly
above the programmed level, reflecting the authorities’ decision to increase some civil

23
servants’ benefits in the fourth quarter. The adjustment is part of a broader set of
measures, some of which were implemented in May 2011,3 aimed at addressing demands
from labor unions in the aftermath of the 2011 social unrest. The authorities have taken
steps to accelerate the execution of the investment program in the second half of the year,
to ensure that capital outlays are consistent with original projections.

34.
The 2012 fiscal program is consistent with the medium-term fiscal objectives.
The basic primary balance is projected at 2.5 percent of GDP, down from 4.2 percent in
2011 (Table 4). To raise revenue to 16.2 percent of GDP, the authorities plan to intensify
efforts to reduce tax evasion and fraud, enhance transit trade monitoring, and increase
information technology resources in revenue collecting agencies. To this end, the
authorities plan to set up a one-stop window for customs clearance, and an electronic
system to improve merchandise valuation in two customs posts. Expenditure composition
reflects the authorities’ resolve to increase capital expenditure to support growth
objectives. It also takes into account wage adjustments budgeted for 2012, covering the
elimination of overdue payments on past promotions for some civil servants, an increase
is some benefits to reduce inequities in the compensation system; and a 5 percent salary
increase. These measures would raise the wage bill to 6.3 percent of GDP, up from
6 percent in 2011(MEFP, ¶¶ 18–22).
35.
Staff emphasized that civil service reforms were critical for the attainment of
fiscal objectives. It encouraged the authorities to maintain the merit-based promotion

24
system, while taking the necessary administrative measures to ensure that promotions in
the civil service are paid within the year. Key reform measures programmed for 2012
include completing the civil service census, setting-up biometrics cards for civil servants,
and completing a diagnostic study on the compensation system. The authorities are
hopeful that these measures will generate some savings and contribute to lowering the
wage bill as a share of GDP over the medium term.
36.
The program is fully financed. At 9.9 percent of GDP, the overall budget deficit
on a cash basis, would be covered with external financing and borrowing from the
WAEMU bond market.
37.
The attached Letter of Intent updates the government’s policies and
commitments for 2011–12. The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to policies
geared towards macroeconomic stability and growth-enhancing structural reforms. The
focus remains on furthering reforms in PFM, civil service, and cotton and financial
sectors reforms. They are requesting that the implementation of the microfinance strategy,
not observed at end-June because of technical problems, be rescheduled to end-December
2011. Understandings were reached on a new structural benchmark for December 2012
for reviewing the compensation system and making the harmonized personnel
management system operational. This should strengthen the wage policy and reduce
inequities in the civil service payroll.
38.
The program will be monitored on a semiannual basis. Staff agreed with the
authorities on quantitative benchmarks and performance criteria as well as structural
benchmarks for the fourth and fifth ECF reviews. Quantitative financial targets for endJune and end-December 2012 are performance criteria (Appendix I). The fourth and fifth
ECF reviews are expected to be completed by June 15, and December 15, 2012
respectively.
39.
Burkina’s capacity to repay the Fund is sound. Debt service to the Fund is
projected at SDR 5.0 million at the end-2012, or 0.3 percent of exports of goods and
services, and 8.3 percent of quota (Table 5).
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
Economic developments and prospects are promising. Despite exogenous
shocks in 2011, performance in agriculture, cotton, mining, and services sectors is
expected to be strong and support the projected growth for 2011–12. Price pressures
earlier in the year have subsided, and inflation should remain moderate. The outlook is,
however, subject to downside risks linked to a potential worsening of the global
economy, and climatic conditions.
41.
Decisive structural reforms are needed to support the authorities’ objectives
in the PRSP. Although economic growth has generally been strong, the narrow
production base is an important source of vulnerability for the economy. To support
growth and poverty reduction objectives in the PRSP, it will be critical to accelerate
growth-enhancing structural reforms, particularly in the cotton and financial sectors; and
to improve the business climate further. Staff encourages the authorities to proceed with

25
the implementation of diversification and other growth supporting initiatives envisioned
in the PRSP.
42.
Staff finds that fiscal policy is focus appropriately on enhancing revenue
mobilization and creating adequate space for priority spending and investment.
Sustained implementation of revenue-enhancing measures, combine with high levels of
budget aid, supported the authorities’ efforts to increase social spending, address
exceptional needs triggered by exogenous shocks and social unrest, and increase
domestically financed investment. Staff urges the authorities to maintain revenue
mobilization efforts, and to prepare a medium-term revenue strategy to underpin their
objectives under the PRSP. Staff believes that a strong revenue performance would also
shield the budget from potential fluctuations in external budget support, and price shocks.
More generally, staff encourages the authorities to maintain fiscal discipline, enhance
expenditure management further, and improve efficiency in public investment execution
to support economic growth, and long-term debt sustainability.
43.
Staff commends the authorities for maintaining sound policies under the
program despite a difficult environment in the first half of 2012. All quantitative
performance criteria and indicative targets for end-June 2011 were met, except for
poverty-reducing spending and; most structural benchmarks were observed. Staff urges
the authorities to meet the annual targets for pro-poor spending, particularly in light of the
impact of adverse shocks on vulnerable groups earlier in 2011.
44.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for the completion of the third ECF
review. Based on a strong program performance and the authorities’ policy commitment
in the Letter of Intent, staff supports their request for completion of the third review and
the disbursement of the fourth loan under the ECF arrangement.
45.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Burkina Faso takes
place in accordance with Decision No. l4747 (10/96) adopted on September 28, 2010, on
consultation cycles.

APPENDIX I—LETTER OF INTENT
Ouagadougou, December 7, 2011
Christine Lagarde
Managing Director,
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street NW
WASHINGTON, DC 20431 (USA)

Dear Mrs. Lagarde:
1.
The government of Burkina Faso remains determined to address the country’s
developmental challenges, as reflected in the ambitious goals set in the PRPS.
2.
Despite a difficult social and regional environment in the first half of the year, the
government maintained the course for economic policies, while taking mitigating
measures to address the impact of the exogenous shocks. Despite these shocks, however,
economic prospects for 2011 and 2012 are promising. Economic growth is expected to be
in line with projections for both years, while inflationary pressures should be moderate.
Nonetheless, the government is committed to fiscal discipline to consolidate recent
progress in fiscal sustainability, and support macroeconomic stability.
3.
The government maintained sound policies, and implemented its economic and
financial program supported by the IMF under the Extended Credit Facility in a
satisfactory manner. As a result, at end-June 2011, all quantitative performance criteria,
and all indicative targets, except for the one on poverty reducing spending were met and,
most structural reforms measures were implemented. Furthermore, as indicated in the
attached MEFP, the government maintains its resolve on reform implementation and
prudent fiscal management. Therefore, it is convinced that program objectives for endDecember 2011 are reachable, as reflected in the 2011 supplementary budget, in the case
of fiscal objectives.
4.
The draft budget for 2012 is consistent with the programmed fiscal targets. It calls
for continued revenue mobilization efforts and prudent expenditure management. In
particular, the government intends to increase capital and pro-poor expenditure to support
its growth and poverty reduction objectives, and to ensure that the wage policy remains
consistent with medium-term fiscal sustainability. In this vein, the agreement reached
with labor unions on November 29, 2011 is fully consistent with this objective. As a
result, the overall fiscal deficit budgeted for 2012 stands at 3 percent of GDP, down from
3.9 percent of GDP in 2011.
5.
The government is convinced that the economic and financial policies presented
in the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) support the
achievement of medium-term objectives, and in particular, those set under our ECF–

36
supported program. It is determined to take any additional measures that may become
necessary to reach the objectives. Should such measures become necessary, the
government will consult with the IMF before their adoption, and before any revision to
policies outlined in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such
consultation. Furthermore, the government will provide the IMF with information on
policy and reform implementation, as agreed under the attached Technical Memorandum
of Understanding, or upon request.
6.
In view of the strong program performance and policy commitments outlined in
the MEFP attached to this letter, the government of Burkina Faso requests the completion
of the third ECF review, and the fourth disbursement totaling SDR 6.45 million.
7.
As was the case in the past, the government authorizes the IMF to publish this
Letter of Intent and its attachments, as well as the staff report, upon approval by the IMF
Executive Board.

Sincerely yours,
/s/
Lucien Marie Noël BEMBAMBA
Minister of Economy and Finance
Officier de l’Ordre National

APPENDIX I--ATTACHMENT I
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2011–12
DECEMBER 7, 2011
I. Introduction
1.
The economic and financial program of Burkina Faso, supported by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) is intended
to consolidate macroeconomic stability, enhance growth prospects, and step up the fight
against poverty, in line with the objectives of the Strategy for Accelerated Growth and
Sustained Development (SCADD). This memorandum of economic and financial policies
taking stock of the program's implementation as of end-June 2011, and outlines economic
policies and reforms that the government intends to undertake to achieve the objectives
set in its economic and financial program for the remainder of 2011 and 2012. It
supplements the Letter of Intent from the Minister of Economy and Finance, as well as
the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies of June 28, 2011.
II. Recent Economic Developments and Program Implementation
at end-June 2011
A. Recent Economic Developments
2.
Economic activity was affected by social unrest during the first half of 2011.
Nonetheless, economic growth is expected to stand at 5.6 percent, supported primarily by
continued dynamism in the mining sector and the recovery of cotton production. The
mining sector should benefit from the expected expansion in production, projected at
21.3 percent, and the coming on stream of a manganese mine, with a projected production
of 60,000 tons. The production of cottonseed should rise by 21.7 percent for the 2010/11
crop year. This increase is partly due to the continued support to producers and the
increasing use of genetically-modified cottonseeds. As for consumer prices, annual
average inflation is projected at 1.4 percent, well below the 3 percent WAEMU
convergence criterion, reflecting essentially the impact of a good harvest from the
2009/10 crop year, and the favorable outlook for the 2010/2011 food crop.
3.
The external position of Burkina Faso should improve in 2011. Net capital
inflows, particularly in the form of budgetary assistance and the CFAF 30 billion in
foreign assistance expected under the Millennium Challenge Account, should offset the
projected deficit on the current account (excluding grants) and support a sharp
improvement in the overall balance of payments, compared to 2010.
4.
Money supply was up by 6.1 percent in June 2011 compared with end-December
2010. The increase was essentially due to rise in credit to the private sector, as well as a
significant use of bank financing by the Treasury, caused in part by the low disbursement

38
rate of budgetary support at end-June. The increase in net credit to the government and in
credit to the economy thus contributed to a rise in net domestic assets, which more than
offset the decline in net foreign assets.
5.
The financial system remains sound overall. The majority of banks continues to
uphold prudential standards and are sufficiently capitalized according to the new regional
rules. Moreover, they have remained active on the regional bond market and were not
adversely affected by the post-election crisis in Côte d'Ivoire at the beginning of the year.
6.
On the fiscal front, performance on the revenue side was strong at end-June 2011,
while there were some weaknesses on expenditure execution. Revenues were in fact
11.4 percent higher than anticipated, thanks to measures to strengthen the revenue
collection units and make them more accountable. Expenditure execution was weaker
than expected, reflecting delays in the procurement process which, combined with the
impact of social unrest, had an adverse impact on both investment and social spending in
the first six months of the year. The midterm implementation review of the 2011 budget
produced a number of recommendations that are expected to improve the execution rate
for capital expenditure in the context of a new supplementary budget for 2011, submitted
to the National Assembly in September. Budget execution during the first half of 2011
revealed the need for further adjustments to the budgetary closeout framework introduced
in 2010, in order to ensure closer adherence to the budget calendar.
B. Results of Program Implementation
7.
The majority of program objectives for end-June were met. The total revenue
floor of CFAF 347.6 billion was exceeded by 11.4 percent, as revenue topped
387.3 billion. Moreover, thanks to ongoing efforts to ensure closer monitoring of
businesses, the large taxpayer non-filer rate was 2.3 percent compared to a program target
of 5 percent for end-June: 2 percent for the VAT, 5 percent for the IUTS (tax on wage
income) and 2 percent for the IMF (minimum tax on businesses)—with a taxpayer
follow-up rate of 100 percent. The performance criteria on overall budget deficit set at
CFA 91 billion was met despite the shortfall in budgetary assistance experienced at endJune. However, social spending fell short of objectives, in part because of delays in the
execution of capital expenditures. The government maintained a prudent foreign
borrowing policy: it neither contracted nor guaranteed debt on non-concessional terms.
Nor did it accumulate domestic payment arrears.
8.
Most structural measures set for end-June 2011 were met (see Table 1 below).
These include in particular the completion of the audit of finance and administration units
(DAFs); implementation of the integrated external financing system; and completion of
the study on mechanisms for financing the price-smoothing fund. The recommendations
from that study were used to establish a new system for setting producer prices as of the
2011/12 cotton year. However, the study on the inputs fund was completed after the
scheduled date of end-June 2011 because of data collection problems.

39
9.

With respect to fiscal reforms, the following measures were taken:



As part of the antifraud campaign, two scanners were purchased for the customs
offices at Ouagadougou (road) and Bobo Dioulasso (station) and a startup test was
conducted at Ouagadougou. Corrective maintenance, preparation of an operating
procedures manual, and a public information and awareness campaign are on
course for implementation by the end of the year. However, the ORBUS customs
preclearance system will be deployed late, as it took longer than expected to
obtain the consent of the principal financing partner supporting this component of
customs facilitation reforms.



For reducing payment times, a Council of Ministers adopted a decree on July 27,
2011 instituting budget expenditure verification units in line ministries and
institutions. Arrangements are now in place to make five verification units
operational on a pilot basis.



The Technical Secretariat of the Budget Execution and Cash Management
Monitoring Committee is now responsible for validating the data in the
government flow-of-funds table (TOFE) before its submission to the Committee,
which meets monthly. This step will further strengthen the reliability of data in the
TOFE and reduce the time taken to complete it.

10.
There has been significant progress in preparations for the transition to a resultsbased budgeting framework by 2017, as recommended by WAEMU. The principal steps
taken in 2010 related to: (i) adoption of a conceptual memorandum by the Council of
Ministers; (ii) organization of stakeholder awareness campaigns, including in the regions;
and (iii) development of a methodological guide on the preparation of program budgets.
That document was used as the basis for preparing program budgets for the seven pilot
ministries in 2010.
11.
With respect to internalizing WAEMU fiscal directives, a work schedule was
adopted in January 2011 and three subcommittees finalized drafts of the following texts:
(i) preliminary draft law on the transparency code, (ii) preliminary draft budget law,
(iii) draft decree issuing general regulations on government accounting, (iv) draft decree
establishing the legal regime applicable to government accounting officers, and (v) draft
decree establishing the TOFE. These texts are expected to be validated by end-2011 and
introduced for adoption by the National Assembly.
12.
Measures to strengthen debt management capacity were pursued, including the
following:


Preparation of an action plan to address the vulnerabilities noted in the Debt
Management Performance Assessment (DEMPA) prepared by the World Bank
during the March 2011 mission.

40


Inclusion of a risk analysis in the annual indebtedness strategy for 2012. However,
there is still a need to strengthen risk analysis capabilities, and a request has been
made to the IMF Institute for an on-site training course for selected staff.



Training for staff involved in introducing the Integrated External Finance System.



To facilitate use of the borrowing and debt management procedures manual
adopted in 2009, training sessions were held for 63 officers during June 2011.

13.
The authorities pursued reforms in the cotton sector. Actions to strengthen the
management of SOFITEX were furthered, and the main recommendations from the study
on the price-smoothing fund were implemented. The study on the inputs fund is expected
by end-October 2011. The authorities have also begun work on an action plan to
implement the strategy for reducing the government’s stake in SOFITEX.
14.
With respect to the financial sector development strategy, the following actions
were taken: (i) a note was prepared outlining the strategy for restructuring the postal
services including the overhaul of the information system, an improvement in the
reliability of the postal financial services files, and a review of the organizational
structure of SONAPOST; (ii) systematic and regular supervision was established for
insurance companies and brokerage firms and the list of insurance agents and brokers was
updated by the Insurance Directorate; and (iii) a workshop was held to validate the new
microfinance development strategy in October 2011.
15.
Progress was made with regard to implementation of a new pricing mechanism for
petroleum products. The provisional report from the study was examined in March 2011
by a consulting firm, which provided guidance for finalizing the study in June 2011
during a validation workshop. The final report will be submitted to the Council of
Ministers for review and adoption so that the new system can be implemented by endDecember 2011.
III. Economic Policies for 2011–12
A. Macroeconomic Framework
16.
The government intends to pursue strategies and actions to support growth and
reduce poverty, in the context of the SCADD. For 2012, economic growth is projected at
5.8 percent, average inflation at around 2 percent, and the external current account deficit
at 6.9 percent.
17.
To achieve these objectives, the government will focus on: (i) vigorous pursuit of
steps to strengthen fiscal progress to date, in terms both of revenue mobilization and of
expenditure and cash management; (ii) implementation of structural reforms; and
(iii) strengthening of social policy; and (iv) implementation of the measures and programs
planned in the SCADD.

41
B. Fiscal Policy
18.
Fiscal policy will focus on maintaining growth by boosting public investment and
supporting private sector investment within a sustainable macroeconomic and financial
framework. In 2011, the overall fiscal deficit (on a commitments basis, excluding grants)
is projected at 10.9 percent of GDP, slightly up from 2010, despite higher revenues. The
deficit will be financed by budgetary assistance from the country's development partners
within the general framework for the organization of budget support, expected
disbursements from the IMF, and a bond issue on the WAEMU market.
19.
Revenue is projected at 16.2 percent of GDP in 2012, compared to 15.8 percent of
GDP in 2011. This increase reflects the recovery in economic activity, continued
organizational improvements in the revenue collecting units, implementation of the new
tax provisions adopted in 2010, and higher international gold prices. Non-tax revenue
collection will also benefit for the payment of telecommunication revenue for the fourth
mobile telephone license.
20.
Total expenditure and net lending should amount to 26.1 percent of GDP in 2012
compared to 26.7 percent of GDP in 2011. Expenditure control remains an important
objective of the government. Thus, nominal increase in spending would be modest, while
reflecting the objective of supporting economic recovery. In this context, while spending
for priority sectors would rise, current expenditure would drop from 13.5 percent of GDP
in 2011 to 12.8 percent of GDP in 2012.
21.
Capital expenditure is projected to rise to 13.5 percent of GDP in 2012, to support
the economic recovery and achieve the growth objectives in the SCADD. Expenditure
priority areas would be: (i) boosting support for rural development, including
rehabilitation of dams and reservoirs; (ii) improving the areas surrounding the dams to
make more farmland available; (iii) developing economic infrastructure; (iv) intensifying
efforts to fight poverty; and (v) promoting employment and reducing unemployment,
particularly among young people and women.
22.
Regarding the wage bill, the government intends to respond to claims from labor
union following the social unrest earlier this year, to increase purchasing power for civil
servants. Nonetheless, the government plans to address these demands while ensuring that
the wage policy remains consistent with medium-term fiscal sustainability objectives.
Therefore, the government plans to accelerate civil service reforms programmed for 2012,
and to take additional measures aimed at reducing inequities in the compensation system
for civil servants. Some of the measures will have a financial impact that will increase the
wage bill from 6 percent of GDP in 2011 to 6.3 percent of GDP in 2012. Nonetheless, the
real impact could be lower because of savings expected from civil service reforms in
2011–12. Moreover, the government believes that the planned reforms would strengthen
the wage policy and make the merit-based promotion system more efficient. More
generally, a better control on the size of the civil service through the setting up of
biometrics card, and merit-based promotion would contribute to a deceleration in the

42
wage bill over the medium term. The key measures programmed for 2011–12 are the
following:


The extension in the last quarter of 2011 of the housing and advising allowances
to civil servants that did not benefit from these allowances at end-June 2011.



Clearance of late payments in promotions granted during 2009–2010 and timely
payment of 2011 promotions, in 2011.



Increase of the base salary by 5% in 2012.



Preparation of a diagnostic study on the compensation system by end-December
2012 (Structural benchmark); and the launching of the civil service census in
December 2011. Results from the census would lead to the harmonization of the
payroll system and the civil service roster, and the efficient setting up of the
biometrics card for civil servants.
C. Borrowing Policy and Debt Management

23.
The government is committed to a prudent borrowing policy in order to avoid
over-indebtedness, while mobilizing significant resources to finance growth. It intends to
pursue its policy of relying on grants and concessional loans to meet its financing needs.
24.
Efforts to strengthen the government's debt management capacity will continue in
2011–12. In particular, steps will be taken to correct the shortcomings noted by the World
Bank DEMPA mission of March 2011, with particular emphasis on developing a
medium-term debt management strategy, for which the government intends to request
technical assistance from the IMF and the World Bank, improving debt auditing, and
holding training activities.
D. Social Policy
25.
With respect to efforts to support the most vulnerable groups, and more generally
to fight poverty, social spending is anticipated to amount to 7 percent of GDP in 2012.
The following actions are planned for 2012:


Strengthening of the social safety nets, in particular the school lunches program
and obstetrical care.



Launch of an ambitious employment program for young people and women,
funded with CFAF 10 billion and supported by several technical and financial
partners.



Implementation of priority items in the action plan for the national social
protection policy (PNPS) now in preparation. A national forum to validate the
proposed PNPS is planned for November 2011.

43
E. Implementation of the SCADD
26.
The 2011–2013 performance matrix for the SCADD adopted on September 30,
2011, calls for:


Launching the work on sources of growth. In this context, the government plans to
begin implementation of the pilot Bagré growth project; adopt a law to develop
public-private partnerships, adopt an inputs strategy to support agricultural
productivity; carry out the technical work on national backbone infrastructure to
speed the introduction of information and communication technologies; manage
the industrial zones of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso sustainably; and adopt a
new mining code and regulations.



Consolidating human capital. The government plans to expedite the
implementation of the program for construction of school and health
infrastructure, as well as measures to match training and employment
opportunities through the development of technical education and vocational
training.
IV. Structural Reforms for 2011–12
A. Financial Sector

27.
In the financial sector, the government plans to deepen reforms by further
implementing the financial sector development strategy. To this end, the government will
seek to establish a framework conducive to greater competition among financial sector
participants; to promote the insurance sector, while pursuing activities underway in the
CNSS to strengthen its solvency over the medium and long term; to improve access to
financing in rural areas and for small and medium-sized enterprises; to boost financing
for housing and access to ownership; and to improve the legal and judicial framework
essential to the financial system and its stability.
28.
To improve SME access to financial services, the government will promote the
microfinance sector by strengthening its institutional framework. It also plans to adopt
and implement, by December 2011, the new microfinance development strategy and its
action plan.
B. Public Finance Reforms
29.
Efforts to improve expenditure management will be pursued. Particular emphasis
will be placed on further reducing payment times, stricter monitoring of the expenditure
system in the line ministries, and implementation of the recommendations from the audits
of the financial administration directorates. The following measures are planned by endSeptember 2012:


Benchmarking of new functionalities in the expenditure system to shorten
payment times.

44


Option for computerized rejection of irregular supplier submissions when the
grounds for rejection are attributable to the supplier.



Introduction of acknowledgment of receipt to make staff more accountable for
meeting timeliness standards.



In order to ensure timely processing, expenditure verifications (liquidations) not
processed within a certain time limit by appropriations managers will be
automatically abandoned.

30.
In order to strengthen capital budget execution and improve the business
environment, a meeting will be held in November 2011 with all persons involved in
government procurement procedures to identify ways of improving those procedures. The
government also intends to continue the practice of advance planning for procurement, to
train the members of procurement sub-commissions, and to step up the monitoring of
procurement plans.
31.
In preparation for the transition to results-based budgeting, all ministries and
institutions will be expected to define their programs in 2011, consistent with the SCADD
and the Millennium Development Goals. Burkina Faso intends to respect the Community
target of moving to results-based budgeting by 2017. In this context, the medium-term
expenditure framework will remain a very important tool for meeting the objectives of the
SCADD.
V. Program Monitoring
32.
The authorities intend to take all measures necessary to achieve the objectives and
benchmarks agreed with IMF staff, as presented in Tables 1and 2 of this memorandum.
The program will be monitored in accordance with the Technical Memorandum of
Understanding, which defines quantitative performance criteria and requirements for data
reporting to IMF staff. The program will be reviewed twice yearly. For the duration of the
program, the government undertakes not: (i) to introduce restrictions on payments and
transfers under current international transactions or tighten any such restrictions without
prior consultation with the IMF; (ii) to introduce or modify multiple currency practices;
(iii) to conclude bilateral payment agreements incompatible with the provisions of
Article VIII of the IMF Articles of Agreement; or (iv) to introduce restrictions on imports
for balance of payments purposes.
33.
Program reviews: the conclusion of the fourth program review, scheduled for
June 15, 2012, is conditional upon the observance of performance criteria for
December 31, 2011; the conclusion of the fifth program review, scheduled for
December 15, 2012, is conditional upon the observance of performance criteria for
June 30, 2012; and the conclusion of the sixth program review, scheduled for
May 31, 2013, is conditional upon the observance of performance criteria for
December 30, 2012.

APPENDIX I--ATTACHMENT II
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Ouagadougou, December 7, 2011
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) defines the quantitative
performance criteria and indicative targets, as well as structural benchmarks to assess
performance under the program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). It also
sets deadlines for data reporting.
I. DEFINITIONS
2.
Government. Unless otherwise indicated, “government” means the central
administration of Burkina Faso and does not include any local administration, the central
bank, or any other public or government-owned entity with autonomous legal personality
not included in the government flow-of-funds table (TOFE).
3.
Definition of debt. For the purposes of the relevant assessment criteria, the
definition of debt is set out in Executive Board Decision No.6230-(79/140), Point 9, as
revised on August 31, 2009 (Decision No. 14416-(09/91)).
a) the term “debt” will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability,
created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form
of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make
one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at
some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or
interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms,
the primary ones being as follows:
i.

ii.
iii.

loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the
basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future
(including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’
credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully
collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds,
and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in
the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements);
suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to
defer payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are
delivered or services are provided; and
leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the
lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that
are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property,
while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the
guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all
lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement
excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance

48
of the property.
b) Under the definition of debt above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded
damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation
that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not
considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise
to debt.
4.
Debt guarantees. For the purposes of the relevant assessment criteria, the
guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal obligation of the government to service
a debt in the event of nonpayment by the debtor (involving payments in cash or in kind).
5.
Debt concessionality. For the purposes of the relevant assessment criteria, a debt
is considered concessional if it includes a grant element of at least 35 percent;1 the grant
element is the difference between the present value (PV) of debt and its nominal value,
expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of
its contracting is calculated by discounting the future stream of payments of debt service
due on this debt.2 The discount rates used for this purpose are the currency specific
commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs), published by OECD.3 For debt with a
maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year-average CIRR is used to calculate the PV of
debt and, hence, its grant element. For debt with a maturity of less than 15 years, the sixmonth average CIRR is used. The margins for differing repayment periods (0.75 percent
for repayment periods of less than 15 years, 1 percent for 15 to 19 years, 1.15 percent for
20 to 29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more) are added to the ten-year and sixmonth CIRR averages.
6.
External debt. For the purposes of the relevant assessment criteria, external debt
is defined as debt borrowed or serviced in a currency other than the CFA franc. This
definition also applies to debt among WAEMU countries.
7.
Reporting requirements. The government will report any new external
borrowing and its terms to Fund staff as soon as external debt is contracted or guaranteed
by the government, but no later than within two weeks of such external debt being
contracted or guaranteed.
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
8.
Quantitative performance criteria are proposed for June and December 2011 for
the overall deficit (commitment basis, including grants) as defined in paragraph 4;
1

The following reference on the IMF website creates a link to a tool that allows for the calculation of the
grant element of a broad range of financing packages: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/conc/calculator.
2

The calculation of concessionality will take into account all aspects of the debt agreement, including
maturity, grace period, payment schedule, upfront commissions, and management fees.
3

For debts in foreign currencies for which the OECD does not calculate a CIRR, calculation of the grant
element should be based on the composite CIRR (weighted average) of the currencies in the SDR basket.

49
contracting or guaranteeing of non-concessional and short-term external debt as specified
below in this paragraph; and accumulation of external arrears. Programmed amounts for
March and September 2011 are benchmarks. The following performance criteria will be
monitored on a continuous basis: (i) the contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external debt by the government, public enterprises and other official sector
entities unless excluded in Tables 1 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies (MEFP), as well as private debt for which official guarantees have been extended
and which, therefore constitute a contingent liability of the government; (ii) the
contracting or guaranteeing of new short-term external debt; and (iii) the accumulation of
arrears on the external debt service of the government.
A. Overall Deficit Including Grants
Definition
9.
For the program, the overall deficit including grants is valued on a commitment
basis (base engagement). It is the sum of foreign and domestic financing (net) of the
government measured from the financing side plus cash basis adjustment. Net foreign
financing is the sum of foreign borrowing minus amortization. Net domestic financing is
the sum of (i) net bank credit to the government, including both net bank credit to the
treasury as defined below and other government claims on and debts to national banking
institutions; (ii) unredeemed government bills and bonds held outside national
commercial banks; and (iii) privatization receipts. Net bank credit to the treasury is the
balance of the treasury’s claims and debts vis-à-vis national banking institutions. Treasury
claims include the cash holdings of the Burkinabè Treasury, deposits with the central
bank, deposits with commercial banks, secured obligations, and government deposits with
the postal system (CCP). Treasury debt to the banking system includes funding from the
central bank (including statutory advances, consolidated advances, IMF financing, and
refinancing of secured obligations), government securities held by the central bank,
funding from commercial banks (including government securities held by commercial
banks), and CNE (Caisse Nationale d’Épargne Postale)/CCP securitized deposits. Net
bank credit to the government is calculated by the Central Bank of West African States
(BCEAO), whose figures are recognized as valid for program purposes. The stock of
treasury bills and other government debt, as well as net foreign financing, is calculated by
the Ministry of Finance. Cash basis adjustment is the sum of (i) expenditure commitments
not paid (engagées nonpayées); and (ii) change in treasury deposits.
10.
All these items are valued according to the statement of government budgetary
execution established monthly in the central government’s financial operations table. This
is prepared by the Permanent Secretariat for the Monitoring of Financial Policies and
Programs (SP-PPF), in collaboration with the other departments of the Ministry of
Economy and Finance.

50
Adjustment
11.
The overall deficit including grants is adjusted upward by the amount that grants
fall short of what is programmed up to a maximum of CFAF 25 billion (see the
MEFP Table 1). It will not be adjusted if grants are higher than programmed.
12.
The overall deficit including grants will also be adjusted upward by the amount
that concessional loans exceed what is programmed up to a maximum of CFAF 15 billion
(see the MEFP Table 1).
Reporting deadlines
13.
The Ministry of Economy and Finance will forward data to the IMF on the overall
deficit excluding grants within six weeks after the end of each quarter.
B. Nonaccumulation of External Arrears
Performance criterion
14.
The government’s external debt is the stock of debt owed or guaranteed by the
government. External arrears are external payments due but not paid on the due date.
Under the program, the government undertakes not to accumulate arrears on its external
debt, except those arising from government debt being renegotiated with creditors,
including non-Paris Club bilateral creditors. Nonaccumulation of external arrears is a
performance criterion, to be observed continuously.
Reporting deadlines
15.
Data on outstanding balances, accumulation, and repayment of external arrears
will be forwarded within six weeks after the end of each month.
C. Nonconcessional External Debt Contracted or
Guaranteed by the Government
Performance criterion
16.
The government undertakes not to contract or guarantee any non-concessional
external debt beyond the ceiling indicated in the MEFP (Table 1). This performance
criterion applies to debt as defined in paragraph 3 and to external debt as defined in
paragraph 6 of this TMU; and it uses the definition of debt concessionality as defined in
paragraph 5 of the same document. This performance criterion also applies to
commitments contracted or guaranteed (including lease-purchase contracts) for which no
value have been received. This criterion also applies to the guaranteeing of private sector
debt by the government, which consequently constitutes a contingent liability of the
government, as defined in section I of this memorandum. In addition, this criterion
applies to public enterprises, local governments, and other official entities (including
administrative, professional, and scientific and technical public agencies) unless excluded
in the MEFP (Table 1). External debt excludes Treasury bills and bonds issued in CFA
francs on the WAEMU regional market. This performance criterion is to be observed

51
continuously. It is measured on a cumulative basis from the time of approval of the ECF
by the Executive Board. No adjuster will be applied to this criterion.
Reporting deadlines
17.
Details on any loan (terms and creditors) to the government or guaranteed by the
government must be reported within four weeks of the end of each month. The same
requirement applies to guarantees granted by the government.
D. Government Short-Term External Debt
18.
The definitions in paragraph 11 also apply to this performance criterion. Shortterm external debt is debt with a contractual term of less than one year. Import- and
export-related loans, Treasury bills issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU regional
market, normal short-term supplier credits, and debt relief operations are not covered by
this performance criterion.
Performance criterion
19.
In the context of the program, the government undertakes not to contract or
guarantee short-term nonconcessional external debt. The definition of nonconcessional in
paragraph 5 applies here. The government also undertakes not to contract or guarantee
any short-term external debt without having first determined its concessionality with IMF
staff. This performance criterion is to be observed continuously. As of September 30,
2010, the government of Burkina Faso had no short-term external debt.
III. OTHER QUANTITATIVE INDICATIVE TARGETS
20.
The program also includes indicative targets on total government revenue,
poverty-reducing social expenditures, accumulation of domestic payment arrears, and
large taxpayer nonfiler rates.
A. Total Government Revenue
Definition
21.
Total government revenue is valued on a cash basis. It includes all tax and nontax
revenue collected by the Directorate General of Taxation, the Directorate General of
Customs, the Burkinabè Treasury, and revenue collection units at ministries and
institutions. It also includes revenue from treasury checks.
Reporting deadlines
22.
Details on total revenue will be sent to IMF staff by the SP-PPF of the Ministry of
Finance and Budget within six weeks after the end of each month.

52
B. Poverty-Reducing Social Expenditures
Definition
23.
Poverty-reducing social expenditures are defined by the PRSP priority sector
programs designed to accelerate the reduction of poverty. They cover all spending
categories for the following ministries: Primary Education and Literacy; Health; Social
Action and National Solidarity; Promotion of Women; Labor and Social Security;
Employment and Youth; Agriculture, Water and Fishing Resources; Animal Resources;
and Environment and Living Conditions. They also cover rural roads and HIPC resources
(Category 5) for infrastructure spending and HIPC expenditures only for the Justice
Ministry and the Ministry of Economy and Development. These expenditures are
monitored directly through the budget.
Reporting deadlines
24.
The government will report within six weeks after the end of each month the
monthly data on poverty-reducing social expenditures.
C. Nonaccumulation of Domestic Payment Arrears
Definition
25.
The government will not accumulate any arrears on domestic government
obligations during the program period. This is a benchmark to be observed continuously.
Reporting deadlines
26.
Data on balances, accumulation, and repayment of arrears on domestic
government obligations will be reported within four weeks after the end of each month.
D. Large Taxpayer Nonfiler Rate
Definition
27.
The large taxpayer nonfiler rate is the ratio of late and nonfilers in the Large
Taxpayer Office (LTO) relative to the total number of taxpayers obligated to file in LTO.
A late filer is anyone who files a tax return after the deadline. A nonfiler is anyone in the
database who did not file taxes. The main tax categories are the VAT (TVA), the
corporate income tax (BIC), and the tax on wage income (IUTS). Filing deadlines for the
main tax categories are set in the tax code.
Reporting deadlines
28.
The government will report within two weeks after the end of each quarter the
total number of late and nonfilers as well as the total number of taxpayers obligated to file
in LTO for the main tax categories.

APPENDIX II—EXCHANGE RATE ASSESSMENT1
The exchange rate assessment suggests that Burkina Faso’s real effective exchange rate
was broadly in line with economic fundamentals with a misalignment in the range of -0.1
to 8.4 percent. REERs analysis based on price indices that accounts for producers’ costs
and profitability shows mixed results and volatility over the last decade.
I. Effective Exchange Rate Developments
1.
The exchange rate has fluctuated in recent years, reflecting developments in
the euro, to which the CFA Franc is pegged.2 In 2007–2009, the nominal effective
exchange rate (NEER) and the real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by about
9.3 percent and 8.3 percent, respectively, reflecting the strengthening of the euro against
the U.S. dollar. Because the euro weakened somewhat in 2010, and inflation declined, the
REER depreciated by 8.4 percent (Text Figure 1).
2.
Recent exchange rate developments in Burkina Faso were similar to those in
other WAEMU countries. Except for Mali and Niger, other WAEMU countries
experienced a REER appreciation in 2005–08, which was subsequently reversed in 2009
and 2010 (Text Figure 2).

II. Exchange Rate Assessment with CGER Methodologies3
A. Macroeconomic Balance Approach
3.
The macroeconomic approach assesses external sustainability based on a
current account norm consistent with medium-term economic fundamentals. It
suggests an overvaluation of 1.3 percent. Using this approach, the model estimates the
exchange rate adjustment needed to close the gap between the current account (CA)
norm, defined as the estimated equilibrium CA, and the CA balance projected over the
medium term. The results show that the CA norm4 is narrower than the projected CA
deficit for 2015 by about ½ percent of GDP. Hence, accounting for the elasticity5 of the
CA to the REER, a REER depreciation of 1.3 percent would be needed to restore the
balance (Table 1).

B. The External Sustainability Approach
4.
The external sustainability (ES) approach assesses external stability using the
current account balance that would stabilize net foreign assets at a benchmark level.
This approach comes to an overvaluation of 8.4 percent. Under the ES approach, the
model estimates the difference between the medium-term CA balance and the CA balance
that would stabilize the country’s net foreign assets (NFA) at a benchmark level.
Simulation results show that the CA deficit projected for 2015 is larger than the NFA-

3

The exchange rate is assessed using the three approaches advocated by the IMF Consultative Group on
Exchange Rate Issues (CGER): the Macroeconomic Balance approach; the External Sustainability
Approach, and the Equilibrium Real Effective Exchange Rate.
4

To estimate the CA norm, we use the model and coefficients from Lee and others (2008). Results show
that the main contributors to Burkina Faso’s CA norm are the lagged value of current account deficit (with a
contribution to the norm of -1.8 percent), the medium-term oil balance (-1.42 percent), and the mediumterm income differential (-1.9 percent).

Estimated by Tokarick (2010).

58
stabilizing CA deficit by 3.5 percent of GDP, leading to an estimated overvaluation of the
REER of 8.4 percent6 (Table 1).
C. Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate Approach
5.
The reduced-form equilibrium real
exchange rate approach (ERER) calculates
the difference between the equilibrium
exchange rate and the actual exchange rate.
Comparing the paths of the REER and the
estimated long-term equilibrium REER shows
that the CFAF was overvalued in the 1980s, and
then became undervalued from 1994—when it
was devaluated by 50 percent compared to the French Franc. The figure above shows that
the REER remained undervalued until 2009.
6.
The ERER approach suggests an overvaluation of about 3.2 percent in 2009
and a moderate undervaluation in 2010. Estimates indicate that in 2009, the ERER was
113.6 while the average REER stood at 117.3, leading to an estimated overvaluation of
about 3.2 percent. The depreciation that took place from mid–2010 to mid–2011 brought
the REER near equilibrium in 2010 with an ERER at 110.17 compared with an average
REER of 110.06; hence a slight undervaluation of 0.1 percent.7

6

The note uses Burkina Faso’s 2009 NFA from the updated and extended version of the Lane and MilesiFerretti (2007) dataset provided by the IMF research department.
7
The ERER is estimated using Burkina Faso’s specific model based on the country’s productivity proxied
by its real GDP per capita relative to trading partners, terms of trade, government consumption, and the
country’s openness proxied by the ratio of trade flows to GDP. The assessment at end-2009 shows an
overvaluation whereas the one at end-2010 shows an undervaluation because the REER depreciated in 2010
more than the ERER (7.2 percentage points vs. 3.4). The main positive contributor to the ERER is terms of
trade.

59
III. Assessment Using REERs Based on Other Price Indices
7.
The REER assessment using price indices other than the consumer price
index, confirms the CGER8-based methodology results. This method uses price indices
better suited in capturing some aspects of producers’ profitability than the consumer price
index (CPI),9 notably costs structure and profit margins: unit labor cost (ULC), labor
productivity (LP), and internal terms of trade (TT). The results point to an appreciation of
the exchange rate in recent years. In addition, producers’ competitiveness was eroded by
an increase in unit labor costs and terms of trade, as well as slow improvement in labor
productivity in Burkina Faso compared with its trading partners (Figure 1).

The Consultative Group on Exchange Rate issues (IMF).

The CGER-based assessment presented above makes use of a CPI-based REER, which is the most popular
REER.

60
8.
During the last five years, Burkina Faso’s price competitiveness and labor
productivity remained broadly in line with the WAEMU standards. While unit labor
costs, terms of trade, and the GDP deflator increased in all WAEMU countries, for
Burkina Faso, these indicators were lower than in most countries in the region. In
addition, Burkina Faso had the second highest labor productivity of the region
(Figure 2).10

IMF staff.

IV. Non-Price Competitiveness
9.
Despite the abovementioned results, Burkina Faso needs to further structural
reforms to address non-price competitiveness impediments to private sector
development. With its currency pegged to the euro and monetary policy conducted by the
regional central bank, continued efforts are needed to reduce transaction costs and
improve the business environment further. Although there has been progress on some of
the World Bank Doing Business indicators,11 Burkina Faso was ranked 134 out of 139 in
the 2010–11 Global Competitiveness Index. Inadequate access to finance, poor

Excluding Benin, Togo, and Guinea-Bissau for which data are not available.

Burkina Faso’ s ranking improved from 154 under the 2010 Doing Business indicators to 150 under the
2012 indicators (out of 183 countries). In the 2012 survey, the country ranked 24th in Sub-Saharan Africa
and second in WAEMU after Mali (which ranked 22nd in Sub-Saharan Africa).

61
infrastructure, an unskilled workforce, weak regulation, and the country’s limited
absorptive capacity are among the main factors identified as hindering private sector
development. Similarly, the country’s scores under the World Governance Indicators
generally fall below the 50th percentile, though higher than the WAEMU countries’ scores
and the Sub-Saharan Africa average scores.12
V. Conclusion
10.
The ER assessment using CGER methodologies suggests that the exchange
rate is broadly in line with fundamentals for Burkina Faso, with a misalignment in
the range of -0.1 to 8.4 percent. REER assessment using other price indices indicates
that competitiveness has been eroded by the nominal appreciation of the NEER, an
increase in Burkina Faso’s relative unit labor costs and terms of trade, and a slower
improvement in labor productivity compared to trading partners. REERs developments
based on indices capturing producer profitability and non-price competitiveness
indicators point to the need for continued structural reforms to support private sector
development.

12

Compared to a range of [-0.25 , +0.25], Burkina Faso scored -0.24 for voice and accountability, -0.11 for
political stability, -0.58 for government effectiveness, -0.11 for regulatory quality,-.21 for rule of law, and 0.37 for corruption control in the 2010 World Governance Indicators.

APPENDIX III—PUBLIC INVESTMENT SCALING UP, GROWTH AND DEBT
1
SUSTAINABILITY IN BURKINA FASO
Introduction
1.
This note examines the link between public investment, growth and debt
sustainability for the Burkina Faso economy. It uses an open-economy Dynamic
General Equilibrium (DGE) model developed by Buffie and others (2011) to simulate the
macroeconomic implications of investment scaling-up, based on the assumption in the
authorities’ new PRSP.
2.
Simulation results from the model are consistent with results from the 2011
DSA analysis based on the IMF/World Bank Low Income Debt Sustainability
Framework. The note discusses them under two external financing options, and the fiscal
adjustment (tax policy) needed to safeguard long-term debt sustainability. The discussion
takes into account Burkina Faso’s particular circumstances, namely the country’s
membership to a customs and monetary union – which limits the scope for unilateral
adjustment in the Value-Added Tax (VAT) rate; the high risk of debt distress; and the
economy’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks.
Calibration
3.
The model is calibrated to match salient features of the Burkinabe economy.
While all steady state ratios—based on recent National Accounts and fiscal data—are
specific to Burkina Faso, “deep” parameters are calibrated to the average LIC as in Buffie
and others (2011) where relevant information was not available for Burkina Faso.
4.
The efficiency of public investment drives the model’s quantitative results. To
account for various weaknesses in the investment process we assume that 70 cents out of
each dollar spent in public investment increases the stock of productive infrastructure.
This parameter’s value is also slightly above the 60 cents per dollar benchmark assumed
in Buffie and others (2011), reflecting Burkina Faso’s relatively good score in the recent
“Public Investment Management Index” (PMI) developed by Dabla-Norris and others
(2011), which ranked Burkina Faso in the fourth quartile of the PMI distribution in a
sample of 71 developing countries.
5.
Public investment is assumed to yield an annual gross return of 25 percent.
This value appears appropriate because it applies to effective infrastructure, thus netting
out inefficiencies in the capital accumulation process. The assumed return on
infrastructure is in line with the relevant literature (see, e.g., Dalgaard and Hansen (2005),
and Briceno-Garmendia (2010), among others).

64
Simulation Results and Policy Implications
6.
Combining concessional borrowing with immediate and unlimited fiscal
adjustment appears compatible with long-term debt sustainability, but requires a
drastic change in tax policy. This scenario is based on the investment scaling-up
contemplated in the authorities’ new PRSP, which includes a doubling of the public
investment budget to US$2.2 billion over a 5-year period. The results indicate that the
long-run effects of investment scaling-up are positive. In particular, economic growth
increases significantly, particularly in the medium-term, benefitting from higher and
efficient public investment and increased private sector investment; and external debt
declines to about 20 percent of GDP in the long-term, after an initial increase at the
beginning of the period. In the fiscal area, however, taking as given the projected path of
official grants2, the adjustment needed to supplement concessional loans to cover scaledup investment leads to an increase in the consumption tax rate of more than 10 percentage
points in five years, also reflecting the assumed rising cost of infrastructure (Figure 1).
For Burkina Faso, this implies that the Value-added Tax (VAT) rate would rise to almost
30 percent, which is neither feasible nor desirable from the macroeconomic viewpoint.
7.
Additional concessional borrowing with delayed and limited fiscal
adjustment leads to an unsustainable level of public. To correct for the
abovementioned results on fiscal adjustment, the model was simulated on the assumption
that the VAT rate remains unchanged for the first five years, and is subsequently raised
by about 2 percentage points. Under this scenario, additional concessional borrowing is
needed to cover the same level of scaled-up public investment as in the baseline scenario.
Simulation results point to a positive macroeconomic impact similar to the baseline
scenario, with less pronounced negative impact in private investment and consumption in
the initial years—as the tax rate does not rise immediately. However, the additional
borrowing raises external public debt to almost 60 percent of GDP in the medium term
(Figure 2). Although the ratio declines subsequently, it remains elevated, and raises
concerns in view of the high risk of debt distress facing Burkina Faso under current
policies. The impact of the debt profile is even stronger with a staggered increase in the
VAT
8.
A staggered increase in the VAT rate lessens the impact of the fiscal
adjustment, and but deteriorate the long-term debt profile. Simulation results indicate
that a stagger increase in the VAT rate could help achieve a smoother fiscal adjustment in
the medium term. However, if the scaled-up investment is financed with the additional
revenue, and borrowing on commercial terms, the stock of external public debt rises to
unsustainable levels in the medium to long-term, reaching some 80 percent of GDP after
a 30–year period (up from less than 20 percent of GDP at the beginning of the simulation
period). As shown in empirical studies, such a build-up of external debt may hamper
long-term growth prospects.

Based on the macroeconomic framework under the ECF-supported program.

65

66
9.
Access to nonconcessional borrowing to complement concessional financing
of scaled-up investment under the new PRSP seems incompatible with long-term
debt sustainability. Under this scenario (Figure 3), commercial loans are assumed to
accrue a nominal interest rate of 9.9 percent, based on available estimates for Burkina
Faso in Gueye and Sy (2010). Imposing a 20 percent cap on the VAT to smooth the fiscal
adjustment, simulation results show that, compared with the baseline scenario, there is a
new stock of commercial debt reaching almost 10 percent of GDP after five years and the
total stock of public debt rises above 50 percent of GDP before returning to historical
levels. The impact on growth is, however, similar to the baseline scenario, while access to
commercial borrowing increases external debt obligations, which may prove challenging
for Burkina Faso considering the country’s narrow export base and vulnerability to terms
of trade shocks.

10.
Scaling up investment at a modest and continued pace, while improving
collection of user fees for infrastructure services, may support debt sustainability
and fiscal objectives. Simulation results with public investment scaling-up assumptions
under the ECF-supported program suggest that, while the long-term impact of growth is
somewhat lower than in scenarios based on the investment scaling-up under the new
PRSP, the additional concessional borrowing is compatible with long-term debt
sustainability. However, the required fiscal adjustment remains strong, although less

67
drastic than in the baseline scenario. Simulations show that a staggered increase in the
VAT rate could correct for this effect and provide a smoother fiscal adjustment path.
Hence, financing modest increases in public investment through additional revenue—
under a staggered tax structure—and concessional borrowing could help contain the
impact of the fiscal adjustment and support long-term debt sustainability (Figure 4).
Simulations also show that an increase in user fees collection from the current 40 percent
in Burkina Faso to about 80 percent would reduce the fiscal adjustment needed to
safeguard debt sustainability by about a percentage point.

Caveats
11.
The model in buffie and others (2011) is an interesting tool for assessing the
impact of scaled-up public investment on growth and on the implications of
financing options on debt and fiscal sustainability. Results from the simulations can
inform policy decisions on the speed and magnitude of scaled-up investment and
implications for financing options, and the needed fiscal adjustment. It is worth noting,
however, that as is the case with any such exercise, the results depend on the assumptions.

68
Nevertheless, the main policy conclusions appear quite robust to reasonable changes in
parameter values.
Conclusion and the Authorities’ Views
12.
Despite a strong long-term macroeconomic impact, scaling-up public
investment may have adverse implications for debt sustainability and require a
drastic short-term fiscal adjustment. Results from the application of a DGE model to
Burkina Faso’s economy show that, under certain conditions, scaling-up investment to
levels envisioned in the authorities’ new PRSP would raise economic growth
substantially in the medium to long-term, boost private investment, and increase
consumption. The results also highlight that the choice of financing options for the
scaled-up investment should be guided by their implications for long-term debt
sustainability, and the resultant fiscal adjustment. In particular, simulation results suggest
that scaling-up public investment with insufficient fiscal adjustment may lead to
unsustainable levels of external public debt, which, as show in empirical studies, may
crowd out private sector investment and hamper long-term growth prospects. Similarly,
unlimited fiscal adjustment to finance higher investment may have undesirable
macroeconomic effects. Taking into account Burkina Faso’s particular circumstances, the
results seem to indicate that a better macroeconomic outcome would be achieved if the
investment scaling-up is moderate, and financed with higher grants and concessional
loans, as well as increased government revenue. The latter could be achieved through a
staggered increase in the VAT rate and enhanced collection of user fees on infrastructure
services.
13.
The authorities welcomed the analysis and broadly agreed with the policy
recommendations. They found that the financing option with higher grants and
concessional loans was consistent with their approach for financing the new PRSP. In this
vein, they expressed interest in using the model’s results for the upcoming donors’
conference scheduled for early 2012. In the discussion, they found that under all
simulation scenarios, the tax adjustment was neither realistic nor feasible because of
Burkina Faso’s obligations on VAT harmonization as a member of a monetary and
customs union. They concurred with staff, however, that it was important to raise revenue
to create fiscal space for higher investment, regardless of the policy instrument used to
this effect.

BURKINA FASO
Joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund
And the International Development Association
Approved by Michael Atingi-Ego and Thomas Dorsey (IMF)
and Jeffrey D. Lewis and Marcelo Giugale (IDA)
December 8, 2011
The results of the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) are similar to those of the previous
DSA. Burkina Faso’s risk of debt distress is high, because the present value (PV) of debtto-exports ratio is projected to breach its policy-dependent indicative threshold under the
baseline scenario and under the stress tests.1 However, the breach is projected to occur
about 10 years later than in the previous DSA, reflecting better exports prospects over the
period. Other debt burden indicators remain below their policy-dependent indicative
thresholds under the baseline and stress tests scenarios. In the context of the new PRSP
adopted in late 2010, Burkina Faso plans to scale up investment, particularly in
infrastructure, to accelerate growth and reduce poverty. The DSA results indicate that
financing needs for higher public investment would have to be met mostly with grants and
concessional loans to support long-term debt sustainability.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Burkina Faso’s stock of debt comprises public and publicly guaranteed
external debt and domestic debt. At end-2010, external debt amounted to 23.9 percent
of GDP with some 80 percent owed to multilateral creditors (Figure 1) and about a third

1

Under the LIC DSF, it is expected that better policies and stronger institutions help countries manage
higher levels of debt. Hence, the thresholds for the DSA are policy-dependent and determined based on the
World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutions Assessment (CPIA) classification. Based on the average
CPIA score in 2008–10, Burkina Faso is ranked as a “medium performer”. The relevant indicative
thresholds for countries in this category are: 40 percent for the present value (PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio; 150
percent for the PV of debt-to-exports ratio; 250 percent for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio; 20 percent for
the PV of debt service-to-exports ratio; and 30 percent for the PV of debt service-to-revenue ratio.

External debt policy has remained prudent. Burkina Faso has systematically
sought grants and concessional loans to cover financing needs. Hence, under the
Fund-supported program, the 35 percent grant element requirement for public and
publicly-guaranteed external debt is strictly enforced, and investment projects are
consistently analyzed by a National Public Debt Committee before loan negotiations are
initiated. The DSA assumes that during 2017–31, the structure of Burkina Faso’s external
debt would not change (see Figure 1), and therefore, the average grant element would
remains above 35 percent.

This DSA is carried out with a macroeconomic outlook reflecting the
expected improvement in economic prospects over the medium to long term (Box 1,
Table 1). The outlook underpinning the DSA accounts for the impact of the projected
increase in public investment, particularly in infrastructure to achieve growth and poverty
reduction objectives outlined in the authorities’ new PRSP adopted in December 2010.
The outlook reflects also the projected expansion in the mining sector, through higher
gold production and the development of mines for other minerals, better prospects in the
cotton sector, and increased diversification in the agriculture sector. Consequently, real
GDP growth is projected to average 7.3 percent in 2017–31, compared with 6.2 percent in
the previous DSA. The noninterest current account deficit, although remaining moderate,
is forecast to be higher than in the 2010 DSA because demand for oil and capital goods
imports is expected to remain strong, in line with the projected increase in public
investment, and improved economic prospects. Similarly, the external debt path is less
favorable than in the previous DSA, with the rate of debt accumulation increasing steadily
during 2011–20, before stabilizing over the long-term. Fiscal consolidation efforts are
expected to be intensified to increase the domestic resource contribution to investment
financing: tax revenue is forecast to increase from 15.6 percent of GDP in 2017 to
17.3 percent of GDP in 2031 thanks to a combination of increased revenue from mining
and private sector activities and efficiency gains in tax administration; and the overall
fiscal balance (including grants) is projected to improve more markedly than under the
previous DSA. The macroeconomic framework also assumes that foreign aid would be
consistent with historical trends in the medium-term and gradually decline as revenue
performance strengthens.

73

Box 1. Burkina Faso: Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA
Real GDP is projected to average 6.4 percent in the medium term, supported by the expected increase in
gold production and global prices, improved production in the cotton sector, notably thanks to higher
productivity with the planned extended use of genetically modified cotton seeds, and the projected buoyant
activity in the services sector. Growth projections are higher than in the 2010 DSA, reflecting a more
positive outlook: the 2010 DSA outlook, which was marked by uncertainties and downside risks following
the 2008–09 terms of trade and climatic shocks that adversely affected economic activity. In the longer
term, growth prospects are expected to be enhanced through: (i) higher and more efficient public
investment, particularly in infrastructure. Key projects under the PRSP include the Samendeni dam, the
Bagre growth pole, and the Donsin airport; (ii) increased energy supply as planned investments in the sector
are completed; (iii) implementation of diversification initiatives scheduled in the new PRSP with greater
participation from the private sector and; (iv) continued implementation of growth-enhancing structural
reform measures. In this vein, an efficient implementation of the financial sector strategy will be critical in
broadening access to financial services and supporting private sector development. Real GDP is forecast to
expand by 7.4 percent on average during 2017–31, despite a projected deceleration in export growth, as
explained below, thanks to the expected impact of higher public investment on infrastructure and public
works, and the anticipated growth in the services sector.
Inflation is expected to remain moderate and in the low-single digits, as the authorities plan to intensify
measures initiated in recent years to support agriculture production, which have resulted in increased supply
of agricultural food products and helped contain inflationary pressures. On this basis, and assuming
moderate increase in import prices, as well as continued prudent regional monetary policy, inflation is
forecast to remain below 3 percent during the projection period.
The external current account deficit, excluding grants, is forecast at about 10 percent of GDP on average
in the medium to long term. Under the baseline scenario, higher export growth assumptions compared with
the previous DSA reflect the expected improvement for gold and cotton export earnings as WEO
projections show that gold and cotton prices will on average remain at the current high levels for the next
two decades. Over the long term, export growth is projected to remain strong, but decelerating towards the
end of the period. These projections reflect conservative assumptions on prospective production in the
agriculture, and cotton sectors in view of uncertainties on weather conditions over the long term; and a
moderate increase in gold export volume taking into account the lifespan of existing mines. Imports are
expected to remain strong as investment increases and oil prices are projected to remain high. The external
current account (excluding official transfers) is projected to widen from 9.9 percent of GDP in 2012 to
about 11 percent of GDP in 2016, before declining to 8 percent in 2027 and 6½ percent of GDP in 2031.
The basic primary fiscal deficit is expected to average 1.4 percent of GDP during 2012–16, and to decline
over the long term. This mainly reflects a projected strong revenue mobilization based on increased
efficiency in revenue collecting agencies, measures to curb fraud and tax evasion, and to modernize tax
administrations. These assumptions are more optimistic than under the previous DSA. They take into
account the impact of the 2010 tax reform strategy and prospects for higher taxes in the mining sector. The
anticipated higher revenue mobilization would create additional fiscal space for increased government
investment; and externally financed investment would average 5.8 percent of GDP in 2017–30, thus
strengthening the authorities’ efforts to accelerate growth. The DSA macroframework assumes that current
transfers would average about 4 percent of GDP during 2017–31, while investment outlays would reach
some 13 percent of GDP over the medium to long term, compared with about 11 percent in the last 10
years. External budget support is assumed to average 3.6 percent of GDP during 2017–31

74

4.
Debt dynamics are positively affected by the higher growth and export
assumptions. DSA results show that under the baseline scenario, at the end of the
projection period, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio deteriorates only marginally compared
with the previous DSA, despite a higher rate of external debt accumulation. In the
external sector, the PV of the debt-to-exports ratio breaches the policy-dependent
threshold nearly 10 years later than in the previous DSA thanks to the robust performance
of the export sector, and decelerates thereafter. Nevertheless, those improvements could
be jeopardized by terms of trade and weather-related shocks that could affect Burkina
Faso’s GDP and export growths.
II. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
5.
The external debt sustainability analysis shows that the risk of debt distress is
high because the PV of debt-to-exports ratio deteriorates during the projection period
(Table 2 and Figure 1). In the baseline scenario, it is projected to increase from 71 percent
in 2011 to 114 percent by 2021, and 176 percent in 2031, well-above the 150 percent
threshold. The DSA shows comparable results under alternative scenarios. In particular,
the PV of debt-to-exports ratio would reach 273 percent by 2031 under the most extreme
shock, which assumes less favorable borrowing conditions for new debt (an increase in
interest rate of 2 percentage points). These results suggest that Burkina Faso’s long-term
debt profile would deteriorate significantly if investment-financing needs were covered
with nonconcessional loans. An alternative scenario assuming a lower grant element over
the long term produces similar results (Figure 2). The PV of debt-to-exports ratio would
also breach the policy-dependent indicative threshold in the case of a shock that would
prevent the projected improvement in exports earnings, or other key macroeconomic
variables.
6.
The DSA results indicate that other external debt indicators would remain
below their policy-dependent thresholds. Under the baseline and alternative scenarios,
the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio and the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio increase somewhat,
without breaching their respective indicative thresholds during the projection period. For
both indicators, the standard stress tests do not point to particular vulnerability to shocks
(Table 2). In particular, under the assumption of less favorable borrowing conditions for
new loans, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio increases from 17 percent in 2011 to about 24
percent in 2031 (with a 40 percent threshold); and the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio
increases from 108 percent in 2011 to 123 percent in 2031 (with an indicative threshold
of 250 percent).
7.
Results from DSA stress tests are consistent with downside risks to Burkina
Faso’s medium-term outlook, which are related to the economy’s vulnerability to terms
of trade shocks and fluctuations in climatic conditions that may affect economic growth
and export earnings. While these shocks may affect exports and growth and increase the
PV of debt-to-exports ratio, sensitivity analysis shows that a positive shock leading to an

75
export growth of about 8 percent during 2017–31 (compared with 5.3 percent in the DSA
framework) would lower the risk of debt distress to moderate levels.
III. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
8.
The DSA results do not change with the inclusion of domestic debt in the
analysis (Table 3). Burkina Faso’s stock of domestic debt amounted to about 3.2 percent
of GDP at end- 2010. It comprises government bonds (82 percent) and consolidated
liabilities to the banking system. Since the stock of domestic debt is low, and projected to
decline based on repayment schedules,3 DSA results on public debt are similar to the
above-mentioned results on external debt.
IV. DEBT MANAGEMENT ISSUES
9.
Debt management capacity needs further improvement. The authorities have
taken measures in recent years to enhance debt management capacity. The World Bank
mission (March 2011) on Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA),
concluded that Burkina Faso had made significant progress on most debt management
indicators, compared with the 2008 DeMPA assessment. However, some weaknesses
remained, covering mostly: (i) the lack of a well-articulated medium-term debt
management strategy (MTDS); (ii) weak auditing procedures; (iii) lack of procedures to
take into account the cost and risks of prospective loans; (iv) inadequate controls of the
filing system and; (iv) weak procedures for database access rights. The authorities are
continuing efforts to strengthen debt management capacity, notably through training and
increased Information Technology resources. They are also planning to request technical
assistance from the IMF and the World Bank for the preparation of a MTDS in 2012.
10.
Burkina Faso is classified as a “low debt management capacity” country
under the IMF/World Bank Debt Limits Framework. The authorities are hopeful that
further progress on debt management in 2011–12, would support an upgrade to a “higher
capacity”, leading to some flexibility on borrowing conditions.
V. AUTHORITIES VIEWS
11.
The authorities concurred with the DSA results and reaffirmed commitments
to prudent debt policies. They stressed, however, that while maintaining an overall
prudent borrowing policy, some flexibility was needed under the current IMF/WB LICs
debt limits framework. They believe that access to nonconcessional borrowing would
support their efforts to mobilize increased financing and scale-up investment under the
new PRSP.

3

Although financing from the WAEMU regional bond market is a financing option in the medium to long
term, the DSA assumes that the authorities would not contract new domestic debt over the projection
period. This assumption is consistent with the fact that so far bonds issuance are done on an annual basis.

76
V. CONCLUSION
12.
Burkina Faso is subject to a high risk of debt distress. DSA results indicate
that while other debt burden indicators are well-below their policy-dependent indicative
thresholds, the PV of debt-to-exports ratio is projected to breach its policy threshold in
the long term. In addition, Burkina Faso’s external debt is vulnerable to shocks that may
adversely affect export earnings. The results highlight the need for continued prudent
borrowing policies, fiscal consolidation, and economic diversification.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguards Assessments:

The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is a common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAMU). The most recent
safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on March 1, 2010. The 2010 update
assessment found that the BCEAO continues to have controls in place at the operational
level. The overall governance framework needed nonetheless to be strengthened by the
addition of an audit committee to ensure that the Board of Directors exercises appropriate
oversight over the control structure, including the audit mechanisms and financial statements.
The Institutional Reform of the WAMU and the BCEAO completed after the approval of the
safeguards report stipulated creation of the Audit Committee, which should now start
working. Efforts to implement fully the International Financial Reporting Standards reporting
framework should also be pursued.
XI.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Burkina Faso is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU)
and has no separate legal tender. The union’s common currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to
the euro at a rate of CFAF 655.957 = EUR 1, consistent with the official conversions rate of
the French franc to the Euro and the previous fixed rate of the CFA franc to the French franc
of CFAF 100= F 1. On December 8, 2011, the rate of the CFA franc in terms of SDR was
CFAF 877.85 = SDR 1.0. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the
WAEMU countries has been reclassified to the category of conventional pegged arrangement
from the category of exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new
classification is based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous
classification was based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus
only reflects a definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a
substantive change in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its
member. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
on current international transactions.

90

XII.

Article IV Consultations:

The periodicity of Burkina Faso’s Article IV consultation is set in accordance with the
July 15, 2002 Executive Board Decision on consultation cycles. Discussions on the 2011
Article IV consultation were held between September 29–October 14, 2011 in Ouagadougou.
The staff report for the 2011 Article IV consultation was considered by the Executive Board
on December XX, 2011. The staff report on the previous Article IV consultation was
considered by the Executive Board on December 14, 2009. The next Article IV consultation
is scheduled for September 2013.
XIII. ROSC/AAP:
An FAD mission visited Ouagadougou during May 7–18, 2001 to assist the authorities
undertake a draft fiscal module of a Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC). The final report, which was issued in July 2002, found that Burkina Faso was
making good progress in a number of areas to increase the transparency and accountability of
government. Additional efforts are needed to bring a number of improvements to the point of
implementation, particularly with regard to expenditure tracking at the local level and
external audit functions. Initial discussions indicated that the authorities broadly concurred
with the mission assessment. On July 31, 2002, the authorities formally adopted an action
plan based on the recommendations of the final ROSC.
An STA mission during May 8–21, 2003 assisted the authorities in preparing a data ROSC.
The report was published in March 2004. The mission found that most of the methodologies
used in the compilation of macroeconomic statistics are in broad conformity with
internationally accepted guidelines. However, most datasets are affected by limited or
impaired source data arising from irregularity in the conduct of surveys (national accounts),
use of outdated weights (CPI), or low response rate to surveys (balance of payments). For
CPI and government finance statistics, data dissemination meets the SDDS requirement, but
for other macroeconomic datasets, timeliness falls short of GDDS recommendations. The
authorities broadly concurred with the main findings of the mission as well as the
recommendations made to address them.
The team, jointly with World Bank staff, also discussed a HIPC Initiative Assessment and
Action Plan (AAP) with the authorities. The aim was to assess the capacity of the public
expenditure management system to track poverty-reducing public expenditures under the
HIPC Initiative and the need for technical assistance to enhance that capacity. The mission
secured the officials’ approval of the jointly prepared preliminary assessment; identified the
main needs for technical assistance on upgrading the capacity to track such expenditures; and
drew up a draft outline action plan. This plan identifies the main needs for further technical

91

assistance to improve tracking of poverty-reducing expenditures. The AAP has been
endorsed by the authorities.

III. Statistical Issues
Burkina Faso—Statistical Issues Appendix
(October 2011)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
The most affected areas are: national accounts and price statistics. Burkina Faso has received
technical assistance (TA) from the IMF; the TA has been partially financed by Japan.
National accounts: Annual GDP estimates are compiled by economic activity, by
institutional sector accounts and by expenditure categories at current and constant prices
(1999=100). The quality of the national accounts estimates is affected by the scarcity of
suitable data sources and by deficiencies in statistical practices. The informal sector is not
properly captured—estimates are derived from limited surveys of the informal sector
conducted in 1989 and 1996. An updating survey was envisaged in early 2011 but postponed
because of the social unrest and funding requirements that could not be met. Most medium
and small enterprises in the “modern sector” fall short of submitting accounting statements or
tax declarations. Private household consumption is estimated as the residual and is not
adequately validated with supply-use tables. These estimates are refined using results from
the household budget-consumption surveys.
Price statistics: The CPI (2008=100) only covers households living in the capital; it
excludes non-African households, various types of purchased goods and services, and
services of owner-occupied dwellings. The prices of unavailable products are presumed
unchanged for a period of up to three months—best practice would impute a price change for
these items based on the recorded prices changes for closely related products. Though the
software package used for calculating the CPI has been overhauled in 2011, the authorities
are planning for further improvements. The producer price index and the wholesale price
index are not compiled and the development of these indices is still not envisaged because of
budgetary constraints.
Government finance statistics: A committee was put in place to oversee the compilation of
government finance statistics and strengthen coordination among fiscal agencies. The
provision of expenditure data has also improved with the adoption of functional presentation
of expenditure. The remaining areas for improvement include mainly the extension of the
TOFE coverage to the general government and basing its compilation on the Treasury ledger.
Monetary finance statistics: Most of the problems in monetary statistics are not specific to
Burkina Faso but affect all member countries of the WAEMU. The BCEAO has encountered
difficulties in estimating currency in circulation in each WAEMU member country due to
large backlogs of unsorted banknotes held by the central bank in its various national
agencies.

102

Balance of payments (BOP): The coverage of informal trade is incomplete. Improvements
in the coverage of services and transfers (especially workers’ remittances) depend on the
intensification of contacts with reporting bodies. While the 2003 data ROSC mission found
that the response rate for the survey among industrial and commercial enterprises was only
40 percent. Annual surveys, reporting foreign direct investment transactions, are conducted
yearly, in line with requirements under the 6th revision to the manual for the compilation of
the BOP. To improve the quality of the BOP reports, the BCEAO authorities also plan to
integrate two additional data sources: the regional stock exchange transactions and the firms’
balance sheet database. However, the attempt to include data from regional stock exchanges
was abandoned because of technical difficulties in monitoring intraday inflows and outflows
by foreign nationals. The BCEAO authorities have indicated that quarterly data, derived from
banking settlement reports, is used to assess BOP reports. BOP compilers receive payment
statements every ten days. However, the information is not used in the compilation of the
annual BOP statements, but rather to support data quality controls and to provide early
information to the BCEAO authorities. The BCEAO will start publishing data on the
international investment position of Burkina Faso with the adoption of the 6th revision to the
manual for the compilation of the BOP, and is therefore revising its surveys design and
adapting its software accordingly. The launch of the new tools and procedures is expected for
2013.
II. Data Standards and Quality

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Since October 2010, annual data and quarterly data covering budgetary central government
are reported to STA for publication in International Financial Statistics and the Government
Finance Statistics yearbook. The latest reported data cover 2010. The BCEAO reports
monetary data to STA with a lag of at most three months. Despite requests, BOP and IIP data
have not been reported to STA for publication in IFS and the BOPSY since 2001

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Burkina Faso
On December 21, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Burkina Faso.1
Background
Sustained implementation of sound policies and reforms in recent years, as well as
strong performance in key sectors driving growth helped the Burkinabè economy
withstand several exogenous shocks in 2008-10. Economic growth has been robust;
inflation has been trending down since the flare-up in 2008 caused by the global food
and fuel prices; and the external current account deficit has narrowed, mostly reflecting
the significant increase in gold exports. The authorities have maintained fiscal
consolidation efforts, while mitigating the impact of exogenous shocks, and enhancing
poverty reduction programs. In the later area, the authorities implemented a number of
initiatives and took measures to support vulnerable groups. Key programs included
school lunches, support to the elderly, and a cash transfer program. During 2001-10, the
share of poverty reducing spending in total expenditure rose from 17.5 to 28 percent.
These efforts were aided by progress in revenue mobilization and financial support from
Burkina Faso’s development partners.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

106

The authorities made important progress in implementing structural reforms in recent
years, particularly in revenue collection, expenditure and Treasury cash flow
management, cotton sector rehabilitation, the business environment, and the financial
sector. In the later area, the authorities prepared strategies for the development of the
financial and microfinance sectors, and implemented a divesture and rehabilitation
program for selected banks. They continue to seek funding for the efficient
implementation of the financial sector strategy. The authorities have also maintained a
prudent borrowing policy, consistent with debt sustainability analysis that points to a
high risk of debt distress for Burkina Faso.
In 2011, economic growth is projected at 5.6 percent, from7.9 percent in 2010, mostly
driven by an expansion in the agriculture and mining sectors, which were marginally
affected by the social turmoil and exogenous shocks in the first half of the year. Thanks
to a good harvest, inflation is estimated to average 1.4 percent. The external current
account (including grants) is projected to stabilize around 3½ percent of GDP,
benefitting from the projected improvement in terms of trade; and the overall fiscal
deficit (excluding grants) would increase to 10.9 percent of GDP, from10.1 percent of
GDP in 2010, partly reflecting measures taken by the authorities to address adverse
shocks in 2011.
The medium-term outlook is promising. Economic growth is forecast to reach 6.4
percent by 2013, thanks to the programmed public investment scaling-up, particularly in
infrastructure; continued structural reforms; and the projected expansion in the mining
sector. Inflation is expected to remain below 3 percent, thus complying with the West
African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) convergence criterion. The external
current account deficit is projected to widen from 8.2 percent of GDP in 2011 to 10.9
percent in 2013, mainly because imports demand is expected to remain strong and to
grow faster than exports in 2012-13. With continued measures to enhance revenue
mobilization and expenditure management, the fiscal position is projected to improve in
2012 and over the medium-term, with the overall deficit declining from 10.9 percent of
GDP in 2011 to 9 percent in 2013, notwithstanding an increase in investment and propoor spending.
Key risks to the economic outlook are related to the economy’s vulnerability to terms of
trade shocks that might affect commodity prices, particularly for cotton, gold, and oil; and
adverse changes to climatic conditions that would weaken growth prospects.

107
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ sustained implementation of sound
policies and structural reforms, which has contributed to robust economic growth, low
inflation, and a broadly favorable external position. They noted, however, that global
uncertainties and climatic conditions pose downside risks to the near-term outlook. In
addition, daunting macroeconomic challenges remain, and poverty is still widespread.
Directors underscored that continued fiscal consolidation, improved social policies, and
decisive implementation of structural reforms will be critical to achieve sustained,
broad-based economic growth and poverty reduction.
Directors encouraged the authorities to maintain fiscal discipline within the context of a
medium-term fiscal framework, while increasing investment and social spending. They
welcomed the continued focus on revenue mobilization to boost domestic resource
availability. Directors also emphasized the need to strengthen expenditure
management, contain current spending, and increase targeted poverty-related
spending. In particular, they underscored that wage policy should remain prudent and
supportive of medium-term fiscal objectives, and they encouraged full pass-through of
international fuel price movements to domestic fuel prices.
Directors agreed with the authorities’ focus on scaling up investment to close the
infrastructure gap and boost economic growth. Nevertheless, they stressed the need to
improve investment efficiency, and to ensure that investment financing strategies are
consistent with long-term debt sustainability. They noted that Burkina Faso remains at a
high risk of debt distress, and called for continued prudent debt management anchored
on grants and highly concessional loans.
Directors stressed that further progress on structural reforms will be critical to enhance
competitiveness and stimulate broad-based economic growth. They highlighted the
importance of reforms to improve the business environment and support private sector
development, including strengthening the regulatory and judicial framework. Continued
rehabilitation of the cotton sector will be crucial. Directors also urged acceleration of
financial sector reforms to reduce financial sector vulnerabilities and to broaden access
to financial services.

IMF Executive Board Completes Third Review Under ECF Arrangement for Burkina
Faso and Approves US$9.95 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the third
review of Burkina Faso’s economic performance under the program supported by the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The completion of the review will enable the disbursement
of an amount equivalent to SDR 6.45 million (about US$9.95 million), bringing total
disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 26.804 million (about US$41.36 million).
The three-year ECF Arrangement for Burkina Faso was approved by the Board on June 14,
2010 (See Press Release No. 10/241). The Executive Board also concluded the 2011 Article
IV consultation with Burkina Faso today. A Public Information Notice will be published in
due course.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Burkina Faso, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
“The Burkinabè authorities are to be commended for their steadfast implementation of
policies and reforms supportive of macroeconomic stability and economic growth, despite a
difficult social environment. Good performance in the agriculture, mining and services
sectors have supported economic growth and price stability despite adverse trade and weather
shocks. In addition, increased export production and prices have strengthened Burkina Faso’s
external position in recent years.
“The Burkinabè authorities’ continued efforts to enhance revenue collection have increased
fiscal space for much needed public investment and priority social spending. The authorities
need to enhance these efforts and advance public financial management reforms to support
medium-term fiscal consolidation.
“To build on recent progress and enhance medium-term prospects, the Burkinabè authorities
will need to maintain the momentum of structural reforms to diversify economic activity and
enhance competitiveness. In particular, they will need to push ahead with measures aimed at

2

reducing transaction costs for the private sector, supporting financial sustainability in the
cotton sector, and improving the business climate. Implementation of the financial sector
development strategy should be accelerated, with a view to broadening access to financial
services for small and medium-size enterprises.
“The ambitious public investment program underway, in accordance with the new Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper, is critical to reduce the infrastructure gap and support broad-based
growth. However, financing options for the investment budget will have to be weighed
carefully, taking into account Burkina Faso’s high risk of debt distress.
“In view of the Burkinabè economy’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks that affect the most
vulnerable in the population, the authorities need to place special emphasis on the preparation
of a social safety net.”

111

Statement by Mr. Assimaidou on Burkina Faso
Executive Board Meeting
December 21, 2011
On behalf of my Burkinabè authorities, I thank staff for their constructive engagement
and the valuable policy advice provided during the ECF program review and 2011 Article
IV discussions held in Ouagadougou in October 2011, as well as through technical
assistance.
In spite of a difficult social and regional environment in the first half of the year, the
authorities stayed the course in implementing the economic and financial program
supported by the Fund under the Extended Credit Facility. All quantitative performance
criteria and all indicative targets except the one on poverty reduction spending were met.
Most structural reforms benchmarks were also achieved. Substantial progress has been
made towards meeting the few unmet benchmarks.
The implementation of sound policies helped the authorities mitigate the impact of the
severe exogenous shocks, including increased commodities and fuel prices, disruptions in
the supply of electricity and trade, reflecting a sub-regional crisis, and social disquiet.
They also made inroads in poverty reduction and growth promotion, while ensuring
macroeconomic stability. Notwithstanding the progress achieved, the authorities are
cognizant of the difficult challenges ahead, particularly in achieving the millennium
development goals, accelerating growth, and diversifying the economy in line with their
poverty reduction strategy (SCADD).
They are committed to continue the reform program, in close consultation with their
development partners, and with the IMF.
I. Recent Economic Development
In spite of the difficult environment, the real sector registered a strong performance
driven mostly by the mining and cotton sectors. Real GDP growth is projected to reach
5.6 percent in 2011, and inflation at 1.4 percent, significantly below the 3 percent regional
convergence criterion. The current account position strengthened on account of improved
terms of trade and aid inflows.
The authorities maintained a prudent fiscal policy stance, thus creating the fiscal space
needed to mitigate the impact of the shocks and promote growth, while ensuring fiscal
sustainability. The fiscal targets were achieved by improving revenue collections,
strengthening expenditure controls, and through public management reforms.
The revenue enhancing measures undertaken included closer monitoring of large
taxpayers, and an anti-fraud campaign in the customs offices. On spending, the authorities
sought to improve the quality of expenditures and remedy weaknesses in budget
execution, including through the installment of expenditure verification units in line
ministries, the completion of the audit of finance and administrative units, and the
implementation of an integrated monitoring system for external financing.

112
While revenues collected were comfortably higher than projected, expenditure execution
was under-performing, reflecting the social unrest in the first half of the year, and delays
in the procurement process. A mid-year budget execution review made recommendations
to address the identified weaknesses, which the authorities sought to implement. In this
vein, the government deliberated this week on a capacity building strategy for
procurement officers, which aims at increasing the efficiency of public spending by
training procurement personnel in international best-practices.
In order to strengthen further their fiscal framework, the authorities made steadfast
progress towards the adoption of program budgeting framework, and to internalize
regional fiscal directives, which will increase transparency in the budget.
The authorities sough to consolidate debt sustainability by systematically seeking grants
and concessional financing, and taking steps to strengthen debt management capabilities.
They prepared an action plan to address the vulnerabilities identified by the March 2011
World Bank’s Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA), and held training
sessions for the debt unit personnel in the new borrowing and debt management
procedures.
On structural reforms, the authorities made progress in improving the business
environment and in implementing their financial sector development strategy. Amongst
others, they overhauled the supervisory framework for the insurance industry, and
undertook steps towards the finalization of a microfinance strategy.
Regarding the cotton sector, they sought to strengthen the management of the main cotton
ginning company SOFITEX, and implemented the main recommendations of the report
on the cotton price-smoothing fund.
II. Economic Policies for 2012
Looking forward, the authorities will focus their efforts on addressing the pressing needs
of the populations, and in implementing their SCADD strategy to accelerate growth and
reduce poverty. To implement their ambitious reform agenda, they will seek to mobilize
additional resources both internally and externally, with a scaling up of donors’ support.
Fiscal policy
As reflected in the 2012 budget recently adopted by parliament, the authorities will
intensify their efforts to mobilize revenues, and increase spending allocated to priority
sectors, while ensuring of fiscal sustainability. They plan to increase revenue collections
to 16.2 percent of GDP during the fiscal year 2012, notably by pursing reforms in the
customs and revenues administrations units, and implementing the new taxation regime.
As regards spending, the authorities’ reforms will seek to improve expenditure controls,
and spending efficiency. They plan to increase spending in priority sectors, particularly
on growth enhancing capital expenditure, while reducing current expenditure. Efforts to
remedy the identified weaknesses in the execution of the budget will also be pursued.
The authorities will also continue the efforts to reduce poverty, through a strengthening of
the social safety net, and initiate a youth and women’s employment program. In line with

113
the agreement reached with the labor unions following social unrests earlier this year, the
authorities plan to increase the civil service base salary by 5 percent and regularize
benefits in order to reduce inequities in the compensation system. Mindful of the need to
preserve medium term fiscal sustainability, the authorities will accelerate their civil
service reform agenda, which will help control the wage bill in the medium term.
On debt policies, the authorities are committed to the preservation of debt sustainability.
They welcome the Debt Sustainability Analysis’s results, which noted improvements in
Burkina’s debt outlook. The report also highlighted the prudent borrowing strategy
pursued by the authorities, with external debt representing 20 percent of GDP, and
domestic borrowing 2.6 percent of GDP. Nonetheless, the authorities plan to continue to
strengthen their debt management capabilities, in line with the World Bank’s DeMPA’s
recommendations. They will also pursue efforts to diversify the countries’ exports.
Financial sector reforms
In the financial sector, the authorities plan to intensify reforms in line with their financial
sector development strategy. In this vein, they will strengthen the regulation of the
microfinance sector, with the view to improving SME, and household’s access to
financial services. They will also promote competition in the financial sector, including
by reducing the state’s share in the banking sector.
Structural Reforms
The authorities’ structural reforms agenda will be two-pronged, seeking to broaden the
sources of growth, and to build up human capital. To broaden the sources of growth and
diversify the economy, the authorities will continue their efforts to eliminate
infrastructure bottlenecks. They will also launch a pilot regional growth cluster project.
My Burkinabè authorities will seek to promote a private sector-led growth, by continuing
to take measures to improve the climate for business, and administrative efficiency. To
that purpose, a legal framework to develop public-private partnerships will be put in
place, as well as an agency for the promotion of investments.
In the cotton sector, the authorities will move forward in the implementation of the
sector’s strategy. In light of the increasing share of natural resources in Burkina Faso’s
growth, the authorities plan to adopt a new mining code, and regulation in keeping with
international standards, and to remain in compliance with the EITI Rules.
III. Conclusion
In light of the authorities continued track record of strong program implementation, and
