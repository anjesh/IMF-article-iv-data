Executive Summary
After two decades of decline, post 2000 reforms have turned Serbia around. But the
difficult legacies of earlier policies remain, reflected in poor employment, inflation, and
external performance—and associated considerable vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, capital
inflows have been and remain strong, overwhelming a strong—notably fiscal—policy
response. Thus, the current account deficit, over 10 percent of GDP, has barely budged in
four years despite fiscal consolidation of 5½ percentage points of GDP, multiple macroprudential measures, and fx-intervention to contain appreciation. Large external deficits have
also unsettled the focus of monetary and exchange rate policies—which has alternated
between disinflation and external objectives.
Failed corporate structures lie at the heart of Serbia’s economic difficulties. Weak
governance—most notably in socially owned and state-owned enterprises—are reflected in
sizeable corporate losses of the non-financial sector. By draining domestic savings, they are
at the core of Serbia’s external deficits while also curbing investment and employment
growth.
But the authorities emphasized instead the need for public investment and labor tax
cuts. Seeing imbalances as normal transition strains rather than binding constraints on
performance, they plan an immediate sizeable fiscal relaxation—with key details still being
prepared—along with labor tax cuts. Corporate reforms beyond those already in process and
early reductions in inflation and the current account deficit are further down the priority list.
This complicates welcome steps recently taken by the central bank to increase exchange
rate flexibility. Prior arrangements had struck an unsatisfactory balance between internal
and external goals, ultimately securing neither. And given high pass-through rates and
effective repo operations, monetary policy can be effective against inflation through the
exchange rate, despite extensive financial euroization. But a major weakening of fiscal policy
could call external sustainability and pursuit of ambitious disinflation into question.
In this context, staff suggested: (i) renewed efforts on privatization and bankruptcies, to
invigorate corporate activity; (ii) initiatives to strengthen banking supervision and reduce
excess returns in banking to help curb credit excesses; (iii) pending reflection of
reinvigorated corporate reforms in the external balance, continued fiscal restraint; and (iv) in
this context, purposeful disinflation and elaboration of recent exchange regime reforms
anticipating eventual fully fledged inflation targeting. But if fiscal support is not
forthcoming, then immediate disinflation ambitions may be beyond reach.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Serbia is growing. After two
decades of stagnation and decline at
the end of the last century, output is up
40 percent from 2000. Furthermore,
some 60 percent of non-budget nonagricultural employment is now in the
private sector, almost double the share
five years ago (Text Table 1). A tough
and extensive reform agenda—
including stabilization after 2000,
banking sector restructuring,
introduction of VAT in 2005, and
privatization of hundreds of firms—
has reversed a long decline.

The legacy of two decades of decline is not readily reversed, however. Since 2000,
official data report consistent declines in employment, unemployment is close to 21 percent
and still rising, headline inflation has only briefly dipped below the mid-teens, and almost
half the CPI remains subject to official controls. And fixed investment remains below
20 percent of GDP, well under transition country norms (Text Figure 1, Text Table 2). But
even so, the external current account deficit has remained in double digits, keeping external
debt above 60 percent of GDP despite Paris and London club debt write downs. And
widespread financial euroization—the euro denomination or indexation of over ¾ of bank
credit and almost all household deposits—is symptomatic of persistent skepticism about
inflationary and broader economic prospects, giving rise to large corporate and household
forex exposures (Figures 1–3, Tables 1–4).

Corporate reforms are the key challenge remaining from the pre-2000 period.
Weak governance—including social ownership, under which the workers manage and retain
all profits from firms, but the state has sole rights to sell the firms—is reflected in corporate
losses reportedly exceeding profits by 2 percent of GDP in 2005 for the non-financial sectors
of the economy (Table 5, Text Table 3). Though this represents an improvement from 2004,

the state, socially owned, and mixed enterprises continue to report dire results, and even
private sector loss-makers show a sizeable deterioration in 2005. These losses, which partly
reflect the extensive remaining official controls on output prices, are largely financed by
depreciation and debt service and wage arrears—some 10–15 percent of accrued non-budget
wages are unpaid in a typical month. By draining domestic savings, they are at the core of
Serbia’s external deficits, while also curbing investment and jobs. And they cast a shadow
over competitiveness (Box 1).
4.
But capital inflows have been strong, these difficulties notwithstanding. They
reflected a mix of privatization receipts, external borrowing by private corporates,
reintermediation—including of mattress cash—following the entry of foreign banks, and
parent bank funding for subsidiaries to take advantage of high banking spreads. In this
context, though intermediation remains low by regional standards, bank credit has risen over
12 percentage points of GDP in three years (Figure 2). This boom compounded the pressures
on the external current account emanating from corporate weaknesses and low household
savings rates.

relative to GDP and their
growth reflects activity in just a few sectors and the rebound from the 1999 crisis, with competitiveness problems
preventing much broader realization of potential. With enterprises reporting heavy aggregate losses, competitiveness
is in doubt. Furthermore, total labor costs (including employers’ contributions) are as much as 10 percent higher than
regional productivity-adjusted norms (Text Figures). And those norms are themselves doubtful—with high persistent
unemployment and external deficits alongside lackluster investment ratios possibly suggestive of region-wide
competitiveness difficulties.

The inflows overwhelmed a strong—notably fiscal—response. Given domestic
supply rigidities, demand quickly spilled into imports, with, more recently, international oil
prices compounding these effects (Text Table 4). Thus, the VAT-adjusted current account1
has barely budged in four years despite strong exports, fiscal consolidation of 5½ percentage
points of GDP, a string of macro-prudential monetary measures, and heavy central bank
intervention taking import cover to about 6½ months (Box 2). Though the latter allowed
early repurchase of outstanding Fund resources—a quarter completed in June 2006 with a
further quarter penciled in for the fall—external objectives remained compromised
(Tables 6–13).

This unsettled the focus of monetary and exchange rate policy. Despite fiscal
support and rapid exchange rate pass through—up to 0.9 within a year for core inflation—
efforts to secure disinflation via the exchange rate anchor after 2001 typically ran into
external current account and debt concerns.2 Thus, the announced fixed band to the euro
which anchored the 2001–02 stabilization shifted into a regime accommodating steady
depreciation with minimal volatility—albeit interrupted by political uncertainties during
2003—with the rate of depreciation sometimes leading and at other times lagging inflation
outturns. Subsequently around February 2006, faced with increasing sterilization costs, the
NBS announced and accommodated greater volatility in the exchange rate, in which context
the dinar appreciated (Text Figure 2).

anticipation of VAT introduction in January 2005. Other macro variables are similarly corrected.

The authorities aimed for external consolidation in 2006. To this end, in the sixth
review of the EA, they anticipated significant fiscal consolidation to a surplus, on IMF
definitions, of 2¾ percent of GDP, to be secured by employment rationalization and reduced
subsidies, allowing for a modest increase in public investment (Text Table 5). Given
continued credit growth, this was projected to support a reduction in the VAT-adjusted
current account deficit of about 2 percentage points of GDP, and help lower headline
inflation to 9–11 percent by end-2006. Additional support would be provided by increased
reserve requirements and modest regulated price rises (Box 2).

call to reconsider the exchange rate regime was heeded with the regime shift initiated
in Q1 2006 anticipating more exchange rate flexibility.
Banking regulation was strengthened. The new banking law brought legislation in
line with Basel Core Principles, but effective implementation remains an issue. Five
state-controlled banks were sold since end-2004 and two further sales are expected by
end-2006.
Structural reforms have lagged. Privatization of socially owned enterprises has
advanced, but the most difficult cases—including utilities—remain. While the 2004
bankruptcy law provides a sound legal basis, it remains little used, including by
official creditors.

Demand growth has remained strong so far this year. Though interrupted gas
imports followed by flooding dented activity in the early part of the year, exports, credit
growth, and imports remained buoyant—the latter reflected in external debt rising to
61½ percent of GDP in May (Text Table 6). Headline inflation was boosted by energy—due
to international price developments—and other administered price hikes to over 16 percent,
while core inflation, at around 10 percent, has slowed modestly, partly in response to the
strength of the dinar relative to its earlier trend since February. Meanwhile, activity was
reflected in strong non-tax and income tax collections, which kept the general government
fiscal balance broadly on track with PPM objectives in H1, despite some weaknesses in VAT
and overruns in central government and pension fund expenditure. Spreads on Serbia
widened since the spring, somewhat more than was the case for other emerging markets.

Political pressures are high. Although Montenegro’s independence passed without
incident, challenging economic reforms, cooperation with the Hague tribunal, and the
Kosovo status talks are on the immediate agenda. The opposition parties and—according to
opinion polls—much of the general public strongly oppose all three. With the multi-party
coalition itself divided on these matters and already lacking a parliamentary majority, it may
have difficulty serving out its term to elections due in the fall of 2007.

II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
10.
Since 2000, economic growth has been high but unbalanced. Growth rates
averaging 5½ percent have been accompanied by low investment, employment, and exports
relative to activity, while inflation, financial euroization, credit and external deficits and debt
have been high. Staff noted that these immediate vulnerabilities, and the associated shifting
focus for monetary and exchange rate policy, call into question prospects for maintaining
stability and sustaining growth.
11.
The authorities were nevertheless confident of prospects. In their view, past
reforms would continue to support exports and yield sustained job-rich growth rising to
7 percent. And though mindful of the imbalances, the authorities saw these as reflecting the
pre-2000 legacy and normal transition strains, rather than as binding constraints on growth.
Of greater concern were infrastructural bottlenecks—reflecting inadequate public investment
over the past 20 years—and the burden of taxation on labor. Thus, the authorities saw need
and scope—given large one-off privatization and other receipts—for immediate relaxation of
the fiscal stance to allow public investment and labor tax cuts. These initiatives took
precedence in their policy agenda over corporate reforms beyond those already planned and
early reductions in core inflation and the external current account deficit.
12.
In this light—and to focus the consultation—discussions concentrated on
sustainability and sequencing. In particular, four inter-related issues were central:
•

Have corporate, labor, and trade reforms gone far enough?

•

How should capital inflows and associated financial sector vulnerabilities be managed?

•

What should anchor fiscal policy?

•

How can the competing objectives for monetary and exchange rate policy be reconciled?
A. Corporate, Labor, and Trade Policies

13.
The authorities regard privatization as well on the way to completion. With over
30 tenders outstanding, a record in Serbia, and multiple auctions underway, all remaining
socially owned enterprises will be offered for sale by mid-2007. Alongside, state holdings in
“mixed”—part state, part private—firms will be sold, including on the stock exchange. And
on corporate restructuring more broadly, the adoption of a strong bankruptcy law in 2004—
which emphasizes creditor rights and procedural deadlines—has laid the basis for effective
bankruptcy procedures. Staff agreed that progress in these areas has been reflected in strong
growth.

13
14.
But the critical cases have been left till last. Staff noted that relatively healthy firms
were offered for sale first, implying that past ownership restructuring was to some extent of
form rather than of substance. Thus, large state-owned enterprises remain, despite some
restructuring, with—apart from oil—no firm plans for sales at this stage. Further, the
authorities agreed that notwithstanding data quality issues highlighted in the draft accounting
and auditing ROSC, remaining state- and socially owned firms continue to make heavy
losses—reflected in the external current account deficit. With the business environment
continuing to discourage investors, staff observed that increased incidence of failed tenders
was likely (Text Table 7). In this context, the deep reluctance to initiate bankruptcies—
reflected in the low number of bankruptcy cases initiated by official creditors—would
become a key impediment to further corporate restructuring, a view endorsed by the IBRD.
And if so, associated aspirations to raise investment and employment, liberalize a greater
share of consumer prices, and secure external sustainability would be compromised.3

This poses difficult dilemmas. The authorities emphasized, on the one hand, that if
failed tenders lead to bankruptcies, then the consequent further loss of jobs would exacerbate
unemployment—which is already high and rising. On the other hand, they accepted that if
many firms continue as is, despite the fundamental inefficiencies revealed by tender failures,
the associated macroeconomic imbalances would persist. Consequently, plans focus on
reinforcing sale attempts. Write-offs of debts to the budget, utilities, and social security funds
will be offered contingent on successful sales. And healthy parts of firms will be “spun off”
for sale free of debts to domestic official creditors. In addition, a “two strike” approach—
whereby a firm is automatically put into bankruptcy after two failed tenders—has been

transition area context.

14
considered. But it has not been adopted in light of concerns with employment and
administrative delays in the courts. It is therefore unclear what the fate of such firms will be.
16.
The oil sector illustrates the trade offs. A longstanding ban on imports of processed
fuels has been reflected in refinery and distribution inefficiencies. This compounded the
burden on the economy of high international oil prices—which by virtue of the
administrative formula controlling domestic fuel prices are regularly passed on to consumers
to preserve high refinery margins. But to shield refining jobs and boost prospective proceeds
from oil privatization, the import ban had recently been extended to 2010. And sale of a
minority stake—with management control—in the refineries, integrated with their
distribution network, was anticipated for the fall. In light of concerns, echoed by staff, that
creation of a private monopoly would compromise efficiency gains from privatization, the
authorities recently announced conversion of the import ban into a declining tariff schedule
to 2012, consistent with EU and WTO principles. But, against staff suggestions, further steps
in this direction—to sell the refineries separately from their distribution network, to sell
majority stakes in both, to shorten the tariff horizon, all of which would lower refinery
margins and remove need to administer fuel prices—have been ruled out by the authorities:
the first, because it compromises privatization prospects unduly; the second, because it
boosts them too much; and the third, because competitive pressures would be too strong for
the domestic refineries.
17.
Labor institutions may complicate the challenges. The 2005 Labor Law raised
severance payments, non-wage benefits, experience pay, added further steps to lay-off
procedures, and set a 12-month non-renewable limit on fixed-term appointments. The
authorities considered that these steps had reflected EU guidelines, and that inefficient
corporate structures and excess labor taxation rather than labor institutions explained
disappointing employment performance. Nevertheless, in view of the latter, redeployment
services are being strengthened, including to secure better skill matches. Staff welcomed the
latter steps and the implicit recognition of need for further corporate restructuring. But in that
light, and given considerable inherited wage setting rigidities, they suggested that the
flexibility of labor market institutions warranted further review.4
18.
Oil and agriculture aside, the trade regime is broadly appropriate. The top tariff
and weighted average rates are 30 and 7 percent respectively, tariff structures are relatively
stable, and quotas are absent—so that world and domestic relative prices for tradable goods
are largely aligned. But 22 lines (including metals) are subject to export duties, licenses are
applied on sensitive products, refined oil imports have until now been banned, and
agriculture is significantly protected. Access to the EU and to regional neighbors is on a
preferential basis. Staff welcomed intentions to phase out export duties and encouraged

further liberalization including in the context of negotiations for a new trading relationship
with Montenegro, a Western Balkan Free Trade Agreement, and steps to WTO
membership—anticipated for 2007.
B. Capital Flows and the Financial Sector
19.
Despite political and reform uncertainties, capital inflows have been strong. The
capital account surplus averaged 15 percentage points of GDP between 2002–05. Greenfield
FDI and portfolio flows have been negligible, however, the former primarily reflecting

20.
The outlook was more qualified, however. In the near future, Kosovo and electoral
issues risk inducing a significant loss of confidence and a reversal of capital inflows. But
even if this was avoided, the flow of high net worth privatization assets was slowing, with
the large telecom license receipt due in 2006 also non-recurring. And absent a further reform
effort, greenfield FDI would continue to disappoint. Furthermore, Serbia had been affected,
even somewhat disproportionately, by international capital market reassessments of
emerging market risk since the spring, and the authorities agreed that the trend in private
external debt—up 6 percentage points of GDP since 2002—would, if continued, dampen
creditor appetite for Serbia risk at some point, possibly even suddenly. If so, the shock could
be sharp given forex exposures and the large gross financing requirements.
21.
And there may be need to slow banking inflows in light of consumer protection
and macro concerns. In this regard, the authorities emphasized that despite the recent
establishment of a credit bureau, pledge registry, and legislation enhancing creditor rights
over collateral, effective arbitrage by borrowers between banks remains blunted. In
particular, the complexity of fee structures and foreign currency clauses in loans—and the
consequent obscurity to all but the most sophisticated borrowers of the associated forex
exposures—impeded effective side-by-side comparisons of loan offers by banks. Reducing
these transactions costs and related information asymmetries between banks and borrowers
via strengthened consumer protection would better discipline borrowing decisions. This, in

16
turn, would slow credit and support the external balance. Staff agreed, adding that interbank
competition would be further stimulated if banking licenses were again to be made available
to greenfield banking investors (subject to appropriate “fit and proper” requirements) and
that were banks to overcome their reluctance to press claims on past due debts in the courts,
borrowing decisions would be disciplined further.
22.
Prudential indicators underscore the case for caution. Staff noted the high share
of non-performing loans in total lending, and that they were rising steeply among the foreign
banks that had spearheaded the credit boom in recent years (Text Table 9).

requirements amounting to 25 percent, 50 percent, and 100 percent, respectively.

Though some of this increase reflected a strengthening of classification procedures, the
authorities recognized that credit risks were rising, while also underscoring that the
prudential framework had been strengthened by adoption of the 2005 banking law (Box 3).
Staff welcomed the latter and the authorities’ intention to introduce risk-weights for
unhedged borrowing from end-September. But in view of the associated increased
implementation challenges, efforts to ensure a high quality cadre of supervisors would need
to continue, including via a review of their conditions of employment. However, banks
queried prudential and macro concerns with credit growth. They suggested instead that
competition along with increased reserve requirements and their non-remuneration has
excessively squeezed margins, notwithstanding generous reported returns on equity in
private banks to end-2005 and continued rapid credit growth in 2006 (Text Table 10).

Box 3: Status of Implementation of FSAP Recommendations5
With 80 percent of all loans either forex-denominated or indexed, the main concerns highlighted
in the FSSA were indirect credit risk and shortfalls relative to Basel Core Principles (BCPs)
(IMF Country Report No. 06/96).
The banking law in November 2005 aligned key regulatory matters with the BCPs, including by
introducing consolidated banking supervision and rendering banks’ boards responsible for applying
integrated risk management systems. One key state-owned bank is about to be sold, and the EBRD
recently acquired a controlling minority stake in the other.
Implementation and the transition to risk-based supervision remains ahead, however:
•

Regulations on indirect credit risk require borrowers forex exposure to be reflected in loan
classification, but compliance often appears to be pro forma;

•

Regulators cannot adequately monitor forex hedging by borrowers;

•

A NBS decision in respect of consolidated supervision remains outstanding;

•

The shift from compliance- to risk-based supervision requires establishment of clear guidance
for supervisors about how to measure adherence; and

•

Despite progress, regulatory forbearance remains an issue.

C. Fiscal Policy
23.
The authorities regarded a balanced budget as appropriate for Serbia. In
particular, notwithstanding external imbalances and other uncertainties, the “common sense”
in this goal would underpin public confidence in budgets—and hence the broader macro
framework. In this light, they felt that the surpluses originally anticipated in the 2006 budget
(2¾ percent of GDP) and projected for 2007 and beyond in the Extended Arrangement
unduly constrained fiscal options and were “unrealistic.” Thus, proposing to account one-off
mobile phone license receipts of 1.6 percent of GDP in 2006 as revenue, they saw scope to
raise spending compared to the adopted 2006 budget by 2½ percentage points of GDP (Text
Table 11). They emphasized that given its funding by license receipts, this additional fiscal
activity in 2006 would not be debt creating and that, on their definitions, the budget outturn
would still be in significant surplus. On staff fiscal definitions for general government (which
place the license receipts below the line), the proposals implied a fiscal deficit for 2006 of
½ of one percent of GDP, weaker by some 3 percentage points of GDP than anticipated, and
representing a relaxation of 1½ percentage points of GDP from 2005.

24.
This would pave the way for additional public investment and labor tax cuts. A
five year public investment envelope, summing to at least 4½ percent of 2006 GDP, had been
announced, to commence disbursements in the latter part of 2006, and the general public had
been invited to suggest projects to absorb the resources. Amongst a great many proposals,
priority would be given to a ring-road for Belgrade, computers for schools, and hospital
construction. In addition, and outside this investment envelope and budget parameters, a
highway connected to the pan-European network—Corridor 10 which the authorities hoped
would be associated with a further Paris Club debt write-down—would be built, with various
private-public partnerships (PPP) on other infrastructural projects also envisaged. And with
the labor tax-and-contribution wedge at over 40 percent of gross remuneration, the personal
income tax rate would be lowered from January 2007 from 14 to 12 percent and a basic
exemption introduced—implying a permanent revenue loss of at least 1½ percentage points
of GDP. Alongside, relief from personal income tax and employer social security payments
will be provided for up to three years for recently unemployed recruits (the disabled, and
those below 30 and above 45 years old).
25.
Staff urged caution. The aversion to raising the tax burden in general, and the aim to
shift towards indirect taxation, were both appropriate given overall tax ratios approaching
45 percent of GDP, the labor tax wedge, and the adverse tax compliance environment. But
concerns remained, including with fiscal sustainability, even with the earlier envisaged path
for the fiscal balance (Appendix II). Although those fiscal surpluses implied continued
declines in public debt ratios, the authorities’ fiscal accounting practices overlooked quasifiscal losses in the corporate sector, overstating the strength of fiscal balances considerably.
Furthermore, enumeration of the potentially large fiscal costs arising from the decision to fill
gaps in pension contribution histories since the early 1990s—caused by employer nonpayment—remained outstanding. Determination of the use of one-off privatization and
license receipts would be premature ahead of that information. And new spending of a

19
recurring nature—such as wages, where increases in one period also impact subsequent
periods—would complicate fiscal options once the anticipated one-off receipts funding it are
exhausted. But even aside from all these concerns, given ample scope for efficiencies in
public spending—notably in transfers, the public wage bill, and enterprise subsidies,
accounting for 17, 11, and 3 percent of GDP respectively—there appeared little need to fund
public investment by weakening budget balances in the manner envisaged.
26.
Furthermore, external vulnerabilities could be aggravated. Troubling external
debt prospects, notably in the face of shocks, could be compounded by the envisaged fiscal
relaxation (Appendix III). First, only part of the envisaged investment projects would be nondebt financed, with other parts funded by official creditors and, indirectly, via the PPP
arrangements. Second, given the focus of the new spending on the non-traded sector
(construction), its envisaged front-loading could drive up non-traded prices—thereby
compromising competitiveness and therefore external debt objectives—and reduce project
real returns. And, more immediately, a significant reversal of the direction of fiscal policy
could, given weakening sentiment towards emerging markets and Kosovo challenges ahead,
undermine confidence markedly. While acknowledging fatigue with persistent fiscal
frugality and the evident need for public investment, staff emphasized that the underlying
constraint lay in untapped current spending efficiencies and the broader challenge of low
domestic savings—the fruit of weak corporate structures and the patterns of capital inflows.
Until these matters were resolved, options for public investment and the fiscal balance would
remain constrained by need to boost domestic savings. And only once they were addressed
would it be prudent to re-anchor fiscal policy to fiscal rather than external sustainability
concerns—thereby accommodating a fiscal relaxation. In view of these fiscal and external
risks, staff suggested that the originally agreed PPM fiscal surplus of 2¾ percent of GDP
remained the best balance between the various concerns. The authorities were not persuaded
to change their plans.
D. The Monetary and Exchange Rate Framework
27.
The central bank has moved towards greater exchange rate flexibility. Finding,
in the face of strong capital inflows, that their attempt to tighten monetary conditions from
late 2005 with a 500bp increase in repo rates was exacting excessive sterilization costs, the
monetary authorities opted in early 2006 to shift towards greater flexibility, anticipating an
eventual float. This action also recognized, more fundamentally, that earlier exchange rate
arrangements had struck an unsatisfactory balance between internal and external goals,
ultimately securing neither. This left skepticism about inflationary prospects and the
associated preference for financial euroization—the legacy of two bouts of hyperinflation in
recent memory—unaddressed. The appreciation of the dinar, subsequent to the policy
change, signaled a positive market response with, even by June, the first dividends evident in
some moderation in monthly core and PPI inflation.

20
28.
This shift, on balance, has merit. Certainly, fixity would seem warranted given high
rates of euroization, exchange rate pass-through, trade openness, trade focus on the euro area,
and the prevalence of monetary over real shocks. But the high share of primary commodities
in exports, the volume of capital flows, fiscal rigidities, and prospects—including continued
strong credit growth, corporate restructuring, and shocks from a troubled neighborhood—all
point the other way.6 And though either kind of regime can in principle operate effectively
with appropriately supportive policies, a float is less costly when policy support is
inadequate—particularly if financial regulators and borrowers manage forex exposures with
appropriate diligence. The fiscal authorities had been inclined to endorse a shift towards
flexibility only once the corporate reform agenda had been completed by end 2007. But they
were persuaded that with political uncertainties high in the immediate future and—given
unfettered financial euroization—the capital accounts de facto open, the early shift had
appropriately diminished risk of an attack on the dinar.
29.
Repo operations provide the necessary instrument. The impact of the hike in repo
rates on the dinar from Q4 2005—albeit boosted in March when bank equity was declared
ineligible to meet bank forex exposure regulations, and offset by continued official forex
intervention—herald the potency of this tool. Accordingly, staff welcomed measures
supportive of the repo already underway. These include scaling back forex intervention
further—by progressively reducing the preferential rates offered by the NBS to the foreign
exchange bureaus, anticipating transition to a “leaning against the wind” role for
intervention—and encouraging competition between banks so as to strengthen further the
role of the repo in influencing dinar banking interest rates.7 With the repo thus shifting to
center stage in dinar markets, reserve requirements on forex liabilities would continue to play
a supportive role to contain overall—including euro indexed and denominated—credit
developments and the external balance, supporting fiscal efforts to these ends.
30.
A new nominal anchor was needed—anticipating eventual inflation targeting.
The high share of administered in overall consumer prices and some uncertainties about
inflation determinants counseled against premature adoption of formal “targets” for inflation.
This would risk target misses due to developments outside NBS control, putting its
credibility—and that of the new framework—in jeopardy. Instead, staff suggested that the
NBS could adopt “objectives” defined on core inflation, expressed as a range, initially for
2006–07, but with the projection horizon extended every six months or so. Alongside, the
Ministry of Finance could issue projections for administered prices, coordinated with the
6

This draws on Selected Issues Chapter V, which provides a fuller assessment of the implications of the
structure of the Serbian economy for the choice of the exchange rate regime.

21
NBS. With efforts underway to strengthen research capacity, the inflation range could be
redefined into formal “targets,” once experience is gained with the new framework. Other
elements of a full-fledged inflation targeting framework—formal forecasting models,
transparency, decision making procedures within the central bank, final determination of
institutional responsibility to set the inflation target, and better data—could be developed
over time. And as prices are increasingly liberalized in the process of corporate restructuring,
the NBS would progressively become responsible for a greater share of overall inflation
developments.8 The authorities welcomed these suggestions.
31.
The ambition for early disinflation should, however, be carefully weighed. Staff
underscored that inflation in Serbia, which is regionally high, hinders efforts to raise
investment and employment because it is a prominent signal of macroeconomic disorder.
Thus, it is a significant concern. Furthermore, worries that disinflation achieved through
appreciation could compromise competitiveness are attenuated by the high pass-through rates
to core inflation. But staff acknowledged that even those modest and temporary
competitiveness losses might be inappropriate if fiscal policies are unduly expansionary—
given the combined effects of both policies on external deficits. In this light, the NBS would
best carefully weigh fiscal prospects when determining its ambitions for the pace of
disinflation. Subject to that qualification, and with core inflation running at monthly
annualized rates of 7–9 percent, staff suggested that the NBS could announce an inflation
“objective” range of 7–10 percent for 2006, declining to 4–7 percent for 2007. And staff
emphasized that administered price increases should not be delayed by concerns with
headline inflation targets lest the consequent additional corporate losses aggravate external
imbalances further.
E. Outlook for 2006–07
32.
A current account deterioration is likely in 2006–07 if the authorities proceed
with their current fiscal plans. While they have yet to determine the pace at which the
multiyear investment program will be implemented, significant spending is anticipated in Q4
2006 and is likely to impact the current account deficit rapidly—raising it towards 14 percent
of GDP depending on the pace of budget disbursements. With the authorities’ plans yet to be
determined, Text Table 12 presents an illustrative scenario reflecting the general flavor of
their intentions, including the prospective PIT reforms. In the main, even assuming no loss of
confidence from the envisaged fiscal relaxation, staff estimates the direct beneficial impact
on growth to be small, given offsets from the expected real appreciation. The planned PPP
projects for 2007, not reflected in the illustrative scenario, would take the budget—and hence
the current account—further into deficit unless all these fiscal initiatives are offset by
reductions in other expenditure.

This implies that PPM objectives for 2006 would be missed. Policies envisaged at
the time of the final review of the EA have been observed so far, and the associated
macroeconomic objectives met (¶7, Text Table 5). Rationalization in the army and health
sectors is proceeding as scheduled, and subsidies have been reduced as expected. But the
investment program and other adjustments, which are planned to be incorporated in the
supplementary budget in the fall, will set budget parameters adrift from earlier objectives.
34.
In addition, the costs of disinflation could be raised. Notwithstanding non-debt
financing and the recent strength of the dinar, to the extent that the fiscal initiatives
permanently raise budget spending or non-tradeable prices, they further weaken mediumterm external sustainability. This could put goals for core inflation, such as those in Text
Table 12, beyond reach. In this light, the determination of specific core inflation goals for the
next 18 months should be made in light of a detailed assessment of the fiscal authorities’
plans for 2006-07.
35.
Strong structural and fiscal policies would provide a more secure platform for
medium-term performance. In staff’s view, given past corporate restructuring, some
strengthening in non-government savings is likely in the medium-term, and will be available
to finance some increases in fixed capital formation, with associated rapid export growth.
But given that the most difficult corporate restructuring challenges remain, this scenario
would require maintenance of strong fiscal balances—surpluses of some 3 percent of GDP—
if external deficits are to moderate (Tables 2 & 3). This framework would also support
sustained disinflation. And with the boost to growth from sustained policy stability offsetting
the drag as the post-2000 rebound draws to a close, growth would remain around 5 percent.
But much better still would be a policy scenario based on decisive resolution of the
remaining corporate restructuring challenges. This would set the stage for medium-term
growth to approach the authorities’ aspirations of 7 percent. And by stimulating domestic
savings strongly, it would allow moderation in the external deficit alongside higher private
investment and a less stringent fiscal stance.

23
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
After two decades of decline to 2000, GDP has risen strongly. This reflects the
natural rebound following the 2001 stabilization, and a significant—if sometimes
interrupted—cumulative fiscal and structural reform effort. Much is going well.
37.
But the legacies of earlier policies still weigh heavily—with failed corporate
structures the most troublesome. Just as these structures—compounded by earlier conflict
and policy instability—drained domestic savings and economic vitality for two decades, so,
completion of the post-2000 privatization and other corporate reform programs—and policy
stability—remain essential to boost savings and restore economic health. And while weak
corporate structures remain, competitiveness is in significant doubt.
38.
Difficult measures—notably bankruptcies—need to be taken. Though many tough
tasks have been largely completed, including bank restructuring, the more healthy firms were
privatized first. The substantial remaining socially and state–owned firms incur heavy losses,
absorb considerable subsidies, and accrue wage arrears. There is little option but to put them
up for sale, with bankruptcy a swift consequence if buyers prove elusive. Until the taboo on
bankruptcy is broken, these firms threaten the sustainability of growth. Broader business
climate, labor, and trade arrangements—including for oil—should support restructuring, with
aspirations for employment emphasizing job creation over job preservation.
39.
Capital inflows pose additional challenges. With bank intermediation still
regionally low, persistent further deposit and credit expansion is likely, with attendant risks
to credit quality and the external deficit. Banks’ continued appetite to lend suggests that total
anticipated returns remain attractive, notwithstanding their concerns with unremunerated
reserve requirements. Policy actions already taken to strengthen competitive forces on banks
including establishment of the credit registry could be complemented by recommencing
issuance of licenses to greenfield banks. By securing efficient spreads, such steps may
encourage greater attentiveness by banks to macroeconomic and indirect credit risks.
Alongside, supervision should continue to strengthen, notably via ensuring capacity of
regulators to implement the improved regulatory framework effectively.
40.
External concerns leave little room for fiscal maneuver. External debt is high, its
private component is growing fast, and patterns of financial euroization imply significant
forex exposures. Only once corporate reforms and credit deceleration are reflected in the
current account balance may scope be created to allow the fiscal stance to be re-anchored
from external to fiscal sustainability—thereby accommodating some fiscal relaxation. Until
then, pending corporate and credit reform, sizeable budget surpluses remain a
recommendation of last resort, with external vulnerabilities and immediate political
uncertainties underscoring the limited scope for fiscal risks. In that light, the budget
parameters anticipated under the EA—a surplus of 2½ percent of GDP (on IMF fiscal
definitions)—remain appropriate.

24
41.
This puts the focus on public expenditure reform. Ambitions to raise real public
spending within fiscal balance targets would best be secured by economic growth—and
growth of tax revenues—via corporate and other reforms, not by raising tax ratios. Until
then, there is ample scope to curb current spending, including transfers. These actions would
create room within appropriate fiscal balance targets for long overdue increases in public
investment, including on roads and the social infrastructure.
42.
Alongside, a renewed assault on inflation would support restructuring. By
signaling strengthened policies, disinflation would encourage investment, thereby supporting
job creation. And given high pass-through rates, the nominal exchange rate cannot play a
sustained role in addressing Serbia’s real effective exchange rate overvaluation and broader
competitiveness difficulties. But if the fiscal stance goes badly awry, progress on disinflation
could be put beyond reach.
43.
Recent changes in monetary arrangements are appropriate. The repo has proven
its effectiveness as a monetary policy instrument and greater exchange rate flexibility has
been announced and realized. If forex intervention is scaled back further, the repo will
become more potent still. Given high pass-through rates, monetary policy can be effective in
combating inflation via its effect on the exchange rate, notwithstanding persistent financial
euroization.
44.
These steps would best be taken further—towards inflation targeting. The central
bank could publicly adopt “objectives” for core inflation in the form of a range, extending
this projection horizon every six months or so, with the Ministry of Finance engaging in
similar exercises with respect to administered prices. Once experience is gained and research
capacity built, the inflation range “objectives” could be reformulated as formal “targets”
alongside other steps completing the process towards full-fledged inflation targeting. And as
corporate restructuring reduces the share of administered prices in the CPI, the central bank
will progressively become responsible for a greater share of CPI developments. And in
support of these initiatives, fiscal and data transparency are priority areas for standards
assessments. Though these exchange and monetary regime initiatives by themselves are no
panacea, they will facilitate economic management.
45.
However, the envisaged fiscal relaxation calls much of this into question. A fiscal
balance outturn for 2006 as much as 3 percentage points adrift of recommendations is in
prospect. And if the personal tax reforms and investment projects proceed in 2007 without
offsetting spending cuts, then further fiscal slippage will occur. Though the proposed
additional investment spending is only partly debt financed, it will, if implemented fully,
significantly impact the current account deficit. Its unintended side effects will include loss
of competitiveness via the impact on non-tradable prices, waste, delays to disinflation and
the associated job creating effects, and risks to general investor confidence—the latter a
particular concern given balance sheet fragilities. And PPM undertakings—on track so far—

25
would not be observed. Instead, critical public investment should proceed, carefully phased,
funded in large part by efficiencies in public spending.
46.
After two decades of disappointment, Serbia has made significant progress in
recent years. The triple challenge ahead—on the economy, on cooperation with the Hague
tribunal, and on Kosovo—would test the mettle of the boldest administration. That said, were
the authorities to baulk now in the face of testing economic challenges and let up on the
fiscal side, much of Serbia’s hard won economic progress would be put in jeopardy.
47.
Should the further early repurchase of outstanding Fund credit, which would reduce
use below 100 percent of quota, go ahead as planned, continuation of PPM for a year—
though not required—would be recommended in view of Serbia’s external vulnerabilities. It
is also recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle

2/ Adjusted for the surge in imports and remittances at end-2004 ahead of the introduction of the VAT in January 2005.
3/ Debt service recorded above the line is after the debt reduction granted by bilateral and commercial creditors, but before the capitalization of moratorium interest (recorded as debt relief).
4/ Official grants and loans above the line are based on secured commitments; amounts expected from new pledges are shown below the line.
5/ Due to a large extent to the incomplete netting out of economic relations with Montenegro.
6/ Negotiations are on-going to clear all remaining external arrears.
7/ Including debt reduction operations from the London Club and Paris Club, and assuming comparable debt relief by other creditors.
8/ Excluding all debt relief concluded or assumed after end-June 2004.

This schedule presents all currently scheduled payments to the IMF, including repayment expectations where
applicable and repayment obligations otherwise. The IMF Executive Board can extend repayment expectations
(within predetermined limits) upon request by the debtor country if its external payments position is not strong
enough to meet the expectations without undue hardship or risk.

VII.

Safeguards Assessments:
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Yugoslavia
(now the National Bank of Serbia) was subject to a safeguards assessment with
respect to the Extended Arrangement approved on May 13, 2002. A safeguards
assessment of the NBY was completed on November 29, 2001. The assessment
concluded that substantial risks may exist in the financial reporting framework,
internal audit mechanism, and system of internal controls as reported in Country
Report No. 02/105. The proposed remedies by the mission are being implemented.

VIII.

Exchange Arrangement:

Serbia accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, on May 13,
2002, and maintains a system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for
current international transactions. The currency of Serbia is the Serbian dinar. On
January 1, 2001, Serbia adopted a managed floating system.
IX.

Last Article IV Consultation:
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on June 29, 2005 (Country Report
No. 05/232).

have contributed significantly to strengthening public debt management (in Montenegro);
identifying the risks associated with PPPs (in Serbia); strengthening AML/CFT efforts (in
Serbia); creating a market-based financial system (in Serbia); and improving statistical data
provision (in Serbia).
The MFD recommendations were key to (i) developing market-based instruments for
monetary operations, (ii) improving public sector debt management, (iii) providing a clear
focus to future work on enhancing banking supervision practices and (iv) outlining
directions for NBS reorganization.

Appendix II: Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
General government debt in Serbia is sustainable under the assumptions of continued
prudent fiscal policies, as proposed by the staff, and robust GDP growth. Its sensitivity to
exchange rate shocks, however, highlights potential vulnerabilities. Sustainability is less
assured if fiscal policy is loosened significantly, if quasi-fiscal losses of state-owned and
socially owned enterprises are taken into account, or if the NPV of unfunded pension
liabilities prove to be large.
1.
Under the baseline scenario, Serbia’s debt-to-GDP ratio would decline steadily from
61 percent of GDP in 2005 to 19 percent of GDP in 2011 (Table 1).10 Sharp reduction in debt
in 2006 reflects significant Paris Club debt relief (USD$ 600 mln.), which lowered debt-toGDP ratio to 49 percent by end-May. Following a sizeable fiscal consolidation in 2004–05,
the baseline assumes further fiscal tightening in 2006, with the overall cash balance
stabilizing at 3 percent of GDP in the medium term. The debt-to-GDP ratio would fall
rapidly due to the high projected primary surpluses and real GDP growth, and the favorable
terms on the current debt stock over the next few years (most of public external debt is on
concessional terms). Real interest rates are assumed to increase over time, however, as
borrowing is contracted at market rates. The scenario assumes no effect from privatization
receipts, to highlight the underlying debt path in the absence of these one-off receipts.
2.
In the stress test using historical averages, however, the debt-to-GDP ratio would
slightly increase in the medium-term due to a smaller historical primary surplus than
assumed under the baseline.11 In the no-policy-change scenario, assuming a constant primary
balance, debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline to 22 percent of GDP. Other tests also
result in a continuous, albeit slower, decline in the debt ratio (Figure 1). However, a one-time
real depreciation of 30 percent results in a significant increase in the debt ratio,
demonstrating the sensitivity of the debt dynamics to the exchange rate, as 87 percent of
public debt is foreign currency-denominated.
3.
To evaluate the implications of quasi-fiscal losses incurred by state-owned and
socially owned enterprises, put by the Solvency Center at significant levels, a modified
10

The debt stock includes gross general government and government-guaranteed debt of the Republic of Serbia,
including debt to non-Paris Club official creditors under negotiation and in non-convertible currencies.

11

Stress tests were conducted using the standardized methodology but with modifications due to data
constraints. Historical data for Serbia are incomplete prior to 2000 and those available thereafter are affected by
debt restructuring operations. Hence, four-year averages (2002–05) were used to replace historical averages for
all variables but the interest rate. The real interest rate was assumed at zero for the stress tests and the 1997—
2001 data for 4 countries in the region (Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania) were used to derive its
standard deviation.

47
scenario takes into account these enterprises’ deficit, estimated for illustrative purposes at
5 percent of GDP annually (Table 2). Under this scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would
decline only slightly (to 45 percent of GDP), and the debt path would be much more sensitive
to shocks. Under most standard stress tests, the debt ratio would increase. The scenario also
serves to illustrate that a significant fiscal loosening would endanger sustainability and make
Serbia more susceptible to public debt distress. This may materialize if the large investment
program proceeds as announced, labor tax cuts are not compensated for, or the fiscal cost of
bridging the social contributions gap—yet unquantified by the authorities—turns out to be
substantial.
4.
As yet unquantified fiscal costs may arise from a September 2005 law bridging gaps
in payment of social contributions from the 1990s. To mitigate the social impact of the
economic crisis of the 1990s and to facilitate restructuring and privatization of public and
socially owned enterprises, the law provides for government-funded bridging of employer
contribution gaps accrued between 1991-2003. Although the benefits for the period of
missing contributions will be paid at the lowest applicable base, the full fiscal impact of this
law remains unclear, and has not yet been quantified by the authorities. An estimated
183,000 employees have a gap in their pensionable service (12 percent of current
contributors), its average length is not known. The authorities are currently processing
applications with a view to providing fiscal estimates for the 2007 budget. Temporary
measures are already in place to allow pensioners with missing years of contributions to
claim partial benefits for those years.

Appendix III: External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Under the assumption of strong policies leading to improving current account balances,
external debt ratios are stabilized in the medium term well below 60 percent of GDP, and set
on a declining path. However, the stress tests qualify this scenario. In particular, external
debt ratios could be worsened by a large depreciation that could, for example, follow a
confidence crisis. But even other less dramatic scenarios would keep debt ratios at higher
levels than under the baseline. This is the first DSA conducted for Serbia only.
Medium-term balance of payments projections
1.
Under the baseline scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio remains relatively flat in the
medium term and then improves over the long run, albeit at a relatively slow pace, averaging
around 60 percent in the next three years and around 55 percent in the next five years
(Table 1). The impact of the last tranche of the Paris Club debt rescheduling agreement
following the completion of the Extended Arrangement in February 2006 is expected to be
offset by greatly increased external borrowing by the private sector. Debt service ratios
increase over the time horizon, reflecting both higher debt service after the end of the grace
period offered by the Paris Club and other bilateral creditors, and, more importantly, the shift
to external borrowing by the private sector away from the public sector, and stabilize at
around 15 percent of GDP and 53 percent of exports. The rise of debt service ratios argues
for the maintenance of adequate official reserves to guard against possible risks, while
keeping on schedule with the country’s external obligations.
2.
The baseline scenario is grounded on the expected implementation of strong policies
by the authorities in the coming years, and assumes that: (i) exports will grow at an annual
average of 19 percent and 21 percent respectively in dollar and euro terms in the first three
years (starting with 2006) and 14 percent in the following four years; (ii) imports will grow
at about 12 percent and 14 respectively in dollar and euro terms in 2006-08 and then around
8 percent in the following four years (Table 2). However, average growth rates for 2006-07
are distorted by the effect of the VAT introduction in January 2005, so that the corrected
average in this period would be slightly lower;12 (ii) FDI related to the privatization process
continues to flow in during 2006 and 2007, but is gradually replaced by other types of FDI,
12

The assumptions on export and import growth rates take into consideration the experience of other transitional
economies and the performance of exports and imports of Serbia since 2000. The rapid growth of imports partly
reflects the large needs for basic investment and consumption goods following the economic isolation of the
country, and is supported by increasing availability of financing. Exports are expected to show sustained growth
in the projection period, reflecting the strong domestic demand of Serbia’s main trading partners, as well as the
impact of the structural reforms, the domestic and substantial foreign investments in recent years, and the
increasing trade integration with the rest of the world.

including “greenfield” investment, equity investment, and reinvestment in existing
companies, building on the success in privatization and improving the business environment;
(iv) commercial borrowing will increase steadily as the business environment improves;
(v) official borrowing will overall decline, particularly in program support being offset by
project support; (vi) there will be no IMF financial support following the recently completed
arrangement; and (vii) gross international reserves will remain at around 8 months of
prospective imports of goods and services in 2006-07, reflecting the impact of the large-scale
sterilization in the first quarter of 2006, and will then gradually decline to around 6 months
as intervention is discontinued.
Stress testing applying the standardized sustainability framework13
3.
With key variables set at their historical averages,14 the external debt ratios would
decline much faster than in the baseline after the first year. This owes to the higher historical
GDP deflator related to dollar depreciation, and the past lower nominal interest rate partly
associated with the delayed start of debt service to the Paris Club creditors.
4.
While the external debt ratios are high but declining under the baseline, the
sensitivity analysis exercises underline the significant vulnerabilities that underlie this
relatively benign scenario. In particular, as shown by the bound test charts (Figure 1), a large
one-time nominal depreciation in 2007, for example triggered by a crisis of confidence in the
government’s economic policy, would bring about a dramatic increase in the debt-to-GDP
ratio. In this scenario, although the debt ratio declines after the initial peak, it remains well
above its current level over the projection period. A shock to the current account, for
example due to insufficient restructuring in the enterprise sector and poor export
performance, would also negatively affect the debt dynamics, though to a lesser degree.
Shocks to interest rates and to real growth rates increase the debt ratio, but it converges back
to the baseline in the medium term. The combination of smaller shocks of all the above
variables would yield higher debt ratios than the baseline mainly due to the current account
shock component.

13

Due to the limited availability of data and the exceptional factors that have affected economic performance,
the standard framework for debt sustainability analysis was adapted. Historical averages for most key variables
are based on the outturns of 2003–05 for Serbia, complemented by 2001–03 data for Serbia and Montenegro
where needed.
14

These variables are real GDP growth, dollar deflator, nominal interest rate, export and import growth rates,
non-interest current account, and non-debt creating inflows.

Appendix IV: IMF-World Bank Relations
Partnership with Serbia’s development strategy
1.
In 2004, the two republics of Serbia and Montenegro highlighted progress in
structural reform and stabilization, and outlined their medium-term development strategies in
their respective Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP). PRSP Progress reports and a
Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) were prepared in 2005 and reviewed by the IMF and
World Bank Executive Boards in February 2006. Support for the governments’ development
strategy from the World Bank and the IMF follow the agreed upon division of
responsibilities between the two institutions.
2.
The Fund takes the lead on macroeconomic policies (fiscal, monetary, and exchange
rate) aimed at facilitating sustainable growth. The Bank has complemented the Fund’s work
through its support to structural reforms. In areas of direct interest to the Fund, the Bank
leads the policy dialogue in: (i) public expenditure management; (ii) macroeconomically
important sectoral reforms (e.g., in the energy sector); (iii) pension, health, and social
assistance reform; (iv) restructuring and privatization of enterprises; and (v) legal reforms
with a bearing on the business environment, including labor markets. The Bank and Fund
have jointly led the policy dialogue in the financial sector, including on the restructuring and
privatization of banks, and in foreign trade.
World Bank group strategy
3.
A Joint World Bank-IFC Country Assistance Strategy for Serbia and Montenegro
covering FY05-07 was endorsed by the Bank’s Board on December 16, 2004. The CAS has
three goals: (i) creating a smaller, more sustainable and more efficient public sector; (ii)
creating a larger, more dynamic private sector; and (iii) reducing poverty levels and
improving social protection and access to public services. As outlined in the FY05-07
Country Assistance Strategy, the Bank’s policy-based lending assistance in Serbia will have
a series of up to four Programmatic Development Policy Lending (DPL) operations, in two
parallel streams: (i) the development of a robust private sector through the Programmatic
Private and Financial DPLs, the first of which was approved in December 2005; and (ii) the
development of a smaller and more efficient public sector through the Programmatic Public
Sector DPLs, the first of which will be sent for Board consideration in the second half of
2006.
4.
The Bank’s program of adjustment lending has been underpinned by analytical
studies. For Serbia, the Bank recently finalized an Economic Memorandum, a Public
Expenditure and Institutional Review, and an FSAP (jointly with the Fund). In addition, an
Accounting and Auditing ROSC, and reports on agriculture, social protection,
decentralization, and on poverty and labor markets are currently under preparation.

57
5.
A program of selective investment lending has been designed to assist the authorities
in tackling critical impediments to effective public sector management and private sector
development, improving social policy, and underpinning reforms initiated under the Banksupported adjustment programs. Investment projects support trade facilitation, education,
enterprise restructuring, energy, health, and transport. As of end-April 2006, 16 IDA credits
totaling $636 million had been approved for Serbia, with adjustment support comprising the
majority.
IFC
6.
As of June 2006, IFC has committed about $318 million in Serbia and Montenegro.
During FY06, IFC committed about $169 million in 5 projects in the financial markets.
Donor supported technical assistance has been an important component of the IFC’s
operations in the country.
7.
In the financial sector, IFC’s support has been focused in catalyzing foreign strategic
investors’ interest and establishing viable financial institutions such as ProCredit Bank and
HVB Serbia. IFC has supported development of microfinance institutions by investing in
Opportunity Bank Montenegro, in ProCredit Serbia and in ProCredit Kosovo. IFC supported the
introduction and expansion of financial services including mortgage financing, consumer finance,
leasing and SME finance. IFC helped the government with leasing regulation and invested in a
leasing company (Raiffeisen leasing). Also, IFC contributed to the cleaning-up, rehabilitation and
privatization of the banking sector through restructuring of IFC’s claims on Serbian and
Montenegrin banks.

8.
In the corporate sector, IFC has provided a loan of US$19.5 million and an equity
investment of US$8.5 million to Tigar Rubber Company, a leading regional producer of high
quality car tires. The financing was accompanied by extensive technical assistance to the
company and its SME suppliers implementing “Supply Chain Management” scheme which
resulted in a high development impact.
9.
Through SEED (now PEPSE) IFC has delivered programs supporting SMEs. In June
2005, IFC started new programs through Private Enterprise Partnership South Europe (PEPSE) with a focus in 4 business lines: SMEs support and linkages, business enabling
environment, access to finance, and infrastructure advisory operations. IFC PEP SE is
supporting three Mediation Centers in Serbia. So far 1515 cases were resolved through
mediation and the amount resolved is EUR 4.6 million.
10.
In infrastructure, through its PEP-SE Infrastructure, IFC is engaged in advising the
city of Belgrade on structuring concessions for the rehabilitation and expansion of solid
waste disposal facilities and for water and waste water services. In addition, IFC is advising
the Government and the JAT Airways in a restructuring plan aimed at the participation of the
private sector at a later stage.

58
11.
While IFC will continue to expand its activities in the real and financial sectors in the
short term, it will look for opportunities to support Serbia with investments in the energy,
telecommunication, and transportation sectors in the long term.
MIGA
12.
As of June 2006, MIGA’s outstanding portfolio in Serbia and Montenegro consisted
of 16 contracts of guarantee with a total gross and net exposure of $393 million and $172
million, respectively. All contracts of guarantee have been issued for project enterprises
incorporated in Serbia. MIGA is also providing technical assistance for capacity building on
investment promotion. It is currently implementing, jointly with the European Agency for
Reconstruction, a follow-on project to strengthen the investment promotion capacity of the
Serbian Investment and Export Promotion Agency (SIEPA).
Joint staff advisory note (JSAN) of the PRSP and progress reports
13.
Bank and Fund staff prepared a joint assessment of the Serbian and Montenegrin
poverty reduction strategies in 2004 and a JSAN on the Serbian and Montenegrin PRSP
Progress Reports in 2005. In both instances, Bank staff took the lead in evaluating the
structural measures to underpin poverty reduction, while Fund staff assessed the
macroeconomic framework underlying the strategies. The latest JSAN commends the
governments for their efforts to address the recommendations made in the first JSA, but notes
that implementation of the poverty reduction strategies has been limited so far, and major
challenges remain.
Bank-Fund collaboration in specific areas
14.
Public expenditure management. Key reforms supported by the Bank included the
adoption of the Law on the Budget System (Organic Budget Law), the first steps toward
introducing a treasury system, and enhanced inspection, auditing and procurement
procedures.
15.
Energy sector reform. As the largest single source of quasi-fiscal pressures, the power
sector became an area of particularly close collaboration between the Bank and the Fund.
While the Bank has taken the lead in developing the policy agenda, the sector’s fiscal impact
also motivated conditionality in successive Fund arrangements. The Bank program has
combined support for policy reforms through its policy-based lending with investment
credits/grants for critical capital needs.
16.
Pension, health and social assistance reform. Chronic arrears on pension payments
and large budgetary transfers to the pension funds in both republics were further evidence
that reforms were required to improve the financial situation and sustainability of the pension
systems. This created a synergy between Bank and Fund programs. The Bank has taken the
lead on pension reforms through both policy-based and investment operations in both

59
republics. Technical assistance has also been provided through grants. The Fund has included
related conditionality in its successive arrangements with SCG and provided supporting
fiscal analysis. The Bank’s policy-based loans have supported reforms of the health care
system to begin restoring financial balance in that sector, as a basis for improving its
functioning and ability to provide basic health care services for all citizens.
17.
Restructuring and privatization of enterprises and banks. Reforms in the enterprise
and financial sector began in late 2000. The Bank and the Fund have worked closely together
to support the needed policy reforms, with the Bank taking the lead on the enterprise sector
and sharing leadership in the banking sector. The Bank program has combined sectoral
policy-based credits with parallel projects to provide technical assistance.
18.
Legal reforms with a bearing on the business environment. The Bank has taken the
lead on business environment and general private sector development. The policy-based
lending program supported enactment of laws on foreign direct investment, an SME agency,
amendments to federal and republican enterprise laws, the preparation of a law on secured
transactions, the enactment of laws on concessions, leasing, bankruptcy, business
registration, and on the Agency for Business Services. In addition, the policy loans
emphasized reforms of the legal framework for the labor market, promoting employment
creation through greater flexibility, and ensuring the financial sustainability and effectiveness
of unemployment benefit programs. This complemented Fund conditionality related to
securities and accounting legislation, and rationalizing employment clauses in social
programs associated with privatization and enterprise restructuring.

APPENDIX V: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
In recent years, Serbia has been successfully upgrading its statistical system with the
assistance of the IMF and other bilateral and multilateral institutions, and although
international standards are not yet fully met, official data for all sectors are sufficiently good
to support key economic analysis and surveillance. In many areas, including monetary and
balance of payments sectors, internationally accepted reporting standards have been
introduced. However, Serbia still makes extensive use of definitions that were developed to
accommodate national characteristics and were not updated during the decade when the
country was isolated from international developments. A page on Serbia in the IMF’s
International Financial Statistics (IFS) is expected to be available sometime later this year.
2.
In response to the authorities’ requests, the Fund provided a series of technical
assistance missions to improve the quality of macroeconomic statistics and support policy
analysis. In 2001–03, STA conducted four missions, two on monetary and financial statistics,
a multisector statistics mission, and a balance of payments mission. In 2004, there were two
missions, on monetary and financial statistics and national accounts. These missions found
that there was a critical need to improve existing statistics by: (i) developing comprehensive
data sources for national accounts; (ii) applying statistical concepts to organize information
on government revenues and expenditures to develop sound government finance statistics;
(iii) strengthening the coverage of balance of payments transactions; and (iv) further
improving the classification of bank accounts by economic sector and by financial instrument
in compiling monetary and financial statistics. A follow-up mission on national accounts
took place in late 2005. A follow-up mission in monetary and financial statistics took place
in March-April 2006, which agreed with NBS officials on the establishment of a system for
regular reporting of data that will lead to the introduction of an IFS page for Serbia.
A. Real Sector
3.
Real sector data are compiled by the Republic of Serbia Statistical Office (RSSO).
Annual current price estimates of GDP by activity and by expenditure are available for
Serbia for 1997–2003. In June 2005, the RSSO started publishing quarterly constant price
estimates of GDP using the production approach, covering 1999–2005. The agency has made
commendable efforts to adopt the System of National Accounts (1993 SNA), but there are still
problems with the scope of the accounts and the basis for recording, which are not entirely
consistent with international standards. Moreover, the quality of the source data is uneven,
and data sources are in need of improvement. Official statistics do not incorporate estimates
of informal activities, which the RSSO estimated at about 14 percent of GDP in 2003.
4.
The RSSO compiles and disseminate retail price indices (RPI), consumer price
indices (CPI), producer price indices (PPI), and unit-value price indices for imports and
exports. It plans to introduce a new CPI index in 2006, in line with international standards.

61
While the frequency and methodology of observation appear adequate, weighting, data
storage, and dissemination could be improved.
B. Balance of Payments
5.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the National Bank of Serbia (NBS).
While the data compilation procedures appear appropriate, some components of the balance
of payments (e.g., remittances) suffer from substantial underrecording owing to the large
proportion of foreign exchange transactions occurring outside official channels. The NBS has
made commendable efforts to improve its estimation of actual flows. In current account
reporting, the NBS could further improve coverage, valuation and classification by adjusting
trade and services data for transactions not explicitly declared (e.g., repairs, shuttle trade,
grants in kind, and tourism). In reporting on capital account and financing, the NBS could
improve FDI statistics and remove exchange-rate effects from the estimation of certain
financial transactions, including reserves and arrears below the line.
C. Government Finance
6.
Fiscal statistics are compiled by the Serbian Ministry of Finance and reported on a
monthly basis. Principal data sources are the Republican Treasury and the budget execution
reports of the spending ministries and first-level budget units.
7.
Since 2001, Serbia has made efforts to bring the existing budget reporting system in
line with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) methodology. But
full compliance has yet to be achieved as implementation of the new chart of accounts,
generally consistent with the classifications of the GFSM 2001, has not been completed.
Fiscal data reporting suffers from frequent re-classifications, especially at the level of local
governments and social funds. While the data on government payment arrears are available
on quarterly basis, information on accrual of arrears is not available. The authorities have
requested a fiscal ROSC mission, which is tentatively scheduled for September 2006.
D. Monetary Accounts
8.
Monetary and financial statistics are compiled by the NBS, broadly following the
methodology set forth in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, and meet GDDS
recommendations with respect to the periodicity and timeliness of financial sector data. Some
improvements could still be made. Depository corporations’ claims on clients in the NBS
Statistical Bulletin are on a net-of-provisions basis, while those reported to STA for the
development of the IFS page are on a gross basis. The coverage of monetary data excludes:
(i) some still relatively small deposit-taking savings and credit institutions; and (ii) since
January 2002, banks in liquidation (as their data are not available on a timely or comparable,
IAS-specified, basis). Regarding the former, the March-April 2006 mission recommended
that these activities be monitored and should they become analytically significant, these
institutions should be included in the coverage of the depository corporations’ survey. The

62
mission also recommended that the banks’ claims on enterprises published in the NBS
bulletin be disaggregated into claims on public and private enterprises. The NBS has began
reporting monetary data in the Standardized Report Forms.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF SERBIA
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
and Post-Program Monitoring Discussions—Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2006 Consultation with the Republic of Serbia
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Michael T. Hadjimichael
October 13, 2006
1.
This supplement provides information on economic and policy developments since
the staff report was issued. A proposed decision on the continuation of post-program
monitoring (PPM) is also attached. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Economic activity has exceeded expectations and inflation has declined, but
external imbalances have widened. Strong demand—fueled by continued capital inflows
and credit growth—has buoyed activity and imports. This has set the current account on
track for a deficit of 12 percent of GDP in 2006—even before a planned weakening of the
fiscal stance later this year—and has raised external private debt by 7 percentage points of
GDP since end-2005, with total external debt back to 65 percent of GDP in August despite
the recent Paris Club write-off. With privatization receipts reflected in gross official reserves,
the latter soared to $10 billion at end-September (over 8 months of imports of goods and
services). This allowed a second early repurchase of SDR 162.5 million in September,
reducing Fund credit to SDR 325 million, or 69.5 percent of quota, as of end-September.
Reduced central bank intervention in the face of non privatization-related capital inflows led
to nominal dinar appreciation in Q3 of some 4 percent relative to H1. However, the strong
dinar, combined with favorable international oil price developments and a slowdown in other
administered price increases, helped reduce inflation in September to 11.6 percent and core
inflation to 10 percent year on year. Recent annualized monthly growth rates for core
inflation are in the range of 5–7 percent.
II. RECENT POLICY DEVELOPMENTS
3.
The National Bank of Serbia (NBS) announced a new monetary policy
framework in August. It includes greater exchange rate flexibility and is anchored by the
announcement of objectives for core inflation (7–9 percent at end-2006 and 4–8 percent at

2
end-2007), with the Ministry of Finance implicitly responsible for administered price
projections (non-core inflation). The framework anticipates eventual transition to a fullfledged inflation targeting regime. The two-week repo rate will constitute the main monetary
policy instrument. Market reaction to these changes has been favorable. Reflecting the
decline in core inflation, the NBS gradually lowered the repo rate from 20 percent in June to
18 percent in September.
4.
Two large privatization operations were completed, and others are forthcoming.
In August, a mobile phone company and mobile operator license were sold for the equivalent
of over 6½ percent of GDP (with the government receiving some 5 percent of GDP and the
minority shareholder the remainder). In September, a state-owned bank was sold for over
1½ percent of GDP. The authorities are proceeding with the sale of a third mobile phone
license. They also anticipate the sale of a minority stake in the state-owned oil and gas
company.
5.
The authorities plan a considerable fiscal relaxation relative to their
commitment at the time of the final review of the Extended Arrangement (EA) in
February 2006. In particular, the supplementary budget adopted in September involves
spending increases by some 3½ percent of GDP in 2006 relative to the EA objectives, funded
by part of this year’s privatization and license proceeds. Part of the increase consists of
additional current spending, in particular wages, while the rest will be executed under the
rubric of a “National Investment Plan” (NIP) including transportation, health, education, and
infrastructure. This implies, on IMF definitions, a general government deficit in 2006 of
about 1.4 percent of GDP, compared to the EA objective of a surplus of 2.7 percent of GDP.
Constraints on implementation capacity, however, are likely to prevent full execution of
these plans in the envisaged time frame. Accordingly, staff projects a 2006 fiscal deficit of
0.6 percent of GDP. While the authorities expect a slightly lower deficit, their estimate is
based on more optimistic revenue projections and the assumption that NIP budget
appropriations are fully executed (Text Table 1). The authorities have not yet announced
their budget plans for 2007. But taking account of the remaining NIP appropriations,
continued implementation capacity constraints, and the already adopted tax cuts, the fiscal
deficit outturn could be over 3½ percent of GDP in 2007—and up to 6½ percent of GDP if
NIP appropriations were fully spent. This compares with a staff recommended surplus of
3 percent of GDP.

6.
Political uncertainties are high. With talks on the EU Stabilization and Association
Agreement still suspended, a party, led by the Minister of Finance, has recently withdrawn
from the minority government coalition. If, as now expected, early elections follow, they are
likely to be held under a new constitution, the draft of which was recently approved by
parliament and will be subject to a referendum in late October.
7.
Thus far, market confidence has not been affected. This appears to reflect that
these policy and political developments were anticipated, that implementation of the fiscal
plans is expected to be only partial, and that high interest rates compensate for the risks.
III. STAFF ASSESSMENT
8.
The reforms to the monetary framework are welcome, but the envisaged
relaxation of fiscal policy reinforces the concerns regarding trends in domestic demand,
external imbalances, and vulnerabilities. The envisaged redirection of fiscal policy—
notwithstanding uncertainties about its timing and scale—will compound current account
pressures, increase external vulnerabilities, complicate disinflation, and compromise
competitiveness and medium-term growth. And if market sentiment turns, growth in the
short term could also be hurt. Moreover, an increase in spending on the scale and pace sought
by the authorities is virtually certain to be associated with large inefficiencies. The staff’s
advice remains unchanged—including continued fiscal consolidation, and an appropriate
phasing of NIP initiatives funded largely through efficiencies in current public expenditure
(Text Table 2). This would reduce external vulnerabilities, support disinflation and the new
monetary framework, and along with further structural measures, set the stage for sustained
medium-term growth.

outstanding Fund credit below 100 percent of quota.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 20, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Republic of Serbia
On October 18, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Serbia—the first Article IV
consultation for Serbia alone following the dissolution of the former state union of "Serbia
and Montenegro" in June.15
Background
After two decades of stagnation and decline at the end of the last century, Serbia has
made significant progress in recent years. Output is up 40 percent from 2000, and GDP
growth reached 6.8 percent in 2005. This reflects progress in macroeconomic
stabilization, banking sector restructuring, and privatization. Concomitantly, some
60 percent of non-budget non-agricultural employment is now in the private sector,
almost double the share five years ago.
However, the legacies of earlier policies continue to weigh on economic performance.
Employment has trended down—despite buoyant GDP growth—, headline inflation has
only briefly dipped below the mid-teens, and fixed investment stagnated below
20 percent of GDP, falling well short of the level in comparable transition countries.
Reflecting the low level of national savings, the current account deficit has remained in
15

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and
policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing
Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
double digits, resulting in an increase in external debt to 65 percent of GDP by August
2006 despite Paris and London Club debt write-offs. Sizeable corporate losses of the
non-financial sector—largely reflecting weak governance and soft budget constraints in
socially owned and state-owned enterprises—are at the core of Serbia’s external
deficits, while also curbing investment and employment growth.
The strong—notably fiscal—policy response has been overwhelmed by surging capital
inflows. Privatization-related FDI and direct corporate borrowing have been increasingly
complemented by parent bank funding for subsidiaries to take advantage of high banking
spreads. This, together with remonetization, has caused a credit boom, compounding
external imbalances. As a result, the current account deficit has barely changed in four
years despite fiscal consolidation of 5½ percentage points of GDP, macro-prudential
measures, and foreign exchange intervention to contain appreciation.
Since 2002, the exchange rate regime has tried to balance internal and external
objectives, ultimately securing neither. In early 2006, the National Bank of Serbia
announced a transition to exchange rate flexibility and accommodated a considerably
stronger dinar accordingly. At end-August, the NBS adopted a new monetary policy
framework using the two-week repo rate as the main monetary policy instrument to
achieve core inflation objectives (7-9 percent at end-2006, and 4–8 percent at end2007). The new framework anticipates eventual transition to full-fledged inflation
targeting. In the same vein, the NBS is scaling back foreign exchange intervention to a
“leaning against the wind” role.
Reduced foreign exchange intervention in the face of continued strong capital inflows led
to nominal dinar appreciation in the course of 2006. The strong dinar, combined with
favorable international oil price developments and a slowdown in other administered
price increases, helped reduce headline inflation to 11.6 percent and core inflation to
10 percent year-on-year in September.
Looking ahead, however, the envisaged fiscal expansion will exacerbate domestic
demand pressures and complicate disinflation. The recently adopted supplementary
budget provides for an increase in expenditures by 4 percent of GDP in 2006 relative to
the original budget, funded by large privatization and license proceeds. This increase
consists of additional current spending and expenditures under the National Investment
Plan that provides for spending in the amount of €1.7 billion (7½ percent of GDP) in
2006–07. Fully implemented, this would imply a general government deficit in 2006 of up
to 1.4 percent of GDP (0.3 percent of GDP according to the authorities’ more optimistic
revenue projections and accounting standards—which treat license proceeds as
revenue—implying a surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP for the Republican budget).
This general government deficit on staff definitions, however, compares to a surplus of
2.7 percent of GDP envisaged under the former Extended Arrangement with the IMF.
However, capacity constraints are likely to prevent full execution of these spending
plans. The authorities have not yet finalized their budget plans for 2007.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for Serbia’s strong economic growth in
recent years, the fruit of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform. However,
Directors underscored that large macroeconomic imbalances—including external deficits
and debt, inflation, and unemployment—persist, with associated vulnerabilities, and that
widespread financial euroization implies significant foreign currency exposures. In that
light, they urged further policy effort, cautioning strongly that the proposed fiscal
loosening carried risks of renewed macroeconomic instability.
Directors noted that sizeable surpluses for the consolidated general government remain
appropriate. Though public debt is on a downward trajectory, fiscal surpluses are needed
to contain external imbalances and vulnerabilities, support disinflation, and—in
anticipation of reinvigorated structural reform efforts—create the basis for sustained
medium-term growth. In this context, critical public investments should be funded by
efficiencies in current spending, rather than fiscal relaxation. Directors also cautioned
against relying on one-off privatization receipts to finance recurrent expenditure, such as
wages. While recognizing the challenge of this approach in the current electoral context,
Directors were of the view that the recently approved fiscal expansion, if fully
implemented, would put at risk hard-won macroeconomic stabilization gains. They also
noted that it would be inconsistent with key understandings under the post-program
monitoring framework which were reached in February. In their view, re-anchoring fiscal
policy from external to fiscal sustainability would be appropriate only once structural
reforms—including corporate restructuring and credit deceleration—are reflected in a
strengthened current account balance.
Directors considered that the remaining economic imbalances were symptomatic of
weak corporate structures, which continue to drain domestic savings. In this light, an
acceleration of corporate restructuring and completion of the privatization of sociallyowned and state-owned companies are the central response to the imbalances and
associated vulnerabilities. Thus, the divestiture of the remaining portfolio of sociallyowned enterprises will require swift and consistent initiation of bankruptcy procedures
should the tenders or auctions for these companies fail. To address employment
concerns, Directors recommended increased flexibility of labor market institutions,
including through a review of labor laws. They also recommended improvements in the
business climate, including by strengthening the effectiveness of the judicial processes.
Directors noted that strong capital inflows pose additional challenges, including by
spurring rapid credit growth and exacerbating current account strains. In this context,
and given evidence of high non-performing loan ratios, they welcomed the new banking
law, which has aligned the legal framework with Basel Core Principles. But further
measures to strengthen banking supervision are necessary, including in regard to the
exposure of unhedged borrowers to exchange rate risk. Moreover, additional measures
to strengthen competition in the banking sector could, by securing efficient spreads,
encourage greater attentiveness by banks to macroeconomic and indirect credit risks
and, thereby, help contain credit growth. In this context, they encouraged the authorities
to consider recommencing the issuance of licenses to greenfield banks.

4
Directors welcomed the new monetary policy framework as an important step towards
eventual full-fledged inflation targeting. In this context, they supported the authorities’
intention to scale back foreign currency interventions to a “leaning against the wind” role,
in line with the goal of increased exchange rate flexibility. The new regime would support
disinflation, which, in turn, would encourage economic growth. Directors underscored the
importance of supportive fiscal policy for the credibility of the new regime and that,
absent this, disinflation objectives could be compromised.
In view of Serbia’s substantial external imbalances and vulnerabilities, Directors
approved the continuation of post-program monitoring for another year, despite early
repurchases that have reduced outstanding Fund credit to below 100 percent of quota.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Thomas Moser, Executive Director for Republic of Serbia
and Srboljub Antic, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
October 18, 2006
1.
We would like to thank the staff for the comprehensive set of documents, which give
a realistic account of the Serbian economy. The staff report very clearly presents the
important achievements of the reform process since 2000 but also rightly points at the
significant remaining challenges. Our Serbian authorities share the staff’s views about the
main economic problems and challenges, and they would like to thank the staff for the
constructive policy discussions and the valuable recommendations.
2.
Serbia is currently undergoing a very demanding period during which some longstanding and delicate political issues will have to be resolved, or at least tackled. The process
for the adoption of a new constitution has started and the referendum will be held at the end
of October 2006. There is a broad political consensus that early elections will be held shortly
after the referendum, probably as soon as mid-December 2006.
3.
Over the last six years, Serbia has implemented its macroeconomic policies under
three successive Fund-supported programs, and the Fund’s involvement has continued in the
form of a Post Program Monitoring (PPM). During this period, real output has increased by
more than 30 percent, inflation has decelerated and is on course for a single digit at the end
of the year, and external debt has declined from over 130 percent to 65 percent of GDP. This
outcome was mainly the result of prudent fiscal and monetary policies, but substantial
progress has also been achieved in reforming both the banking and the real sector. The
reform momentum has received a boost from the political side through the completion of the
EU’s feasibility study in 2005 and the start of negotiations on association. Although these
negotiations are temporarily blocked, prospects for EU accession provide a clear framework
for reforms.
4.
Although these achievements are encouraging, the authorities are fully aware that
much remains to be done and a challenging reform agenda is still ahead of them. While
growth has been strong, the economy is still below its level of 1990, inflation continues to be
relatively high, not to mention the high current account deficit and the array of remaining
structural reforms.
5.
One of the issues highlighted in the staff report and to a large extent discussed during
the staff mission is the fiscal policy stance. Over the last years, Serbia has achieved
significant fiscal consolidation with a change from high deficits to surpluses over the last two
years. This demonstrated the authorities’ willingness and ability to carry out a sizeable fiscal
adjustment. At the current juncture, the Serbian authorities regard a relaxation of the
demonstrated fiscal austerity as appropriate. While the elections looming at the end of 2006
undeniably provide part of the reason, the authorities also consider that higher revenue,

2
including from a third mobile license receipts, has created the necessary fiscal space to
improve the country’s infrastructure. After years of disinvestment in the 1990s and a very
low level of public investment after 2000 (about 3 percent of GDP), Serbia’s infrastructure is
in a dire state and it is becoming a serious bottleneck for investors. The authorities consider
an increase in public investment therefore as important. Size, scope, pace and financing,
however, are issues to be discussed in the context of development of the budget for 2007.
6.
Monetary policy is currently undergoing the significant change from an exchange-rate
anchor as the main instrument for controlling inflation toward an inflation targeting
framework. The first results – as reflected in declining inflation and inflation expectations
and an appreciating exchange rate – are positive. The main instrument in the new monetary
framework is the two-week repo rate, and there are initial but clear signs that the repo rate is
becoming the key interest rate in markets. To strengthen its monetary signals, the National
Bank of Serbia improved the money market operation design and introduced a new practice
of publicly communicating the results of Monetary Board meetings. The National Bank of
Serbia will continue to move out of the foreign exchange market, thus making the exchange
rate more flexible. As the result of the introduction of the new monetary framework the
exchange rate has been appreciating.
7.
As in other transition countries, credit to the private sector in Serbia is growing
rapidly, supported by foreign borrowing of foreign owned banks. Credit to private sector has
more than doubled in last two years, despite high reserve requirements on foreign borrowing.
Banking privatization has continued in 2006 with the selling of one of two largest state
owned bank. The largest bank in Serbia was recapitalized by the EBRD, which also bought
shares in one smaller private bank. A couple of other state owned and domestically owned
private banks were also sold to foreign owners.
8.
As the staff notes, slow reforms in the real sector have contributed substantially to
external imbalances by lowering domestic savings. The authorities plan to reinvigorate
privatization by putting up for sale all companies from the portfolio of the Privatization
agency by mid-2007. The plan for the state owned Share Fund is to sell all shares in its
portfolio through the stock exchange in 2007. All companies that cannot find buyers twice on
auctions or tenders will be put into bankruptcy. The staff rightly notes that the bankruptcy
procedures enacted in 2005 have remained little used up to now, but the number of
bankruptcy cases is clearly rising.
9.
Telecommunication and the oil sector are undergoing significant changes. After
selling one of two majority state owned mobile companies for 1.5 billion Euros, the
government launched the tender for a third mobile operating license. The entering of a third
mobile operator will provide more competition and have positive effects on the business
climate. The tender for selling minority shares in the oil company will be announced with the
new government in office. The restructuring of other utilities continues through measures

3
that introduce competition and improve efficiency by imposing hard budget constraints
through subsidy cuts and strict wage control.
10.
The authorities decided to start early repurchase of outstanding Fund resources. Two
repurchases were completed in June and September 2006, respectively, bringing outstanding
Fund credit below the 100 percent of quota which requires a post-program monitoring.
However, the Serbian authorities are fully aware that the country would still benefit from
close monitoring, given the significant macroeconomic imbalances and the number of
structural reforms that still need to be addressed. Therefore, our authorities would very much
welcome the continuation of PPM.
11.
Our Serbian authorities consider transparency in their relations with the Fund as
important. Since regaining Fund membership in 2000, all staff reports on Serbia were
published, and this policy will continue in the future. Accordingly, the Serbian authorities
consent to the publication of the staff report.
