•

Consultation and team. The 2009 Article IV consultation discussions with Thailand
were held in Bangkok during March 23−April 3, 2009. The staff team consisted of
Messrs. Weerasinghe (Head), Kalra, and Aiyar, and Ms. Ruiz-Arranz (all APD), and
Mr. Gray (MCM). Messrs. Chua (Alternate Executive Director) and Kanithasen (Advisor,
OED) participated in the discussions. The team met with Finance Minister Korn
Chatikavanij, Bank of Thailand Governor Tarisa Watanagase, senior officials, and private
sector representatives.

•

Prior consultations. Macroeconomic policies in recent years have been broadly
consistent with Fund advice. There have been significant strides in banking sector
restructuring, and 2007 saw the passage of a number of financial sector laws.
Implementation of public sector investment plans, especially for infrastructure, has been
significantly delayed.

•

Exchange rate system. Thailand maintains a floating exchange rate, under an inflation
targeting regime. Thailand has accepted its obligations under Article VIII Sections 2, 3,
and 4, and maintains an exchange rate regime free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.

•

Economic statistics. Thailand’s statistical base is adequate to conduct effective
surveillance. Data issues are discussed in the Informational Annex.

•

Publication. Staff reports have not been published thus far; PINs and selected issues
papers have been published. The authorities have not yet indicated their consent to
publication of this year’s documents.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Unsettled domestic politics and the global recession are weighing on the Thai economy.
After an extended period of domestic political turmoil, investor and consumer confidence are
low. Coming on top of weak domestic demand, the global recession has significantly
neutralized exports which have been the engine of growth in recent years. Growth has slowed
in recent years and 2009 will see the first full-year decline in real GDP since the Asian crisis.
The decline in real GDP could be limited to 3 percent in 2009 by a significant fiscal
stimulus. Private domestic demand is expected to remain weak and the global recession has
eroded export growth. Fiscal stimulus from the 2008/09 budget can limit the contraction in
growth. Risks to the near term outlook come from heightened political uncertainties, weak
implementation of the fiscal stimulus, and a potentially sharper slowdown in external
demand. With political stability, a restoration of domestic and external confidence, and full
implementation of the public investment program, Thailand would be able to return to
sustainable, high growth rates over the medium term.
The consultation discussions focused on policy measures to support growth, and on
vulnerabilities in the financial and corporate sectors.
•

The government’s fiscal stimulus plans are needed to support growth but a
determined implementation of these plans is critical. The increase in deficits and
debt to finance the fiscal stimulus plans should be manageable over the medium term.

•

Sharp cuts in the policy rate by the Bank of Thailand (BOT) were timely. There
remains some scope for further rate cuts to provide support to economic activity.
However, while banking system liquidity remains ample, the credit transmission
mechanism is impaired by the higher risk aversion of banks. The BOT’s intention to
monitor market conditions when deciding on further rate cuts is appropriate.

•

Plans to guarantee credit expansion for SMEs and exporters are helpful in the
current conjuncture. These initiatives can help unblock credit expansion to these
sectors by shaving credit risk for banks.

•

The financial and corporate sectors are in robust shape, but risks remain. The
likely deterioration in asset quality and balance sheets of banks could be absorbed for
the foreseeable future by capital buffers. The corporate sector should also be able to
ride out the downturn. Large corporates still have access to financing. Marginal SMEs
are the most vulnerable to the deteriorating economic outlook but should get some
relief from the credit guarantee schemes.

•

The level of the baht is broadly appropriate. The BOT’s continued commitment to
a flexible exchange rate system is welcome.

I. MACROECONOMIC AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
1.
After years of intense turmoil, the political temperature in Thailand remains
high and private sector confidence is low. Political turmoil—the ouster of the Thaksin
administration in 2006 in a military coup, the return of Thaksin’s allies to power in fresh
elections in December 2007, the fall of two governments in 2008—has reduced business
confidence to a ten-year low. Mr. Abhisit assumed the premiership in January 2009 at the
head of the Democratic Party led coalition government. Simmering discontent of supporters
of the ousted governments culminated in violent street protests in early April. The resulting
decline in external sentiment led to downgrades by ratings agencies of Thailand’s sovereign
and local currency debt in mid-April.
2.
Against this backdrop, strong headwinds from the global downturn reached
Thailand in 2008Q4. Domestically,

Developments in monetary aggregates reflected the slowdown in activity. Private

4.
Financial markets reflected the impact of the global turmoil. Tightening funding
conditions abroad, the decline in interest rates at home, and deficit financing contributed to a
significant expansion of the domestic bond market. Large corporates with sound credit
entered the market, partly to refinance external borrowings and as a precaution in the face of
the uncertain economic environment going forward. As a result, bond issuance surged in
2008. The stock market shared the downward trend with regional bourses. With the broadscale pull back by foreign investors, the SET index fell by over 45 percent in 2008. Equity
market volatility rose significantly in 2008Q3, before declining in Q4 (Figure 2).

5.
International reserves increased and the baht depreciated against the dollar.
Despite a balanced current account, a fall in FDI and net portfolio outflows, reserves
increased (Table 3). This increase is attributable to strong inflows on the capital account
generated by a reduction in the net foreign assets of commercial banks as banks switched
from perceived high-risk assets abroad to domestic assets. As regards the exchange rate,
following the removal of capital controls in March 2008, the baht initially appreciated in
2008Q1. Since then, global risk aversion has contributed to a stronger dollar and the baht has
depreciated in line with other regional currencies. International reserves increased by
US$23¼ billion to US$111 billion at end-2008 (about 9 months of imports), with almost all
the accumulation occurring during 2008Q1. In 2009Q1, a trade surplus has contributed to an
increase in reserves to US$115¾ billion at mid-April.
6.
Monetary policy kept pace with the shifting economic environment but risk
aversion in the banking system rose.
•

Headline inflation (period average) rose to 5½ percent in 2008 from 2¼ percent in
2007, reflecting the rapid run-up in global oil and commodity prices. Core inflation
also doubled to 2¼ percent. Inflationary pressures have moderated significantly since
2008Q4 with the onset of a declining trend in global oil prices.

With the ebb and flow of inflationary pressures and growth prospects, the Monetary
Policy Committee adjusted its

policy rate. The target policy

points to 2¾ percent. The rate was further lowered by another 150 basis points to
1¼ percent by April 2009.

•

Alongside, commercial banks interest rates declined, but net interest margins were
broadly unchanged. Banks lowered lending and deposit rates with the decline in the
policy rate. However, the unchanged net interest margins suggests an attempt by
banks to cushion profitability at a time of declining activity. In an attempt to ensure
that reductions in the policy rate translated into lower lending rates, the BOT urged
commercial banks—with some effect—to cut their lending rates. Notwithstanding
some decline in rates, with low loan demand and banks’ risk aversion, private sector
credit growth has remained subdued.

7.
Fiscal stance tightened in 2007/08 as budgetary spending fell short of the target.1
The central government budget posted a deficit of about ½ percent of GDP due mainly to
capital underspending (budgeted deficit was 1¼ percent of GDP). The general government
surplus rose to ¾ percent of GDP (from a deficit of ¼ percent of GDP in 2006/07), and the
overall public sector was in balance.
II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
The decline in real GDP could be limited to 3 percent in 2009 by a significant
fiscal stimulus.2 The global recession is projected to generate a sharp contraction in net
exports while supportive fiscal policy would limit, but not eliminate, the contraction in
domestic demand. Both consumption and investment are projected to fall. Negative growth in
private consumption—in line with falling real incomes—will be partially offset by growth in
1

The BOT and MOF projections are for real GDP declines of 1½−3½ percent and 2½−3½ percent, respectively.

7
public consumption. Similarly, a sharp contraction in private investment will be partially
offset by growth in public investment. Alongside, the decline in oil prices is expected to lead
to a significant moderation in headline and core inflation. For 2009, market observers expect
core inflation to remain well within the target band of 0−3½ percent.
9.
A small current account surplus is projected for 2009 on account of an
improvement in the terms of trade while the financial account is projected to turn
negative. Both exports and imports are projected to contract sharply in real terms. However,
with a concentration in hard-hit cyclical sectors such as automobiles and electronics, the fall
in exports is expected to be larger, with import demand sustained by the large fiscal stimulus.
The terms of trade are forecast to improve mainly due to a fall in oil prices. The financial
account is projected to turn negative, reversing the pattern of 2008: FDI is projected to
decline, net portfolio outflows would likely continue and the large reduction in NFA of
commercial banks that occurred in 2008 is expected to be partially reversed as domestic
banks replenish assets abroad. With these developments, international reserves would decline
but remain high at around 8 months of imports (about 360 percent of short-term debt),
providing a substantial cushion against sudden stop or capital reversal scenarios.3
10.
A recovery in the global economy and public investment would support growth
beyond 2009. For 2010, domestic demand is expected to be a key contributor to growth, with
a substantial contribution from public investment. Starting in 2010H2, the recovery in
Thailand’s main trading partners can be expected to stimulate a recovery in private
investment and a rebound in exports. This would be balanced by a strong recovery in imports.
Together with a gradual deterioration in the terms of trade as energy prices rise, the current
account is projected to move to a small deficit over time. Infrastructure spending is expected
to generate public sector deficits but public debt is projected to remain within sustainable
limits. Over the medium term, growth could converge to a potential rate of 5−6 percent.
These positive developments, like the near-term outlook, are contingent on supportive
macroeconomic policies and a turnaround in the global economy.
11.
Risks to near-term growth are tilted to the downside. The country remains deeply
polarized, and the heightened political turmoil continues to erode business and consumer
sentiment. A sharper slowdown in trading partner countries could further dampen the
investment climate and risk aversion, apart from its direct impact through the trade channel.
Domestically, weak implementation of budget investment plans would constrain the size of
the fiscal stimulus.

3

In 2009, gross financing needs are estimated at about US$34½ billion. Of this, US$24 billion comprises shortterm debt, on which a 70 percent rollover rate is assumed.

8
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The discussions focused on measures to address the impact of the global crisis and support
growth. These included policies to stimulate domestic demand, especially to provide a fiscal
stimulus, and a supportive monetary stance. Discussions also focused on the need to ensure
credit growth for vulnerable sectors and financial and corporate sectors’ vulnerabilities to
the growth slowdown and the worsened external environment.
A. Macroeconomic Policies
12.
Overall, there was agreement that the policy challenge is to limit the downdraft
from the global recession and maintain macroeconomic stability. Raising investor and
consumer confidence will be key in the near term. The political turmoil of 2008, continued
unrest in 2009, and frequent changes in government have taken a heavy toll on investor
sentiment and dampened external perceptions of Thailand. A credible end to the political
unrest and resumption of government activity is essential to a recovery in private sector
confidence. As regards macroeconomic policies for 2009, the fiscal stimulus package would
contribute to higher growth. Over the medium term, effective implementation of
infrastructure investment would complement the recovery in exports and private demand. In
addition, measures to enhance infrastructure and social sector spending to increase physical
and human capital and raise total factor productivity would raise the growth potential.
13.
Staff welcomed the fiscal stimulus plans for 2008/09. The central government
budget deficit is expected to widen to 4½ percent of GDP from ½ percent of GDP in 2007/08.
Of the total change in the fiscal deficit, around 2½ percent is estimated to be from fiscal
stimulus measures, the remainder from the operation of automatic stabilizers (Box 1). The
size and composition of the fiscal stimulus are broadly appropriate and will help support
growth in the second half of 2009. The public sector deficit will also likely widen as local
administrations and state-owned enterprises are expected to provide further stimulus,
particularly in the form of accelerated investment. The combination of higher deficit and
guarantees for credit expansion will lead

Box 1. Fiscal Stimulus
Thailand has adopted fiscal stimulus measures to counter the ongoing economic downturn and
help cushion its impact on vulnerable groups. The budgetary fiscal stimulus in 2008/09 is estimated
at around 2.4 percent of GDP and is aimed at supporting domestic demand in the near-term. This
includes a stimulus package focused on transfers and subsidies of around 1 percent of GDP (approved
in a supplementary budget in early January), as well as tax measures and increased public investment.
The government approved in March a medium-term stimulus package of B1.6 trillion focused on
infrastructure investment over the next three years.

The size and composition of the combined fiscal stimulus package aim to support growth
starting in the second half of 2009. About half of the fiscal stimulus in 2008/09 is expected to come
from income support measures (transfers and subsidies), 30 percent from discretionary tax measures
and the remainder from infrastructure investment. The advantage of transfers/subsidies, which are
aimed at credit-constrained and vulnerable groups, is that they are quick disbursing, would have an
immediate impact on domestic demand, and would help to kick-start growth.
In addition, the authorities intend to expand public sector investment over the medium term. The
government has adopted a public investment plan of B1.6 trillion over the next three years. As a result,
public sector investment is expected to increase by 1½ percentage points of GDP in 2009/10 relative to
2007/08. In the medium-term, public investment would be the most effective way to stimulate the
economy. Public investment, especially in infrastructure, has advantages over other types of spending
as the associated multiplier is likely higher and as is necessary from a medium-term growth perspective.
The impact on growth in 2009 and 2010 depends critically on the implementation of spending
plans, especially public infrastructure investment. Underspending relative to budget targets reflects,
in part, the conservative approach to fiscal policy since the Asian Crisis. In recent years, this has been
compounded by political problems which have contributed to delays in project implementation. The
challenge going forward will be to ensure speedy, efficient, and full implementation, thus improving on
the authorities’ past record of spending shortfalls. Staff estimate that the impact of the stimulus package
on growth in 2009 could be between 1 and 2¼ percentage points.

10
for the next three years. On current plans, the central government deficit for 2009/10 is
estimated to decline slightly to 4 percent, but the overall public sector deficit is expected to
widen to 5 percent on account of higher infrastructure investment by public enterprises. To
ensure that fiscal policy continues to maintain a supportive stance, staff suggested that public
sector investment be allowed to increase by at least 1½ percentage points of GDP relative to
2007/08. Implementation of these plans would require a significant contribution from public
enterprises, foreign borrowing, and intensive use of public private partnerships. Thailand’s
public debt is currently at moderate levels, and staff projections suggest that with the higher
deficits, the debt ratio will rise through 2011/12 but fall thereafter as growth picks up.
15.
Financing the higher deficits would require adjustments to mandatory ceilings,
external borrowing, and stronger efforts to tap the domestic bond market. With the
significant revenue shortfall and the higher planned spending from the stimulus package, the
authorities intend to temporarily raise the domestic borrowing limits to finance a higher fiscal
deficit.4 In addition, the government has accessed US$2 billion in financing from the World
Bank, AsDB, and JBIC. As regards domestic issuance, even though there is sufficient
liquidity in the banks, there is a limited appetite for public debt at longer maturities. To tap
this liquidity, market participants noted that the authorities would need to make additional
efforts to tap retail investor demand for longer duration government bonds through higher
yields or innovative products (such as floating rate bonds).
16.
With global monetary easing, the BOT considered that there was some
remaining scope for further cuts in the policy rate. Staff welcomed the BOT interest rate
cuts since December 2008 as timely. With a global recovery likely to be delayed, exports
collapsing, and inflationary pressures having abated significantly, the BOT maintained that
there was some space for monetary policy to be further accommodative of growth. However,
it was also mindful that the impact of monetary policy may be limited by feedback loops
from the weaker real economy and the current excess liquidity in the financial system; in
addition, with headline inflation in negative territory for the last two months, the
effectiveness of monetary policy is likely to have diminished as the policy rate moves
towards zero. Going forward, the BOT intended to balance these considerations in
determining the size and timing of further cuts in the policy rate.

4

The current law limits new borrowing to cover a budget deficit to 20 percent of annual budget expenditures,
plus 80 percent of principal repayment due. New borrowings can come only from domestic sources. Guarantees
on state enterprise borrowings are limited to 20 percent of annual budget expenditures. External borrowing can
be for economic and social development only, and is limited to 10 percent of annual expenditures.

11
17.
To address gaps in the credit transmission mechanism, the government intends
to guarantee portions of loan portfolios of banks for exporters and SMEs through state
financial institutions (SFIs).5 With these sectors worst hit by the economic slowdown and
heightened risk aversion of the banks, the guarantees would help to underwrite continued
credit expansion to the marginal SMEs. The guarantees are to be extended through the Small
Business Credit Guarantee Corporation (SBCG) and the EXIM bank, and involve risksharing among banks and the SFIs for NPLs related to new loans to these sectors. The
guarantees are available for 5 years and 3 years for SBCG and EXIM bank, respectively.
B. Financial and Corporate Sector Vulnerabilities
18.

Banks and corporates entered the global turmoil with robust balance sheets.



Favorable initial conditions—stronger balance sheets, limited exposure to subprimerelated and structured products, ample domestic liquidity, and reliance predominantly
on domestic deposits for funding—have helped the Thai banking system withstand
the turmoil in global financial markets. Banks are well capitalized (14¼ percent CAR
at end-2008 compared to 8½ percent minimum requirement), have had positive
operating profits, and NPLs have been falling for several years (Figure 3).
Improvements in risk management and caution in business strategy also contributed
to the strong position of banks as they entered the global and domestic economic
downturn. The extension of full deposit insurance through 2011 has helped to shore
up depositor confidence in the banking system.



Similarly, the corporate sector entered the current economic slowdown with moderate
leverage and strong balance sheets. Large corporates continued to have access to
bank financing and increased domestic bond issuance. However, SMEs have been
negatively affected by the downturn, especially in the export sector. Electronics,
automobiles, and tourism sectors have been the hardest hit.

5

The Portfolio Guarantee Scheme operated by the SBCG will extend guarantees on loans portfolios of banks to
SMEs up to a total of B30 billion, for credit expansion of B60–100 billion. To this end, the government will
inject B3 billion of new capital into the SBCG. Banks’ customers will pay a fee for the guarantee, and banks
will share default risk with the SBCG (the first 12 percent of the NPLs would be fully covered by the SBCG,
with a lower proportion of the defaults covered beyond the first 12 percent along a graduated scale). The EXIM
bank would receive a capital injection of B5 billion to extend loans up to B150 billion per year over the 3 years.

12
19.
The global recession and declining domestic growth in 2009 are expected to
adversely affect bank balance sheets. There is a likelihood of a deterioration in asset
quality and higher NPLs, especially on account of SMEs. Banks continued to provide loans to
large corporates in 2009Q1, but are reducing their overall lending targets. In addition, banks
are restructuring loans of potentially

shocks, the BOT has conducted stress
tests on banks’ balance sheets under tight assumptions, including on the higher credit risk and
lower growth. These tests indicate that while NPLs are likely to increase going forward as
growth slows and the asset quality of the banks’ portfolios deteriorates, the capital adequacy
ratio of most banks would remain above minimum requirement. However, the tests suggest
that only a few banks may experience difficulties and these banks have been or are being
recapitalized.

C. External Competitiveness and the Exchange Rate

The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment that Thailand’s real effective
exchange rate (REER) is broadly in line with fundamentals. Preliminary CGER estimates

methodologies suggesting

that the baht is close to
equilibrium. The Equilibrium
Real Exchange Rate (ERER) methodology suggests a small undervaluation. These estimates
are consistent with market expectations, based on forward rates and consensus private sector
forecasts, of a broadly stable REER.
22.
Thailand’s real exchange rate has recently moved largely in line with the rest of
the region. Most regional currencies have depreciated against the U.S. dollar, due to
deleveraging and a flight to safety. This nominal depreciation has driven a corresponding
depreciation in the REER. The movement of the Thai baht since the second quarter of
2008—in both nominal and real terms—is therefore part of a region-wide trend. Meanwhile
survey-based methods indicate that Thailand remains broadly competitive against the region
and other emerging markets. The BOT underscored its commitment to a flexible exchange
rate, with intervention only to smooth excessive volatility.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
23.
Unsettled domestic politics and the global recession are weighing heavily on the
Thai economy. As a result of the extended period of political uncertainty, investor and
consumer confidence are low. The global recession has significantly neutralized exports as an
engine of growth. Growth has slowed in recent years and 2009 will see the first full-year
decline in real GDP since the Asian crisis. Risks to the near term outlook are significant, and

14
come from heightened political uncertainties, weak implementation of the fiscal stimulus,
and a potentially sharper slowdown in external demand. With political stability, a restoration
of confidence, and full implementation of the public investment program, Thailand would
return to sustainable, high growth rates over the medium term.
24.
Restoring market confidence remains key in the near term. While some of the
desired increase in confidence can come from a normalization of the political situation, a
determined implementation of policies, especially those related to public investment, can also
help to enhance confidence in Thailand’s economic prospects.
25.
The government’s fiscal stimulus plans are welcome but a determined
implementation of these plans is critical. With domestic demand weak and external
demand faltering, public spending holds the key to limiting the downturn in growth.
Budgetary measures, including those in the supplementary budget, and automatic stabilizers
will help to limit the decline in real GDP in 2009. In this context, an early start on the threeyear public investment program is highly recommended. This would help to support demand
beyond 2009, and help kick-start public infrastructure projects which are vital to higher
medium-term growth.
26.
The increase in deficits and debt to finance the fiscal stimulus plans should be
manageable over the medium term. Given the available fiscal space, these higher deficits
and debt levels are appropriate from a countercyclical perspective and would decline over the
medium term as growth pick up. The authorities intention to raise the mandatory ceilings to
finance the deficits is appropriate and the temporary nature of these measures is an indication
of Thailand’s continued commitment to fiscal sustainability.
27.
Sharp cuts in the policy rate by the BOT were timely. Some scope remains for
further rate cuts to complete the easing cycle and provide additional support to activity.
However, while banking system liquidity remains ample, the credit transmission mechanism
is impaired by elevated risk aversion of banks. Hence, the BOT’s intention to gauge the
effectiveness of recent reductions in the policy rate in deciding on further cuts is appropriate.
28.
Plans to guarantee credit expansion for SMEs and exporters are helpful in the
current conjuncture. These initiatives can help unblock credit expansion to these sectors by
shaving credit risk for banks. The emphasis in these schemes on risk sharing between
commercial banks and SFIs and a time limit for their operation are welcome features.
29.
The financial sector is in robust shape, but risks remain. The strong initial
position of the banks and strong supervisory efforts of the BOT have helped the sector
weather the global financial turmoil so far. In addition, the proactive efforts of the banks to
deal with potential defaults through advance loan restructurings are also helpful in the current
circumstances. Going forward, the slowing economy and stress on their clients’ balance
sheets and cash flows are likely to lead to deterioration in asset quality for the banks. While

15
the banks should be able to ride out the downturn given their capital buffers, continued close
BOT supervision is warranted.
30.
Although vulnerable, the corporate sector should also be able to ride out the
downturn. Large corporates have low leverage, still have access to domestic bank financing,
and have made precautionary financing arrangements in the domestic bond market even as
external financing has become more difficult. Marginal SMEs are the most vulnerable to the
deteriorating economic outlook but should get some relief from the credit guarantee schemes.
31.
The level of the baht is broadly appropriate. Recent REER movements have been
in line with regional peers, and the baht’s real effective value is consistent with
fundamentals. The BOT’s continued commitment to a flexible exchange rate system is
welcome.
32.

It is recommended that Thailand remain on the 12–month consultation cycle.

APPENDIX I. THAILAND: PUBLIC AND EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. Public Debt Sustainability
In the baseline scenario, the public debt-to-GDP ratio increases over the short-term but
the debt path remains sustainable. Owing to decelerating growth and a widening fiscal
deficit, public debt is projected to increase to 45 percent of GDP in 2009, from 37 percent of
GDP in 2008. It will rise further (to 50 percent of GDP) over the next two years as the
government is expected to run sizeable fiscal deficits before falling again from 2012
onwards. This path of public debt stems from the envisaged stepped up spending on
infrastructure by state-owned enterprises, from the announced fiscal stimulus package (of
2½ percent of GDP this fiscal year) as well as from the operation of automatic stabilizers in
the form of lower revenue growth. The increase in guaranteed debt by SFIs and government
agencies is also responsible for the projected increase in debt ratios over the medium-term.
Notwithstanding this, the profile of public debt remains favorable for most shocks to
the baseline. Shocks to the interest and exchange rates make only small differences to the
medium-term forecast. Shocks to real GDP growth, the primary balance and a combination
shock would increase the debt to GDP ratio by 5 percentage points relative to the baseline in
2014. However, all these shocks show marked declines by the end of the projection period.
The worst debt dynamics is projected under the contingent liabilities shock. Under this
scenario, the debt ratio would increase to 55 percent of GDP before falling to 53 percent of
GDP in 2014. Nevertheless, given legally binding constraints on the amount of debt that is
guaranteed every year, this path is in unlikely to be realized.
B. External Debt Sustainability
The baseline projection indicates a gradual rise in the country’s external debt for the
next three years, followed by a reduction in the debt ratio subsequently. In 2009 and
beyond, the government is expected to run substantial fiscal deficits, which will be partly
debt-financed. Both the central government and state-owned enterprises plan to undertake
large public investments in infrastructure. Together with a rise in private import demand as
consumption and investment recover from the recession, this will contribute to a rise in the
debt-to-GDP ratio from 23.6 percent in 2008 to a high of 28.2 percent in 2011. After that, as
fiscal deficits shrink, amortization is forecast to outweigh fresh borrowing, lowering the debt
ratio to below current levels by the end of the projection period. The non-interest current
account surplus and the accumulation of non-debt creating capital inflows (as FDI increases
over time with political normalization and economic growth) contribute, cumulatively, to
reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio by 14.2 percentage points through 2014. This is offset to
some extent by a build-up in international reserves, which are projected to decline gradually
in months of imports, but increase in absolute terms with the substantial rise in imports.

27
Stress tests indicate that Thailand’s external debt outlook remains quite resilient to
macroeconomic shocks. Shocks to the growth rate and the interest rate make only small
differences to the medium-term forecast. A shock to the non-interest current account would
change the 2013 external debt level to a substantially higher 33 percent of GDP from the
22 percent of the baseline, while a substantial real depreciation would also change the level to
33 percent. While higher than baseline levels, even these shock scenario levels are not unduly
large; they show an underlying downward trend by the end of the projection period and
remain well below the levels of debt in the early 2000s.

APPENDIX II
Risk-Adjusted Balance Sheets and Credit Risk: A Contingent Claims Approach
The Contingent Claims Approach (CCA) is a risk-adjusted balance sheet framework
where equity and risky debt of a firm or financial institution derive their value from
assets. In this framework, first proposed by Robert Merton, the total value of assets is equal
to the market value of equity and risky debt. Asset values are uncertain and in the future may
decline below the point where debt payments on scheduled dates cannot be made. Debt is
“risky” since there is a chance of default.
Equity and risky debt can be valued using finance techniques for valuing implicit call
and put options. The values of these options are derived from assets, uncertainty of assets,
and the promised debt payments. The value of risky debt is the equivalent default-free debt
minus expected loss due to default; the value of the equity is computed as the value of an
implicit call option; and the value of expected loss due to default can be modeled with an
implicit put option. These risk-adjusted balance sheet components can be calibrated by using
forward-looking information from the equity market and information from the balance sheet
to define the “distress” or “default barrier.” The implied market value of assets and implied
asset volatility are inferred from market and balance sheet information; credit risk indicators
such as default probabilities and credit spreads can then be calculated.
CCA-type models use a modified Merton framework to estimate expected default
frequencies (EDF) other risk indicators which are useful for vulnerability, credit risk
and financial stability analysis. The EDFs can be calculated daily for banks, other financial
institutions, and corporates which are traded on the stock exchange. To get an indication of
the trends in risk in a sector, the median EDF for the sector can be calculated (EDF of the
median institution). Also, the “75 quartile” can be calculated which means that 25 percent of
banks/firms in the sector have default probabilities above the level shown. EDFs for the
corporate sector can be used to project likely new NPLs.

VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement: After more than a decade when the baht was
effectively pegged closely to the U.S. dollar through a basket of currencies, the
exchange rate regime was changed on July 2, 1997. The exchange rate system is now a
floating exchange rate regime with occasional central bank intervention.
IX. Last Article IV Consultation: At the conclusion of the 2008 Article IV
consultations last May, Executive Directors noted that Thailand’s main policy
challenges were to rebuild investor confidence and support domestic demand. They
commended monetary and fiscal policy, while noting that early implementation of
public infrastructure projects would help stimulate the economy in the short-run while
simultaneously improving the prospects for medium-term growth. They welcomed the
completion of the Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA), and called on the
authorities to speedily implement the assessment’s recommendations.

Recent Technical Assistance:

FAD: The following TA missions took place: tax policy and structure; pension reform;
and establishment of Office of Macroeconomic-Fiscal Analysis, in 1998; tax policy in
July 2003; and fiscal risks, July 2008. A preparatory mission for a fiscal ROSC took
place in February 2005. A full fiscal ROSC mission took place in November 2008 and
left a draft report with the authorities for comments.
LEG: Staff has advised on the reform of bankruptcy and secured lending, including
visits in January, April (as part of a World Bank mission), and June 1998;
November 1999; February 2000. In February 2004, LEG provided technical assistance
(TA) in the areas of corporate insolvency and AML/CFT. In April 2006, a LEG mission
visited Thailand to provide TA relating to the country’s AML/CFT regime.
MCM: In 1997, MCM consultants participating in an APD mission focused on the
soundness of the financial sector, and two MCM missions provided assistance on
monetary instruments and monetary management under a floating exchange rate regime.
Also, an MCM mission with World Bank participation outlined a strategy for financial
sector reform, and MCM helped integrate this strategy into Thailand’s Fund-supported
program. Since 1997, MCM has provided support in financial sector restructuring with
several MCM missions and participation in APD review missions. A TA mission on the
operational framework for monetary policy took place in September 2003 and a mission
on AML/CFT in February 2004. In 2008 a mission investigated the possibility of setting
up a sovereign wealth fund.
Long-term resident advisors on banking supervision have been assigned to the BOT
since June 1998.

4
STA: Thailand has received a series of TA missions in recent years on national accounts
statistics (December 1996, October 1997, March and September–October 1998, March
and August 1999) mainly to improve the quality and timeliness of quarterly data.
Furthermore, missions on producer price indices (June–July 1999) and on balance of
payments statistics (September–October 1998, January 2002) reviewed the methodology
of several price indices and the balance of payments compilation system. There have
also been missions on the areas of banking statistics (April and June–July 1998, and
January–February 2001), data dissemination issues (July 1996, and April–May, June,
and November 1997), and Government Finance Statistics (March 2002 and
August 2003). A mission to assist preparation for a Data ROSC in 2004 took place in
April 2003. A data dissemination seminar was held in March 2005. A data ROSC was
completed in October 2005. A TA mission in BOP statistics took place in October 2006.
XI. Resident Representative: The IMF office in Thailand, which had been operating
since December 1, 1997, was closed in September 2003.

ANNEX II. THAILAND: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP6
(As of April 22, 2009)
Since 2003, the World Bank (WB) has had an innovative Partnership for Development
with Thailand. While provision of IBRD loans remains an option, this new partnership
focuses mainly on a two-way sharing of knowledge: the WB transmits successful Thai
development experiences to other member countries and brings relevant knowledge and
expertise from around the world made possible by the WB’s work in other countries and by
its global reach. This knowledge transfer to Thailand takes place under two modalities:
(i) diagnostic and monitoring work on Thailand; and (ii) implementation support in agreed
areas that are part of Thailand’s own national development agenda.
Diagnostic and monitoring work has included a regular series of economic (biannual),
social and environment monitors (annual) as part of WB’s monitoring as well as indepth analytical work and policy reports done jointly with Thailand. Among the former,
the latest Thailand Economic Monitor was issued in November 2007 and the latest Thailand
Social Monitor (focusing on the theme of youth), was released in January 2008. Among the
in-depth reports, the following have been recently published: the Investment Climate
Assessment Report (based on a survey of 1,300 firms) which provided a benchmark for
Thailand; the North East Economic Development Report, assessing growth and povertyreduction performance in the lagging region, as well as overall regional balance in the
country; the Access to Anti-retroviral Treatment (ART) for AIDS in Thailand, measuring the
impact of increased access; and the Migration in the Greater Mekong Subregion, measuring
the extent and economic impact of labor migration from neighboring countries into Thailand.
A report on the Development of a Knowledge Economy in Thailand was prepared as an input
into the Tenth National Economic and Social Development Plan (2007–11) and is expected
to be published sometime in end-January. Most of the diagnostic work is funded jointly by
the WB and the government.
Implementation support in selected areas of Thailand's national development agenda
comprise of Country Development Partnerships (CDPs) which have involved analysis,
policy-reform advice, and consensus-building with various stakeholders. There are
currently four ongoing CDPs––education, health, infrastructure, and environment and natural
resources. Several other CDPs—in the areas of financial and corporate governance; poverty
analysis and monitoring; governance and public sector reform; and social protection—have
more recently closed.
This implementation support is funded in part by WB's own administrative budget and
in part by donor grants, the latter of which is becoming increasingly scarce for
Thailand. The Trust Fund (TF) portfolio includes 11 government-executed TF operations
6

Based on input by World Bank staff.

6
with total commitment of $52.28 million, with disbursement to date of 64.3 percent. The TFs
are funded by ASEM donors, the government of Japan, and IBRD. There are eight WBexecuted TFs, six of which are funded by the government of Japan. The total commitment of
the WB-executed TFs is $2.6 million, with disbursement to date of 83.2 percent. The major
assistance is providing: (i) technical assistance (TA) to the Ozone Depleting Project
($45 million, with disbursement to date of 68.3 percent); and (ii) assistance to the four
southern provinces which were affected by the tsunami ($5 million, with disbursement to
date of 81.3 percent). The other TFs are providing TA to finance foreign and local
consultants for the work on needed technical analysis, workshops, dissemination, and
consensus-building under the Country Development Partnership Programs.
A review of the Bank/Thailand Country Partnership Strategy is nearing completion
and will help to form the basis for the partnership going forward. At the request of the
government, this is expected to not only include the two-way knowledge-sharing partnership,
but also support to Thailand in its work on the low-income Mekong countries. The
possibility of expanding the partnership to also include new financial support from the Bank
Group—both IBRD and IFC—will also be discussed.
The first WB loan was to Thailand in October 1950, and the country was an active
recipient of assistance until the late 1990s. In the past decade, the Bank’s financial
assistance has been limited and there have not been any new lending commitments
since 2005. All together, the WB has extended a total of 120 IBRD loans of approximately
$8.5 billion and six IDA credits of around $125 million to date. Currently, there is only one
ongoing IBRD loan (i.e., Highway Management Project) of $84.3 million, from which
$64.2 million has been disbursed.

The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has a diversified portfolio in Thailand of
approximately $201 million as of end-February 2008, focused on infrastructure,
financial markets, and chemicals. IFC’s program has evolved as Thailand’s private sector
has emerged from the crisis and re-established its access to international capital. In 2005, IFC
scaled down its Bangkok office accordingly.
IFC’s program now focuses on maximizing the developmental impact of the private and
financial sectors in Thailand in three areas: (i) reaching underserved segments;
(ii) addressing climate change; and (iii) private infrastructure provision. IFC also signed a
mandate letter with Standard Chartered to lead a proposed local currency bond in early 2008,
and will proceed on the basis of market conditions and discussions with the Thai authorities.
IFC is in discussions to support the Thai government in achieving its infrastructure
development program. The government’s program will require substantial capacity to
access private capital markets. IFC stands prepared to use its advisory or investment services
to help Thailand appropriately and competitively attract private capital to this program as
efficiently as possible.
IFC’s partnership approach to Thailand enlists the Thai private sector as a source of
expertise and capital in less developed countries. IFC is prepared to support Thai firms
pursue projects with high developmental impact in IDA countries, including in the Mekong
region. The nascent infrastructure, agribusiness and financial sectors can benefit greatly from
the participation of Thai institutions both in terms of capital as well as expertise.

Includes three private sector loans.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) pledged $1.2 billion at the Tokyo Meeting in
August 1997 to support the government of Thailand’s stabilization and structural adjustment
program, focused on the financial and social sectors. Lending by the ADB increased from
$330 million in 1996 to $550 million in 1997, $630 million in 1998 (excluding guarantee
operations of $950 million), and $364 million in 1999. From 2000 to 2002, no loans were
made to the government. The government prepaid $918 million of ADB’s pool-based loans
in 2002, $84 million in 2004, and $372 million in 2005. As of 31 December 2008, about
$60.29 million has been provided for more than 150 technical assistance projects covering a
wide range of sectors and activities.
One private sector loan, which involves the construction, ownership and operation of a
1,434MW coal-fired power plant in Map Ta Phut, Rayong Province, in the amount of
$40 million, was approved in 2003. Other private sector initiatives are at various stages of
development, reflecting a stronger focus on this sector.
The opening of the Thailand Resident Mission in 2005 marked a new chapter in the
country’s long-standing relationship with ADB. A Country Partnership Strategy 2007–11, a
five-year partnership framework between the Government and ADB at national and regional
levels, was completed in May 2007. The Country Operations Business Plan (2008-2010),
completed in 2008, reaffirmed that the core strategic areas of partnership in the CPS 2007–11

9
remain relevant and closely aligned with the Government policies and action plans to
promote long-term, sustainable economic growth and social development.
As middle-income country, Thailand recognizes the critical role of infrastructure for
sustainable economic growth and increased competitiveness. ADB is prepared to work
closely with the government to support its “megaprojects” infrastructure investment
program. Additionally, consistent with Thai government’s effort to develop the domestic
capital market, ADB issued a debut local currency bond of 4 billion baht ($102.5 million) in
May 2005 and another issuance of 6.5 billion baht ($180 million) in September 2006.
In 2005, seven technical assistance grants amounting to $3.35 million were approved. These
included three tsunami-related technical assistance operations to assist in post-tsunami
support activities. Infrastructure investment advisory assistance to Thailand’s Public Debt
Management Office was another technical assistance project aimed on assisting the
government in evaluating various mechanisms and options for integrating the urban mass rail
transport system in Bangkok. The remaining technical assistance activities address legal,
regulatory, public policy, and economic management issues and challenges.
In 2006, ADB approved 4 technical assistance projects in Thailand amounting to
$1,531 million. One of these was focused on strengthening the capacity of Thailand’s
Neighboring Countries Economic Development Cooperation Agency to become a lead
government donor agency while another supported the implementation of the Capital Market
Development Master Plan, comprising 4 components : regulatory structure, bond market and
securitization, taxation, and derivatives. ADB also continued providing the technical
assistance to the government on planned investments to expand the Bangkok mass rapid
transit system.
In 2007, ADB approved two new technical assistance projects in the amount of $1 million.
The first technical assistance is Preparing the Bangkok Mass Rapid Transit Integrated
Ticketing Project. The second technical assistance is Planning for the Sustainable
Development of Southern Thailand.
In 2008, ADB approved 3 technical assistance projects amounting to $2.77 million. The first
TA was the GMS Highway Expansion Project in which ADB financing will be used to widen
key sections of the East-West Economic Corridor in Thailand. Another three TAs included
an advisory and capacity building support to mainstream energy efficiency measures in Thai
municipalities, an introduction of e-learning networks among Thai primary schools in rural
areas, and a further development plan for the Thai capital market.

10
ANNEX IV. THAILAND: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance. The bulk of the information used for
surveillance is obtained directly from the Bank of Thailand (BOT). Key financial data are
reported daily, and the BOT publishes a monthly economic review, including basic data on
monetary aggregates, balance of payments, investment, manufacturing production, and
overall cash fiscal balance (all with a lag of one to two months). The BOT also posts a wide
range of economic data on its website (www.bot.or.th). In addition, the BOT has been
publishing quarterly inflation reports since July 2000. The country subscribes to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
The authorities responded to the 1997 crisis by greatly improving provision of economic
data, together with a commitment to increase data transparency. For example, data on the key
assets and liabilities of the BOT are now published regularly, including net forward
obligations. The BOT has also made considerable efforts to improve the reporting of
comprehensive data on the position of financial institutions (including nonperforming loans
and capital adequacy) and external debt positions, and continues to provide data to the Fund
to facilitate effective monitoring of the economy.
Real sector
The national accounts are broadly in line with the 1968 SNA, but are in the process of being
updated to the 1993 SNA, which is expected to be completed in 2008. The base year for the
constant price figures is 1988. The constant price data is being changed from the fixed base
year method to the chain volume measure (or CVM) method. The 1993 SNA and the
constant figures in the CVM method are expected to be completed in 2010.
Labor market data, including on wages, employment, and unemployment, are derived from
the quarterly Labor Force Survey.
Fiscal sector
The authorities provide data to the Fund consistent with the Government Finance Statistics
Manual, 2001 (GFSM 2001). Data are contributed to both the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook and the International Finance Statistics. However, public budget documents and
parliamentary submissions utilize different presentations under the cash basis. In this regard,
the GFS is considered as a supplementary data to the cash basis and utilized mainly for crosscountry analysis.
The authorities have also improved data dissemination on Ministry of Finance (MOF)
website. A distinction between expense and the net acquisition of nonfinancial assets is not
available on a sub-annual basis since October 2004. However, MOF is in the process of
compiling monthly data, which is expected to be published on the website starting FY2008

11
by end-September 2009. It will be half year data report of FY2009. In addition, the MOF is
also scheduled to compile previous years’ data (FY2005−07).
Monetary sector
The concepts, definitions, classification of financial instruments, and sectorization of
institutional units of monetary and financial statistics (MFS) conform to the methodology of
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Coverage of monetary statistics
comprises all depository corporations, including money market mutual funds and savings
cooperatives. Due to the growing importance of insurance corporations, pension funds, and
other financial intermediaries, an MFS mission was conducted during October 13−24, 2008
to review the work by the BOT in expanding the coverage to include other financial
corporations (OFCs). The BOT has completed the compilation of the OFCs and submitted to
the IMF. The OFCs data of Thailand is scheduled to be published in the March 2009 issue of
IFS and IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics.
External sector
While the methodology for compiling balance of payments data remains adequate, a
number of weaknesses in the data collection system need to be addressed in order to fully
capture developments following the relaxation of the foreign exchange controls. These
include: (i) incomplete coverage of transactions by nonresidents in Thailand and by Thai
residents abroad (other than banks) which mostly affect data on trade in services; (ii) a lack
of data on noncash activity, such as reinvested earnings; and, more generally, (iii) a
deterioration in the quality of data reported under the exchange control system, due to the
sharply increased scale of transactions, and partly due to exchange control liberalization and
simplified data reporting requirements. An STA mission in October 2006 found that the
authorities are addressing these weaknesses and reported progress in data sources and
compilation of items in the services account. Following the mission’s recommendation, the
authorities have adopted a BOP enhancement roadmap and some identified gaps have been
filled (compilation of reinvested earnings data, dissemination of revision policy, and studies
on capturing major service transactions through survey or administrative records).
Official reserves and foreign currency liquidity data are published in the international
reserves template under the SDDS. The BOT website is updated at the end of each month
with data conforming to template standards. Data on external debt and debt service have
significantly improved since the introduction of a quarterly survey of private nonbank
external debt. However, a few weaknesses regarding coverage remain; for example, the
breakdown of debt service along the lines of external debt stocks would be useful.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Thailand
May 18, 2009
The following information provides an update on recent developments and does not alter the
thrust of the staff appraisal.
Recent indicators paint a mixed picture for economic activity. A variety of indicators
point to continued weak activity in the first quarter of 2009. Consumer and investor
confidence remain at low levels; imports declined substantially in 2009Q1; revenue
collections continue to be lower than budget projections; and private sector credit growth
slowed further in March 2009 (y/y basis). With the decline in imports concentrated in raw
materials and intermediate goods, export growth is likely to remain weak. On the other hand,
indices of manufacturing production and capacity utilization edged up in March compared to
recent months, and the stock market has rebounded since end-2008 in line with the region on
the back of tentative positive news about the global economy.
The authorities announced in May further information on their investment program
for FY 2010−12. The total investment is now projected at B 1.43 trillion (compared to
B 1.56 trillion expected originally and reported in the staff report). This is about 16 percent
of 2009 GDP. The projects will be concentrated on infrastructure, irrigation, energy, health
care, education, telecommunications, and tourism. These investments are expected to be
financed through annual budgets (40 percent), borrowing (44 percent), and the remainder
financing is to come from joint venture funds with the private sector, securitization and other
sources.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 5, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation
with Thailand
On May 18, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Thailand.1
Background
Thailand has been in an investment slump since 2006. Political turmoil has led to reduced
business confidence and slow private investment growth. The main engine of growth for the
economy has been the export sector.
However, since the fourth quarter of 2008, exports have contracted dramatically due to the
global recession, thereby removing the only prop of growth. Exports fell by about 18½ percent in
Q4 on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis. Manufacturing output contracted by
11 percent, thus bringing the level of manufacturing output to its lowest level since late 2005.
GDP fell by about 6 percent, thereby wiping out much of the good growth performance of the
first three quarters, and leaving growth for the year at 2½ percent. Indices of economic activity
and business and consumer confidence remain depressed in 2009.
After rising on the back of oil and commodity prices in the first half of 2008, inflation has plunged
sharply. Headline inflation (period average) was 5½ percent in 2008, while core inflation was
2½ percent, both representing substantial increases from the previous year. But since July,
inflation has fallen in line with oil prices, with headline inflation in negative territory for the first
three months of 2009. The abatement of price pressures has allowed the Bank of Thailand
(BOT) to use monetary policy to aggressively support demand. Since December 2008, the
policy rate has been reduced by a cumulative 250 basis points, and now stands at 1¼ percent.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

The authorities have focused on fiscal measures to stimulate the economy since the second
half of 2008. The 2008/09 (October-September) budget—passed under the old government last
year—incorporated a mix of expenditure and tax measures to widen the small fiscal deficit. With
the subsequent rapid deterioration of demand conditions, the new government is implementing
a supplementary budget incorporating B 100 billion (1 percent of GDP) of additional spending,
including fast-disbursing direct income transfers, subsidies for transport and utility services, and
higher pensions. Overall, the central government is expected to shift from a deficit of ½ percent
of GDP in 2007/08 to a deficit of 4½ percent in 2008/09, delivering a cyclically-adjusted fiscal
stimulus of about 2½ percent.
The 2008 current account was close to balance, with the strong export and import performance
of the earlier part of the year both being reversed in Q4. Meanwhile, with banks reducing their
overseas exposure—switching from foreign assets to domestic lending and exporters’ increased
hedging against exchange rate risk—the capital account registered a surplus despite slowing
foreign direct investment (FDI) and negative portfolio inflows. International reserves rose to a
healthy US$111 billion—equivalent to 9 months of imports—by end-2008. The baht appreciated
against the U.S. dollar in the first quarter of 2008, when capital controls were removed, but has
subsequently fallen in line with regional currencies.
The Thai banking and corporate sectors entered the global crisis in relatively robust health. Thai
banks are well capitalized, non-performing loans (NPLs) have been falling for several years
from the high levels reached during the Asian crisis, and direct exposure to the U.S. mortgage
market and structured products is low. The corporate sector has seen falling leverage and high
profitability in the last few years. Nonetheless, the financial crisis will likely result in stresses to
both sectors. Banks would see a rise in NPLs, while corporates—especially small and mediumsized enterprises—may see a tightening of credit conditions in addition to falling demand. The
government has responded with a scheme to guarantee loans to small- and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), with risks shared between the banks and the government.
The output contraction in 2009 could be limited to about 3 percent provided that political stability
is maintained and the authorities’ fiscal stimulus speedily and efficiently implemented. Over the
medium term, growth is expected to recover as the global economy turns around and public
infrastructure spending crowds-in private investment.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors observed that Thailand’s economic growth had slowed sharply last year, on
account of the unsettled political situation and the spillovers from the global recession. With a
sharp fall in exports and continued sluggish domestic demand, real GDP is projected to contract
in 2009—the first time since the Asian crisis—and the near-term outlook is subject to
considerable downside risks. Nevertheless, economic fundamentals remain strong,
underpinned by a track record of prudent macroeconomic policies and robust financial
institutions. Bringing the economy back on a sustained high growth path will, however, require
decisive implementation of the policy measures to support domestic demand, and a swift
restoration of investor and consumer confidence through a normalization of the political
situation.

3
Directors welcomed the authorities’ fiscal stimulus plans, and underscored that timely and
efficient implementation of these plans is critical at the current juncture. They considered it
important that the budgeted transfers and subsidies target the most needed and vulnerable
groups, and that automatic stabilizers be allowed to operate fully. An early start of the three year
public investment program to support demand beyond 2009 would help kick-start public
infrastructure projects that are vital to medium-term growth.
Directors considered that, given the available fiscal space, the increases in deficits and public
debt are appropriate from a countercyclical perspective and would decline over the medium
term as growth picks up. They supported the authorities’ intention to temporarily raise the
mandatory ceilings on government borrowings in order to finance the deficits under current
circumstances, noting that the temporary nature of the fiscal stimulus measures is an indication
of the authorities’ continued fiscal discipline.
Directors welcomed recent aggressive cuts in the policy interest rate. While there remains room
for a further easing of monetary policy, Directors noted the already ample liquidity in the banking
system and the currently impaired credit transmission mechanism. Accordingly, Directors
supported the authorities’ intention to assess the economic conditions and the effectiveness of
recent rate reductions before deciding on further action. The time bound plans to guarantee
credit for small- and medium-sized enterprises and exporters should help encourage banks to
extend new loans to the sectors hardest hit by banks’ elevated risk aversion, enabling them to
continue to support employment and domestic demand.
Directors noted that the banking sector remains resilient, with limited exposure to subprimerelated and structured products. The strong initial positions of banks and strengthened
supervision by the Bank of Thailand have helped the sector weather the global financial turmoil.
Nevertheless, the slowing economy and a likely deterioration in banks’ asset quality call for
continued close supervision, particularly of state-owned specialized financial institutions.
Directors encouraged the authorities to take further steps to implement the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations fully.
Directors welcomed the Bank of Thailand’s continued commitment to a flexible exchange rate
system. They noted the staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate broadly reflects
fundamentals.

Statement by Duangmanee Vongpradhip, Executive Director for Thailand
and Pariwat Kanithasen, Advisor to Executive Director
May 18, 2009
1.
On behalf of the Thai authorities, we would like to express our appreciation to the
Mission team for the productive engagement during the 2009 Article IV Consultation. The
candid discussions on economic and financial developments as well as on policy direction
were helpful for both sides. Thailand is confronting challenges arising not only from the
spillovers of the global financial and economic turmoil like many other countries, but also
from domestic political problems. In light of these challenges, the Thai authorities have acted
swiftly and decisively to restore confidence as well as to support the economy by shoring up
domestic demand. Sound economic fundamentals, including fiscal prudence in previous
periods and internal price stability, have allowed a counter-cyclical expansion of fiscal policy
and an aggressive easing of monetary policy to take place without posing longer term risks.
Financial institutions have entered the crisis on solid footing, and measures have been taken
so that financial institutions could continue to perform their intermediary roles.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
2.
Having registered favorable growth in the first three quarters of 2008, the Thai
economy contracted significantly by 4.3 percent year-on-year in the last quarter, due to the
sharp declines in net exports as well as private investment. Nevertheless, the expansion in
private and public consumption helped cushion against the economic slowdown. Internal and
external stability have remained sound, as inflationary pressures—which peaked in mid2008—have subsided. Meanwhile, the current account registered a surplus, and the
international reserves position remained at a high and comfortable level.
3.
In 2009, with the protracted impact from the domestic political situation, coupled
with the likelihood of a prolonged global recession, the Thai economy is expected to contract
substantially. Domestic political unrest, which has already had an adverse effect on the
confidence of investors, consumers and tourists, can lead to a significant contraction in
private demand. In response, public spending through large fiscal stimulus packages is
expected to help support overall demand. On the external front, the sharp global economic
downturn will continue to result in a marked contraction in exports. Meanwhile, imports—
including imports of raw materials for production—also contracted substantially in line with
the decline in the demand for exports and private expenditure. Since imports were projected
to fall at a sharper rate than exports, the authorities viewed that the current account would
register a large surplus in 2009.
4.
Despite the risks to the economy, extremely accommodative fiscal and monetary
policies would limit the downturn this year and would bring the economy back to a sustained
growth trajectory. For 2009, the authorities expect that the Thai economy to contract within
the range of 1.5 to 3.5 percent, mainly as a result of the contraction in private domestic
demand. Inflationary pressures continue to remain muted. Headline inflation is projected to
lie between -1.0 to 0.5 percent, while core inflation is expected to lie at the bottom of the
target range, between 0.0 to 1.0 percent.

2
Fiscal Policy
5.
Expansionary fiscal policy is expected to play a key role in providing an initial boost
to jump-start the economic recovery as well as in shoring up confidence. Thailand has always
had a tradition of maintaining high fiscal discipline—this has provided the Thai economy
with ample space to conduct expansionary fiscal policy at a time when it is needed most. Yet
we also realize that for any stimulus, however large, to be effective, timely and efficient
implementation is essential.
6.
As a result, the Thai government launched the first fiscal stimulus package of 117
billion baht promptly in January 2009 to restore confidence and promote private
consumption. Specifically, this package has targeted vulnerable groups, protecting them from
the immediate repercussions of the crisis. Following the successful execution of the first
package, a second fiscal stimulus package for 2009-2012, amounting to 1.43 trillion baht,
was launched in May 2009. This package is aimed to boost growth through much-needed
infrastructure investment, and this should help create employment, and enhance the private
sector’s competitiveness in the long run.
7.
It is worth noting that these extraordinary times have required fiscal stimulus
measures of extraordinary magnitudes, inevitably requiring flexibility of fiscal rules that
were set for normal business cycles. Taking the stimulus packages into consideration, the
ratio of public debt to GDP, which currently stands at around 40 percent, could peak at
60 percent in 2013, thus temporarily exceeding the 50 percent benchmark (self-imposed by a
previous Cabinet). It should be highlighted here that even for this extraordinary case, public
debt would remain sustainable. Going forward, however, this ratio is expected to decline in
line with the path of economic recovery. Furthermore, once the situation returns to normalcy
and the private sector resumes its role in driving the economy, Thailand would continue its
stand in maintaining fiscal discipline. In this connection, we are also pleased to learn of the
positive assessments of Thailand’s fiscal framework in the recent Fiscal Transparency
Module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC).
Monetary Policy
8.
Monetary policy has been eased aggressively to help support the economy against
negative shocks as inflationary pressures have subsided. The front-loading of policy interest
rate cuts at unprecedented scales and speeds has reflected the Bank of Thailand’s serious
commitment to support the economy through reducing the cost of borrowing and restoring
weakened confidence of both investors and consumers. Overall, since December 2008, the
Monetary Policy Committee lowered the policy interest rate in the four consecutive meetings
by a total of 250 basis points from 3.75 to 1.25 percent per annum.
9.
The policy interest rate is at its lowest level since the Inflation Targeting (IT) regime
has been implemented in Thailand in May 2000. In this light, any further interest rate cuts
will hinge upon a comprehensive assessment of the economic conditions and prospects going
forward, given that accommodative monetary policy will have a limited impact in stimulating
growth as long as domestic demand remains weak. At the same time, nominal deposit rates

3
have recorded historically low levels; consequently, any adverse effects on depositors will
also need to be considered carefully.
10.
Under the current financial environment, however, the transmission mechanism of
monetary policy has been impaired, as reflected in increased risk premiums—resulting in a
higher effective cost of borrowing. As a result, the effects of highly accommodative
monetary policy have not been fully transmitted into market interest rates. While larger
corporates continue to be able to secure financing, some vulnerable sectors, especially small
and medium-sized businesses, are more prone to distress. In this regard, the provision of
government-sponsored credit guarantees, such as through the Small Business Credit
Guarantee Corporation, should help encourage banks to extend new loans, given the previous
tightening of lending standards due to rising credit concerns. The scheme is expected to
alleviate firms’ liquidity conditions and enable them to continue with their operations,
helping to cushion employment and prevent further worsening of domestic demand.
Exchange Rate Developments
11.
On exchange rate policy, the Bank of Thailand will maintain the principle of a
managed floating exchange rate system, allowing the exchange rate to reflect economic
fundamentals. The policy response is to curb excess volatility on exchange rate movements
and to keep the currency’s movements in line with regional peers. We believe that any
market interference to keep exchange rate away from the level indicated by fundamentals can
be costly and unsustainable in the longer term.
12.
The Thai baht reversed from an appreciation trend from the first quarter of 2008 to a
depreciation trend through the rest of 2008, resulting from heightened risk aversion of deleveraging by foreign investors as the global financial crisis intensified. In the first quarter of
2009, the baht remained stable on average as demand and supply of foreign exchange were in
balance. However, compared to regional peers, the baht—in Nominal Effective Exchange
Rate (NEER) terms—appreciated as Thailand faces relatively smaller capital outflows
compared to regional peers, as well as a strong current account surplus. Given the risk from
investors' behavior in the past decade, the authorities are aware of the risks of fluctuations in
capital flows. Going forward, the central bank will continue to ensure that the baht moves in
an orderly fashion in line with regional currencies.
Financial Sector Developments
13.
Thai financial institutions’ positions are solid, given low levels of direct exposure to
toxic assets, low reliance on global liquidity as a source of funds, and their strong capital
base. Although they faced some spillovers from the global turmoil, Thai financial institutions
have remained resilient and in good health as a result of the substantive reforms undertaken
over the past decade since the 1997 financial crisis.
14.
The Basel II framework has been implemented since the end of last year, with all
banks continuing to maintain their capital in accordance to requirements under Pillar 1.
Meanwhile, the disclosure under Pillar 3 will be effective in June this year and the guideline
for Pillar 2 will be issued to all banks in the near future. Furthermore, rigorous risk

4
assessments and stress tests of financial institutions have been conducted, whereby macroprudential linkages have played a major role. As a result, banks’ capital have exceeded the
required ratios, providing a valuable cushion for difficult times such as these. In addition,
regular dialogues between financial institutions and the regulators have helped to convey
policy directions from the authorities to the banks on one hand, as well as banks’ concerns to
the authorities on the other.
15.
Nonetheless, the likelihood of a deterioration in asset quality means that NPLs are
bound to rise as the economy slows down. The latest data indicate that net NPLs have only
increased slightly from 2.9 percent at the end of 2008 to 3.1 percent in the first quarter of
2009, yet a far cry from levels seen during the crisis. At the same time, banks themselves
have anticipated this spillover and have acted preemptively through various measures. For
example, since the onset of global turmoil, banks have acted early in assisting customers with
debt rescheduling so as to ward off pressures on asset quality and on NPLs, which have
eventually forestalled a sharp rise in NPLs.
Conclusion
16.
The Thai authorities have been proactive in the implementation of monetary and
fiscal measures to provide maximum support to the weakening economy in the face of both
domestic and external challenges. We are pleased that we share similar views with the staff
with regard to the handling of the crisis and our policies going forward, recognizing that risks
remain.
17.
In the near term, the Thai economy is expected to face a contraction, mainly due to
the spillover from external shocks as well as domestic political uncertainties. Hence a speedy
restoration of market confidence is needed. We would like to emphasize that despite these
shocks, Thailand’s economic fundamentals remain strong, supported by a track record of
strong macroeconomic policies, including fiscal prudence, a forward-looking monetary
policy and robust financial institutions. Furthermore, recent strides in regional financing
arrangements, such as the recently concluded Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization,
provides an additional cushion against external shocks.
18.
Going forward, a recovery in the global economy and a stabilization in the political
situation will help to support Thailand’s medium term economic outlook. Therefore, with
strong commitments from the Thai authorities in the implementation of macroeconomic
policies, the Thai economy is expected to return to a potential growth of 5-6 percent over the
medium term.
19.
Finally, it remains for the authorities to thank not only the Mission team for their
effort and hard work on this Article IV consultation, but also all staff members involved in
the Fiscal Transparency ROSC assessment as well as technical assistance missions to
Thailand.
