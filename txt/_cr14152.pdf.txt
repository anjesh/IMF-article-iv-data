STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION, THIRD
AND FOURTH REVIEWS UNDER THE STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT,
REQUEST FOR WAIVERS OF NONOBSERVANCE OF PERFORMANCE
CRITERION AND APPLICABILITY OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Jordan is grappling with strong headwinds. It is facing a political transition even while the
Syria crisis is stretching Jordan’s social fabrics. At the same time, gas inflows from Egypt
continue to fluctuate, putting pressure on both the external and fiscal accounts.
Policies were appropriately adjusted to exogenous shocks. During 2012, they were focused
on crisis management. After confidence had come back at year-end, they turned toward
medium-term consolidation anchored in a bold subsidy reform. Fiscal consolidation needs to
continue and more emphasis is needed on reforms to address chronically high unemployment.
Aimed at protecting external stability and reducing vulnerabilities, the main Article IV
recommendations are to: (1) maintain the momentum on fiscal and public utility reforms to
reduce the still rising debt, while making policies more equitable and growth-friendly;
(2) preserve reserve buffers in a time of high uncertainties while further enhancing the
resilience of the financial sector; and (3) foster inclusive growth and job creation by generating
a business environment more conducive to investment; revisiting public sector hiring and
compensation while equipping new entrants with private sector skills and addressing the
constraints to female labor market participation; and enhancing the quality of institutions.
The program is broadly on track and, looking forward, will focus on deep tax reform. All
end-2013 targets were met. The central government is expected to meet its end-March 2014
target, but the combined public sector deficit (of the central government and the electricity
company NEPCO) will be missed because of temporary shortfalls in gas delivery from Egypt.
International reserves have continued to over-perform through March. The next reviews will
focus on tax reform to recoup revenue losses incurred in recent years, which reflected tax
policy choices, weak tax administration, declining nontax revenue, and also a slow economy.
Jordan needs more grants to manage high risks. The main risks pertain to the Syria conflict
becoming deeper and more protracted and shortfalls in gas from Egypt. Jordan is also
susceptible to global spillovers, including from higher U.S. interest rates, while domestic risks
are non-negligible with resistance to reforms increasing. Though shocks could be absorbed,
debt would further increase and growth could suffer. Additional grants now could help ease
macroeconomic pressures, generate growth, and create employment, but eventually Jordan
will have to prepare for an exit from external aid.
The completion of the reviews makes available SDR170.5 million (about $258 million).

BACKGROUND
A. Strong Headwinds
A Difficult Environment
1.
Jordan faces issues of a political transition. A new election law paved the way to
parliamentary elections in January 2013, which were peaceful though boycotted by the Muslim
Brotherhood which viewed the changes as too incremental. Public protests have subsided in the
last year, but the relationship between parliament and government has become more
contentious and the opposition more vocal, including on corruption and political rights.
2.
Regional instability deeply affected the country. While slowing since mid-2013, the
number of officially registered Syrian refugees has increased steadily over the last two years,
amounting now to about 9 percent of Jordan’s population. In addition to macroeconomic
implications (Box 1), this has triggered changes in the social landscape and the provision of
public services has suffered. It could also worsen the already poor unemployment and poverty
situation. Moreover, gas inflows from Egypt have repeatedly come to a halt, most recently at
end-January, owing to sabotages of the pipeline.
3.
Policies were appropriately adjusted to cope with shocks. During 2012, they were
focused on crisis management and, after confidence had come back at year-end, turned toward
medium-term consolidation. The authorities have followed the recommendations of the 2012
Article IV in the context of the stand-by arrangement, which was approved on August 3, 2012,
though progress on the structural front has been slow.

Economy Slowly Picking Up
4.
Economic activity has been gradually recovering. Following a period of strong
growth during 2000–09 (averaging about 6½ percent), growth dropped sharply to 2.3 percent in
2010, largely due to the global downturn. Since then, it has picked up marginally to 2.8 percent
year-on-year through September 2013. In the last two years, measured growth was hurt by
shocks, including the Syria conflict (which, together with the losses of the public electricity
company NEPCO, added some 5–6 percent of GDP to the fiscal and external accounts in each of
2012 and 2013, requiring significant policy tightening). The ensuing unavoidable fiscal
adjustment and a sharp contraction in mining (from industrial action in 2012 and difficulties in
renegotiating contracts following the break-up of the international fertilizer cartel in mid-2013)
have also played a role. Services (especially communication and finance) and construction have
been the drivers of growth.

7.
The current account deficit has started to narrow. It peaked in 2012, reflecting a
number of factors, including higher energy prices coupled with disruptions to the flow of natural
gas from Egypt, lower grants, and poorer export performance brought about by lower potash
prices and strikes. While mining difficulties persisted and pressures on non-energy imports

year-end and have showed so far a limited response to the spike in volatility in emerging
markets (EMs). The Amman Stock Exchange was stable until a steep drop in mid-2013, mainly in
mining sector shares; since then, the market recovered to pre-2012 levels. At the same time,
banks’ financial soundness indicators (FSIs) have largely reversed the deterioration that occurred
in 2008–09 (see Table 5).

Policies Focused on Fiscal Consolidation
9.
There was a turn-around in fiscal policies. Concerns about social tensions at the
beginning of 2012 and expectations that gas from Egypt would resume temporarily put on hold
plans for consolidation. But starting in May 2012, the authorities have been taking measures with
a net reduction in the combined primary central government deficit and NEPCO losses of over
5 percent of GDP within two years. The most notable measure was a bold reform of general
subsidies. In November 2012, the authorities liberalized fuel pump prices while introducing cash
transfers to 70 percent of the population. Electricity tariffs for selected economic sectors and rich
households have been increased three times since May 2012, anchored in a strategy to return
NEPCO to cost recovery over the medium term.1 There were also tax and nontax measures, which
recouped some of the revenue loss of 9 percent of GDP experienced during 2007–11.
10.
The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) complemented the fiscal efforts. Because it took
time to formulate an appropriate fiscal response, temporary losses in confidence in 2012 resulted
in a surge in deposit dollarization and pressures on reserves, which reached a low of $5.3 billion
(64 percent of the Fund’s reserve adequacy metric) at end-2012. The CBJ responded by hiking
policy rates three times that year. Since then, dollarization has been on a downward trend—from
25 percent in November/December 2012 to 19 percent by end-March 2014. This, along with a
sizable influx of GCC grants and the issuance of dollar-denominated domestic bonds and a
U.S.-guaranteed Eurobond, helped rebuild reserves to $11.5 billion at end-2013 (or 133 percent of
the reserve adequacy metric). Starting in mid-2013, the CBJ’s focus shifted to stimulating economic
activity by reducing policy rates (three times in August and October 2013 and January 2014) by a
total of 75 bps. Private sector credit growth, which slowed in 2012, has recently picked up.

B. Program Implementation
11.

The program is broadly on track.

Central government. The end-December 2013 performance criterion (PC) on the central
government primary deficit was met and it is estimated that the central government
remained on-track through end-March 2014.2

Electricity tariffs are set on an ad-hoc basis. Specific increases for 2015-17 by sector have been announced (i.e.,
they would not change with fluctuations in the fuel mix and prices).

requesting waivers of applicability for the PCs on the central government and on net international reserves since:

JORDAN



Energy. NEPCO’s losses were lower than programmed at end-2013 reflecting a
resumption in gas flows from Egypt, but will exceed the target for end-March
because of renewed gas shortfalls. As a result, the end-March PC on the combined
government-NEPCO deficit is expected to be missed, but this should be recouped in the
second half of the year through corrective action.3



Monetary. Net international reserves (NIR) are expected to exceed the end-March PC by
a large margin and the continuous PC on the accumulation of external arrears has been
met.

12.
Structural performance has somewhat improved. All six benchmarks set for the last
quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014 have been met, including two with a delay (the
implementation of measures to bring the 2014 budget in line with program understandings, and
the establishment of a commitment control system). The licensing of the credit bureau (June 2013
benchmark) is still pending because the license application was incomplete, but is expected to be
completed soon. Notable is good progress in utility reform with the strong implementation of the
water and energy strategies.

POLICY DISCUSSION—SAFEGUARDING EXTERNAL
STABILITY WHILE MANAGING RISKS
13.
The macroeconomic framework remains largely unchanged. It assumes that the
recent shocks are temporary. In particular, it is assumed that the Syria crisis will taper off starting
in 2016 with refugees gradually returning and trade links gradually normalizing. Gas from Egypt
is projected to reach on average 100 million cubic feet per day (allowing for temporary
disruptions), while the energy mix would improve over the medium term and mining exports
recover starting in 2014 as the international fertilizer market normalizes and strikes are over.


Growth is projected to increase, to 3½ percent in 2014, and to its estimated potential of
4½ percent in the medium term. While agriculture could suffer from the drought in early
2014, this should be more than offset by public infrastructure investments, which have a
large growth multiplier.4 If supported by an acceleration in product and labor market
reforms, potential growth and the employment responsiveness to growth could improve,
thereby reducing chronically high unemployment.



Inflation is expected to decline to about 2½ percent at end-2014, and 2 percent in the
medium term, aided by an expected moderation in international food and fuel prices.

(i) the final data to assess performance for end-March are not yet available; and (ii) there is no clear evidence
suggesting that the PC might not be observed.

A waiver of nonobservance is requested.



The current account deficit (including grants) would improve to about 4½ percent of GDP
over the medium term, mostly reflecting the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facility becoming
operational in mid-2015, which will substantially reduce the energy import bill.



The adjustment in fiscal and energy policies is consistent with a gradual reduction of the
combined central government’s primary deficit and NEPCO’s losses from more than
8 percent of GDP in 2013 to ½ percent of GDP over the medium term. This path remains
unchanged from the second review and accommodates the higher fiscal costs from the
Syrian refugees. The pace of adjustment is expected to create headwinds to growth, but
these should be manageable, given shifts in the budget toward investment and because
some of the improvement is coming from supply side effects.

capital flows, and substantial grants.
Gross usable reserves are projected
to remain at comfortable levels, around 130 percent of the reserve adequacy metric. Tourism-based
price measures remain competitive and non-traditional exports have risen on average over
7 percent in the past five years. Although most external shocks are expected to be temporary,
Jordan will remain vulnerable given its geographical location and economic structure and until fiscal
and energy sector imbalances are addressed (the exchange rate assessment assumes that they will
be). Also, the country will eventually have to prepare for an exit from external aid.
15.
Risks remain elevated. The most prominent risks pertain to the Syria conflict becoming
deeper and more protracted (see Box 1 on the transmission channels) as well as shortfalls in gas
from Egypt—a complete stop of gas flows would create substantial fiscal and current account
gaps. Moreover, Jordan is susceptible to global spillovers, in particular from higher U.S. interest
rates, which could drive up domestic lending rates and depress growth. Also, a slowdown in EMs
could further reduce the prices of phosphate and fertilizers, Jordan’s traditional main exports
(Box 3), and adversely affect the current account. More generally, though, a protracted reduction

in commodity prices would likely have a positive impact on the current account.5 Domestic risks
remain non-negligible with resistance to reform beginning to increase, making a strong case for
more outreach and developing contingencies. Indeed, a loss in domestic confidence may quickly
reverse the de-dollarization trend, lead to outflows, and reignite pressures on reserves.
16.
To protect external stability and reduce vulnerabilities while improving Jordan’s
labor market outcomes, the Article IV consultation focused on the following themes:


Maintaining the momentum in fiscal and public utility reforms to return debt to a
downward trend with a view toward more equity and growth.



Preserving reserve buffers in a time of high uncertainties and further improving the
resilience of the financial sector.



Addressing long-standing obstacles to growth toward more inclusion, more
transparency, and more jobs.

A. Policy Theme 1—Maintaining the Momentum on Fiscal Reforms
17.
Placing public debt on a downward trend requires further consolidation (¶9).6 The
new Market Access Country Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) shows results consistent with the
DSA presented in the staff report for the second review. Ensuring public debt sustainability will
require a very significant net fiscal adjustment by both the central government and NEPCO.
Assuming a consolidated fiscal adjustment of about 9 percent of GDP during 2015–18 (this
includes an adjustment of one percent of GDP of the water authority of Jordan (WAJ)), public debt
would continue to increase until 2015 (to 91 percent of GDP) before declining. Confidence intervals
for debt do not show unsustainable upward trajectories under a variety of shocks. While the
analysis points to vulnerabilities with debt structure and financing needs, financing available
from Jordan’s international partners under the program addresses these in the near term. Staff
welcomed plans to further lengthen the maturity profile of domestic debt, which will reduce
roll-over risks and recommended to regularly access the domestic market rather than depending
on the availability of external financing.
18.
Both the central government and the utilities need to go through major
transformations. Some automatic adjustment is expected when refugees return to Syria (up to
1.4 percent of GDP per year; Box 1), arrears of the health funds are fully repaid (0.3 percent of
GDP each year over three years), and possibly from a reduction in cash transfers (which are
supposed to be disbursed only when the oil price is above $100 per barrel). Moreover, the
medium-term strategies for NEPCO and the water authorities—if implemented as planned—will
return the utilities to cost recovery by 2017 and 2019, respectively, yielding more than half of the
5

The 2012 Article IV found that, historically, the impact of an increase in oil prices has been positive, due to the
current account linkages to oil exporting countries. This relationship is likely reversed now, as Jordan is much
more reliant on fuel imports.

adjustment. What has been lacking so far is a well-defined adjustment strategy for the central
government to generate measures of 2½–4 percent of GDP from 2015 onward (depending on
when and how quickly Syrian refugees return). Staff highlighted the advantage of setting in train
most of the adjustment upfront to help anchor expectations.

19.
The burden of fiscal consolidation should be distributed equitably. Adjustment in the
last years concentrated on reducing subsidies and affected mostly banks, hotels,
telecommunication, rich households, and non-Jordanians. Staff noted the need for making the
adjustment more broad-based to minimize distortions and maintain competitiveness. It reiterated
that deep income tax reform will need to play a prominent role in any credible medium-term fiscal
consolidation strategy. This could reverse the revenue loss in recent years. Losses of 5½ percent of
GDP in tax revenue during 2007–11 reflected to some extent tax policy choices—an increase in
incentives and a revision in the income tax law costing the budget some 2 percent of GDP and
regular tax amnesties possibly further eroding the tax base. Revenue also suffered from a weaker
economy and a reduction in tariffs from trade arrangements. Nontax revenue declined as well by
about 3½ percent of GDP, mostly related to real estate transactions and profits from public
enterprises (each amounting to about one percent of GDP).

Central Government
20.
The 2014 budget aims to strike a balance between consolidation and growth
(¶s13–15). The primary deficit would decline to 4.5 percent of GDP. While this is only 0.2 percent
of GDP tighter than the 2013 outcome, capital spending will accelerate by almost one percent of

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JORDAN

GDP and spending on health by 0.7 percent of GDP. These increased outlays would be financed by
revenue measures, and, to a lesser extent, by savings on nonessential current spending.


Both tax and nontax revenue will increase.7 Cabinet has approved a package of
measures with an annual revenue impact of one percent of GDP, about half of which is
already effective with the remainder to become effective shortly. The package relies
heavily on fee increases. Staff welcomed these efforts, but cautioned that revenue might
come in lower than expected (for instance, imposing customs fees might not be
consistent with some bilateral trade agreements). To help limit risks, the pending
measures should be implemented as soon as possible. Looking beyond 2014, staff felt
that the scope for further raising fees was limited.



Expenditure measures are relatively limited. Central government wage increases have
been curbed to 2 percent. However, the wage bill would stay constant as a share of GDP,
because of the need to hire new doctors and also a re-classification of wages, which had
in previous budgets been recorded under capital spending. Staff welcomed savings from
tightening the eligibility criteria for the cash transfers. It noted that the acceleration in
capital spending in the last quarter of 2013 bodes well for implementing the full
investment program in 2014. Staff also urged the authorities to front-load the transfers
to the health funds to ensure early arrears clearance.

Some of the increase reflects delayed revenue payments of 0.3 percent of GDP due in 2013 (part of this revenue
was already received in the first quarter of 2014). Staff regretted these delays and urged the authorities to work
closely with payees to prevent a repeat.

21.

The medium-term fiscal strategy needs to be anchored in deep tax reform.



Tax reform (¶16–17). Reform should rest on two main pillars, specifically the new
income tax law and a reduction in tax incentives, which could collectively generate up to
2.5 percent of GDP. At the same time, stronger tax administration could improve
compliance and help reduce tax arrears, contributing up to 0.5 percent of GDP (see
paragraph 43). The income tax law at parliament is expected to raise revenue by
0.7 percent of GDP. Staff highlighted that there was scope to go much further, and
pointed to the income tax threshold, which is by far the highest in the region (only about
some 3 percent of the population is currently paying income taxes). A published report
on existing tax incentives shows that foregone general sales tax revenue amounted to
about 2 percent of GDP in 2012. Staff encouraged the authorities to streamline such
incentives, including by eliminating in particular the exemptions on services and curbing
incentives provided to economic zones (which also complicate tax administration).



Expenditure reforms. Replacing the wheat flour subsidy (which is currently sold at about
one tenth of the market price) with transfers to vulnerable parts of the population could
yield savings of up to ½ percent of GDP. Recognizing the political sensitivities of such
targeting, staff encouraged the authorities to continue with outreach. It also
recommended preserving or, if possible, increasing social and capital spending. At the
same time, staff believes that another ½ percent of GDP in savings could come from a
gradual reduction in the wage bill. This could come about by reforming compensation
and promotion policies. And, as outlined in the National Employment Strategy (NES),
there is a need to gradually eliminate waiting lists in the Civil Service Bureau, and turn
them into lists for active labor market programs in the private sector.

Utilities
22.

The utilities are implementing their medium-term strategies (¶s 12, 20–23).



Reforms are well underway to return NEPCO to cost recovery. Making the LNG
terminal operational is the only medium-term option to reduce the large energy import
bill. The construction is on track and the authorities hope to complete the terminal at the
latest by mid-2015. Progress has been also made on renewable energies. Staff stressed
that electricity transmission and distribution network improvements should go hand-inhand with increased generation capacity. It noted that the strategy remains vulnerable to
fluctuations in fuel supply and international oil prices. Establishing an automatic tariff
adjustment, in the form of a variable fuel surcharge,8 would help to partly mitigate the
impact of changes in the fuel mix and prices. Moreover, there is scope for reducing
technical losses in the private sector-run electricity distribution companies. Lastly, more
regular consultations between the ministry of finance and NEPCO would ensure that
NEPCO can reduce its arrears as planned. A write-off of NEPCO’s debt to accelerate the
company’s return to market access could be considered because the World Bank
assesses that NEPCO is managed efficiently (so there is little moral hazard).



The water strategy aims to cover operation and maintenance costs. It seeks
balancing cost-savings measures to improve efficiency with investments to improve
network performance and gradual increases in tariffs (Box 4). Staff welcomed that
vulnerable parts of the population are exempted from tariff increases. Because
implementation risks are high, careful monitoring will be essential to recalibrate as
needed. Staff also noted that the strategy is based on major investments, requiring
coordination with donors and the public investment program.

8

A decision by the Electricity Regulatory Board could impose such a surcharge as it is already envisaged in the
tariff structure.

Authorities’ Views
23.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment but highlighted political sensitivities
and the need to balance consolidation with growth. They underscored their commitment to
fiscal consolidation and, in the long term, to reduce net debt to 60 percent of GDP. The authorities,
however, indicated that it was difficult to go for broad-based adjustment because the middle class
had been adversely affected by the lackluster economic performance of the last years. Thus,
measures would need to be introduced gradually being mindful also of any potentially negative
impact on the economy.
24.
More grants are vital to shoulder the burden of the Syrian refugees. The budget is
tight as it covers only the direct costs of Syrian refugees, but not any indirect costs. Moreover, the
authorities feel that the direct costs included in the budget are potentially underestimated. They
were also concerned that planned future tax increases could be perceived by the population—
which was already suffering from lower-quality public services—as having to unduly pay for the
Syria crisis. In this context, the authorities also highlighted donor fatigue as a risk if the Syria
conflict is further protracted.
25.
Energy reforms are progressing. The authorities stressed their commitment to designing
contractual frameworks (such as had been done for renewables) to attract investors while putting
in place appropriate fiscal safeguards. They also expressed their concern with unpredictable gas
supplies from Egypt, but pointed out that the LNG terminal would provide much-needed relief.
While agreeing that it would be technically easy to implement automatic adjustments in electricity
tariffs, the authorities thought that reaching a consensus on tariff reforms had been politically
costly and thus wanted to wait with raising the issue.

B. Policy Theme 2—Preserving Buffers and Financial Stability
Monetary Policy
26.
Global financial conditions may pose a challenge. Historically, Jordan’s rates have
closely followed the U.S. policy rate. Thus, the expected shift in U.S. monetary policy could be
challenging for Jordan. This is because it would lead to a strengthening of the dollar, and with it
the dinar—thereby weighing on competitiveness—and to a rise in global yields. Notwithstanding
Jordan’s ability to access official or U.S.-guaranteed sources of financing, the tapering would make
tapping international markets more expensive and would feed into higher domestic interest rates.
Not only would this worsen debt indicators (see public sector DSA), but also, when combined with
continued fiscal consolidation, may have potential negative implications for economic activity.

Staff stressed that monetary policy should carefully weigh the need to stimulate
economic activity, with that of safeguarding reserve targets (¶s25 and 26). De-dollarization
is expected to continue this year, but only marginally relative to last year. As such, it is not
expected to be a key driver for gross international reserves. At the same time, the current
account deficit will remain high; core inflation might be subject to further upward pressure;
volatility in EMs could continue; and risks to the outlook remain elevated. Staff thus felt a neutral
stance for monetary policy would be appropriate.

Interest Rates

Authorities’ Views
28.
Monetary policy will continue to focus on maintaining adequate reserve buffers
and the attractiveness of the Jordanian dinar, while providing room for growth. The
authorities assess the output gap to still be negative, and believe that the recent policy rate cuts
will reduce the cost of borrowing, thereby stimulating private sector credit growth—and with it
aggregate demand. Such actions could yield the desired outcomes, judging from the apparent
historical workings of the credit channel of monetary policy—a pass through from policy rates to
lending rates, and from lending rates to credit growth. Regarding the U.S. tapering, the
authorities thought that, unless there was a change in the pace, this had already been priced-in.
Staff noted that there is uncertainty surrounding the cyclical position of the economy. While
measured formal sector output may still be below potential, high core inflation suggests
pressures in the informal economy (which has become more important given the refugee
situation). Also, staff cautioned that the credit channel of monetary transmission might involve
lags that have not fully played out yet.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Financial Sector
29.
The banking sector is stable and overall sound. Data for the second half of 2013 (the
latest available) show aggregate capitalization of about 18 percent, well above the regulatory
minimum of 12 percent. Capital is of high quality, with a high proportion of tier 1 capital (mainly
common equity). The depositor base is resilient, with retail deposits accounting for about two
thirds of total deposits. In particular, the loan-to-deposit ratio of 71 percent provides capacity for
banks to increase lending without relying on external funding. Banks therefore have strong
liquidity buffers, with liquid assets composed mainly of domestic sovereign bonds. They also
enjoy healthy profitability, with an aggregate return on average equity of over 10 percent.
Provisioning ratios have been steadily built up, to an average of 75 percent. Non-performing
loans (NPLs) remain at 7.4 percent of total loans, but are declining from a peak of 8.5 percent in
2011. Looking ahead, lower impaired loans would help banks further increase coverage ratios as
a buffer to future provisioning. Staff also underscored that banks’ exposure to sovereign debt
has increased sharply in recent years and that banks will need to find new sources of earnings as
the government consolidation proceeds.

Financial sector reform has been progressing (¶27–32). Staff conducted an
assessment of the banking sector to evaluate risks and assess progress in implementing the 2009
Financial Sector Assessment Program recommendations.


The collection of supervisory data is being improved. Strengthening the monitoring
of FSIs will support offsite supervision by accurate and timely regulatory reporting. The
authorities have been making progress in introducing an automated system for the
collection of FSI data, as well as an early warning system for monitoring systemic risk
indicators. They plan to complete an automated data collection system by June, which
would allow supervisors to conduct regular analysis on a quarterly basis, with data
submitted by banks no more than eight weeks after the end of each quarter.



Supervisory processes for home-host relationships require further attention.
Offshore activities by many Jordanian banks are significant in terms of their revenue
impact (Box 5). Regular onsite cross-border examinations are not yet a feature of the

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JORDAN

supervisory cycle or part of the CAMELS risk-rating approach. Staff emphasized that a
systematic approach to home-host supervision was important and welcomed plans to
host a supervisory college for Arab Bank.9


Initiatives to strengthen capital buffers and the regulatory framework are ongoing.
The CBJ has implemented numerous bank-specific measures to increase capital buffers.
For those few banks that have capital adequacy ratios just above the regulatory
minimum, staff argued for raising capital. It welcomed the CBJ’s plans to strengthen the
crisis management framework and encouraged the authorities to use Fund Technical
Assistance (TA) to proceed with the implementation of Basel II.

31.
The anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)
framework is being strengthened (¶33). During its April 2013 plenary meeting, the Middle East
and North Africa Financial Action Task Force acknowledged the progress made in addressing the
deficiencies outlined in the 2009 mutual evaluation report. To further improve the effectiveness
of the AML/CFT regime, the authorities have requested Fund TA.
Authorities’ Views
32.
The authorities felt that cross-border supervision and efforts to reduce banks’
vulnerabilities were appropriate. They agreed that there was scope for improvement on
cross-border supervision, but argued that onsite reviews are performed at least once every two
years with a full review of cross-border establishments. They also noted that informal channels of
information-sharing with host supervisors are effective. Regarding capital ratios, the authorities
pointed out that they were targeting a capital adequacy ratio of 14 percent to ensure that all
banks are well capitalized. While some banks are still to achieve that level, supervisors are
foremost working to address the structural features of weaker banks’ business models to
improve asset quality, increase coverage ratios, and stabilize earnings. Capital injections or banks
selling assets might be part of a comprehensive package.

C. Policy Theme 3—Inclusive Growth and Job Creation
33.
Though Jordan has considerable potential, most of the obstacles to growth have
been long standing. Jordan’s infrastructure is good and planned electricity tariff increases are
not expected to strongly affect its competitiveness (Box 6). Also, the private sector has the
capacity for innovation and ability to identify profitable products for investments. Jordan’s
political risks are below the regional average, but are higher than the EM average and could be a
deterrent to investment.10 While macro-risks are being addressed in the program, there are

weaknesses in the business environment, labor markets, and institutions. Discussions on
structural issues were closely coordinated with the World Bank.
34.

Indeed, poor labor market and social outcomes are entrenched.



Unemployment is a chronic problem, averaging 13.7 percent during 2000–10 and
12.6 percent over the last three years. Young people, ages 15 to 24, account for almost
half of the unemployed, and the youth unemployment rate, at about 31 percent, is
among the highest in the world. Unemployment rates tend to be highest among the
educated. For females, they are double that of males, because of much lower
employment-to-working age population ratios and despite lower formal labor force
participation. In fact, on all female labor market outcomes, Jordan ranks low, even
below the MENA average, which in turn has worse female outcomes than the average
of any other region in the world.



World Bank analysis shows that poverty remains a concern. By 2010—the latest year for
which data are available—an estimated 14.4 percent of the Jordanian population were
below the poverty line. And about 33 percent of households experienced “transient”
poverty—that is, they were poor during at least one quarter of the year, even though
officially, they are considered non-poor because their annual per capita consumption
exceeded the poverty line. At the same time, inequality appears to be an issue, with the
top three expenditure deciles recording stronger consumption growth than the bottom
four deciles. The World Bank is currently helping the authorities to strengthen their
poverty analyses, including by estimating the distributional impact of policies.

35.
Jordan’s key challenge is to create jobs amidst ongoing fiscal consolidation. The
consolidation is designed so as to minimize the adverse impact on growth by accelerating capital
spending and creating room for private sector development. But the employment challenge is
daunting. To absorb the new entrants to the labor force, Jordan will need to increase
employment by an estimated 400 thousand full-time positions over 2013–20. These new jobs will
need to be generated by the private sector, as employment in the public sector as well as
emigration to the Gulf can no longer absorb as many Jordanians as they used to.11 Staff stressed
that, in the absence of further reforms to labor and product markets, creating that many jobs
would require an average annual real GDP growth of 6.1 percent—a tall order. Current growth
forecasts would only generate 275 thousand jobs.

Business Climate
36.
Reforms to improve the business climate need to be reinvigorated. Jordan’s scores in
international comparisons are low, particularly on investor protection, contract enforcement, and
access to finance. Reversing such outcomes would create an environment that is more conducive
11

Emigration to the GCC has been an important employment strategy for Jordanians over the past several
decades, especially among skilled males.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JORDAN

to investment and competition. It would also give incentives for workers to move out of the
informal sector, where they have very little protection, and into the formal sector, with positive
implications including on tax revenue. Staff reiterated that there is a pressing need to step back
and review why long-standing reforms have stalled and whether there is a need to revamp the
agenda.
37.
Legislation to improve the private investment climate is proceeding slowly (¶39).
Staff urged the authorities to work with parliament to expedite approval of the laws on
investment, secured lending, insolvency, and Public-Private Partnerships (PPP). Legislation in line
with international standards could create a more level-playing field, by enhancing the
transparency of the rules governing investment. Staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to
approve any new incentives only after a cost-benefit analysis and in conjunction with
compensating measures. It also noted that stability in the legal framework was important for
investors and that re-opening agreed terms could thwart investor interest.
38.
Steps are taken to further promote access to credit and financial inclusion (¶42).
The financing needs of the government might have led to some crowding out of the private
sector (Box 7), but the gradual reduction of government financing needs will make more space
for the private sector in the medium term. Moreover, most of the $70 million loan from the
World Bank for Small and Medium-Size Enterprise finance has already been disbursed and the
CBJ is seeking to mobilize further donor support. At the same time, weaknesses such as
difficulties in providing collateral are being addressed.

Labor Market Reform
39.
More focus is needed on the labor market (¶38). The NES is designed to address high
unemployment and provide employment opportunities for Jordan’s growing labor force. To date,
however, there has been no clarity on specific policy actions and associated timelines. Staff
stressed the need to clarify NES’ implementation status, including specific measures, and to step
up engagement with international institutions that have labor market expertise.
40.
Reforms could improve employment outcomes in the private sector. The fact that
unemployment has remained high for so long suggests that the problem is largely structural and
will not be resolved by a cyclical increase in output. What is needed are labor market reforms
aimed at addressing:


Skills mismatches. The education system may not be producing graduates with
marketable job skills, as suggested by the concentration of unemployment among the
youth and educated, and the fact that firms regularly cite the lack of suitable skills among
job applicants as an significant constraint to hiring. Thus, more focus is needed on
realigning curriculums with private-sector needs. To put the unemployed into jobs,
policy-makers could also scale up and replicate promising training programs, such as the
Job Compact.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

JORDAN



Public sector hiring practices and compensation policies. The public sector has been
an extraordinarily important source of employment. Its hiring practices have typically
placed a premium on diplomas over actual skills, influencing educational outcomes and
contributing to skill mismatches. At the same time, the comparatively greater job
security, higher average wages, and more generous non-wage benefits offered by the
public sector have inflated wage expectations among new entrants. Therefore, public
sector hiring will need to place greater emphasis on skills and competition. Moreover, to
strengthen the link between compensation and productivity, adjustments in government
pay scales will be needed within a framework of overall wage restraint.



Female participation. The NES suggests that various factors have led to weak labor
market indicators for females, specifically: employers’ perceptions; limited access to
information on job opportunities; the lack of targeted active labor market policies for
females; the lack of maternity benefits in the private sector; and the absence of
affordable and dependable childcare. Addressing such constraints could go a long way to
unlocking the employment potential of Jordanian women.

Quality of Public Institutions
41.
Implementing changes hinges on strong public institutions. A large body of empirical
work identifies better quality of institutions as a key driver of sustainable improvements in living
standards. It finds that better institutions—that is, environments and policies providing incentives
that encourage productive activities and discourage rent-seeking, corruption, and theft—not
only foster physical and human capital accumulation, but also enhance total factor productivity.12
Jordan performs well within the region in the perception of corruption though its ranking relative
to other countries has deteriorated over the last years. Strengthening public institutions could
help improve perceptions and support greater political involvement through more transparency
and accountability.

The committee to reinforce integrity could anchor efforts in transparency (¶40).
Staff welcomed the establishment of this independent committee that will monitor the
implementation and enforcement of an executive plan. This plan, which was prepared after broad
consultations, sets an ambitious agenda of reforms, aiming at developing a culture of integrity in
all of segments of the society, strengthening the rule of law and judiciary independence, and
promoting transparency in government policymaking and decision-making.
43.
Strengthening the structural fiscal agenda would not only generate revenue, but
also foster transparency (¶s 12, 18, 19, 35–37). Staff encouraged the authorities to train
(possibly with Fund TA) and empower staff in the newly-established macro unit, which should
become the linchpin for macroeconomic monitoring.


Improvements in revenue administration are encouraging. Collection efficiency and
segment management are benefitting from the reclassification of taxpayers based on size
and industry; better information sharing across public agencies; and further
improvements of the national registry. Looking forward, staff encouraged the authorities
to go more strongly after tax evasion, including by strengthening penalties and
modernizing its audit programs in line with international standards. Removing sales tax
exemptions would help to streamline revenue administration.



Public financial management (PFM) reforms are progressing but more is needed.
Commitment controls will prevent a re-occurrence of arrears, providing assurances that
the program’s cash targets are binding. Still, there is a need to improve the supervision of
off-budget health funds and, to this end, the roll-out of the Government Financial
Management Information System to the ministry of health is encouraging. Rather than
looking into all trust accounts, staff encouraged the authorities to focus only on large
ones with a view to consolidating them swiftly into the treasury single account. This
would allow a better assessment of the size of the government transactions and the
underlying fiscal position.



A rigorous selection of public capital projects will help make the most of scarce
resources and could boost growth. Staff welcomed that the authorities are establishing
a framework for managing public investment with assistance from the World Bank. This
will not only increase transparency of public spending but also maximize its impact on
growth and jobs. Projects should be prioritized based on standardized financial and
economic cost-benefit analyses, taking into account fiscal costs, including contingent
liabilities. Such analyses should also inform the decision on whether to fund the projects
from the budget or through PPPs.



Mega-projects under consideration as PPPs will need to be carefully managed.
Some of these projects could become a game changer in the long term. They include: a
freight railway linking Jordan with Syria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia; a water desalination plant
on the Red Sea; the exploitation of oil shale; the construction of a pipeline from the Iraqi
oil fields around Basra to the Aqaba port (for use both in Jordan and for exports); nuclear

21

JORDAN

energy; and direct gas imports through a pipeline from the Eastern Mediterranean. These
projects could produce large positive externalities and improvements in the current and
fiscal accounts. It is thus critical to strengthen the newly created PPP unit. Because some
of the energy projects could generate revenue, staff recommended working proactively
on addressing the challenges arising from the taxation of natural resources and
designing a fiscal framework to anchor fiscal policies.

Authorities’ Views
44.
The authorities felt that the standard indicators of business environment reforms
did not tell the whole story. Though acknowledging some value in these indicators, they noted
that the indicators could provide a misguided picture. For instance, adequate and broad access
to finance is ensured by various products, including from micro-finance and nonbank financial
services, and the credit bureau will help providing better information to lenders. There is also
sufficient room for private sector credit. Nonetheless, a task force is looking into how to improve
specific business indicators. On perceptions of corruption, the authorities believe that this has
been unduly magnified; they are working with the media to turn around those perceptions. In
terms of obstacles to growth, the authorities regard the ongoing regional uncertainty as the
single largest impediment.
45.
Work is in progress to bring together sectoral strategies into a holistic framework.
The authorities noted that they are reviving the structural reform agenda. They hope to achieve
synergies and update the strategies in light of the challenges from the Syria crisis. The authorities
see Jordan’s comparative advantage in skill-intensive sectors, such as business consultation and
financial services. While the GCC had been the traditional client for medical and education
tourism, this was now less so the case, but other MENA countries (for instance, Libya and Yemen)
were substituting for that. The authorities have also started marketing religious tourism.
46.
Work is ongoing to address the chronically high unemployment. The authorities
acknowledged the need to move toward the private sector as the main source of employment.
They noted that the problem is challenging because of sizable disparities in unemployment
across governorates—ranging from 10.5 percent in Amman to about 17.1 percent in Tafiela—and
the massive influx of refugees. In this

legally work in Jordan. Furthermore, the authorities highlighted several initiatives to put the
unemployed into jobs, particularly in remote and rural areas where unemployment tends to be
the highest. These include giving incentives to qualified industrial zones to build factories in
villages while at the same time intensifying their vocational training programs to make the
unemployed employable.

PROGRAM ISSUES
47.
The reviews focused on program implementation and laid the groundwork for
medium-term consolidation. The second review adjusted the fiscal program to help cushion
disruptions in gas supplies and the impact of the Syria conflict. With reserves rebuilt and a sound
energy sector strategy in place, the third and fourth reviews centered on measures to underpin the
planned consolidation and further reduce program risks (Box 8). Staff stressed that strong
ownership is critical for the success of the program and offered TA, which could help reduce
implementation risks.

A. Agreements
48.
The program safeguards the fiscal targets for 2014 (¶s14 and 20). Regarding the
central government, the authorities felt confident that the measures for 2014, along with
ongoing improvements in tax administration, would suffice to raise the expected revenue.
Nonetheless, they stand ready to implement compensating measures to meet the target should
revenue fall short of projections (several

the revenue side). Regarding NEPCO, the
authorities expect gas flows to resume

target in 2014. The program
accommodates a temporary disruption in

½ percent of GDP (the end-2014 target on
NEPCO’s losses is unchanged). If shortfalls
in gas flows in the first half of the year cannot be offset by larger flows later in the year,
corrective action is needed, which could be in the form of a temporary electricity tariff or a VAT
surcharge.
Sources: Jordanian authorities; and IMF staff estimates.

49.
Fiscal consolidation in 2015 will be addressed proactively in the next reviews (¶s16
and 17). For the central government, passage of an adequate income tax law will be a key
consideration for staff to be able to assess that the program remains on track to meet its
objectives (and thus to recommend the fifth review). Further, the authorities plan to approve by
end-September measures which—together with the income tax law—will yield 1.5 percent of
GDP and thus cover the full adjustment for 2015.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

50.
Additional grants could help manage the costs of gas shortfalls and also allow more
spending on priorities (¶s10 and 11). Should additional grants become available, they would
help first to manage any gas shortfalls (and in this context protect against a need for additional
budget cuts). Grants could go also toward restoring public services to their pre-Syria crisis quality
or capital spending to boost growth. There appears to be a multitude of studies on the impact of
the Syrian crisis on Jordan with very different results, potentially undermining fundraising efforts.
Staff noted that the recently completed USAID study provides a long-awaited solid estimate of the
fiscal costs of hosting the refugees. It recommended merging this study with others on the
macroeconomic and social impact into a consistent fundraising document.

B. Modalities
51.
Conditionality has been adjusted to reflect program performance and objectives. PCs
for end-June 2014, end-September 2014 and end-December 2014 as well as Indicative Targets for
end-March 2015 are proposed to be set as per the MEFP Table 1. The new benchmarks are
focused on adjustment of the central government and NEPCO as well as measures to improve the
monitoring of the financial sector and prioritize public investment, all of which are macro-critical
reforms.
52.
The program is fully financed. For the period between April 2014 and March 2015, total
grants and loans are expected to reach about $2.5 billion—including $600 million from the GCC,
$340 million from the World Bank and Japan, $319 million from the EU, $177 million from the
U.S. and $100 million from Saudi Arabia. The remaining gap will be covered by a Eurobond
issuance of $1 billion in the third quarter of 2014, for which the authorities are seeking a U.S.
guarantee. Financing assurances have been obtained. Nonetheless, if there are early indications
that projected financing will not be received, the authorities will consult with the Fund on
alternative financing approaches and further policy adjustments.
53.
Staff’s assessment of exceptional access criteria remains unchanged. While public debt
will continue to increase under a no-policy action scenario, the implementation of the authorities’
national program will bring it on a downward path to 79 percent of GDP by 2019, with a debt
service burden that would remain manageable (criterion 2). The assumptions underlying this
assessment are broadly unchanged from the last review. Moreover, the authorities aim at
lengthening the maturity profile of domestic debt to reduce rollover risks; the government is also
committed to debt reduction, with the minister of finance announcing in his budget speech to
parliament that he intends to reduce central government debt to 60 percent of GDP in the long
term. Other exceptional access criteria also continue to be met: current account pressure remains
high (criterion 1); prospects for sustained market access remain good with some non-resident
participation in domestic debt markets and, in the future, Eurobond issuances envisaged without
third-party guarantees (criterion 3); and with each successive review the authorities have
demonstrated their ability to implement difficult reforms, thus ensuring that the program has a
strong prospect of success (criterion 4).

Jordan has the capacity to repay the Fund. Jordan has an unblemished record of
payments to the Fund and its capacity to repay has been strengthened by a higher-thanprogrammed level of reserves. Peak Fund access projections remain unchanged from the Stand-By
Arrangement request (800 percent of the quota). Fund credit outstanding would reach a maximum
of 4.8 percent of GDP in 2015.
55.
The CBJ is addressing the recommendations of the safeguards assessment concluded
in January 2013 (¶43). It is introducing additional disclosures in its financial statements to be
finalized by end-March 2014, and is working on removing audit qualifications to ensure fair and
transparent presentation of assets on its balance sheet. The CBJ has also reviewed procedures and
controls over the program NIR compilation process, and will ensure reconciliation with the
accounting records within six weeks after each test date in 2014. As a next step, it will review the CBJ
law and prepare draft amendments by end-2014 with the view to strengthen oversight
arrangements and legal underpinnings of its autonomy. In addition, the internal audit review of
procedures for program monetary data compilation needs to include net domestic assets and
incorporate audits of the reported data, as well as an independent recalculation of the data in
accordance with the technical memorandum of understanding.

STAFF APPRAISAL
56.
Jordan’s external and domestic environment is narrowing its space for reforms.
Growth has picked up, but is insufficient to make a dent in persistently high unemployment and
transient poverty. The social situation is stretched further by absorbing Syrian refugees in the
economy. Hosting the refugees is also putting pressures on fiscal and external accounts, which
remain vulnerable to changes in international energy prices and the fuel mix (in particular
fluctuations in gas inflows from Egypt).
57.
Fiscal consolidation is proceeding nonetheless and reserves have now reached
comfortable levels. Both the central government and NEPCO deficits stayed within the 2013
program targets. After rebuilding reserves in the first half of 2013, the CBJ thrice reduced interest
rates since the summer to stimulate private sector growth.
58.
Consolidation needs to go hand-in-hand with a stronger agenda for more growth
and jobs. A continued reduction in the combined deficit is needed to return debt to a downward
trajectory over the medium term. Though the fiscal adjustment is designed to support growth and
reverse a crowding out of the private sector, reforms are needed to address long-standing
structural weaknesses.
59.
Steadfast execution of the 2014 budget is key. To this end, timely implementation of
measures is crucial. Staff also urges the authorities to monitor revenue closely and act quickly if
expected gains from measures turn out to be lower than expected. Executing the full capital
spending program will help support growth.
60.
Deep and proactive tax reform is needed to underpin the medium-term adjustment.
The revised income tax law presents an opportunity to substantially raise revenue and to fully
realize this, the authorities should work with parliament to lower the personal income tax
threshold. This, together with a reduction in tax incentives, would provide a solid basis for
medium-term consolidation. There is also scope for revisiting the wage bill and the general food
subsidy.
61.
Utilities are now focused on implementing their strategies toward medium-term cost
recovery. Energy sector reform is well underway, but remains vulnerable to shortfalls in gas from
Egypt. Staff thus urges the authorities to prepare a contingency plan if gas flows are not resumed
in the spring. Also, better coordination with the ministry of finance would ensure that NEPCO stays
current in its payments. The key to the success of the water strategy lies in close monitoring and
the implementation of the investment plan.
62.
All efforts should be made to maintain an adequate reserve buffer. This is critical
because of a continued high current account deficit and elevated risks. Staff recommends a neutral
monetary policy stance in the near future, mostly in light of uncertainty surrounding the drivers of
core inflation.

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JORDAN

63.
The banking sector remains sound, but supervisory initiatives should be expedited.
Higher frequency and timeliness of FSI is a priority. Given the importance of bank activities in other
countries, enhancing cross-border supervision and progressing toward implementation of the
Basel frameworks would reduce vulnerabilities.
64.
Structural reforms need to be retooled toward generating more jobs. Reversing
Jordan’s poor labor market outcomes requires a renewed momentum in structural reforms, which
should be reviewed jointly with development partners. Staff urges the authorities to tackle with
parliament long-standing legislation to create a more level-playing field for investors. Labor
market reforms should aim at reducing skills mismatches, changing public sector hiring practices
and compensation policies, and harnessing the employment potential of Jordanian women.
65.
Stronger institutions could become a driver of growth. In particular, tangible progress
toward more transparency and accountability could create a broader buy-in. Prioritizing public
investment toward maximizing its impact on growth and unemployment is critical to make the
most of scarce resources. Moreover, efforts in improving tax administration would complement tax
policy changes. At the same time, PFM reforms—including by consolidating trust accounts—could
substantially facilitate fiscal management.
66.
Risks remain high. Given the high debt, there is little room for further slowing the
adjustment path. At the same time, Jordan is already struggling to host the Syrian refugees and
further inflows would likely be difficult to absorb. Also, the uncertainty surrounding gas inflows
from Egypt is expected to stay, potentially requiring substantial additional financing. These
pressures together with the country now entering its third year of consolidation make the case for
more outreach and a stronger involvement of stakeholders. The capacity to manage the program is
slowly improving with the help of TA, including from the Fund.
67.
More grants would help in managing risks. With the analysis of the impact of the Syrian
crisis on Jordan now more advanced, staff emphasizes the importance of a concerted fundraising
drive. Grants could not only go into covering any shortfalls in gas from Egypt, but also toward
other priorities, including projects to stimulate growth and promote employment.
68.
Staff supports the completion of the third and fourth reviews. It also supports (1) the
waiver of nonobservance for the end-March 2014 PC on the combined public deficit because the
slippage is temporary and expected to be offset during 2014; (2) waivers of applicability for the
end-March 2014 PCs on the primary fiscal deficit and on NIR; and (3) setting PCs for end-June,
end-September, and end-December 2014. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be
held on a 24-month-cycle.

Labor markets. The influx of Syrian
refugees has led to a significant crowding
out of Jordanian workers in the informal
sector. At the same time, and based on
available labor market data, staff’s analysis
finds no conclusive evidence supporting
the hypothesis that the Syria crisis had
negatively impacted Jordanian formal
unemployment outcomes, which could be

attributed to the fact that Syrian refugees are legally not allowed to work. In fact, unemployment rates
have not worsened relative to pre-Syria crisis levels in governorates cumulatively hosting about ninety
percent of Syrian refugees, while such rates have marginally deteriorated in governorates hosting the
remaining ten percent. Instead, the public sector creating fewer jobs appears to be the main driver of
worsening unemployment outcomes at the national level over the past two years, because the sector
has been generating much of the jobs in the last decade. These results are broadly in line with staff’s
empirical results that unemployment in Jordan has been largely a structural rather than a cyclical
phenomenon.
Inflation. The Syria conflict has a statistically significant effect on Jordan’s rental prices in 2013
(though not on domestic food prices), with an estimated impact on end-of-period CPI inflation of
about 0.6 percentage points by year-end.
External current account. The crisis has also put further strain on the current account, but the net
impact is not clear. Trade through Syria—an important element of cross-border trade in the region—
has been all but eliminated, and the increased size of the population has resulted in a sharp rise in
overall imports. Non-energy imports increased by over 11 percent in 2013. Nonetheless, transfers
through the UN agencies and from other private citizens abroad have helped to dampen the effect. A
redirection of GCC tourists from more affected countries (for example, Lebanon) has also been
beneficial.

refugees from the border. For water, the rapid rise in the number of users causes stress on
water supply systems with many refugees now living beyond the reach of support systems.



The study distinguishes between direct costs to meet the humanitarian needs of the refugees
and indirect costs to re-establish the pre-crisis quality of public services. Direct costs
estimates by USAID are broadly in line with those in the program (which were provided by the
authorities). This implies that public services remain below their pre-crisis quality (for instance,
school class sizes have increased). For indirect costs, the study uses the depreciation over an
investment’s life span rather than including the full costs of investment upfront. This explains
why other studies, including by the ministry of planning, show substantially higher fiscal costs.

Box 2. Exchange Rate Assessment
Jordan’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated but tourism-based measures remain
competitive. The trajectory of the trade-weighted REER turned positive in recent years as inflation in Jordan
has been higher than in trading partner countries. The REER is currently between 5 and 10 percent above the
10-year average but is broadly in line with longer-term averages. Moreover, tourism-based measures of
1

competitiveness, which account for one-quarter of exports of goods and services, have continued to
improve when compared with Jordan’s competitor countries.

Export performance has been lackluster since the onset of the global financial crisis. This reverses a
trend of robust export performance in previous years. Export volumes increased by 1 percent on average
over the past five years (2008–12), relative to 5 percent in the preceding five years (2003–07). As a share of
GDP, exports are unchanged from their level in the mid-1990s. Recent performance reflects a combination of
factors, including lower world growth, regional instability—which in particular affects tourism—and
difficulties in the phosphate industry. A narrower focus

the time of the last Article IV. However, as with many of these methodologies, there is significant uncertainty
with regard to the specific point estimates, with standard errors relatively large in all three specifications
shown. The external stability approach points to a similar current account norm as the macro-balance
approach, while the equilibrium real exchange rate approach points to an overvaluation.
A norm of this magnitude is consistent with Jordan’s financing prospects: (i) foreign direct investment
was approximately 5 percent of GDP in 2013 but has been on average much higher in the previous ten years
(approximately double the current level); (ii) a deep domestic government bond market and an active stock
market will continue to attract regional portfolio flows; and (iii) external debt levels remain relatively low (see
External DSA).

Box 3. Jordan’s Interconnectedness
Jordan is a very open economy. Imports of goods are more than half of GDP and exports amount to more
than one quarter. Tourism receipts and remittances are each about 10 percent of GDP and foreign direct
investment (FDI) exceeds 5 percent of GDP.
Links with Arab countries (in particular the GCC and Iraq) are the strongest. They account for the largest
share of exports, remittances and tourism receipts. The U.S. and European countries follow at some distance,
while a significant share of exports goes to other Asian countries (mostly to India, China, and Indonesia), in
particular phosphates and fertilizers. FDI has also historically come from the Gulf region. As of 2009, around
70 percent of the total inward investment position reported by Jordan originated from the Gulf, with Saudi
Arabia accounting for 18 percent.

Financial links with the MENA region are significant. Jordanian banks have substantial offshore exposures
(see Box 5). Ten foreign banks are operating in Jordan, and their share of total banking assets has slightly
increased from about 10 percent in 2007 to about 12 percent in 2012. Non-resident deposits, two thirds of
which are in foreign currency, are about 11 percent of total deposits. Loans to non-residents have been
following a declining trend since 2009 and now amount to 4.4 percent of total credit.

Box 4. Water Strategy
The authorities announced a strategy to eliminate the operating losses of the water companies
by 2020. Without action, annual losses are expected to increase to beyond one percent of GDP by
2020. The strategy assumes that donors will finance most capital spending required for improvements
in service delivery, given Jordan’s unique geographical features and extreme water scarcity
(about 0.5 percent of GDP per year on average). Projected investment costs exceed $3.5 billion
over 10 years, of which $1.5 billion would be needed by 2016.
The strategy is based on two pillars:



Cost savings. These are expected to stem from: (i) improvements in energy efficiency by
modernizing key infrastructure, including by setting up renewable energy generation near
pumping stations; (ii) a reduction of physical water losses; and (iii) system optimization.



Revenue measures. The authorities propose a gradual approach to: (i) reduce administrative
water losses (for instance, illegal connections and billing inefficiencies); (ii) increase revenue
collection through administrative improvements and the outsourcing of bill collection to third
parties; and (iii) increase water and wastewater tariffs for households, industry and farmers.
The authorities envisage increases in waste water tariffs starting in 2014, but water supply
tariffs would increase only starting at end-2015. Envisaged tariff increases exclude most
households, whose tariffs are highly subsidized. Connection and service fees have already
been increased for some users, and more increases are expected starting in 2015.

Nonetheless, the regulatory framework is adequate. The CBJ has to approve the establishment of
offshore subsidiaries of Jordanian banks. Without it, no offshore activities could take place. While there are
no formal caps in place on exposures, at a minimum, each bank subsidiary or branch has to ensure that its
capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is in line with international standards. In fact, each subsidiary’s capital is
subtracted from the parent’s bank capital, so the latter also has to maintain the minimum CAR if it expands
abroad. In addition to CARs, all banks (parent, subsidiary, or branch) are well-rated in terms of liquidity and
asset quality; otherwise, no offshore activity is allowed.
The CBJ is expanding the supervision of banks’ overseas subsidiaries. It monitors cross-border
exposures and, in some circumstances, has worked with banks to take additional provisions against assets
in countries where the risks are high (for instance, banks’ exposures to Syria are fully provisioned). The CBJ
has also performed several onsite cross-border examinations (in the U.K. and Switzerland for Arab Bank
subsidiaries), and plans further examinations for 2014.

Banks have been increasingly financing the
public sector. Banks covered the sharp rise in
borrowing by the public sector by reducing cash
holdings, deposits at the CBJ, and foreign assets.
Largely because of a slowdown in credit growth to
industry, trade, and somewhat the construction
sector, private sector declined from about
90 percent of GDP in 2007 to about 70 percent by
end-2013. This stands in contrast with the trend in
most of the MENA region, where the ratios of
private sector credit to GDP have rebounded

Annex I. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Jordan’s public debt remains sustainable. With the fiscal adjustment envisaged under the program
(“baseline”), Jordan’s public debt is projected to peak at 91 percent of GDP in 2015 and then
gradually decline. Gross financing needs are relatively large at around 16 percent of GDP on
average in the medium term, reflecting short maturities of domestic debt (less than two years).
Moreover, Jordan is expected to continue to rely on sizeable grants over the medium term, but will
eventually have to wean itself off foreign aid. Jordan’s heat map risk assessment points to
substantial vulnerabilities as do the shock scenarios. On the upside, most debt profile indicators are
below upper early benchmarks and debt is projected to decline in the medium term even under the
most severe stress test.
Baseline and Realism of Projections

1



Growth and prices. Past projections of growth show medium-size forecast errors, with a
slight tilt toward the pessimistic side. The current growth forecasts for the near team are
marginally below those in the program one year ago, reflecting lower-than-expected 2012
and 2013 growth. The track record of the inflation forecast is generally in line with other
countries, with actual inflation being 2.2 percentage points higher than the forecast on
average. The inflation forecast has been revised down slightly from one year ago, to
incorporate lower-than-expected inflation in 2012 and on the expectation that current
inflation pressure gradually abate.



Debt level and fiscal adjustment. Despite significant adjustment in the medium term, the
debt-to-GDP ratio will peak at 91 percent in 2015 and decline only from then onward to
2
79 percent in 2019. Although Jordan’s 3-year average level of the cyclically-adjusted
central government primary balance (CAPB) is generally in line with other countries, the
maximum 3-year adjustment is an outlier in the second percentile. This reflects a tightening
of the CAPB from -6.1 percent of GDP in 2014 to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2017. This adjustment
is overestimated because the 2013 CAPB includes government transfers to utilities of over
3 percent of GDP to service government-guaranteed debt. Still, when adjusting for these
transfers, Jordan remains an outlier ranked in the second percentile. It should also be noted
that past projections of the primary balance tended to be optimistic.



Sovereign yields. Although both external and domestic bond yields have moderated from
3
earlier highs, Jordan’s effective interest rate is forecast to stabilize around 5.6 percent. The
underlying interest rate assumptions are as follows. On external debt, the U.S.-guaranteed

1

The new DSA framework is described in (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/050913.pdf).

2

This path is slightly different from the last staff report, reflecting mainly different interest bill projections using
the new market access county DSA template.
3

The projection does not include interest payments for (1) pre-2013 debt issued to finance NEPCO and WAJ
losses; and (2) debt to finance WAJ’s losses in the medium term; these are paid directly by the utilities. This
results in an underestimate of the total interest bill.

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JORDAN

Eurobond in 2014 is estimated to have a spread of 60 bps over the U.S. Treasury bonds; the
rates of other non-guaranteed debt will carry a risk premium in line with other emerging
markets. On domestic debt, the risk premium over the U.S. LIBOR rate is assumed to decline
gradually to historical average levels with continued strong program implementation.


Maturity and rollover. Public debt has relatively short maturities, with an average below two
years. Combined with the large general government deficit, this drives gross financing needs
to 26 percent of GDP in 2014. Maturities for domestic debt are assumed to be lengthened in
the medium term with new issuance in 2018 having an average maturity of over 3 years.
Jordan’s external public debt profile is on the longer end, with maturity-at-issuance typically
more than 5 years and low rollover needs in the near to medium term.

Stress Tests and Heat Map
Stress tests show that Jordan is most vulnerable to shocks to growth and contingent liabilities from the
financial sector. This highlights the importance of structural reforms to promote growth and to fortify
financial stability. The heat map (on the last page) highlights the needs for continued strong fiscal
adjustment and the lengthening of the domestic debt maturities.


Growth shock. In this scenario, real output growth rates are lower by one standard deviation
(or 2.6 percentage points) for two years starting in 2015. As a result, the nominal primary
balance improves more slowly than in the baseline as nominal revenue falls while spending is
unchanged. This leads to an increase in risk premiums (see bullet above). Accordingly, the
debt-to-GDP ratio reaches 88 percent of GDP in 2019 (9 percentage points higher than in the
baseline) while the financing needs increase to 18 percent of GDP (2 percent of GDP higher
than in the baseline).



Primary balance shock. Assuming that the authorities will implement half of the
planned adjustments each year throughout the medium term, risk premiums will increase (a
25 bps increase for each one percent of GDP worsening in the primary balance). As a result,
the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase to 84 percent of GDP by 2019 (5 percent of
GDP points higher than the baseline), while annual financing needs are about 17 percent of
GDP in 2019 (1.2 percent of GDP higher than in the baseline).



Contingent liability shock. A one-time bail out of the financial sector increases non-interest
expenditures by 10 percent of banking sector assets4. This is combined with a real GDP
growth shock (one standard deviation for two years), which in turn pushes up sovereign
borrowing costs. In this shock scenario, debt peaks at 107 percent of GDP in 2016 and
then declines. Gross financing needs increase to 32 percent of GDP in 2015 and decline to
19 percent in 2019.

4

For the purpose of the shock simulation, banking sector assets are defined as the sum of claims to the private
sector, claims to the central government, and gross foreign assets. These add up to 102 percent of GPD.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

JORDAN



Interest rate shock. This scenario assumes that concerns about medium-term debt
sustainability will increase spreads by 200 bps from 2015 onward. The government’s interest
bill climbs, reaching an effective rate of 6.9 percent by 2019. Higher borrowing costs are
passed on to the real economy, depressing growth. Given that banks have large holdings of
sovereign bonds in their portfolios, such a shock may weigh on banks’ financial soundness,
including on their capital. The debt-to-GDP ratio reaches 82 percent in 2019, despite sizeable
primary surpluses, and gross financing needs increase to about 17 percent of GDP in 2019.



Combined shock. A combined shock incorporates the largest effect of individual shocks on
all relevant variables (real GDP growth, inflation, primary balance, exchange rate and interest
rate). This would increase debt to its peak level of 102 percent of GDP in 2016. Gross
financing needs will peak at 27 percent of GDP in 2016 and decline to 20 percent of GDP by
2019.



No Egypt Gas. Assuming there is no gas from Egypt starting in 2014, NEPCO will have to
switch to more expensive fuel and incur higher losses throughout the medium term, with
liquefied natural gas mitigating the adverse impact on imports and debt starting in 2015.
Under this scenario, debt will peak at 96 percent of GDP in 2016 and then declines; gross
financing needs will stay at 18 percent of GDP in 2019.



Heat map. Jordan’s debt level and gross financing needs are at high levels compared
to other countries. On the upside, the risk from the debt profile is modest, and the share of
short-term debt is expected to continue to decline. High external financing requirements are
mainly driven by a large current account deficit rather than external debt amortization.
Overall, these indicators highlight the importance of fiscal adjustment and a need to
lengthen the domestic debt maturity profile.

1/ Public sector is defined as central government and includes public guarantees, defined as guaranteed debt for NEPCO, WAJ, and other public entities..
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes changes in the stock of guarantees, asset changes, and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ The cell is highlighted in green if debt burden benchmark of 70% is not exceeded under the specific shock or baseline, yellow if exceeded under specific shock but not baseline,
red if benchmark is exceeded under baseline, white if stress test is not relevant.
2/ The cell is highlighted in green if gross financing needs benchmark of 15% is not exceeded under the specific shock or baseline, yellow if exceeded under specific shock but not
baseline, red if benchmark is exceeded under baseline, white if stress test is not relevant.
3/ The cell is highlighted in green if country value is less than the lower risk-assessment benchmark, red if country value exceeds the upper risk-assessment benchmark, yellow if
country value is between the lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks. If data are unavailable or indicator is not relevant, cell is white.
Lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks are:
200 and 600 basis points for bond spreads; 5 and 15 percent of GDP for external financing requirement; 0.5 and 1 percent for change in the share of short-term debt; 15 and 45
percent for the public debt held by non-residents; and 20 and 60 percent for the share of foreign-currency denominated debt.
4/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds, an average over the last 3 months, 18-Dec-13 through 18-Mar-14.
5/ External financing requirement is defined as the sum of current account deficit, amortization of medium and long-term total external debt, and short-term total external debt at
the end of previous period.

Appendix. Letter of Intent
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC, 20431
USA

Amman, April 8, 2014

Dear Ms. Lagarde:
Our economy continues to suffer from the impact of exogenous events. In particular, the Syrian crisis is
ever more encroaching, having not only implications on the fiscal and external accounts, but also
resulting in social pressures. We expect such negative spillovers could become more pronounced should
the conflict escalate further. Moreover, gas deliveries from Egypt continue to be unreliable. While donors
have provided additional assistance, further external grants are needed to help mitigate new pressures
on the fiscal accounts and public debt.
Despite the challenging environment, we are doing our part to ensure that public sector consolidation—
the cornerstone of our program—remains on track. Losses at our electricity company (NEPCO) are being
gradually reduced—supported by recent tariff increases—and are expected to be eliminated by 2017.
Fiscal consolidation efforts are also well underway at the central government level. Fuel subsidies were
eliminated in 2012 and we expect the revised income tax law (currently at parliament) to substantially
raise revenue. We also plan to reduce tax incentives and implement other measures aiming for a
cumulative consolidation effort by more than seven percent of GDP over the next three years. These
efforts have instilled confidence in our government and its policies, resulting in a rapid rebound in our
external reserves position.
As a result of our efforts, performance under the program has been strong. All quantitative performance
criteria and indicative targets for end-March are expected to be met with the exception of the one on
the combined public deficit because of a temporary shortfall in gas supplies from Egypt. Structural
performance is also much improved, and we have met all six structural benchmarks since October 2013,
which are focused on raising revenue, enhancing transparency, reforming public utilities in the energy
and water sectors, and making growth more inclusive.
In view of our strong performance as well as strong policy measures for 2014, we request a waiver of
non-observance of the missed end-March performance criterion on the combined public deficit and
completion of the third and fourth reviews under the Stand-By Arrangement and approval of the related
purchase. We also request a waiver for applicability of the other end-March performance criteria, for
which actual data will not become available until six weeks after end-March (i.e., mid-May).
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) describes the economic policies
that we intend to implement to achieve the objectives of our economic program of preserving

64

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JORDAN

macroeconomic stability and fostering inclusive growth. We believe that these policies are adequate to
meet the program’s goals, but we stand ready to take further measures that may become appropriate
for this purpose. We will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these measures, and in advance of
any revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such
consultations. We will also provide the Fund with the data and information necessary to monitor
performance under the program.
We authorize the Fund to publish this Letter of Intent and its attachments, as well as the accompanying
staff report.
Sincerely,

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
Jordan continues to face a difficult external environment. However, we are steadfastly implementing our
policies to maintain macroeconomic stability, foster equity, increase growth, and reduce unemployment.
We have re-built reserves to a comfortable level and are implementing strategies that will return the
electricity and water companies to cost recovery. We are now focused on further reducing the government
deficit in a sustainable and equitable way while strengthening our structural reform agenda toward more
inclusive growth and job opportunities, particularly for the young. We appreciate the donor support to help
us alleviate fiscal and macroeconomic pressures in particular from hosting Syrian refugees.

BACKGROUND AND MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK
1.
Jordan’s external environment remains difficult. The main risk to our program is spillovers
from the Syria crisis. Currently, Jordan hosts more than a million Syrians, about 15 percent of Jordan’s
population. We welcomed the refugees in our communities and, together with our UN partners, set up
the largest refugee camp in the world. These refugees are likely to stay in Jordan for some time. Despite
help from donors, the humanitarian effort has come at a significant cost for the economy as a whole and
for local communities, particularly in the north. In addition to maintaining good living conditions in the
camps, this effort has created extraordinary fiscal costs that we can sustain only with stepped-up
contributions from the international community. Any intensification of the conflict would have negative
consequences for our economy, testing our economic, financial, and social capacity to accommodate
more refugees. We are also facing the risk of renewed disruptions in gas flows from Egypt, which could
significantly increase the deficit of our electricity company NEPCO as well as our external and fiscal
financing needs.
2.
Despite this challenging environment, the economic recovery is gaining traction.
Notwithstanding the difficulties in the mining sector, we expect growth to have picked up to about
3 percent in 2013 from 2.7 percent in 2012, driven by sustained activity in financial services, trade, and
construction. Private sector credit growth has accelerated in the last months while year-on-year headline
CPI inflation has dropped sharply to 3.1 in February 2014. The stock market has gained about 3 percent
since end-September 2013 and has weathered well the recent turbulence in emerging markets. With the
improvement in overall macroeconomic conditions, dollarization declined and dinar liquidity improved.
As a result, the yield curve on government securities declined by 350–400 basis points since end-2012,
lowering the financing costs for the private and public sectors. In addition, lower energy imports, higher
remittances and current transfers and better-than-anticipated tourism receipts helped reduce the
current account deficit by 5 percent of GDP to below 10 percent of GDP in 2013.
3.

We expect the macroeconomic outlook to improve in the medium term.



Growth. We forecast GDP growth to accelerate to 3.5 percent in 2014, supported by a boost in
public investment, largely financed by GCC grants; a rebound in private sector capital spending;
and stronger domestic demand from Syrian refugees positively impacting the formal economy.

66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JORDAN

We expect growth to further pick up in the medium term, reaching 4½ percent by 2016, thanks
largely to our structural reforms and the assumption that regional uncertainties will decline.


Inflation. We forecast end-of-period consumer price inflation to decelerate to 2.5 percent at
end-2014, and about 2 percent in the medium term, aided also by a moderation in food and fuel
prices. This forecast reflects that planned electricity tariff increases for the coming years are
expected to have a limited effect on inflation, as did previous ones.



Current account. Owing to our efforts in diversifying energy sources, we will reduce our
dependency on expensive fuel imports. This together with continued fiscal consolidation will
lead to an improvement in the current account deficit (including grants) to about 4 percent over
the medium term.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND PERFORMANCE IN 2013
4.

Our reform program is based on three objectives:



Macroeconomic stability to strengthen investor confidence and withstand any economic shock;
indeed, continued stability is a precondition to achieve our goals of inclusive and equitable
growth. International reserves are now at comfortable levels and a sound medium-term energy
sector reform is in place. Our focus now is on consolidation in the central government to
gradually reduce public debt to 60 percent of GDP in the long term.



Equity and inclusion for our citizens to improve their well being. We are making sure that those
who have the means to pay for public services do so, while we support the poor.



Growth and jobs, in particular for the young, so that Jordanians have an opportunity to work
and improve their economic and social conditions.

5.
We implemented strong policies in 2013, underpinning our objective of macroeconomic
stability and inclusive growth:


Fiscal policy. The year turned out broadly as planned and we met the end-December
performance criterion (PC) on the primary fiscal deficit and the end-December Indicative Target
(IT) on central government accounts payables.



Energy policy. NEPCO’s operating losses were much lower than expected because of the
resumption in gas inflows from Egypt in the fourth quarter. As a result, we met the endDecember PC on the combined public deficit (defined as the sum of the central government
primary deficit and NEPCO losses; see the technical memorandum of understanding). NEPCO
started repaying its overdue invoices, aided by a concessional loan from the Islamic
Development Bank; nonetheless the IT on NEPCO’s stock of arrears was not met as the central
government delayed payments because of incomplete documentation.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

JORDAN



Monetary policy. Prudent monetary policy together with the central government’s efforts built
up reserves and maintained a high level of confidence in the dinar. This was supported by (1) the
successful issuance of two dollar-denominated domestic bonds; (2) the issuance of a Eurobond
in October for $1.25 billion which was guaranteed by the U.S.; and (3) the mobilization of donor
grants. Despite setting a more ambitious target at the time of the last review, the end-December
PC on net international reserves (NIR) was yet again met by a large margin, reflecting private
transfers, higher capital inflows and continued de-dollarization. The end-December IT on net
domestic assets was met as well.

6.

We have complemented these policies with structural reforms (see also Table 2):



Fiscal consolidation. Parliament approved the 2014 budget, which, together with the adoption
of revenue measures, will ensure that the central government finances stay in line with program
targets. We also increased electricity tariffs on January 1, 2014 as envisaged in our medium-term
energy strategy. Moreover, we adopted and published a medium-term strategy to reduce the
losses of the Water Authorities’ of Jordan (WAJ) which exempts the low-income households from
tariff increases. Finally, we strengthened budget commitment controls by issuing a circular with
the 2014 budget that notifies ministries that they can commit only up to general and special
orders which the ministry of finance will issue on a quarterly basis (the total value of these orders
can be lower than the approved budget appropriation).



Equity and inclusion. We submitted to parliament a draft revised income tax law that aims at
not only raising revenue but also at improving the transparency and equity of the tax system.
Moreover, with assistance from the World Bank, we created a national unified registry to better
target subsidies.



Growth and jobs. To improve financial inclusion, we adopted a strategy that addresses supply
and demand bottlenecks (see below). We also expect to shortly license a private credit bureau. In
partnership with USAID, we completed a study to cost existing tax incentives; we will use the
study to reduce incentives, creating a level playing field and promoting entrepreneurship.

MACROECONOMIC STABILITY AND EQUITY
7.
Macroeconomic stability and equity are the cornerstones for sustainable growth. Sound
policies instill confidence and set the stage for inclusive growth. We are committed to continuing with
our efforts started in 2012 by further reducing fiscal imbalances, addressing the losses of public utilities,
and maintaining appropriate external buffers. We are also determined to leverage the stability and
integrity of our banking system to enhance financial inclusion while strengthening the protection of
consumers.
8.
We expect our program to stay broadly on track through March 2014. We estimate to meet
both performance criteria on the central government primary deficit and net international reserves, the
latter by a large margin. Because of temporary shortfalls in gas supply from Egypt, however, the
performance criterion on the overall public deficit is estimated to be missed (see paragraph 20).

68

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JORDAN

A. Public Finances
9.
We will continue fiscal consolidation. For 2014, we are targeting a consolidated public sector
deficit of 8.3 percent of GDP (and 4.5 percent of GDP for the primary central government deficit). Over
the medium term, we are gradually reducing the deficit to 5.1 percent of GDP in 2015 (and 2.9 percent
of GDP for the primary central government deficit) to reach about one percent of GDP in 2017. This will
reverse the upward trend in net debt, which is expected to peak at 87.4 percent of GDP in 2015 and
decline to 76.2 percent of GDP in 2019. To reduce risks and costs, we are also developing a new
medium-term debt strategy, for which we might request technical assistance (TA) from the Fund.
10.
We are doing our best to provide for the Syrian refugees but the fiscal costs are
significant. A recent study financed by USAID estimated the fiscal costs of the Syrian crisis on the
central government and public utilities. The study distinguishes between direct costs to meet the acute
needs of the crisis and indirect costs to re-establish services to their pre-crisis quality. For 2013, direct
costs are estimated at 1.2 percent of GDP. This is broadly in line with what had been included in the
central government budget (with the exception of spending by the health funds, which had accumulated
some arrears; see our memorandum of economic and financial policies of October 29, 2012) and is
implicitly included in the losses of the utilities. For 2014, the study estimates an increase in direct costs
to 1.4 percent of GDP, which has been included in the program. However, we are not able to cover any
indirect costs which are estimated at an additional one percent of GDP (based on depreciated capital
spending).1 Also, this means that our population has been experiencing a substantial decline in the
quality of public services.
11.
Further grants from donors are needed. First of all, gas supplies from Egypt continue to be
unreliable, potentially adding a large burden on fiscal and external accounts. Should there be further
shortfalls in gas supplies from Egypt, additional grants would help close this gap. Regarding the
refugees, donors have already contributed directly or through the UN to provide humanitarian aid.
Because the refugees are not expected to leave any time soon, we need to count on donors’ support in
the future. With local communities already thinly stretched, important in particular are additional grants
to help us return services to their pre-crisis quality and also to increase capital spending toward
fostering higher growth and employment. We appeal to our donors to further step up their support and,
because our public debt has increased in the last years, we will continue to highlight that we will need
assistance in the form of grants.
12.
The ministry of finance (MOF) is coordinating program implementation. In particular, it will
coordinate the issues related to NEPCO and WAJ. Since last year, banks have been reluctant to provide
new financing to public utilities, including the roll-over of existing debt. To ensure that utilities stay
current in their payments and also that NEPCO is repaying its arrears as programmed, the MOF each
month is preparing a rolling 6-month plan of the liquidity needs for NEPCO and WAJ and will transfer
funds as needed. We have started staffing the new macro unit, which will complement the work of the

including transit trade, and an increase in the interest premium.

research department, and expect it to be fully staffed by September. This unit will be in charge of
following up on all aspects of our program. We believe that it will be instrumental in further improving
the monitoring of program implementation, including of the structural agenda.

Central Government
13.
We are reducing the central government primary deficit to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2014. In
particular, in light of the substantial revenue losses over the last years, we are implementing measures to
increase revenue to 22.9 percent of GDP (by 1.6 percent of GDP compared with 2013). Although we will
increase only slightly primary current spending (that is excluding the interest bill) as a share of GDP, we
will cut low-priority spending (including purchases of goods and services and transfers to own-budget
agencies, see paragraph 15) to make room for an increase in the allocation to the health funds
(0.7 percent of GDP). We will also increase capital spending (expected to reach 5 percent of GDP) to
promote economic growth. Our underlying balance will in fact improve more strongly to 4.2 percent of
GDP, when taking into account 0.3 percent of GDP for the clearance of arrears of the health funds.
14.
Our revenue measures in 2014 focus on rebuilding the revenue base in a fair manner
focused on the ability to pay. We have:


Increased the specific excise tax on cigarettes and alcohol to JD0.42 per pack from JD0.32,
which, along with an increase in sales prices, would generate revenue of another 0.35 percent of
GDP.



Increased various fees and charges (revenue impact of 0.4 percent of GDP). These include
increasing foreigners’ work permit fees; visa and residency fees; storage fee in special economic
zones; fees on cross-border trucks; airport and diplomatic services. We have also imposed a new
fee on consular services abroad.



Intensified pressure on public enterprises to ensure that they fully and timely transfer
their surpluses to the central government. This will help avoid a repeat of last year’s shortfall
in nontax revenue. Together with improvements in tax administration and the full-year impact of
last year’s increase in the sales tax rate on mobile phones, this is expected to contribute about
0.6 percent of GDP in extra revenue.



Introduced new fees on exempted imported goods (revenue impact of 0.3 percent of GDP).

Given delays in implementing these measures and uncertainty about fiscal outcomes, we will take
additional revenue measures at the time of the next review in the event of shortfalls from revenue
projections.
15.
The 2014 budget makes spending more pro-growth and pro-poor. The wage bill is expected
to stay at 5.3 percent of GDP. One half of the 8-percent nominal increase is coming from a
reclassification of wages recorded under capital spending in 2013 and the other half from a modest
across-the-board wage increase by 2 percent (equivalent to JD26 million) and the hiring of doctors and
teachers to help cope with the increased demand from Syrian refugees (JD26 million). We expect savings

70

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JORDAN

(0.2 percent of GDP) from a better targeting of cash transfers and a reduction in other transfers, which
will allow us to increase the allocation of the health funds:


Cash transfers. To better target these transfers, we have tightened the eligibility criteria by
proxy means testing (PMT) looking not only into wage income, but also at consumption and
asset indicators. Asset tests, with specified thresholds on car, land, and real estate ownership are
introduced for 2014. To that end, we have further developed the national unified registry
database in the Income and Sales Tax Department (ISTD), with the assistance of the World Bank,
to: (1) link it to other databases; and (2) allow the ranking of families using the PMT
methodology. The first installment was for March and done only after improved eligibility
thresholds could be applied so as to ensure the total benefit transfer is consistent with the 2014
budget allocation (JD210 million), and a better targeting of eligible beneficiaries.



Other transfers. We have reduced transfers to public own-budget agencies by 0.2 percent of
GDP. This reflects on-going efforts to freeze and realign the salaries of their employees with
those of public servants, as well as to merge agencies with similar mandates.

While we not expect this to have any substantial impact on the 2014 budget, we are also planning in the
course of 2014 to review the general food subsidy on wheat flour to prevent abuse.
16.
We are making all efforts in cooperation with parliament on the income tax law seeking its
approval as soon as possible. We have discussed the tax law extensively with stakeholders and, based
on their feedback, submitted it formally to parliament in early February. The law is reversing some of the
changes made by the income tax law in 2009. Specifically, the draft proposes to increase the personal
income tax rates from 7 percent to 10 percent and 14 percent to 20 percent (there are two brackets).
Moreover, it increases the main corporate income tax rate from 14 to 20 percent, while setting a higher
rate of 25 percent for telecommunication and mining companies and 35 percent for the financial
industry.
17.
Passage of the income tax law will set the stage for the next review and the 2015 budget.
An important component of this budget will be our efforts to reduce tax incentives, which have been
estimated to cost the government more than 3 percent of GDP. To make the public aware of this loss
and increase transparency, we have published the list of existing incentives and their cost as estimated
by USAID; we intend to regularly update this list and the resulting costs with the help of TA. We intend
to approve sufficient fiscal measures to cover the program adjustment in the central government
primary deficit in 2015 by end-September 2014 (new benchmark), to allow sufficient time to formulate
the full budget. In line with parliamentary rules, we will also submit by December 15 the draft 2015
budget to parliament in line with program agreements (new benchmark).

Strengthening tax administration will improve efficiency and transparency. The ISTD has
already re-stratified taxpayers into the large taxpayer office, medium taxpayer offices and small taxpayer
offices, which will improve the efficiency of tax collection. The ISTD has also classified taxpayers based
on the International Standard Industrial Classification for better segment management, and has started
to collaborate with the Anti-Money Laundering unit on information sharing. To strengthen the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

71

JORDAN

enforcement capacity of ISTD, we have submitted an amendment to the law on the collection of public
funds to introduce appropriate penalties on tax evasion. Also, we were able to stabilize the level of tax
arrears in 2013. Looking ahead, and with the IMF TA assistance, intend to establish a holistic compliance
management framework by identifying and implementing specific compliance improvement programs
for the high-risk segments, sectors and issues (as done with for the medial sector). The ISTD will also
modernize its audit programs in line with international standards.
19.

Strong public financial management (PFM) will improve governance.



We are repaying arrears and improving the PFM of own-budget agencies. With Fund TA,
our task force on arrears estimated the stock of health fund arrears at 0.7 percent of GDP at
end-2013; these will be gradually repaid. We are on track to roll over the Government Financial
Management Information System to all budget units in 2014 and will extend it to the health
funds in 2015. During the interim, we will computerize the data system of the health funds.



We are also addressing the issue of trust accounts. We have compiled a list of accounts at
commercial banks and by March 2015 will identify those accounts that can be consolidated into
the Treasury Single Account.

Public Utilities
20.
We are steadfastly implementing strategies to return utilities to cost recovery, thus freeing
up room for private sector development. Our main focus is on cost reduction and efficiency
improvements, while exempting the poor from any tariff increases. Electricity tariffs were increased as
planned in January 1. We expect that NEPCO’s losses will not exceed the year-end target of 3.8 percent
of GDP. Because of intermittent gas supplies from Egypt at the beginning of this year, we expect higher
losses in the first half of the year, which we will recoup in the second half. We are working with the
Egyptian authorities to increase the gas supply, but we also stand ready to implement contingency
measures. These could include temporary electricity tariffs or general sales tax surcharges. We will raise
electricity tariffs as announced on January 1, 2015 (new benchmark).
Electricity sector
21.

We are making considerable progress in energy diversification:



Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). We signed on October 31 the contract for the construction of the
jetty that will connect the LNG vessel to the main inland pipeline. Work has started and
completion is expected by March 2015. We also selected our preferred bidder for the supply of
LNG, and expect to sign the main agreement soon (benchmark for April). Supply is expected to
start as soon as the infrastructure is in place.



Renewable energies. We have signed the first round of contracts for the construction of solar
and wind farms which will provide generation capacity of over 100MW. We expect these plants
to start operation in 2015.

72

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JORDAN



Conventional generation capacity. The construction of two modern dual-power plants is on
track. With assistance from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, we expect
them to start operation by mid-2014, making available around 540MW as planned.

22.
We are also improving efficiency. First, we are prioritizing investments on new transmission
lines that will serve renewable energy power plants under construction, so that load capacity is met even
as generation increases. Second, we have signed a contract for a study looking into how to reduce
distribution losses to international standards (with completion expected by end-2014).
Water sector
23.
We have adopted a comprehensive strategy to tackle losses in the sector. Based on this
strategy, the sector would fully recover operating and maintenance costs from their revenue by 2018.
This will mostly be done through cost savings and efficiency gains, in order to minimize the impact on
tariffs. In fact, we have already started to upgrade our network by making the Disi water aquifer
operational in mid-2013 (this has already improved the availability of water for many Jordanians). Tariffs
for different uses will be raised gradually, starting with industrial customers (a first increase already took
place in November 2013), and then for waste-water tariffs for non-poor residential customers (with the
first increase expected by end-2014). We expect that the required large investments will be financed by
the central government budget or our international partners.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
24.
The exchange rate peg will remain the anchor for our monetary policy. It has served us well
over the past two decades, and will continue to underpin stability in our increasingly open economy.
25.
To ensure there are adequate buffers in case of exogenous shocks, the Central Bank of
Jordan (CBJ) will maintain reserves at a comfortable level. For the period between April 2014 and
March 2015, we expect the programmed external financing to be fully received, which has been
confirmed with our development partners. This financing includes grants of $972 million—including
from the GCC ($600 million), the U.S. ($177 million), Saudi Arabia $100 million, and the EU
($83 million)—and loans of $1,564 billion, including from Japan ($9 million), the World Bank
($319 million), the EU ($236 million), and another U.S. guarantee for a Eurobond issue of $1 billion,
which has been approved by the U.S. administration.
26.
The CBJ’s recent conduct of monetary policy was shaped by the need to stimulate
economic activity within the context of the exchange rate peg and the objective of strengthening
external reserves. The CBJ lowered policy rates in August and October 2013 and in January 2014, each
by 25 basis points. The reduction was prompted by the continued positive momentum in the economy,
including robust growth in foreign exchange reserves, sustained de-dollarization, and contained
inflationary pressures. It aimed at creating an environment that is further conducive to economic growth.
In fact, the output gap in the economy remains negative, and the CBJ expects that lower policy rates will
reduce private sector borrowing costs, thereby stimulating credit growth. We will continue to monitor
domestic and regional economic and political developments, and will stand ready to act proactively,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

73

JORDAN

weighing the need to stimulate economic activity with that of safeguarding our international reserve
position and price stability.

C. Financial Sector Policies
27.
We have made progress in implementing the 2009 Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) recommendations toward better compliance with the Basel Core Principles (BCPs). We are
progressing toward implementing a risk-based approach to supervision. Supported by IMF TA, we have
taken steps to strengthen banking supervision and enhance the monitoring of Financial Soundness
Indicators (FSIs). Stress testing and systemic risk analysis have been improved through the publication of
industry standards for stress testing and the establishment of a Financial Stability Department which
performs top-down stress testing and reviews results of stress tests by banks. As planned, we have
published in December the first Annual Financial Stability Report. At the same time, we are gradually
strengthening macro prudential analysis to address potential systemic risks.2 We have issued a
regulation that limits maturity mismatches and requires each bank to have in its credit policy limits on
the debt-to-income ratio for retail customers; these limits are reviewed and approved by CBJ. We
recently finalized the work on a new real estate price index that will allow us to better monitor credit
risks in these sectors; an analysis of the results will be included in the forthcoming Financial Stability
Report.
28.
We will improve the collection and analysis of supervisory data. We have ongoing initiatives
designed to strengthen our capacity to identify emerging risks and facilitate early intervention if
necessary. We plan to complete by June 2014 an automated system for the collection and analysis of
FSIs that will allow regular analysis on a quarterly basis of data submitted by banks no more than eight
weeks after the end of each quarter (new benchmark). The implementation of this system will also
facilitate the completion of an associated project regarding early warning indicators that will enhance
systemic risk monitoring. We plan to conduct further work in the third quarter 2014 to finalize the
design features of a statistical-based early warning model with the assistance of IMF TA for
implementation in 2015. The ultimate goal of these two work-streams is to streamline the collection of
supervisory data via an automated process on a quarterly frequency.
29.
We plan to further develop arrangements for home-host cooperation and expand our
supervision of domestic banks’ cross-border operations. Recent visits have been conducted to
various offshore operations of domestic banks. To complement these efforts, plans are for our riskbased supervision to include onsite reviews to significant offshore operations as part of the normal
supervisory cycle by December 2014. In an effort to enhance the frequency and quality of information
regarding foreign activities by domestic banks, we also plan with the help of IMF TA and in discussing

2

Potential risks to banks’ liquidity arising from non-resident deposits are not a concern. This is because they comprise
mainly of deposits of Jordanians living abroad who have proved a loyal depositor base and, for large banks, also deposits
of NGOs and the UN related to the support of Syrian refugees.

74

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JORDAN

with hosting supervisory authorities to host a supervisory college for the Arab Bank Group in 2015 as a
way to develop closer relationships with them.
30.
We are working on strengthening the crisis management framework for banks. The CBJ
already has in its arsenal crisis management arrangements including lender of last resort and emergency
liquidity facilities. Furthermore, it has very recently established a crisis management committee whose
task is to devise a formal crisis management manual to facilitate dealing with any banking crisis, and
which is expected to discuss its results internally by year-end.
31.
We will seek to maintain the strength of the Capital Adequacy Ratios (CARs) of banks.
Various supervisory initiatives have been introduced to strengthen bank CARs. Importantly, we have
focused on addressing the structural features of bank business models to improve asset quality, increase
coverage ratios for Non-performing Loans (NPLs), and make earnings more stable. We will continue to
encourage banks to maintain comfortable capital buffers to enhance their resilience.
32.
We continue to work on strengthening our regulatory framework. With the help of IMF TA,
we have undertaken initial quantitative assessments of the impact of introducing Basel III. Further
analysis is required, especially in relation to liquidity. The CAMELS risk rating system also requires further
adaptation to facilitate the implementation of Pillar 2 of Basel II and future alignment with the buffer
regime in Basel III and a project to update the examination manual is underway. We are also working on
a revised and more comprehensive corporate governance regulation which we expect to be
implemented by mid-2014.
33.
We remain committed to further enhancing the anti-money laundering and countering
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime. We have prepared a third follow-up report, which
documents progress made toward addressing the deficiencies outlined in the mutual evaluation report
adopted by the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENA FATF) in 2009. MENA
FATF acknowledged such progress in its April 2013 plenary meeting. Going forward, we plan to conduct
in collaboration with other stakeholders, a national AML/CFT threat Assessment, whose objectives are
(i) identifying a list of risk factors that are drawn from suspected threats or vulnerabilities; and
(ii) analyzing the nature, sources, likelihood, and consequences of identified risks. Such an assessment
will help us refine our risk mitigation and prevention strategies. We are currently engaging the Fund to
receive TA in this regard.

GROWTH AND JOBS
34.
High and sustainable growth will create jobs for our people and increase their standards of
living. First, we are focusing on public investment as one engine of economic activity. At the same time,
we are making sure to equip the unemployed among our young people with the necessary skills that put
them to work. We are also supporting growth by broadening access to credit.

A. Improving Investment Quality
35.
We are establishing a framework to improve the management of public investment on
which we are seeking TA from the World Bank. Whether those projects are carried out as traditional
on-budget public procurement, funded by donors, or as public-private partnerships (PPPs), we want to
ensure that they promote growth and reduce unemployment, while their fiscal risks are well managed.
To this end, we plan to establish with assistance from the World Bank a three-step public investment
decision process that covers all line ministries, own-budget agencies, and state-owned enterprises by
December (new benchmark). First, we will develop guidelines on undertaking cost-benefit analyses of
projects, which we expect to complete by September 2014. Such analysis would be the basis for
prioritization by a joint MOF-ministry of planning and international cooperation (MOPIC) committee and
a prerequisite for any new project to be eligible for approval and inclusion in our Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework. Second, we will decide whether the selected projects should be implemented as
on-budget public procurement or PPPs, depending on what is more efficient. We also plan to prioritize
donor-funded projects and include them in the 2015 budget. Third, for all investment projects
(especially the PPPs), the MOF will review their fiscal affordability at each important "decision gateway"
(such as bidding, signing of the contract, renegotiation). We will submit to parliament a PPP law by May
2014.
36.
We are also working on improving the execution of our large existing project pipeline.
Based on a cost-benefit analysis of each project above $250 million, the MOF and the MOPIC will
prioritize by end-2014 those projects that are not yet included in the Executive Development Program.
At the same time, we will review all projects that are not disbursing, in order to identify implementation
bottlenecks, address them, or reallocate funding elsewhere if the project is deemed irredeemably stalled.
37.
We have established a PPP unit in the MOF to manage fiscal risks from PPPs. As a first step,
the unit will start to work on the five pilot projects recently identified with the World Bank. With TA from
the Bank and other donors, the unit will conduct financial viability analyses, including value-for-money
assessments and contingent liabilities, and take at least two fiscally affordable projects to the market
before end-2014.

B. Creating Employment Opportunities
38.
We are implementing the National Employment Strategy (NES), for which we will request
assistance from the World Bank. We are already engaged with the Bank in implementing certain
aspects of the Jordan Jobs Compact to increase access to career guidance, job search, and on-the-job
training among targeted youth. At this point, the project provides a learning platform to test a number

76

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JORDAN

of initiatives, including: (i) school-to-work transition; (ii) job search and matching; and (iii) job readiness
and placement. It is reaching about 14,000 young people. If successful, we stand ready to expand the
project to more participants. Based on our recent NES progress reports, we will seek assistance from the
World Bank to move forward on areas where progress has been slow.

C. Improving the Business Climate
39.
A level playing field will provide higher growth opportunities. The new investment law now
before parliament will create a new investment authority; improve market access for foreign investors;
and establish a One-Stop-Shop with time limits to expedite applications. The law also allows cabinet to
grants exemptions from the sales tax under certain conditions. We will use any such tax incentives only
sparingly. In particular, before granting any incentives, we will cost them. Cabinet will approve them only
in conjunction with compensating measures so that their overall impact on revenue is neutral. We will
also review the incentives regularly and, if the investor does not deliver what had been agreed upon
(including job creation), we will reserve the right to repeal the granted incentive. We have submitted the
draft secured lending law to parliament as well as a draft insolvency law.
40.
The royal committee to reinforce integrity has finalized its recommendations and a
committee to oversee the implementation has been formed. These efforts will be guided by the
integrity charter and executive plan it adopted in December, which brings an integrated approach to the
work of government oversight agencies; and by amendments to the anti-corruption legislation aimed at
strengthening PFM and promoting accountability and transparency in the public sector.

D. Enhancing Financial Inclusion
41.
Our sound banking sector is expected to help boost medium-term growth. The FSIs for
end-June 2013 suggest that the sector remains sound. Indicators point to an improving outlook in 2014,
namely improved asset quality slowing the rate of NPLs and a pick-up in growth in private sector credit.
The depositor base is resilient, with retail deposits accounting for approximately two-thirds of total
deposits and a loan-to-deposit ratio of 68 percent.
42.

We continue to support initiatives to encourage access to credit and financial inclusion.



On the infrastructure side, the establishment of a credit bureau sponsored by a broad base of
credit providers is intended to strengthen financial intermediation. Because it might take time
for the private credit bureau to become operational, we will consider reducing the reporting
threshold to the public registry as an interim measure to capture a larger pool of credit data and
support credit providers until the bureau is operational. The National Payment Council led by
CBJ started several national retail payment projects including mobile payment, bill
presentment, and an Automated Clearing House. These projects are expected to enhance
financial inclusion as well as the efficiency and safety of the payment system.



On the demand side, we will introduce in spring 2014 a regulatory framework for
microfinance with TA from the Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

77

JORDAN

Encouraging access to finance is a core objective of the CBJ, as this form of financing has the
potential to make growth considerably more broad-based and inclusive. While microfinance
accounts for approximately one percent of total lending in the economy, micro borrowers rely
on microfinance for their financing needs. Through the licensing and supervisory regime, the CBJ
will take responsibility for the supervision and oversight of microfinance lenders, providing
transparency and certainty in the relationship between lender and borrower. We are also
working on lowering the financing cost for Small and Medium-Size Enterprises (SMEs) and
Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs) through credit lines from the World Bank and we signed an
agreement with the Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development to get another credit line
of $50 million which is expected to be disbursed during the coming months. Also we will
continue discussing with other international and regional partners to have similar programs. In
particular, the CBJ has designed a framework for Islamic banks to benefit from these lines. The
recently introduced regulations on treating customers fairly are expected to encourage more
SMEs to seek financing from the banking sector.


On the supply side, the CBJ is communicating its strategy on financial inclusion to the market
and has provided banks with low-cost credit lines with long-term maturity as discussed above.
To lower the risk, the Jordan Loan Guarantee Company (owned jointly by the CBJ and banks) has
adopted a new strategy and developed new products; it is increasing playing a more important
role in providing partial guarantees to SMEs and exporters.

PROGRAM MONITORING
43.
We are implementing the recommendations of the CBJ safeguards assessment concluded
in January 2013 in the context of Jordan’s Stand-By Arrangement approved on August 3, 2012. In
particular:


The CBJ financial statements for the year 2013 were finalized by end-March 2014 and included in
the Annual Report. The disclosures in the statements will be further improved, to include
derivative contracts, equity reserves, and significant investments in associates.



We have reviewed procedures and controls over the program monetary data compilation
process, and will ensure reconciliation with the accounting records within six weeks after each
test date in 2014.



We are developing a plan to remove audit qualifications in the CBJ financial statements, to
ensure fair and transparent presentation of assets in the CBJ balance sheet. An external
committee is already looking at the resolution of Petra bank, and work is ongoing to resolve
other outstanding issues. An internal committee in the CBJ was recently formed and tasked with
studying and resolving other outstanding issues.



Work is ongoing to prepare draft amendments of the CBJ law by December 2014, with the view
to strengthen oversight arrangements and legal underpinnings of the CBJ’s autonomy. We have
formed a committee that already prepared a preliminary draft of amendments of the CBJ law,

78

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JORDAN

which was discussed at the CBJ’s high management level. We expect to submit a revised draft—
in line with the recommendations of the CBJ safeguards assessment—to the CBJ board during
the second half of 2014.
44.
Progress in the implementation of our policies will continue to be monitored through
quarterly reviews, quantitative PCs, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks. These are
detailed in Tables 1–2, with definitions provided in the attached Technical Memorandum of
Understanding.

QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, INDICATIVE TARGETS,
AND CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE CRITERIA: DEFINITIONS
A.

Quantitative Performance Criteria and Indicative Targets

4.
The quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets specified in Table 1b attached to the
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) are:


a performance criterion (ceiling) on the primary fiscal deficit of the central government excluding
grants and net transfer to the National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) and the Water
Authority of Jordan (WAJ);



a performance criterion (ceiling) on the combined primary deficit of the central government (as
defined above) and the net loss of NEPCO (“combined public deficit”);



a performance criterion (floor) on the net international reserves (NIR) of the Central Bank of
Jordan (CBJ);



a continuous performance criterion (zero ceiling) on the accumulation of external arrears;

84

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

JORDAN



an indicative target (ceiling) on accounts payable of the central government;



an indicative target on the accumulation of domestic payment arrears of NEPCO;



an indicative target (ceiling) on the net domestic assets (NDA) of the CBJ.

5.
The performance criteria on the central government’s primary fiscal deficit and the combined
public deficit, as well as the indicative targets on the accounts payable of the central government and
the accumulation of domestic payment arrears of NEPCO, are monitored quarterly on a cumulative basis
from the beginning of the calendar year. The performance criterion on the NIR and the indicative target
on NDA of the CBJ are monitored quarterly in terms of stock levels. The performance criterion on the
accumulation of external arrears is monitored on a continuous basis.

B.

Ceiling on the Primary Deficit of the Central Government Excluding

Grants and Net Transfers to NEPCO and WAJ
6.
The central government is defined as the budgetary central government that is covered by the
annual General Budgetary Law (GBL). It excludes the budgets of the 27 autonomous agencies but
includes all ministries and government departments which operate in the context of the central authority
system of the state. The operations of the central government will be measured on a cash basis.
7.
For program monitoring purposes, the primary deficit excluding grants and net transfers to
NEPCO and WAJ of the central government is defined as the sum of: (i) net external financing of the
central government; (ii) privatization receipts received during the relevant period; (iii) net domestic bank
financing of the central government; (iv) net domestic nonbank financing of the central government;
(v) grants received from abroad by the central government, including grants from the Gulf Cooperation
Council; less (vi) domestic and foreign interest payments by the central government; and (vii) net
transfers from the central government to NEPCO and WAJ.
8.
Net external financing of the central government is defined as cash external debt
disbursements received by the central government, less external debt repayments paid by the central
government. The debts covered are debts of the central government (excluding off-budget military
debts) and any foreign debts that are channeled through the central government to finance operations
of the rest of the public sector.
9.
Privatization receipts consist of all transfers of monies received by the central government in
connection with the sale of government assets. This includes receipts from the sale of shares, the sale of
non-financial assets as well as leases and the sale of licenses or exploration rights with duration of
10 years and longer.
10.
Net domestic bank financing of the central government is defined as the change in the
banking system’s claims in Jordanian dinars and in foreign currency on the central government, net of
the balances on government accounts with the CBJ and commercial banks.

11.
Net domestic nonbank financing of the central government is defined as central government
borrowing from, less repayments to, the non-bank sector (including the nonfinancial public sector not
covered by the central government budget, and, specifically, the Social Security Corporation), and the
cumulative change from the level existing on December 31 of the previous year in the stocks of
government securities held by nonbanks and in the float.
12.
Net transfers from the central government to NEPCO and WAJ are calculated as (i) direct
transfers from the central government to NEPCO and WAJ (or NEPCO and WAJ’s creditors) on behalf of
NEPCO and WAJ (including subsidies, cash advances, and payment of debt or government guarantees if
called), minus (ii) any transfers of cash from NEPCO and WAJ to the central government (including
repayments of debt, arrears or cash advances).
13.
Adjustors: The ceiling on the primary deficit of the central government excluding grants will be
adjusted:

Downward by the extent to which the sum of foreign budgetary grants and foreign budgetary
loans—including the Eurobond but excluding non-resident purchases of domestically-issued government
bonds—received by the central government (as specified in Table 1b) during the relevant period falls
short of the levels specified in Table 1b of the MEFP up to a maximum as specified in Table 1b.

C.

Ceiling on the Combined Public Deficit

14.
For program monitoring purposes, the combined public deficit is defined as the sum of: (i) the
primary deficit excluding grants and net transfers to NEPCO and WAJ of the central government as
defined in Section B; and (ii) the net loss of NEPCO.
15.
The net loss of NEPCO is defined as the difference between total operating revenues and total
costs as reported in the unaudited income statement. Total operating revenues are defined as the sum
of: (i) sales of operating power and (ii) all other revenue, excluding proceeds from central government
transfers or payments of NEPCO’s obligation on NEPCO’s behalf. Total costs are defined as the sum of:
(i) purchase of electric power, including fuel costs, capacity and energy charges, and all costs related to
electricity generation to be borne by NEPCO; (ii) any fuel transportation costs; (iii) depreciation costs;
(iv) all other maintenance and operating expenses, including on wages and remuneration of the board of
directors, and provisions; and (v) interest expense and any other financial costs.

Floor on the Net International Reserves of the CBJ

17.
For program monitoring purposes, the NIR of the CBJ in U.S. dollars are defined as foreign
assets of the CBJ minus its foreign liabilities.
18.
Foreign assets of the CBJ are readily available claims on nonresidents denominated in foreign
convertible currencies. They include foreign exchange (foreign currency cash, deposits with foreign
correspondents, and holding of foreign securities), monetary gold, IMF reserve position, and SDR
holdings. Excluded from foreign assets are any assets that are pledged, collateralized, or otherwise
encumbered (e.g., pledged as collateral for foreign loans or through forward contract), CBJ’s claims on
resident banks and nonbanks, as well as on subsidiaries or branches of Jordanian commercial banks
located abroad, claims in foreign exchange arising from derivatives in foreign currencies vis-à-vis
domestic currency (such as futures, forward, swaps, and options), precious metals other than gold, assets
in nonconvertible currencies, and illiquid swaps. Excluded from foreign assets is the outstanding balance
of bilateral accounts with the Central Bank of Iraq of U.S. dollar 1,081 million.
19.
Foreign liabilities of the CBJ are defined as all foreign exchange liabilities to residents and
nonresidents, including commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from derivatives (such as futures,
forward, swaps and options, including any portion of the CBJ monetary gold that is collateralized), and
Jordan’s outstanding liabilities to the IMF. Excluded from reserve liabilities are government foreign
exchange deposits with the CBJ, deposits from public institutions and government departments with
independent budgets, commercial companies with state participation, deposits from donors (including
grants received from the GCC), the two technical swaps with Citibank Jordan for U.S. dollar 80 million,
and amounts received under any SDR allocations received after June 30, 2012.
20.
The stock of foreign assets and liabilities of the CBJ shall be valued at program exchange
rates. As of June 28, 2012 (end-June), the stock of NIR amounted to U.S. dollar 8,556.4 million, with
foreign assets of the CBJ at U.S. dollar 9,707.7 million and foreign liabilities of the CBJ at U.S. dollar
1,151.3 million (at the program exchange rates).


Adjustors: The floors on the NIR of the CBJ will be adjusted upward (downward) by the extent to
which the sum of foreign budgetary grants and foreign budgetary loans—including the
Eurobond but excluding non-resident purchases of domestically-issued government bonds—
received by the CBJ (as specified in Table 1b) during the relevant period exceeds (falls short of)
the levels specified in Table 1b of the MEFP. The downward adjustment will be capped at the
maximum level specified in Table 1b of the MEFP. The floors will also be adjusted upward by the
amount that the outstanding balance of bilateral accounts with the Central Bank of Iraq is repaid,
including both principal and interest payments.

Ceiling on the Accumulation of External Debt Service Arrears

21.
External debt service arrears are defined as overdue debt service arising in respect of obligations
incurred directly or guaranteed by the central government or the CBJ to official and private creditors
beyond 30 days after the due date.

F.

Ceiling on the Accounts Payable of the Central Government

22.
Accounts payable of the central government are defined as the total stock of checks issued
by the central government but not yet cashed by the beneficiary and the liability of the central
government’s trust accounts less deposits in the trust accounts.

G.

Ceiling on the Accumulation of Domestic Payment Arrears by NEPCO

23.
Domestic payment arrears by NEPCO are defined as the belated settlement of a debtor’s
liabilities which are due under obligation (contract) for more than 60 days, or the creditor’s refusal to
receive a settlement duly offered by the debtor. Arrears to be covered include outstanding payments on
wages and pensions; social security contributions; tax payments, and obligations to banks and other
private companies and suppliers. Arrears exclude obligations to the central government arising from net
transfers as specified in paragraph 15.

H.

Ceiling on the Net Domestic Assets of the CBJ

24.
Reserve money of the CBJ is defined as the sum of: (i) currency in circulation (currency outside
banks and commercial banks’ cash in vaults); and (ii) non-remunerated deposits of licensed banks with
the CBJ in Jordanian dinars.
25.
For program monitoring purposes, the net domestic assets of the CBJ are defined as reserve
money less the sum of net international reserves as defined above plus Jordan’s outstanding liabilities to
the IMF. Therefore, the ceiling on NDA is calculated as projected reserve money minus the target NIR.
26.

Adjustors: The ceilings on the NDA of the CBJ will be adjusted:



Upward (downward) by the extent to which the floors on the net international reserves of the
CBJ are adjusted downward (upward)



Downward (upward) by the extent to which the CBJ decreases (increases) reserve requirements
on Jordanian dinar deposits of the banking system. The adjustment will equal the change in the
required reserve ratio multiplied by the stock of deposits with licensed banks at the start of the
first month when the new reserve requirement ratio applies that are: (i) denominated in
Jordanian dinars and; (ii) subject to reserve requirements.

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the CBJ was subject to
a full assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), which was approved on
August 3, 2012. An assessment was completed in January 2013 and found that the elements of a
sound governance framework, as well as requirements concerning Fund disbursements for direct
budget financing, are in place. The assessment made a number of recommendations, which the
authorities have started implementing.
Exchange System: The Jordanian dinar is fully convertible and is officially pegged to the SDR. In
practice, the authorities have an exchange rate regime which is pegged to the U.S. dollar since
October 1995 at JD 1 = $1.41044. Jordan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in
1995 and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
Last Article IV Consultation: The 2012 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on
April 9, 2012. The Staff Report and Executive Board Assessment can be found in IMF Country Report
12/119 at: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=25937.0
Financial Sector Assessment Program: Jordan participated in a Financial System Stability Assessment in
2003, and the related report was presented to the Executive Board at the time of the 2003 Article IV
consultation (SM/04/1). A Financial System Stability Assessment Update was conducted in 2008, and the
report presented to the Executive Board at the time of the 2008 Article IV consultation (SM/09/104).

WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS
1.
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS 2012–15) was discussed by the Bank’s Board of
Directors on January 24, 2012. The World Bank Group is supporting Jordan in its efforts to build
stronger growth resilience and to foster job creation through a three-pronged strategy:


Strengthen fiscal management and increase accountability;



Strengthen the foundation for sustainable growth with a focus on competitiveness; and



Enhance inclusion through social protection and local development.

In light of the government’s increased focus on transparency, public participation and government
accountability, the World Bank Group (WBG) is supporting these efforts across the portfolio.
A CPS Progress Report is scheduled for fiscal year (FY) 14.
2.
As of March 2014, the World Bank’s active portfolio in Jordan consists of thirty five projects
valued at $729 million, financed mainly by IBRD (92 percent of the total portfolio), as well as some
Bank-administered trust funds. The portfolio comprises investments in the Urban Development,
Education, Energy, Environment, Public Sector Governance, Public Administration, Social Services,
and Finance/Private Sectors. Currently, investments in Social Services account for the highest share
of the portfolio at 35 percent followed by the Urban Development Sector at 21 percent. The Bank is
helping to enhance Jordan’s capacity and performance in the areas of governance, fiscal
management, public sector efficiency and private sector-led growth through a programmatic series
of two Development Policy Loans ($250 million each).
3.
The World Bank also provides support on emerging needs to help build Jordan’s resilience
to the Syrian crisis. The large refugee influx from Syria has strained the government’s capacity to
deliver basic services and led to an increase in competition for jobs and social tensions. An
Emergency Loan ($150 million, approved in July 2013) helped Jordan maintain access to healthcare
services (vaccines and supplies) and basic household needs (bread and cooking gas) for affected
households. A complementary Emergency Services and Social Resilience Grant ($50 million
approved in October 2013) leveraged grants from the UK, Canada, and Switzerland, with the Arab
Fund for Economic Development recently having joined in with an additional $10 million. This
project will help municipalities strengthen their service delivery capacity, support local economic
development and foster social cohesion in host communities.
4.
WBG support to private sector development continues to focus on improving the investment
environment, sector competitiveness, Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) financing and
the framework for public private partnerships. IFC has scaled up its investment activities in Jordan
during the last few years, and its portfolio has grown from $50 million at end FY05 to about
$746 million at end-January 2014. IFC has also undertaken an extensive program of Advisory
Services to support private sector development.

5.
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency’s outstanding gross exposure from
investments into Jordan stood at $212.9 million as of end-January 2014. In FY13, MIGA issued a
$13 million political risk insurance guarantee to a U.S. investor for the expansion of the AS Samra
Wastewater Treatment Expansion Project.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 31, 2014)

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance and program monitoring.
National Accounts: While progress has been made over the last few years in improving
quarterly estimates of the national accounts from the production approach, Jordan has still to
develop quarterly national accounts from the expenditure approach. Also, further efforts are
needed to ensure that the compilation of the national accounts is compliant with the System of
National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA). The base year for calculating the GDP at constant prices
should be updated (from the current 1994 to 2010).
Price statistics. An urban-only CPI, based on 12 geographic areas covering all Jordan, is
compiled and released every month. The weights should be updated more frequently than the
current five-year period, using expenditure data from the bi-annual household budget surveys.
Government finance. The authorities have developed a financial balance sheet in accordance
with the classification and sectorization systems recommended by the GFSM 2001 aimed at
further strengthening the stock and flow data that serve as a source for compiling government
finance statistics and for verification of internal and intersectoral consistency.
Monetary statistics: Timeliness of reporting monetary data for publication in International
Financial Statistics is satisfactory.
Balance of payments: The CBJ has adopted the methodology of the fifth edition of the Balance
of Payments Manual (BPM5) for the compilation of the BOP statistics and the international
investment position (IIP), and has disseminated data in the BPM5 format. The implementation of
surveys in the area of services is important for further improving the quality of the BOP statistics.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since

IMF Executive Board Completes Third and Fourth Reviews Under the
Stand-By Arrangement with Jordan and Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation
On April 28, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the
third and fourth reviews of Jordan’s performance under a three-year program supported by a
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) and concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Jordan. The 36month SBA in the amount of SDR 1.364 billion (about US$2 billion, or 800 percent of Jordan’s
quota at the IMF) was approved by the Executive Board on August 3, 2012 (see Press Release
No. 12/288). The second review under the Stand-By Arrangement was approved by the Board on
November 8, 2013 (see Press Release No. 13/435). The completion of the third and fourth
reviews enables the immediate release of SDR 170.50 million (about US$264.7 million),
bringing total disbursements under the program to SDR 852.50 million (about US$1.3 billion).
In completing the third and fourth reviews, the Executive Board approved the authorities’
requests for a waiver of nonobservance for the end-March 2014 performance criterion on the
combined public deficit and for a waiver of applicability for the end-March 2014 performance
criterion on the primary fiscal deficit.
A press release on the Article IV consultation will be issued separately in due course.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Jordan, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:
“The Jordanian authorities remain committed to reforms and prudent policies despite a difficult
environment. Their Fund-supported economic program, focused on reducing external and fiscal
vulnerabilities, remains broadly on track.
“The 2014 budget appropriately targets further fiscal consolidation while protecting the most
vulnerable. Measures to increase central government revenue are welcome and should be

implemented without delay. Contingency measures should be prepared and implemented if
expected revenue gains turn out to be lower than expected and fiscal targets appear at risk.
“Looking further ahead, the medium-term consolidation strategy hinges on further tax reforms to
rein in rising public indebtedness. The new income tax law should aim at bringing the tax burden
in line with that of regional peers. At the same time, tax incentives should be reduced. Continued
implementation of reforms in the energy and water sectors is necessary to return the utilities to
cost recovery.
“Monetary policy should continue to focus on preserving comfortable reserve buffers. While
headline inflation has declined in recent months, a rising trend in core inflation calls for a
continued cautious approach. Financial stability would be further supported by enhancements in
the supervisory frameworks and improvements in financial statistics.
“Faster and more job-rich growth requires regulatory and legislative action to improve the
business climate. There is also a need to step up labor market and educational reforms,
strengthen public institutions, and better prioritize public investment.”

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Jordan
On April 28, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Jordan and also completed the third and fourth reviews of Jordan’s
economic performance under a three-year program supported by a Stand-By Arrangement
(SBA).
A press release on the third and fourth reviews was issued on April 29, 2014 (see Press Release
No. 14/183).
Jordan has faced strong headwinds in recent years, particularly from the Syria conflict and
fluctuations in gas supplies from Egypt. These have been putting pressure on the fiscal and
current accounts. At the same time, unemployment has been persistently high.
Nonetheless, the economy is strengthening gradually. Growth has recovered from the trough of
2.3 percent in 2010 to almost 3 percent in 2013. Headline inflation dropped to 3.3 percent at end2013 (though core inflation remains elevated). The current account (excluding grants) narrowed
to 16½ percent of GDP in 2013, thanks to cheaper energy imports and higher transfers.
Policies were adjusted to exogenous shocks. Fiscal consolidation started in mid-2012, reducing
the combined primary central government deficit and the electricity company’s losses from
14.5 percent of GDP in 2011 to 8.3 percent of GDP in 2014. The consolidation was anchored in
a bold reform of general subsidies, including in the electricity sector.
The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) complemented the fiscal efforts and reserves are now at
comfortable levels. Starting in mid-2013, the CBJ’s focus shifted to stimulating economic
activity by gradually reducing policy rates by a total of 75 basis points. Private sector credit
growth, which slowed in 2012, has recently picked up.

The economy is expected to further strengthen in the next years. Growth is projected to increase
to 3½ percent in 2014, and to 4½ percent in the medium term. Inflation is expected to decline to
about 2½ percent at end-2014, and 2 percent in the medium term. The current account deficit
would gradually improve to about 4½ percent of GDP over the medium term, reflecting mainly a
lower energy import bill. Risks to this outlook remain substantial, mostly related to the Syria
conflict and further fluctuations in gas from Egypt.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to their Fund-supported economic
program, which has buttressed the economy’s resilience in the face of significant external
shocks. Directors noted, however, that Jordan’s continued exposure to adverse global and
regional spillovers underscores the importance of persevering with prudent policies and
sustaining the reform momentum. Directors invited the international community to continue its
support of Jordan’s economic and institutional transformation.
Directors agreed that the 2014 budget strikes an appropriate balance between fiscal consolidation
and supporting growth and encouraged the authorities to implement contingency measures if
their fiscal targets appear threatened. More broadly, they noted that strengthening the fiscal
position over the medium term will require sustained efforts. In this regard, Directors
recommended the rapid approval of the new income tax law which, together with a reduction in
tax incentives, would boost revenue and enhance equity. They also saw scope for streamlining
expenditures, including the public wage bill and remaining universal subsidies.
Directors took note of the staff assessment that Jordan’s exchange rate peg has served the
country well and that the current exchange rate level remains in line with medium-term
fundamentals. They commended the Central Bank of Jordan’s responses to external pressures,
which was instrumental in returning international reserves to a comfortable level. Directors
concurred that lingering inflation risks argue for a continued cautious approach.
Directors agreed that the financial system is generally sound. They encouraged the authorities to
reinforce the framework for cross-border supervision and accelerate implementation of the
remaining Basel II prudential requirements. Directors looked forward to additional efforts to
improve data on financial soundness and welcomed the authorities’ continued efforts to fight
money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
Directors underscored that structural reforms on a broad front are essential to safeguard
macroeconomic stability and bolster Jordan’s social outcomes. They agreed that faster job
creation calls for improving the business climate, reducing skill mismatches, promoting the
participation of women in the labor force, and implementing new employment policies in the
public sector. In this context, Directors welcomed recent steps to facilitate access to finance to
small businesses and looked forward to the approval of the new laws on investment, secured

3
lending, and insolvency. Efforts to enhance transparency and governance, including in tax
administration and public financial management, would also be important.

Statement by Mr. Shaalan on Jordan
April 28, 2014
Jordan continues to implement its economic reform program in spite of a difficult external
and domestic environment. In particular, the spillovers from the Syrian crisis and the
interruption of gas supply from Egypt have imposed substantial costs on the economy,
exerting pressures on fiscal and external balances. The authorities’ prompt response to these
events contributed to the successful implementation of the Fund-supported program. Support
from donors remains essential to maintain the momentum of reform and help shoulder the
burden of hosting the Syria refugees.
Recent developments and outlook
In spite of the impact of the Syrian refugees, who amount to more than 10 percent of the
population, economic activity in 2013 picked up and inflation remained subdued while both
the current account and fiscal deficits were substantially reduced. Additionally, banks’
financial soundness indicators continued to strengthen. These favorable developments
contributed to the buildup of foreign exchange reserves to comfortable levels.
Over the medium-term, economic performance is expected to improve further. A planned
substantial increase in capital spending and a pick-up in private sector activity will help
generate job opportunities. Ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts and the strategy to diversify
energy sources will allow the fiscal and external balances to strengthen, and will thereby
strengthen the economy’s resilience to risks.
Program implementation
Overall performance under the program has been strong. Most quantitative targets and
structural benchmarks were met through the end of 2013. As the final data is not available for
end-March 2014, waivers are being requested on the applicability for the end-March
performance criteria on the primary fiscal deficit and on other PCs where the data will not be
available until mid May. The authorities are also requesting a waiver for nonobservance of
one performance criterion, which is not expected to be met, related to the higher than
programmed losses of the electricity company, NEPCO. The higher losses resulted from a
shortfall in contracted gas supply from Egypt which necessitated the import of more
expensive fuel. NEPCO losses are expected to be recouped in the second half of the year to
bring the related performance criterion back on track.
Fiscal policy
Strengthening public finances remains a top priority to slow the accumulation of public debt
and place the debt to GDP ratio on a declining path. The primary balance of the central
government significantly improved in 2013. During the year, fuel subsidies were

2
discontinued, non-priority government spending was cut, electricity tariffs were raised, and
intensified efforts were made to improve the collection of tax and non-tax revenues.
The 2014 budget strikes an appropriate balance between fiscal consolidation and supporting
growth. The budget includes larger allocations for capital spending and better targeting of
cash transfers, while accommodating the rising fiscal costs of refugees. Revenue measures
focus mainly on adjustments in fees collected under non-tax revenues. All structural fiscal
reforms agreed under the program are proceeding as scheduled. These includes strengthening
public financial management to prevent the recurrence of new arrears, and tax administration
reforms directed at improving tax collection efforts and reducing tax evasion. Looking
forward, tax measures have a key role in the fiscal consolidation given the limited scope for
further reductions in spending. Accordingly, measures are planned to reduce tax exemption
incentives and the government submitted a new income tax law to the parliament in February
that would contribute to rebuilding the tax revenue base.
Strengthening the finances of public utilities is a key component of the program. Besides
raising tariffs, the efficiency of the electricity sector was enhanced through measures to
reduce losses in the distribution system. To diversify energy sources, a liquefied natural gas
port and renewable energy farms are expected to be completed as early as next year.
Monetary and financial sector policies
Monetary policy aims to support economic growth, while maintaining price and external
stability. The exchange rate peg continues to serve Jordan well and helps to maintain price
stability. In line with price developments, the central bank has adjusted its policy rates
throughout the year in response to market developments. After raising rates in 2012 when the
foreign reserves came under pressure, rates were lowered, once foreign reserves were builtup and dollarization significantly decreased, to stimulate bank credit to the private sector.
The banking sector remains sound and resilient. Financial soundness indicators show
enhanced profitability and declining non-performing loans with increased loan provisioning.
Moreover, liquidity and capital adequacy ratios remain strong. A number of initiatives are
under way to strengthen bank supervision and safeguard financial stability. The central bank
issued its first Financial Stability Report last December. Other initiatives include steps to
improve stress testing and systemic risk analysis. An automated data collection system to
enhance the efficiency of bank supervision is expected to be completed in June of this year
and a new corporate governance regulation will be issued soon. Plans also include expanding
supervision of bank cross border operations.
Structural reforms
Ongoing structural reforms aim at boosting economic growth and generating job
opportunities. Besides increasing public investment, the authorities are taking steps to

3
prioritize public projects and improve the business and investment environments. A new
investment law is awaiting parliament approval. This law will facilitate the investment
process, partly through creating a one-stop-shop for investments. A secured lending law and
an insolvency law were also submitted to parliament as recommended by the Fund and
World Bank staff. To help address high unemployment, especially for the young, a National
Employment Strategy is being implemented to facilitate job search and training. To improve
access to credit, in particular by small and medium enterprises and micro-finance institutions,
credit lines have been established with the World Bank and the Arab Fund for Social and
Economic Development.
Finally, the authorities would like to express their appreciation for the continued support of
the Fund and Jordan’s partners.
