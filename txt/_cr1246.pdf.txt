STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Growth has been strong with signs of a broadening recovery, but severe
floods constitute a temporary setback to agriculture and economic diversification. The
precarious global outlook exposes Cambodia’s narrow export base to significant
downside risks. A high degree of dollarization and largely reduced fiscal space
constrain the authorities’ ability to cushion shocks. Against this background,
discussions focused on fiscal and financial sector risk management strategies for the
near term and ways to strengthen foundations for high and stable growth over the
medium term. Past surveillance has been characterized by broad agreement on the
direction of policies, notably safeguarding fiscal sustainability, while progress in
implementing key 2010 FSAP recommendations has been mixed.
Fiscal space. Macroeconomic stability hinges on prudent fiscal policies. While some
fiscal stimulus would be warranted in the event of a severe downturn, the mission
cautioned that fiscal space is limited and that greater consolidation efforts are needed
to strengthen revenue administration and prioritize spending. While the outlook for
external debt sustainability has improved on Cambodia’s prudent track record,
potentially large contingent liabilities from public-private power sector projects need to
be carefully managed.
Elements of greater monetary independence. Although the National Bank of
Cambodia’s (NBC) influence on monetary conditions is very limited, steps should be
taken to normalize monetary conditions amid robust growth and rapid credit
expansion. The pace of tightening can be recalibrated as risks to growth materialize.
This would also signal a strong commitment to promoting the riel, along with progress
to develop an interbank market and upgrade the NBC’s liquidity monitoring.
Financial deepening. In line with ongoing technical assistance (TA) efforts and key
recommendations from the 2010 FSAP, discussions focused on the merits of a
moratorium on new bank licenses, initiatives to develop the foreign exchange market
in conjunction with the recently created stock market, and ways to make financial
system supervision more forward-looking and comprehensive, including by enhancing
the quality of data reported by banks.
Foundations for stronger growth. Policy initiatives to improve the investment climate
are beginning to bear fruit, and their steadfast implementation holds the promise of
raising Cambodia’s growth potential.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
1.
Growth. The economy has
performed well in 2011, but recent floods
add to uncertainty (Figure 1). Garment
exports rose more than 30 percent, led by
robust retail sales in the United States (still
the main market) and improved access into
the European Union (with exports up more
than 60 percent from 2010). Tourist arrivals
have continued to expand at a brisk pace,
while various indicators, including rising
imports of construction materials and a rapid
increase in construction approvals point to a
recovery of the battered real estate sector.
Agriculture was also strong in the first three
quarters—rice exports through September
tripled under the new rice policy—but recent
severe floods have reportedly destroyed
10 percent of the wet season harvest and
could shave 1 percentage point off growth.
Staff estimate overall growth at 5¾ percent
in 2011, but nonagricultural growth at
7½ percent would be the highest in four
years. In 2012, overall GDP growth could
reach 6½ percent notwithstanding sluggish
growth in advanced economies, boosted by
the return of agricultural output to pre-flood

trends, the ongoing recovery in the real
estate sector and still robust garment exports
as Cambodia continues to gain market shares
from improving cost competitiveness and
privileged access to key advanced economies
(Table 1).
2.
Inflation and credit. Inflationary
pressures have steadily increased in 2011 and
headline inflation peaked at 6.7 percent in
September, driven by higher food and fuel
prices and reinforced by strong credit
growth, estimated to exceed 30 percent (y/y).
Inflation is expected to level off in line with
global commodity prices, and would average
about 4½ percent in 2012.
3.
External position and stability. The
current account deficit (including official
transfers) is projected at about 9½ percent of
GDP in 2011–12, reflecting initially a higher
petroleum import bill and strong imports
related to private-public investment, notably
large hydropower projects (Table 2).
However, the current account deficit remains
fully financed through broadening foreign
direct investment (FDI) and official loans.
Gross official reserves rose to US$3 billion in
November (an increase of nearly
US$300 million since the beginning of the
year), equivalent to about 4¼ months of
prospective imports. In the absence of signs
of adverse pressures on external
competitiveness, the riel has remained close
to its post-2008 average in real effective

and low degree of financial integration.
According to BIS data, claims of euro area
banks on Cambodian residents amount to
less than 0.8 percent of Cambodia’s GDP,
compared with an average exposure of
about 5½ percent of GDP for Asian
economies. Nevertheless, adverse
spillovers from turmoil in major global
markets could exacerbate domestic
financial risks stemming from rapid credit
growth and limited banking supervision.

4.
Risks and spillovers. The authorities
broadly agreed with the outlook, but were
more optimistic on the resilience of
agriculture. They concurred with staff that the
fragility of the global recovery exposes
Cambodia’s narrow export base to significant
downside risks.




Cambodia is highly sensitive to economic
activity in the U.S. and Europe, which
account for 70 percent of its garment
exports (60 percent of total exports) and
the bulk of high-end tourist arrivals.
Garment manufacturing and tourism
together are forecast to contribute
3 percentage points, or more than onethird, to growth in 2012. On average, a
1 percentage point decline of growth in
the United States and Europe would result
in about a 1¼ percentage point drop of
growth, making Cambodia a relatively
“high beta” economy in the region. But the
multiplier from a more severe shock could
be substantially larger, as in 2009, mainly
on account of adverse confidence effects.



A high degree of dollarization––the ratio of
foreign currency deposits to total deposits
is 95 percent as of October 2011––
constrains the effectiveness of monetary
policy in cushioning such shocks, leaving
fiscal policy as the main tool for
safeguarding macroeconomic stability.



Severe flooding in Cambodia and Thailand
(the leading rice exporter), constitutes a
major upside risk to rice prices and hence
CPI inflation. A 10 percent increase in rice
prices would push Cambodia’s inflation up
by 2 percentage points, more than
anywhere else in the region.



Under the baseline scenario, growth is
expected to return to its potential of about
7½ percent over the medium term
(Table 3), provided ongoing reforms to
improve the business environment and
upgrade physical infrastructure, and
enhance public sector revenue and service
delivery are steadfastly implemented.



Cambodia’s current account deficit
(including official transfers) would
gradually fall to about 5¾ percent of GDP

Financial spillovers are difficult to predict
because of data limitations, but they would
likely be limited given Cambodia’s
relatively underdeveloped financial system

1

Structural changes, the high degree of dollarization,
and weaknesses in macroeconomic data mean that
standard equilibrium exchange rate models do not
yield statistically significant results in the case of
Cambodia. For example, the macroeconomic balance
approach is highly sensitive to the age-dependency
ratio, which in Cambodia’s case is extremely low due
to the genocide under the Khmer Rouge (1975–79).
Nevertheless, controlling for this factor, the current
account norm is estimated to be about -5 percent of
GDP, broadly in line with the medium-term current
account projections.

by 2016, broadly in line with tentative
estimates of its savings-investment norm,
on the back of robust export growth,
reflecting further diversification and

improved competitiveness, and lower
imports of petroleum and construction
materials with the completion of large
hydropower projects.

KEY ISSUES FOR THE CONSULTATION
A. Creating And Safeguarding Fiscal Space
5.
Developments. Fiscal easing
supported aggregate demand during the
global crisis with the deficit (excluding grants)
rising to over 8 percent of GDP in 2009
(Tables 4 and 5). In 2010, gains in fiscal
consolidation were stronger-than-anticipated
on buoyant revenue and more aggressive
cutbacks in nonpriority current expenditure,
and domestic financing was halved to
1 percent of GDP. However, strengthening the
fiscal position in 2011 has proven more
difficult than envisaged (Figure 2). Progress in
enhancing revenue collection appears to have
stalled and the revenue-to-GDP ratio stayed
broadly at its 2010 level, with full year revenue
expected to fall about ¼ percent of GDP short
of the budget. Spending pressures related to
the recent floods have been appropriately
minimized by re-directing about CR200 billion
from existing capital spending plans for
reconstruction. Nevertheless, with the
supplementary 2011 budget calling for
additional spending of about CR250 billion,
the government deficit (excluding grants) is
expected to exceed 6 percent of GDP,
½ percent of GDP higher than implied by the
initial budget, while the need for domestic
financing will remain sizable (about 1 percent
of GDP).
6.
Discussion. With Cambodia’s
prospects for macroeconomic stability resting

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

on prudent fiscal policies, discussions focused
on: (i) the fiscal space available to address
near-term downside risks and the budget for
2012; (ii) the need for rebuilding fiscal space
over the medium-term through revenue
measures and for safeguarding space by
enhanced monitoring of contingent liabilities;
and (iii) improvements under the public
financial management reform program
(PFMRP) in support of Cambodia’s
development needs and inclusive growth.
7.
How much fiscal space is left to
address downside risks? The staff team
cautioned that the fiscal easing in 2009 already
used up a substantial part of the fiscal space.
In particular, government deposits in the
banking system, which serve as an important
anchor for stability given their role as a flexible
source to finance fiscal stimulus in the absence
of a market for government debt and as a
backstop to potential financial system
fragilities, are running low. In the event of a
severe downturn in 2012, with a growth
contraction comparable to 2009, automatic
revenue stabilizers (and hence revenue
shortfalls) mean that deposits would only be
sufficient for a discretionary spending increase
of 1 percent of GDP (Box 1). The team and the
authorities agreed that in light of very limited
fiscal space, any fiscal contingency plan will
also need to pay particular attention to the

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CAMBODIA

Box 1. How Much Fiscal Space Does Cambodia Have?

Fiscal stimulus in 2009 has substantially
reduced Cambodia’s fiscal space. While public
and external debt-to-GDP ratios are elevated
relative to pre-crisis levels, government deposits in
the banking system have been drawn down
substantially from about 8 percent of GDP in 2008
to 4 percent of GDP in 2011. The government
deposit buffer is key to macroeconomic stability in
Cambodia given the lack of the lender of last
resort capacity of the central bank, still frail public
confidence in the banking system implying a
higher risk of a sudden stop in deposit flows, and
its role as a flexible source of government finance
in the absence of a market for government
securities. The reduction of the fiscal space has
very important bearings on Cambodia’s
vulnerability, at a juncture where tail risk scenarios
continue to overshadow the precarious path of the
global economic recovery. Moreover, Cambodia’s
high degree of dollarization implies that the scope
for countercyclical use of exchange and interest
rates as policy instruments is limited.
This box presents the staff’s assessment of
Cambodia’s fiscal space. For the exercise, we
consider a downside scenario where low real GDP
and export growth in 2009–10 are replicated in
2012–13, resulting in a revenue shortfall (defined
as a gap from trend) similar to that in 2009.1 Under
this scenario, we quantify what would happen to
the fiscal space under different discretionary
spending options.


The government responds to the downside
scenario by boosting discretionary spending
by 1 percent of GDP in the year of the shock
(2012); thereafter, consolidation is as gradual
as after 2009, with the increase in domestic
financing removed only in 2015.

________________________
1
We first estimate trend revenue and then define the
revenue shortfall as a gap between trend and actual. The
estimated revenue shortfalls are in a range between 0.5 to
1.3 percent of GDP, depending on filtering methods.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

No discretionary spending stimulus, with only
revenue-side automatic stabilizers at work.



We draw two main conclusions. First, with a
growth contraction comparable to 2009, automatic
revenue stabilizers (and hence revenue shortfalls)
mean that a stimulus of more than 1 percent of
GDP should be ruled out. Both options A and B will
lead to the government deposit-to-GDP ratio
sliding to less than two standard deviations of past
domestic financing needs in 2012, assuming a
revenue shortfall in 2012 of 1.3 percent of GDP.2 A
gradual withdrawal of stimulus under option A will
exhaust government deposits by 2014. Second,
downside risks would significantly worsen
Cambodia’s external debt sustainability with debt
(in NPV terms) rising above 250 percent of
revenue. Moreover, such a deterioration of
Cambodia’s external debt sustainability would
likely coincide with a tightening of concessional
funding supply from advanced economies severely
hit in a global downside scenario, thereby placing
an additional premium on the need to protect the
government deposit buffer in the banking system.

effectiveness of spending. Efforts should focus
on accelerating high-impact social priority and
infrastructure outlays under medium-term
development projects, and maximizing
synergies with reconstruction of rural
infrastructure after the floods.
8.
2012 budget. The mission welcomed
the consolidation envisaged in the 2012
budget as an important step toward rebuilding
fiscal space. The authorities are committed to
expenditure restraint by keeping the ratio of
current spending to GDP below 11½ percent
of GDP and unchanged from 2011, and to
plans for significant revenue administration
enhancements yielding about ½ percent of
GDP. As a result, domestic financing and thus
the drain on government deposits will be
substantially reduced, while the fiscal deficit
(excluding grants) would be reduced to about
5¾ percent of GDP. In the event that revenue
collection falls short of budget targets, the
authorities indicated they would consider
unwinding cuts in petroleum import duties in
early 2011 to offset higher global fuel prices,
raising “sin taxes,” and speeding up collection
of tax arrears.
9.
Rebuilding fiscal space through
revenue measures. Staff recommended a
medium-term consolidation path that would
avoid undue external and inflation pressures,
and rebuild domestic and external fiscal
buffers, which would enable Cambodia to
bolster its low risk-of-debt distress rating, and
strengthen its ability to absorb future shocks
(Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability
Analysis 2011). Under this path, a reduction in
the deficit (excluding grants) to slightly under
4 percent of GDP in 2016, replenishment of
government deposits in the banking system,
and a reduction of public external debt to the
pre-crisis level of 27 percent of GDP by 2016

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

would be achieved mainly by an increase in
the ratio of tax revenue to GDP (on average by
about ½ percent of GDP per year, consistent
with commitments under the public financial
management reform program). There was
broad agreement that improving the
productivity of Cambodia’s tax system was key
to this plan. Staff estimate that the gap to
potential revenue that could be closed by
strengthened tax administration amounts to
about 3–5 percent of GDP (Country Report No.
11/45, Box 1). However, the team cautioned
that strong and continued efforts will be
required by revenue collecting agencies,
including enforcement of measures adopted
since the previous consultation to enhance
taxpayer compliance and education, and
improve governance within agencies. Trade
liberalization commitments will create
additional pressures to generate revenue from
domestic taxes. While current plans to
strengthen revenue administration are
ambitious but realistic, consideration may
therefore also need to be given to strengthen
direct taxation and enhance buoyancy
including by reducing incentives. The IMF
stands ready to provide further TA both in the
areas of revenue administration and tax policy
design.
10.
Safeguarding fiscal space through
enhanced monitoring of contingent
liabilities. The team noted that rapidly
growing contingent liabilities, if not managed
carefully, could set back efforts at creating
fiscal space. The government’s power
generation expansion plan envisages
completion of 35 projects under public-private
partnerships (PPP) by 2020 with a total
investment cost outside the government’s
capital budget of US$5.4 billion, or about
50 percent of 2011 GDP. Contracts covering
about half of the investment plan have already

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CAMBODIA

been signed. The risks for the government by
providing take-or-pay guarantees may seem
small in light of existing electricity shortages
and conservative demand forecasting
scenarios underlying these projects. However,
the sheer size of these projects, and the fact
that risks for complex infrastructure projects
are difficult to quantify ex ante, call for
continuous and careful monitoring, as they
could severely curtail the fiscal room for
maneuver, in particular in the event of adverse
economic shocks when contingent liabilities
are also more likely to be triggered (Joint
IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis
2011). The authorities agreed with this
assessment and noted significant progress in
designing a public debt strategy and the
creation of a high-level government
committee on public debt management. They
welcomed staff’s suggestions to build on these
new institutional arrangements to enhance the
monitoring of risks related to PPP projects and
close important gaps in the current framework:
These include setting up a central PPP

monitoring unit to evaluate all planned
projects with “gateway powers” to ensure only
sound projects and procurement options are
chosen consistent with the public investment
strategy, promoting greater transparency of
contingent liabilities in the budget law, and
strengthening the legal framework with
respect to competitive bidding and dispute
resolution mechanisms.
11.
Using fiscal space effectively. There
was broad agreement that further progress
under the government’s public financial
management reform program (PFMRP) will
also be important to ensure that greater fiscal
space is used effectively. The team welcomed
progress in the areas of cash management,
budget classification, and technical
preparations for the government’s financial
management information system (FMIS). Key
challenges ahead include a commensurate
capacity build-up, interdepartmental
coordination, and the provision of adequate
funding for the FMIS.

B. Taking Basic Steps Toward Greater Monetary Independence
12.
Developments. The NBC’s influence
on monetary conditions remains very limited.
In the absence of a formal monetary
framework, market-based instruments and an
interbank market, the NBC continues to use
the exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar as an
effective nominal anchor and has sporadically
intervened over the past year, mainly to
smooth seasonal demand and supply
fluctuations. Official reserves have risen as
banks have placed part of foreign currency
returning to the system during the recovery
with the NBC. But while dollarization has
remained stubbornly high, the ratio of official
reserves to foreign currency deposits has
steadily declined, as credit growth has
accelerated and the NBC kept reserve

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

requirements at their post 2009 crisis lows
(Table 6 and Figure 3).
13.
Discussion: role of policy
normalization. The staff team argued that
steps should be taken now to normalize
monetary conditions, consistent with the
robust economic expansion. Gradually raising
reserve requirements amid strong growth
would strengthen perceptions about the NBC’s
commitment to price stability. Keeping reserve
requirements low for too long could also pose
financial risks in light of the still sizable
liquidity overhang in the banking system by
inducing banks to unwind excess liquidity
faster and making adjustment more difficult
when the stance is changed. In the event of an

adverse global economic shock, there is scope
to recalibrate the pace and timing of monetary
normalization. Reserve requirements on
foreign currency deposits should be raised
more than on riel deposits consistent with the
long-term objective of promoting the use of
the local currency. The authorities shared the
teams’ assessment of the monetary stance and
reiterated their commitment to low inflation by
noting that an interministerial working group
had been set up earlier in 2011 to monitor
inflation developments, but preferred to move
more cautiously in normalizing monetary
conditions. In the view, potential financial risks
were tempered to the extent that rapid credit
growth was fueled by lending to agriculture
with attendant diversification benefits.
14.
Role of enhancing the monetary
framework. There was agreement, however,
that heightened downside risks also required
greater efforts at enhancing the monetary
policy framework. In this regard, the team

supported the swift completion of technical
preparations of securitizing central bank
deposits. Used as collateral, such securities
could play a critical role in facilitating the
creation of an interbank market, allowing
banks to more easily manage both riel and
dollar liquidity at a time when global financial
uncertainty is on the rise. The team
encouraged the NBC to publish more frequent
and up-to-date data and analysis on monetary
and credit developments on its website, which
would contribute to better informed decisions
by market participants. Regularly sharing
information with the National Treasury on
government cash flows would be critical for
the NBC to enhance its liquidity monitoring.
There was agreement that progress in all these
areas would not only help reduce uncertainty,
but also create space to pursue carefully
sequenced steps to enhance Cambodia’s
monetary framework consistent with the
national strategy of strengthening the free
flow of the riel.

C. Managing Financial Deepening
15.
Developments. Cambodia’s financial
system is rapidly changing, reinforcing old and
creating new challenges to safeguarding
financial stability. At the same time, progress in
implementing high-priority 2010 FSAP
recommendations is uneven (Table 7). A higher
minimum capital requirement for banks was
implemented as scheduled and noncompliant
banks are being dealt with, and the NBC has
continued to upgrade its supervisory capacity.
At the same time, the launch of a credit bureau
in early 2012 will enable banks to better
manage credit risks. However, work on key
elements of a crisis management framework
remains to be initiated and agreements on the
delineation of responsibilities among different
supervisors are still pending. Coordination has

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

become even more critical after the launch of
the Cambodian stock exchange in July 2011.
Although there are no listings yet and
transactions are allowed to be settled in
U.S. dollars for a transition period of three
years, the stock market will eventually boost
foreign exchange transactions and therefore
also requires upgrading Cambodia’s shallow
foreign exchange market. Finally, based on
recent onsite inspections, efforts at enforcing
existing standards for reliable data, including
for stricter asset classification and provisioning,
will only gradually improve the accuracy of
standard financial soundness indicators, which
may still substantially underestimate credit and
solvency risks (Table 8).

CAMBODIA

16.
Discussion. In coordination with
ongoing TA efforts and guided by the FSAP
recommendations, discussions led to broad
agreement in the way forward to address the
key challenges of building a deeper financial
system in support of Cambodia’s development
while safeguarding financial stability.




Moratorium on bank licenses. While the
2010 FSAP recommended a moratorium
on new bank licenses for as long as
supervisory capacity remains relatively
limited, Cambodia continues to witness a
rapid influx of new banks (Box 2). In
addition to stretching supervisory capacity
too thin, the staff team argued that the
proliferation of banks has made Cambodia
“overbanked.” The current degree of
concentration and fragmentation poses
risks to financial stability, while not
delivering sufficient benefits from
competition and innovation. Given the
long shadow of Cambodia’s financial
history, even a small institution can have a
large impact on public confidence in the
wider system. The authorities saw merit in
the staff’s assessment and are considering
ways to impose a moratorium consistent
with their commitment to a sound banking
system and stable growth.
Developing a foreign exchange market.
The current foreign exchange market is
thin, cash-based, and dominated by
money-changers, and even small stock
market transactions could lead to
disruptive supply and demand imbalances.
The transitory settlement option in
U.S. dollars addresses this concern without
foregoing Cambodia’s long-term objective

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

of de-dollarization. However, there was
broad agreement on the need for a
roadmap (supported by ongoing TA from
the IMF) toward an effective wholesale
foreign exchange market that is noncash
based and open to banks and major
nonbank financial institutions. Staff noted
that consistent with enhancing the
monetary policy framework, the NBC could
gradually step back from the market by
dealing less with retail money changers
and more with banks, while also allowing
some flexibility in the exchange rate to
afford the market a chance of clearing
itself.


Making financial system supervision
forward-looking and comprehensive.
Given the absence of financial safety nets
and the fact that Cambodia’s high degree
of dollarization severely curtails the NBC’s
lender-of-last-resort capability, staff
welcomed progress in enhancing the
prompt corrective action framework.
However, staff expressed concern about
the lack of progress in agreeing on
memoranda of understanding (MoUs)
between the NBC, the Ministry of Economy
and Finance (MEF) and the Securities and
Exchange Commission of Cambodia (SECC)
on shared responsibilities, and to establish
procedures for information exchange and
bank resolution. The authorities agreed
with the team’s recommendation and since
the discussions have begun to set up
working groups be established with
representatives from all supervisory
agencies to jointly prepare MoUs. They
welcomed the offer of IMF TA to these
working groups.

CAMBODIA

Box 2. Bank Competition and Financial Stability1
Cambodia’s banking system is liberalized,
dollarized, and bimodal—a few large banks and a
large number of small banks. The financial system has
a large presence of foreign banks, accounting for
more than two-thirds of the banks and half of total
deposits.
The number of banks in Cambodia has grown
rapidly in recent years, doubling since 2005, which
has implications for bank competition and financial
stability. Notwithstanding the limited financial access,
Cambodia appears to be “overbanked” compared to
developmental peers and regional neighbors,
including countries with substantially higher income
levels and much larger and well-developed financial
systems.

An “overbanked” financial system does not
necessarily imply a competitive banking system.
In Cambodia, for example, it does not seem to have
led to any visible decline in interest spreads. The
economic literature shows competition in the
banking industry, unlike other industries, is less
related to the number of banks but more to the
quality of supervision and transparency in the
banking system. In fact, the proliferation of banks can
weaken financial stability, including through
encouraging excessive risk-taking behavior by banks,
limiting scope for diversification, and overburdening
supervisory capacity. A higher number of banks, even
after controlling for relevant variables, has been
found to be negatively associated with measures of
bank competition across countries (Claessens and
Laeven, 2004).

The notion of “overbanking” here does not refer to financial
penetration (i.e., financial access, currently at 10 percent, is low in
Cambodia) but rather to the “density” of banks (i.e., the number of banks
for a given level of credit, economic activity or population, as used in the
literature, see Claessens and Laeven (2004)).

14

Improving the efficiency of the banking sector
needs to take account of the local conditions and
risks. Since most of the banks in Cambodia operate
in urban centers (mostly Phnom Penh) and offer a
limited range of products, scope for diversification
appears limited for the time being. The presence of a
large number of small banks can also complicate the
nascent monetary transmission channel in Cambodia,
as is common in many developing countries. Any
aggressive expansion plans by the large number of
banks in an increasingly complex financial system can
stretch the supervisory capacity, chiseling away the
benefits from supervisory upgrades.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

factors: (i) quality of banking regulation and
supervision; (ii) absence of an interbank market,
which hampers risk sharing and liquidity
management; (iii) high level of dollarization (i.e.,
limited role of the central bank as a lender of last
resort); (iv) limited foreign exchange reserves.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

D. Building Foundations for Stronger Growth
17.
Developments. After steadily rising
for about 10 years from the mid-1990s,
Cambodia’s potential growth appears to be
slowing, suggesting that early productivity
gains and marginal returns to investment are
diminishing (Figure 4). At the same time,
Cambodia’s economic base remains narrow.
The textile sector dominates manufacturing
and accounts for about 80 percent of all
exports. Tourism, the second largest source of
foreign exchange earnings, is still dominated
by increasing visitor numbers to a single
destination, Angkor Wat. Cambodia continues
to rank low with regard to important
determinants of private investment. But it is
geographically close to the world’s fastest
growing markets, and economic rebalancing
in Asia—including China—offers potential for
future growth from exports to new markets
and inward investment as Cambodia begins
to integrate into the Asian supply chain. In
fact, recent FDI trends and anecdotal evidence
point to a nascent diversification of investors
beyond the garment sector.
18.
Discussion. Against this background,
discussions focused on removing
impediments to investment. The staff team
noted that recent initiatives to improve the
business environment and address
infrastructure bottlenecks hold the promise of
lifting Cambodia’s relatively low investment
rate, and diversifying the investor base
(Box 3). However, it will be important that

specific measures, such as the Anti Corruption
Law and the government’s rice policy to
promote rural development be implemented.
The authorities concurred that further budget
prioritization, in support of critical
infrastructure investment, will also be key in
crowding in more private investment. They
noted that such measures would also help
reduce urban-rural imbalances, thus
promoting more inclusive growth in line with
the Millennium Development Goals (Table 9).
Separately, staff emphasized the importance
of timely, independent, and accurate
economic statistics in improving the
investment climate by facilitating informed
business decisions and enhancing policy
credibility. The authorities welcomed the IMF’s
continued TA in the area of national accounts
statistics.
19.
AML/CFT. There was broad
agreement that enhancements to the
AML/CFT framework can also support the
broader fight against corruption and hence
improve Cambodia’s investment climate. In
particular, the team welcomed the authorities’
plans to address strategic deficiencies
identified by the Financial Action Task Force
and the 2010 FSAP, including the adequate
criminalization of money laundering and
terrorism financing offences, and the
strengthening of the Financial Intelligence
Unit’s resources.

Box 3. Investment as a Driver of Potential Growth in Cambodia
Cambodia’s near double-digit growth prior to the
global financial crisis was a result of a confluence
of favorable factors. In addition to the expansion of
international trade, sustained investment and
improvements in productivity drove potential growth
to an estimated peak of 8.7 percent during
2004–2005.1 However, it has declined since. Assuming
a sustained investment-to-GDP ratio of 20 percent
(close to 2000–10 average) and an absence of further
shocks to productivity or labor supply, potential
growth could reach 7.6 percent in the medium term.
This outlook however will only materialize if a
number of binding impediments to investment and
total factor productivity are successfully removed.

The extent and quality of basic infrastructure in
Cambodia at present is lagging behind many
other lower income economies (Figure 4). Relatively
high electricity cost curbs power consumption and
economic activity. Roads and telephone lines are
scarcer, while the ease-of-doing business rank is
higher in Cambodia. The government is already
addressing many of these gaps; for example,
substantial investments in hydropower and coal-fired
plants should materially lower the electricity costs. If
these efforts succeed in bridging the infrastructural
gaps relative to peers, Cambodia could lift its
investment-to-GDP ratio by about 5 percent, with an
associated boost to potential output growth of over
1 percent. A concerted effort by the government to
improve the quality of basic infrastructure therefore
holds the key to sustaining high potential growth in
the years ahead.

Projection

5% boost to investment rate

9

Investment returns in Cambodia are constrained
by a lack of adequate basic infrastructure such as
cheap electricity, and difficulties of doing
business more generally. As a result, investment
relative to GDP in Cambodia remains one of the
lowest among low-income countries. Low investment
can also inhibit the progress of economic
diversification away from Cambodia’s currently
narrow export base, and in turn hinders overall
manufacturing productivity, creating a vicious cycle
of headwinds to growth.

The potential growth is estimated from a dynamic stochastic
growth model with a Phillips curve, which combines strengths from
the traditional production function and the state space methods.
See Rungcharoenkitkul, “Estimating Potential Growth in Cambodia”
IMF Working Paper (forthcoming).

Meanwhile, investment in human capital should
continue to receive a high priority. Labor
productivity remains an integral driver of Cambodia’s
long-term growth, and will grow in importance as the
economy diversifies and climbs up the value chain of
both the manufacturing and the service sectors. At
present, public spending on education in Cambodia
remains one of the lowest compared to peers. A
sustained investment in human capital will ensure
that long-term growth is more firmly based, as well
as more inclusive.

CAMBODIA

STAFF APPRAISAL
20.
Economic setting. Cambodia’s
economy has performed well in 2011 and
recent severe floods constitute only a
temporary setback to building stronger
foundations for growth. Buoyant garment
exports, a strong tourism sector, and an
emerging recovery of the battered real estate
sector mean that nonagricultural GDP growth
likely reached the highest rate in four years.
However, depending on replanting efforts and
the impact on rice yields, the damage of floods
to agriculture could visibly dent overall growth.
On the back of strong economic activity,
higher global food and fuel prices, and
reinforced by strong credit growth, inflation
rose through most of 2011 and is expected to
ease only gradually. The real effective
exchange rate appears to remain broadly in
line with economic fundamentals.
21.
Outlook and risks. Growth dynamics
point to a favorable outlook for 2012, in part
boosted by the return of agriculture to preflood trends. However, Cambodia’s narrow
economic base means that exposure to global
downside risks is high while policy buffers are
limited, mainly owing to the high degree of
dollarization and largely reduced fiscal space
after the 2009 global recession. Medium-term
growth prospects critically depend on ongoing
reforms to improve the business environment
and upgrade physical infrastructure, and
enhance public sector revenue and service
delivery to provide for Cambodia’s vast
development needs while safeguarding fiscal
sustainability.
22.
Fiscal policy. With significantly less
fiscal space to counter a potential severe
global downturn than in 2009, any fiscal
contingency plan would need to focus on

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

accelerating and reprioritizing spending for
existing high-impact social sector and
infrastructure investment projects. The 2012
budget will help rebuild fiscal space by halving
domestic financing, but further revenue
mobilization over the medium term is key to
strengthening policy buffers, and providing
adequate resources for development. Better
monitoring of sizable and growing contingent
liabilities will be critical to safeguard fiscal
space, while steadfast implementation of
ongoing public financial management reforms
will help to ensure spending effectiveness.
23.
Monetary and exchange rate policy.
Keeping reserve requirements, the NBC’s main
policy tool, at post-crisis lows is inconsistent
with Cambodia’s strong recovery and could
undermine perceptions about the authorities’
commitment to price stability. With credit
growth accelerating, inaction could also
contribute to macro-financial risks. There is
scope, however, to recalibrate the pace and
timing of monetary normalization in the event
of an adverse global economic shock. Better
liquidity monitoring and the creation of an
interbank market are not only important steps
to improve monetary operations consistent
with Cambodia’s longer-term development
strategy, but would also help increase financial
system resilience at the current juncture.
24.
Financial sector policy. The main
challenge ahead is building a deeper financial
system while safeguarding financial stability.
Amid a rapidly growing banking system, a
moratorium on bank licenses would provide a
critical window to build adequate supervisory
capacity and improve the balance between the
degree of competition and health of banks.
Formalizing coordinated supervision and crisis

CAMBODIA

management between relevant government
agencies is essential to reduce systemic risks
and limit potential fiscal costs. Upgrading
Cambodia’s shallow foreign exchange market
will need to be carefully sequenced with
Cambodia’s international financial integration,
the growth of the stock market, and the
development of the overall monetary policy
framework.
25.
Investment. The authorities’ mediumterm structural policies appropriately focus on

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

infrastructure bottlenecks and improving the
investment climate, which would also help
alleviate rural-urban imbalances. Further
strengthening the AML/CFT framework and
better and more timely economic statistics will
also help improve Cambodia’s competitiveness
by reducing the cost of doing business and
facilitating informed decision making.
26.
It is recommended that the next
Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

CAMBODIA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1

January 18, 2012

Approved By

Vivek Arora and Dominique Desruelle (IMF)
Jeffrey D. Lewis and Sudhir Shetty (IDA)

Prepared By

International Monetary Fund
International Development Association

Cambodia has been upgraded to a “medium performer” based on the World Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) and now faces a low risk of debt
distress (from moderate last year). While external debt burden indicators do not breach
the relevant indicative thresholds under the baseline scenario, the debt level is sensitive to
shocks as indicated in standard bound tests.2 Under an alternative scenario with a higher
level of borrowing over the medium and long term, Cambodia may lose its low debt
distress rating. In particular, the scope for absorbing additional risk, including from
contingent liabilities related to the rapid growth of infrastructure projects outside the
budget and the banking system, would be substantially smaller. All this underscores the
need for a prudent borrowing strategy, underpinned by continued fiscal consolidation
over the medium term, and improvements in debt and contingent liability management,
which should be incorporated in the authorities’ upcoming debt strategy document.

1

This DSA has been prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank staffs and in consultation with the Asian Development Bank
(AsDB), using the debt sustainability framework for low-income countries approved by the Boards of both institutions.

2

The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and institutions allow

countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels are policy-dependent. Cambodia’s policies and
institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s CPIA, place it as a “medium performer,” reflecting the 2010 CPIA upgrade. The
relevant indicative thresholds for this category are: 40 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 150 percent for the NPV of
debt-to-exports ratio, 250 percent for the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 20 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio,
and 30 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are applicable to public and publicly guaranteed
external debt.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS CAMBODIA

1.
Cambodia’s DSA indicates that the
risk of debt distress is low. Under the baseline
macroeconomic outlook (Box 1), including
assumptions on growth and fiscal consolidation,
external debt burden indicators do not breach
the relevant indicative thresholds. These
thresholds are higher than in the 2010 DSA,
given Cambodia’s recent upgrade as a medium
performer based on the World Bank’s CPIA
measure of institutional capacity.
2.
Staffs have analyzed an additional
country-specific alternative scenario of
increased bilateral external borrowing.
Assuming a doubling of external borrowing from
the baseline over 2011–21 on less concessional
terms than those from multilateral donors, this
scenario indicates that the scope for absorbing
risks would be significantly reduced and
Cambodia would lose its low debt distress rating.
3.
At the end of 2010, Cambodia’s
external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG)
debt stock was 28 percent of GDP in nominal
terms and 20 percent in net present value
(NPV) terms. Until 2008, strong economic
growth and favorable external conditions
contributed to a decline in debt ratios. However,
in 2009, the external PPG debt ratios rose, partly
reflecting an increase in the overall fiscal deficit
against the backdrop of the global recession. For
2011, the debt stock in PV terms as a share of
GDP, as a share of exports of goods and
nonfactor services, and of government revenues
is projected at 20 percent, 39 percent and
154 percent, respectively. The past DSA (2010)
baseline macroeconomic scenario broadly
matches the macroeconomic developments, with
slightly higher-than-projected growth outcome
in recent years, but no tangible impact on debt
dynamics.

Around half of Cambodia’s external
debt is held by multilateral creditors, primarily
the AsDB (27 percent) and the World Bank’s IDA
(18 percent). China is the largest emerging
creditor, accounting for about 66 percent of total
bilateral disbursements in 2010. Cambodia
remains in arrears to the Russian Federation and
the United States. Following a Paris Club
agreement in 1995, Cambodia concluded
agreements with France, Germany, Italy, and
Japan. The status of negotiations of outstanding
debt obligations with the Russian Federation and
the United States has effectively remained
unchanged since the last DSA. Currently,
Cambodia is not servicing its debt with either of
these creditors, and efforts to conclude

agreements with each under the framework of
the Paris Club are required. Since prospects
for resolution are unclear, the current DSA

assumes no restructuring in its baseline, with
arrears continuing to build up throughout the
projection period.

Box 1. Cambodia: Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA (2011–31)
The Cambodian economy has performed well in
2011 with overall growth at slightly below
6 percent, on the back of robust garment exports,
rising tourism income, and a recovering real estate
sector. The recent severe flood is a temporary setback,
but agricultural activity should revert back to trend by
2012, pushing GDP growth to 6½ percent.
Inflation is projected to average 5.6 percent in 2011,
before gradually declining toward 3 percent in the
medium term.
The potential growth rate of Cambodia in the medium
and longer terms has been upgraded to 7–8 percent,
on the assumption that Cambodia will continue
implementing necessary reforms in a steadfast and
evenhanded manner (for detailed analysis of the drivers
of potential growth see Box 3 in the accompanying staff
report). There has been some encouraging progress,
such as a rising global market share in garment exports,
large investments in hydropower projects that soon will
substantially lower the cost of electricity in Cambodia
which remains three times as high as in neighboring
countries, and an emerging diversification of FDI
beyond the garment manufacturing sector.
The external current account deficit (including official
transfers) is projected to be above 9 percent of GDP
during 2011–13, before trending toward 5 percent of
GDP in the longer term. A higher current account deficit
in the short term reflects high import contents of the
build-operate-transfer (BOT) hydropower projects,
which are incorporated in the macroeconomic

framework from 2011 onward. These imports are fully
financed by corresponding FDI flows. As the
construction of these power plants is completed, FDI as
a share of GDP should stabilize at around 6 percent,
while imports of construction materials and petroleum
for electricity production should also level off. Official
transfers including loans and grants are programmed to
continuously decline as a percentage of GDP in line
with rising per capita income. With a positive outlook
for export competiveness and FDI, and a narrowing
current account deficit in the longer term, gross official
reserves in months of next year’s imports are expected
to gradually rise from 4.3 months in 2011 toward
5 months in the long run.
Projected fiscal consolidation is an important anchor
of macroeconomic stability in the medium term and
beyond. The overall fiscal deficit in terms of GDP
(excluding grants) is expected to narrow from about
6 percent in 2011 to less than 4 percent in 2016, before
gradually falling to 2½ percent by 2031. Revenue would
be the main driver of consolidation and is expected to
rise to over 14 percent of GDP (excluding grants) by
2016 from about 12 percent of GDP in 2011 in line with
targets adopted in the PFM reform program. Revenue
(excluding grants) is assumed to increase to
16½ percent of GDP over the long term, implying that
gaps in the productivity of Cambodia’s tax system
vis-à-vis regional peers would gradually be closed.
Public expenditure would remain mostly at around
18 percent through the medium term, and kept below
19 percent up to 2031

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
5.
All external debt indicators remain
below the policy-dependent debt burden
thresholds under the baseline scenario, and no
thresholds are breached under standardized
stress test. The main results of the external DSA
are as follows:


All debt indicators in the baseline
scenario are expected to decline over
the 20-year projection period (Table 1a).
During the projection period, the PV of the

debt-to-GDP ratio decreases from
20 percent in 2011 to about 14 percent in
2031 (compared to an indicative threshold
of 40 percent), while the PV of the debt-toexports ratio decreases from 39 percent in
2011 to 27 percent in 2031 (compared to
an indicative threshold of 150 percent).
The PV of the-debt-to-revenue ratio
declines from 154 percent in 2011 to
80 percent in 2031 (indicative threshold:
250 percent). The debt service-to-exports

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS CAMBODIA

and debt service-to-revenue ratios stay
well below the indicative thresholds
throughout the entire projection period
due to concessionality of previous debts.


The standard stress tests do not reveal
any serious vulnerability (Table 1b and
Figure 1). A one-time 30 percent
depreciation and the shock to exports
push the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio to
212 and 219 percent respectively,
highlighting the need for improved
revenue performance.

6.
An additional country-specific
alternative scenario considers the impact of
increased borrowing (Tables 3a and 4a). This
scenario illustrates how increased borrowing
(US$880 million during 2011–21, about double the
amount envisaged under the baseline scenario)
under consideration by the authorities can affect
debt sustainability.3 The terms for most of this
additional borrowing are assumed to be
comparable to bilateral loans from emerging
donors: 60 percent of the loans are at 2 percent
interest rate with grace period and maturity of
7 and 20 years.4 With no information on the
nature or the type of projects to be financed in the
higher borrowing scenario and the fact the
potential growth has already been upgraded since
the last DSA to 7–8 percent, the alternative
scenario does not assume any “growth dividends.”
Limited administrative capacity of the government
to manage debt-financed capital investment and
challenges in public financial management would

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

further reduce the likelihood of any growth
dividend. The main results under this borrowing
scenario are as follows:


There would be a significant accumulation
of external debt, with the total debt stock
rising to 38 percent of GDP (NPV of debt-toGDP at 29 percent) over the medium term.



In several bound tests, the indicative thresholds
are breached for a prolonged period of time
(Figures 3 and 4). The increased borrowing
would therefore push the debt distress rating
from low to moderate.



Moreover, the return to sustainable debt
levels would become more difficult if
contingent liabilities, which tend to correlate
with shocks under the bound tests, were
triggered. Given the large exposure to BOT
projects as noted in the accompanying staff
report, if problems in only 1 out 10 BOT
projects arose potentially leading to a total
loss of investment costs, an additional
5 percent of GDP would be added to the
debt stock. Similarly, based on international
experience, a banking crisis for a country
with a financial depth as in Cambodia during
the DSA projection period could add about
10 percent of GDP to public debt.5



Apart from impairing Cambodia’s ability to
absorb shocks, the scenario also underscores
the need to raise tax revenue as planned. If
the revenue-to-GDP ratio stagnates, higher
fiscal deficits would push public debt close to
the sustainability threshold.

5

Based on the pace of financial deepening (e.g.,
credit-to-GDP ratio) during the last decade, over the
DSA projection period, Cambodia’s credit-to-GDP is
expected to reach or exceed that of the median
emerging market (EM) economy (Rishi et al., 2010).
Empirical studies show that the median direct fiscal
cost of banking crises in EMs is 11.5 percent of GDP
(Laeven and Valencia, 2010).

CAMBODIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
7.
Given the predominance of external
debt, public debt dynamics closely track that
of the external debt. Cambodia does not have,
and is not expected to have in the foreseeable
future, a market for domestic government debt
securities.
8.
The nominal stock would increase
modestly to 29 percent of GDP (21 percent of
GDP in NPV terms) by end-2011 and then
gradually decline after 2012, reflecting the fiscal
consolidation envisaged under the baseline over
the medium term (Table 2a). The PV of public
debt-to-GDP ratio and the public debt service-torevenue ratio would decline gradually over the

long term to 14 percent and 64 percent
respectively. The debt service-to-revenue ratio
remains low in most scenarios for the entire
projection period under the baseline.
9.
Public debt dynamics are adversely
affected by a permanent growth shock and
accommodative fiscal stance. Under a
permanent growth shock, the level of public debt
(as a share of GDP) continues to rise to over
35 percent of GDP (in PV terms). If the primary
balance remains unchanged at 2011 level, the PV
of public debt-to-GDP continues to rise to
28 percent increase by 2025 and then declines
gradually (Table 2b).

DEBT MANAGEMENT
10.
The authorities are close to finalizing
their formal debt strategy. Staffs welcomed the
significant progress in designing a public debt
strategy and the creation of a high-level (sevenmember) government committee on public debt
management, chaired by the Minister of Economy
and Finance and co-chaired by the Governor of
the National Bank of Cambodia. The debt strategy
considers alternative borrowing plans and
assesses associated risks. The debt unit at the MEF

is also building its capacity, including through TA
provided by the AsDB, for analyzing contingent
liabilities from the BOT projects and the financial
sector. The authorities also acknowledge the
importance of a comprehensive approach to debt
management, a transparent and objective
management of investment projects, and the
need to maintain concessionality of new
borrowing. Once finalized, the debt strategy is
expected to be published in early 2012.

VIEWS OF THE AUTHORITIES
11.
The authorities were in broad
agreement with the DSA. They underscored that
government borrowing would be undertaken only
for investment in a few critical sectors (e.g.,
infrastructure such power, roads, ports, irrigation)
and that they would strengthen capacity to assess
the budgetary, debt, and growth implications of

investment projects. They also welcomed
suggestions to strengthen monitoring BOT
projects with a view to minimizing fiscal risks.
Regarding the alternative scenario with higher
borrowing, the authorities concurred that elevated
borrowing would lead to Cambodia’s losing the
low distress rating.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

CONCLUSION
12.
In the staffs’ view, Cambodia is at low
risk of debt distress based on external
indicators under the baseline scenario and the
higher thresholds as a medium performer. The
baseline projections and the associated standard
stress tests show limited risk related to external
debt given that none of the indicators breaches
the indicative debt burden thresholds. However,
in view of Cambodia’s low domestic revenue base,
risks to total debt and debt service need to be
managed through further strengthening revenue
efforts over the medium term.
13.
The increase in debt ratios under an
alternative scenario with a higher borrowing
path highlights the need for a prudent
borrowing strategy and careful management

of public debt. This exercise also underscores the
importance of effective management of new debt
accumulation and any contingent liabilities from
the rapidly growing BOT projects and the financial
sector. Increased borrowing will significantly
reduce the government’s ability to tackle any
future crises within the sustainability thresholds.
14.
The staffs encourage the authorities to
build on recent steps and move forward as
quickly as possible to strengthen debt
management capacity. In this regard, it will be
important to continue the work under way to
develop and implement a comprehensive debt
management strategy and to closely monitor the
contingent liabilities from the BOT projects and
the financial sector.

2/ Includes both public and private sector external debt. The years in the table refer to calendar years.
3/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections, also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Debt service-to-exports ratio

Debt service-to-revenue ratio

Sources: Cambodian authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), noninterest current account in percent of GDP, and nondebt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

2/ Includes both public and private sector external debt. The years in the table refer to calendar years.
3/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections, also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Memorandum item:
Grant element assumed on residual financing (i.e., financing required above baseline) 6/

Sources: Cambodian authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), noninterest current account in percent of GDP, and nondebt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

incurred by Cambodia to the IMF before
January 1, 2005. This resulted in the forgiving of
all of Cambodia’s outstanding debt to the IMF, a
total of SDR 56.8 million (about US$82 million).
The authorities intend to spend the resources over
a number of years, initially on rural irrigation
projects. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC)
transferred the full MDRI proceeds to the Ministry
of Economy and Finance effective March 2006.

Safeguards Assessment
A voluntary safeguards assessment of the NBC
was completed in January 2010 at the request of
the authorities. The assessment updated the
previous voluntary assessment completed in
March 2004. The assessment found that the NBC
had taken steps to strengthen aspects of its
safeguards framework, although important
measures proposed in 2004 are still outstanding
or in progress. Some new risks have emerged in
the area of external audit. The assessment made
appropriate recommendations.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Payments
System
Cambodia’s exchange regime is classified as
stabilized. The official exchange rate, which is
expressed in riels per U.S. dollar, applies to all
official external transactions conducted by the
central government and state enterprises, and is
used for accounting purposes by the NBC. It is
determined by the foreign exchange market, with
the official rate adjusted to be within 1 percent of
the market rate on a daily basis.
Cambodia accepted the obligations of

Article IV Consultation
Cambodia is on the standard 12-month
Article IV consultation cycle. The last Article IV
consultation discussions were held in Phnom
Penh during August 30–September 10, 2010.
The Executive Board discussed the staff report
(IMF Country Report 11/45) and concluded
the consultation on October 29, 2010.
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
The joint IMF-World Bank FSAP mission took
place in March 2010 and the assessment was
completed in October 2010.

ANNEX II. CAMBODIA: IMF-WORLD BANK
COLLABORATION
(December 2011)
The Bank and the IMF country teams for
Cambodia, led by Mr. Mathew Verghis (Lead
Economist, EASPR) and Mr. Olaf
Unteroberdoerster (IMF Mission Chief for
Cambodia), maintain a close working
relationship and have an active dialogue on a
range of macroeconomic and structural issues.
Recent key areas of cooperation and
coordination include:




4

Macroeconomic policy advice to the
authorities. The IMF and the World Bank
staffs have consulted each other on key
macroeconomic policy messages to the
authorities to avoid sending conflicting
messages. The staffs adopted a joint stance
on the complex question of the 2009
national accounts. The two teams also
regularly share information outside
missions, and discuss and exchange
institutional views on key macroeconomic
developments. Bank staff share and discuss
the monthly fiscal monitor, translated
Budget Law (English version) and the
quarterly review of macroeconomic
developments. IMF staff share policy notes
and other mission preparatory documents.
Financial sector reform/TA and FSAP.
World Bank and IMF teams have worked
closely together while undertaking the
March 2010 FSAP. The two teams sent
respective representatives jointly in 2009 to
appraise the authorities about the purpose,
structure, output, and requirements of an
FSAP. The two teams also regularly
communicated on financial sector

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

developments throughout the assessment.
The FSAP was completed in October 2010.
Following the recommendations by the
FSAP, it is expected that technical assistance
(TA) will be deployed in subject areas akin to
the FSAP and close coordination between
the IMF and the World Bank will continue.


Public financial management and tax and
customs administration reform. Both
institutions are working to strengthen
coordination of work on public financial
management, and tax and customs
administration reform. Both teams share as
much as possible the work done in this area.



Article IV consultations. IMF Article IV
consultations regularly share their
macroeconomic data with the World Bank
and hold working sessions to try and
reconcile macroeconomic data sets. The
collaboration is closest on the debt
sustainability analysis, a joint product, but
extends more broadly into other areas of
the consultation as well. This is extremely
important for both institutions in
Cambodia’s scarce data context. World
Bank staff are also invited to and do
participate in some of the key meetings.



Structural reforms. The IMF staff and the
World Bank teams have worked together
to share views on a range of other issues,
including structural reforms for a better
investment climate (and competitiveness
issues), customs modernization, rural
development, and de-dollarization.

CAMBODIA

The new Resident Representative (Mr. Faisal
Ahmed) was appointed in July 2011. The
presence of a locally-based representative has
further deepened collaboration on economic
and debt sustainability analysis and the IMF’s
involvement on the Public Financial
Management Reform Program.
Based on the above intensive partnership,
the World Bank and the IMF share a
common view about Cambodia’s
macroeconomic and structural reform
priorities. These include:


Sustaining the recovery. As of
December 2011, a broad-based recovery
is well under way. However, it needs to be
sustained with appropriate fiscal
consolidation and continued management
of the banking sector risks, against the
backdrop of global uncertainty.



Building foundation for stronger
growth. After steadily rising from the
mid-1990s, potential growth appears to
be slowing. Removing impediments to
investments would be the key to promote
stronger growth.



Creating fiscal space. Macroeconomic
stability critically depends on prudent fiscal
policies. Fiscal space to address near-term
downside risk is limited and greater fiscal
consolidation efforts are needed to rebuild

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

space, including through improving revenue
administration, prioritizing spending, and
better monitoring of contingent liabilities.


Building credibility for greater monetary
independence. Normalizing monetary
conditions would guard against macrofinancial risks and signal a strong
commitment to de-dollarization, along with
progress to develop an interbank market
and upgrade the NBC’s liquidity monitoring.



Managing financial deepening.
Implementing the key recommendations of
the 2010 FSAP would be critical to
safeguard financial stability. These include
implementing a moratorium on new bank
licenses, developing the foreign exchange
market in conjunction with the recently
created stock market, and strengthening
the financial system supervision.



Improving governance. Both the World
Bank and IMF have stressed the critical role
of governance in improving the quality of
service delivery and the business
environment.

The teams are committed to continue the
close cooperation going forward. The table
below details the specific activities planned
by the two country teams over the next
12-month period along with their expected
deliveries.

ANNEX III. CAMBODIA: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(December 2011)
From 1992 through December 2011, the Asian
Development Bank (AsDB) approved funding
of US$1,433.51 million including 56 loan
projects of US$1,174.8 million with low
interest, and 22 Asian Development Fund
(ADF) grants of US$258.71 million to
Cambodia for structural reform programs and
development projects. To date, 39 loan
projects for a total of US$882.54 million and
5 ADF grants of US$56.51 million have been
completed.
The sector composition and loan/grant
amount of the remaining active portfolio as of
December 2011 is as follows: (i) agriculture
and natural resources, US$158.5 million;
(ii) education, US$51.6 million; (iii) energy,
US$20.0 million; (iv) finance, US$30.0 million;
(v) health, nutrition, and social protection,
US$10.0 million; (vi) public sector
management, US$55.1 million; (vii) transport
and communication, US$148.26 million; and
(viii) water supply, sanitation, and waste
management, US$21.0 million.
The AsDB’s overarching goal in Cambodia is
inclusive and diversified economic growth and
poverty reduction. The AsDB’s Country
Partnership Strategy ((CPS) 2011–13),
endorsed in July 2011, supports
implementation of the government’s updated
National Strategic Development Plan 2009–13
(NSDP Update)1 and focuses on poverty

reduction and inclusive growth with an
integrated approach to rural development; on
the promotion of urban-rural linkages
(including connectivity); and the enhancement
of human capital by improving rural water
supply and sanitation, and access to quality
general education and industry-relevant
technical and vocational education and
training (TVET). The CPS 2011–13 prioritizes
five sectors: (i) transport; (ii) water supply,
sanitation, and urban development;
(iii) agricultural and natural resources;
(iv) education and training; and (v) finance, as
well as a facilitating sector, public sector
management. The CPS also identifies four
critical country challenges of climate change,
decentralization, rural-urban linkages, and
regional cooperation. The CPS incorporates
five key cross-cutting themes into all
activities—private sector development,
governance, gender equity, knowledge
solutions, and partnerships.
The AsDB’s geographical focus remains the
Tonle Sap basin where the CPS supports
sustainable natural resource use and
management; stimulates the growth of
competitive farms and rural enterprises; builds
sustainable rural infrastructure, including
irrigation, to strengthen productivity, market
connectivity, and competitiveness;
and improves food security and climate
resilience in agricultural production. AsDB
interventions on transport will focus on
expanding the provincial and rural roads
network to promote connectivity and trade
and tourism activities in Cambodia and the
Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

CAMBODIA

The AsDB will continue its support for the
Cambodia Millennium Development Goal
targets for improved water supply and
sanitation for the large number of people
without access in urban and rural areas. In
urban areas, we will work to manage the
challenges of rapid urbanization and provide
basic services and infrastructure to meet the
needs of the poor and stimulate the growth of
value chains. The AsDB will develop urban
environmental infrastructure (drainage, water
supply, and sanitation, as well as selective
infrastructure to improve the business
environment) in border towns and secondary
growth centers around the Tonle Sap basin. In
education and training, the AsDB will
concentrate on the completion of nine years of
basic education, leading to further education
and training by promoting equitable access
and quality and focus on formal and informal
TVET for men and women to respond to labor
market needs and the demands of business,
and to improve rural incomes.
In finance, the AsDB will continue its leading
role in the financial sector to (i) consolidate the
banking reforms achieved to date, upgrade
financial infrastructure, and strengthen the
regulatory capability of the National Bank of
Cambodia; (ii) support microfinance expansion
through regulatory and institutional reforms,
and consider appropriate reforms to stimulate
SME finance; and (iii) support ongoing reforms
to develop the insurance industry. The AsDB
will support implementation of the recently

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

updated Financial Sector Development
Strategy (2011–20). The CPS also includes
support for government measures to deepen
public sector management reform and
strengthen anticorruption measures. For
decentralization and deconcentration, the
AsDB will support the program-based
approach under the three-year
implementation plan (2011–13) in functional
assignments, fiscal decentralization (including
public financial management capacity
development), and subnational financing
mechanisms such as the Sub-National
Investment Facility.
In the area of private sector development, the
AsDB assists the government’s efforts in
improving competition policy and regulatory
efficiency; strengthening the investment climate
and innovation; continuing trade policy reforms
and trade facilitation (customs and sanitary and
phytosanitary standards for food safety); and
leverage public-private partnership
opportunities. Assistance has also been provided
to help the government improve its
competitiveness at the GMS level through
reducing border-related costs and distortions;
improving physical infrastructure; enhancing
transport and trade facilitation, including
promoting compliance with SPS standards. Later
interventions would be more focused on
improving the trade facilitation and logistical
links to the subregion as systems and procedures
become more developed and integrated.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 27, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation
with Cambodia
On February 3, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation 1 with Cambodia on a lapse of time basis. Under the IMF’s lapse of
time procedures, the Executive Board completes Article IV consultations without convening
formal discussions.
Background
The economy has performed well in 2011, but recent floods add to uncertainty. Buoyant
garments exports, increasing tourist arrivals, and a gradually-improving real estate sector have
supported a broadening recovery. Agriculture was also strong in the first three quarters—rice
exports through September tripled under the new rice policy—but recent severe floods are
expected to exert a transient setback. Staff estimates overall GDP growth at 5¾ percent, but
nonagricultural growth is forecast to exceed 7½ percent, the highest in four years. Assuming
agriculture will return to pre-flood trends, overall GDP growth is forecast to reach 6½ percent
in 2012.
Inflationary pressures increased in 2011, driven by higher food and fuel prices and reinforced by
strong credit growth estimated to exceed 30 percent (y/y). Headline inflation is expected to
average 5¾ percent in 2011 and to ease only gradually in 2012, in part reflecting a moderation
in global commodity prices.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

The current account deficit (including official transfers) is projected at about 9½ percent of GDP
in 2011–12, reflecting a higher petroleum import bill and strong imports related to large
hydropower projects. However, the current account deficit remains fully financed through
broadening foreign direct investment and official loans. Gross official reserves rose to
US$3 billion in October, equivalent to about 4¼ months of prospective imports. In the absence
of signs of pressures on external competitiveness, the riel has remained close to its post-2008
average in real effective terms and is broadly in line with fundamentals.
Economic growth is expected to return to its potential of about 7½ percent in the medium term,
provided reforms to improve the business climate and upgrade physical infrastructure, and
enhance public sector revenue and service delivery are steadfastly implemented. Cambodia’s
current account deficit would gradually fall to about 5 percent of GDP by 2016, in line with
estimates of its savings-investment norm, on the back of robust export growth, reflecting further
diversification and improved competitiveness, and lower imports of petroleum and construction
materials with the completion of hydropower projects.
The fragility of the global recovery exposes Cambodia’s narrow export base to significant
downside risks. Cambodia is highly sensitive to economic activity in the U.S. and Europe, which
account for about two thirds of its total exports and the bulk of high-end tourist arrivals. Any
immediate financial spillovers, however, would likely be limited and mostly indirect. A high
degree of dollarization constrains the effectiveness of monetary policy in cushioning such
shocks, leaving fiscal policy as the main tool for safeguarding macroeconomic stability.
However, a largely reduced fiscal space from the previous crisis and the need to preserve
financial stability limit the scope to cushion such shocks. On the other hand, upside potential
could stem from better-than-expected returns on investments in the power sector and rural
infrastructure areas, against the backdrop of positive spillovers from Asia’s economic
rebalancing.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2011 Article IV consultation with Cambodia, Executive Directors endorsed
staff‘s appraisal, as follows:
Cambodia’s economy has performed well in 2011 and recent severe floods constitute only a
temporary setback to building stronger foundations for growth. Buoyant garment exports, a
strong tourism sector, and an emerging recovery of the battered real estate sector mean that
nonagricultural GDP growth likely reached the highest rate in four years. However, depending
on replanting efforts and the impact on rice yields, the damage of floods to agriculture could
visibly dent overall growth. On the back of strong economic activity, higher global food and fuel
prices, and reinforced by strong credit growth, inflation rose through most of 2011 and is
expected to ease only gradually. The real effective exchange rate appears to remain broadly in
line with economic fundamentals.

3
Growth dynamics point to a favorable outlook for 2012, in part boosted by the return of
agriculture to pre-flood trends. However, Cambodia’s narrow economic base means that
exposure to global downside risks is high while policy buffers are limited, mainly owing to the
high degree of dollarization and largely reduced fiscal space after the 2009 global recession.
Medium-term growth prospects critically depend on ongoing reforms to improve the business
environment and upgrade physical infrastructure, and enhance public sector revenue and
service delivery to provide for Cambodia’s vast development needs while safeguarding fiscal
sustainability.
With significantly less fiscal space to counter a potential severe global downturn than in 2009,
any fiscal contingency plan would need to focus on accelerating and reprioritizing spending for
existing high-impact social sector and infrastructure investment projects. The 2012 budget will
help rebuild fiscal space by halving domestic financing, but further revenue mobilization over the
medium term is key to strengthening policy buffers, and providing adequate resources for
development. Better monitoring of sizable and growing contingent liabilities will be critical to
safeguard fiscal space, while steadfast implementation of ongoing public financial management
reforms will help to ensure spending effectiveness.
Keeping reserve requirements, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC)’s main policy tool, at
post-crisis lows is inconsistent with Cambodia’s strong recovery and could undermine
perceptions about the authorities’ commitment to price stability. With credit growth accelerating,
inaction could also contribute to macro-financial risks. There is scope, however, to recalibrate
the pace and timing of monetary normalization in the event of an adverse global economic
shock. Better liquidity monitoring and the creation of an interbank market are not only important
steps to improve monetary operations consistent with Cambodia’s longer-term development
strategy, but would also help increase financial system resilience at the current juncture.
The main challenge ahead is building a deeper financial system while safeguarding financial
stability. Amid a rapidly growing banking system, a moratorium on bank licenses would provide
a critical window to build adequate supervisory capacity and improve the balance between the
degree of competition and health of banks. Formalizing coordinated supervision and crisis
management between relevant government agencies is essential to reduce systemic risks and
limit potential fiscal costs. Upgrading Cambodia’s shallow foreign exchange market will need to
be carefully sequenced with Cambodia’s international financial integration, the growth of the
stock market, and the development of the overall monetary policy framework.
The authorities’ medium-term structural policies appropriately focus on infrastructure
bottlenecks and improving the investment climate, which would also help alleviate rural-urban
imbalances. Further strengthening the Antil-Money Laundering/Counter-Financing of Terrorism
(AML/CFT) framework and better and more timely economic statistics will also help improve
Cambodia’s competitiveness by reducing the cost of doing business and facilitating informed
decision making.
