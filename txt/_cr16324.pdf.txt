IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Sudan

On September 7, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Sudan.
Sudan is a low-income fragile country facing significant domestic and international constraints and
large macroeconomic imbalances despite efforts made toward macroeconomic stability and growth.
Following the shock of the secession of South Sudan five years ago, policy adjustments helped to
contain the fiscal deficit, slow money growth, reduce inflation, and support economic recovery.
Institutional reforms strengthened tax collections and public financial management, and social
spending increased. Despite these efforts, however, large macroeconomic imbalances—triggered by
the loss of three-quarters of oil exports—continue to constrain growth prospects, along with weak
policies, internal conflicts, and U.S. sanctions. Domestic and international efforts to end internal
conflicts have yet to bear fruit, and the humanitarian situation remains difficult. Sanctions and the
withdrawal of correspondent bank relations weigh on trade, investment, and growth. Absence of
progress toward debt relief limits access to official external financing.
While good harvests boosted growth to close to 5 percent in 2015, external imbalances widened due
to low commodity export prices, expansionary policies, and insufficient exchange rate adjustment.
The terms-of-trade shock widened the current account deficit to 6 percent of GDP in 2015, while the
already low foreign exchange reserves dropped to 1½ month of imports despite external financial
support. The parallel exchange rate continued to depreciate and the premium soared to 165 percent
as the official rate remained virtually fixed. The budget deficit widened to 1.9 percent of GDP owing
to shortfalls in oil revenue. Inflation, which had been contained to 12.6 percent at end-2015 (from
25.7 percent a year before), rose to 16.5 percent in July 2016.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms
the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
The outlook is subject to significant downside risks. Low commodity export prices, absence of policy
buffers, economic sanctions, the withdrawal of foreign correspondent banking relationships, and a
weak business environment will continue to constrain economic activity. Consequently, growth is
expected to remain modest at 3–3½ percent in 2016 and beyond. The fiscal framework faces risks
due to low tax revenues and uncertain oil revenues. Large external financing gaps are likely to persist.
Sudan remains in debt distress and is eligible for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Large external debt and arrears hinder access to external financing and
weigh heavily on development prospects. Sudan’s arrears to the Fund declined to about
SDR 969 million at end-June 2016 following payments of $10 million each in 2014 and 2015, and
$5 million in the first half of 2016. The authorities intend to continue to engage with international
partners to secure support for debt relief and the lifting of sanctions, which would pave the way for
foreign investment and financing for growth and poverty reduction. They are committed to
strengthening cooperation with the IMF on policies and payments.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the progress made toward macroeconomic stabilization and growth
following South Sudan’s secession in 2011 and against the backdrop of a challenging external
environment. Directors regretted, however, that large macroeconomic imbalances, exacerbated by
low commodity export prices, continue to constrain growth and development prospects. They
encouraged the authorities to accelerate and sustain broad-based reforms to achieve
macroeconomic stability, address vulnerabilities, and promote inclusive growth.
Directors stressed the importance of continued fiscal consolidation. They encouraged the authorities
to contain spending on goods and services while protecting social spending, prioritizing capital
spending, and accelerating ongoing revenue administration reforms. Directors considered that, given
Sudan’s low tax revenues, stronger domestic revenue mobilization is essential to generate fiscal
space for investment and social spending in the medium term, and to achieve pro-growth fiscal
consolidation.
Directors called for tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check. They noted that this would
require continued adherence to limits on central bank advances to the government, limiting
quasi-fiscal activities to levels consistent with monetary targets, and developing liquidity
management instruments. Directors also called on the central bank to strengthen its capacity to
mitigate financial stability risks. They welcomed Sudan’s removal from the Financial Action Task
Force’s “gray list,” and called for continued strengthening of the AML/CFT framework.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used
in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors emphasized the need to adjust the exchange rate and move toward greater flexibility, with
a view to improving competitiveness and significantly reducing the parallel market premium. They
encouraged the authorities to prepare a timetable for the removal of foreign exchange restrictions
and multiple currency practices as soon as possible.
Directors encouraged the authorities to advance structural policies to foster sustained and inclusive
growth. They supported reforms to improve the business environment for the private sector, financial
inclusion, and the quality of spending to support human capital. Directors called for expanding social
safety nets and improving their targeting to reduce poverty, and welcomed initial preparations of a
Poverty Reduction Strategy.
Directors recognized that garnering international support for debt relief is critical for Sudan’s
economic development. Continued engagement with international partners to secure comprehensive
support for debt relief would pave the way for foreign investment and financing for growth and
poverty reduction. Directors called for minimizing non-concessional borrowing and avoiding
selective servicing of bilateral debt. They encouraged the extension of the “zero option” agreement
with South Sudan before it expires in October 2016 and strengthening the joint outreach for debt
relief by the two countries. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to strengthen
cooperation with the Fund on policies and payments. They advised the authorities to make regular
payments to the Fund that are at least sufficient to cover Sudan’s obligations falling due and increase
them in line with improvement in Sudan’s payment capacity.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Sudan is a low-income fragile country facing significant domestic and
international constraints and large macroeconomic imbalances despite notable
progress toward macroeconomic stability and growth. Following the shock of the
secession of South Sudan five years ago, policy adjustments helped to contain the fiscal
deficit, slow money growth, reduce inflation, and support economic recovery.
Institutional reforms strengthened tax collections and public financial management, and
social spending increased. Despite these efforts, however, large macroeconomic
imbalances—triggered by the loss of three-quarters of oil exports—continue to
constrain growth prospects, along with weak policies, internal conflicts, and U.S.
sanctions. Domestic and international efforts to end internal conflicts have yet to bear
fruit, and the humanitarian situation remains difficult. Sanctions and the withdrawal of
correspondent bank relations weigh on trade, investment, and growth. Absence of
progress toward debt relief limits access to official external financing.
Developments, outlook, and risks. Despite progress made toward macroeconomic
stability and growth—and good harvests boosting growth to close to 5 percent last
year—renewed efforts are needed. External imbalances widened in 2015–16 due to a
negative terms-of-trade shock, increased monetization of government operations, and
limited exchange rate flexibility. The already low foreign exchange reserves dropped to
one-and-a-half month of imports despite external financial support, while the parallel
exchange rate continued to depreciate and the premium soared as the official rate
remained virtually fixed. The fiscal deficit widened and the budget faces risks due to low
tax revenues and shortfalls in oil revenue. The outlook is subject to significant downside
risks. Large external financing gaps are likely to persist, heightening risks of disorderly
adjustment in case of shortfalls in external financing. As a result, macroeconomic
stability and growth rest on early policy adjustment and external aid.
Policy recommendations. The authorities should accelerate policy consolidation and
reforms to achieve macroeconomic stability, address vulnerabilities, and promote
inclusive growth. Policies should include greater exchange rate flexibility; increasing
fiscal revenue to create space for growth-enhancing public infrastructure and social
spending, while reducing the fiscal deficit and tightening monetary policy; enhancing
financial sector resilience; strengthening social safety nets; and improving the business
environment for private investment and job creation.

SUDAN

Debt relief. Sudan remains in debt distress and is eligible for debt relief under the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Large external debt and arrears hinder
access to external financing and weigh heavily on development prospects. Sudan’s
arrears to the Fund declined to about SDR 969 million at end-June 2016 following
payments of $10 million each in 2014 and 2015, and $5 million in the first half of 2016.
The authorities should continue to engage with international partners to secure support
for debt relief and the lifting of sanctions, which would pave the way for foreign
investment and financing for growth and poverty reduction. Strengthening cooperation
with the IMF on policies and payments should also continue.

Sudan is a low-income fragile country facing significant domestic and international
constraints and large macroeconomic imbalances. Decades of internal conflicts and
U.S. sanctions have undermined economic stability and growth. While the start of oil production in

Economic stabilization efforts have
borne some fruit. Since 2012, the authorities
have launched reforms to adjust to the loss of oil
revenues. Measures included exchange rate
adjustments, subsidy reductions, fuel price hikes,
and tax increases. Tax collections and public
financial management were strengthened, and
social spending was increased to mitigate the
impact of the adjustment on the poor. The
reforms, supported by a Staff-Monitored
Program (SMP) in 2014, helped reduce the fiscal
deficit, slow money growth, ease inflation, and
support growth. The authorities’ recent five-year
reform plan for 2015–19 continues in the same
direction.

liquidity creation. The virtually fixed official exchange rate contributes to foreign exchange
distortions and shortages, and low import tax collections. Actions against violations of U.S. sanctions
since mid-2014 contributed to the withdrawal of correspondent bank relations (CBRs), which
hampers foreign trade and investment and weighs heavily on growth. Absence of debt relief limits
access to official external financing.
Box 1. Tax Revenue Mobilization
Sudan’s tax revenues are among the lowest in low- and lower-middle income countries (LLMICs). Tax
revenues represented only 6.3 percent of GDP compared to 12 percent of GDP on average in fragile LLMICs
in 1995–2015 (figure). With little improvement
over the period, this gap has been increasing.

strengthen tax administration, tax revenues increased only marginally in percent of GDP in 2015 due to low
imports and an overvalued official exchange rate. This limited the available fiscal space and constrained progrowth investment and poverty-reducing social spending.
Sudan’s tax revenue is lower than expected at

Sudan’s tax collection efficiency is relatively low. VAT efficiency—measured by the revenue collected in
percent of GDP divided by the standard tax rate—is only 0.19 per percentage point, placing Sudan below
the 25th percentile of the distribution and well below the median of 0.37. While at 17 percent its VAT rate is
similar to its peers (in the range of 15–18 percent), the low efficiency suggests large tax exemptions and/or
weaknesses in tax administration.

Box 1. Tax Revenue Mobilization (concluded)
Furthermore, Sudan has one of the lowest direct tax revenues among LLMICs, collecting only
0.6 percent of GDP. This is explained by low personal and corporate income tax rates, high exemptions and
tax holidays, and low compliance due to weak administration.
There is significant scope to raise tax
revenues in Sudan. Out of 36 African
LLMICs, Sudan ranked 34th in terms of tax
effort, with a tax revenue gap of 6.1 percent
of GDP (Torres, 2016). The study estimated

Domestic and international efforts to resolve internal conflicts and address the
difficult humanitarian situation are underway. The U.N. counts 3.1 million internally-displaced
persons and about 360,000 refugees (many from South Sudan), and provides humanitarian support
to some 5.4 million people (15 percent of the population). Armed conflicts have been endemic in
some areas of Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile states, and a 21,000-strong UN-African Union
(AU) peacekeeping force has been stationed in Darfur since 2007. The government launched a
national dialogue in 2015, but the process was boycotted by key opposition parties and armed rebel
groups. In early 2016, a roadmap for peace was launched under the auspices of the AU with support
from the international community, but has yet to be agreed by all parties. In May, the government
held a referendum on the permanent administrative status of Darfur and in June declared a
unilateral cessation of hostilities in South Kordofan and Blue Nile.
5.
Implementation of the recommendations of the last Article IV has been mixed (Box 2).
Current spending was contained, including through initial steps to reduce fuel subsidies. However,
the limited response thus far to ongoing tax administration reforms has delayed fiscal consolidation
and constrained monetary control. Importantly, no progress was made towards greater exchange
rate flexibility.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

Box 2. Response to the 2014 Article IV Consultation Key Recommendations
Exchange rate: greater exchange rate flexibility

No progress. The CBOS adjusted the official exchange rate by only 2 percent in July 2015 while the
gap with the parallel market rate widened to 122 percent in mid-June 2016. International reserves declined.
Fiscal policy: fiscal consolidation through revenue mobilization and restrain of current spending,
including a gradual phase-out of fuel subsidies

Limited progress. While current spending was contained, the drop in oil revenues and slow progress
in increasing non-oil revenues led to a widening deficit.
Monetary policy: tighter monetary policy

Limited progress. Inflation declined from 25.7 percent at end-2014 to 14.3 percent in June 2016,
partly on account of lower food prices. At the same time, reserve money growth was higher than expected
due to central bank financing of the government and agriculture.
Structural policy: improve the business climate and invest in human and physical capital

Limited progress. In the absence of relevant reforms, Sudan’s ranking in the 2016 World Bank Doing
Business Survey dropped one position to 159th among 189 countries. Low domestic revenues constrained
social spending and public investment.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
6.
In 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, good harvests boosted economic growth and
reduced inflation. However, weak commodity export prices and expansionary policies widened
external imbalances, which remain an important stability risk.


Non-oil real GDP grew by 5.8 percent in 2015 (up from 2.7 percent in 2014), driven by
agriculture and services, while oil-GDP contracted by 10 percent.



The declining trend in inflation started
to reverse in recent months. Inflation
slowed to 12.6 percent in December

Transfers from South Sudan comprise transit fees for the use of Sudanese oil pipelines and payments under the
Transitional Financial Arrangement to compensate Sudan for the loss of oil exports.

Gold exports have become a significant source of foreign exchange for the official sector. Losses arise because the
CBOS purchases gold from domestic producers in local currency at a price that reflects the parallel exchange rate,
exports the gold, and sells the foreign exchange proceeds at the more appreciated official rate.

The external position—structurally weakened by the loss of oil revenues following South
Sudan’s secession—was hit by a negative terms-of-trade shock in 2015, compounded by
expansionary policies. The current account deficit (on a cash basis) widened to 5.9 percent of
GDP (from 4.8 percent of GDP in 2014), largely owing to lower prices for Sudan’s commoditybased exports (mainly livestock, gold, oil, and sesame) and high oil import-financing costs. Nonoil imports also increased significantly. In the first quarter of 2016, the trade deficit widened to
1.1 percent of GDP (from 0.7 percent in the same period of last year) on account of weak
commodity exports.

depreciated by 36 percent between end-2014 and end-June 2016, which increased the parallel

injections into weak banks have resulted in
CBOS and government fully or partially owning 15 of the 37 banks, and their restructuring has been
lagging. In October 2015, following significant strengthening of its framework for Anti-Money
Laundering and Combatting the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), Sudan was removed from the
Financial Action Task Force’s “gray list” of countries subject to monitoring.
8.
Enforcement actions against violations of U.S. sanctions contributed to the withdrawal
of CBRs and complicated bank operations. This resulted in high import financing costs and rising
difficulties in international transactions, including remittances, which may result in greater reliance
on cash transactions and associated AML/CFT risks (Box 3).

The CBOS sets two official exchange rates: an “indicative” rate and an “official” rate (within ±4 percent) which
applies to public transactions and customs valuation. The difference between the two is currently less than 2 percent.
Commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus are required to set their rates within ±4 percent of the indicative
rate, but in practice they trade at top end of the band. Thus, the official rate differs by more than 2 percent from the
commercial banks’ rate. Since January 2014, the CBOS devalued the official rate by only 7 percent, of which 2 percent
in 2015.
4

Staff estimates that the parallel market covers about 50 percent of imports—up from 30 percent in 2013 due to
changes in foreign exchange regulations in mid-2014 that allowed exporters to sell their proceeds directly to
importers. Based on a weighted exchange rate between the official and the parallel markets, the effective premium is
about 63 percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Box 3. Withdrawal of Correspondent Bank Relations
Enforcement actions against international banks in mid-2014 for violating U.S. sanctions contributed
to a substantial withdrawal of foreign CBRs of Sudanese banks. In June 2014, BNP Paribas pleaded guilty
to violating U.S. sanctions against Sudan and other countries, and was ordered to pay $8.9 billion in
forfeitures and fines. In 2015, Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank also faced fines for violating U.S. sanctions.
Among other factors, this contributed to a substantial withdrawal of CBRs of Sudanese banks. Foreign and
local entities based in Sudan reported difficulties and delays in processing foreign exchange transfers to and
from Sudan. The central bank and commercial banks reported a significant reduction in the number of
foreign correspondents (one large bank reported having only 15 correspondent banks in 2016 compared to
55 a year ago) or an almost complete cut-off from international transactions. According to a recent report by
the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure, Sudan lost almost half of its CBRs between 2012 and
2015, representing a 15 percent drop in volume. Banks had to pay higher fees and post full cash collateral;
the CBOS authorized “nil value” imports financed offshore; and one bank reported plans to open branches
abroad to carry out international transactions.
Available data suggest a slowdown in trade since the withdrawal of foreign CBRs. Import financing
(e.g., through letters of credit) by both the CBOS and commercial banks slowed in 2015. Difficulties in
repatriating export proceeds reportedly

cash transactions would jeopardize hard-won
progress on the implementation of the
AML/CFT framework.

A persistent breakdown of CBRs would weigh on economic and social outcomes. Constraints on
financing imports and repatriating export proceeds may reduce trade and foreign investment. Shortage of
imported goods, including foodstuffs and energy, would increase inflation and depress consumption.
Difficulties in processing international transactions will lead to continued shortages of foreign exchange,
which will put pressure on the exchange rate. Constraints on transferring remittances may impact the most
vulnerable. These adverse developments would contribute to further dampening economic growth, and
ultimately worsen social outcomes and poverty.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Low commodity export prices, economic sanctions, and lack of policy buffers, will
continue to jeopardize macroeconomic stability and constrain growth, requiring continued
external assistance.


Staff expects growth to slow to about 3 percent in 2016 as crop production returns to normal
levels after good harvests last year. Inflation could increase owing to the lagged effects of the
parallel exchange rate depreciation and wearing out of the positive impact of good harvests on
food prices. Despite a recovery of gold exports along with the improved outlook for world
prices, the current account deficit is expected to remain high and international reserves low in
the absence of progress towards greater exchange rate flexibility and sufficient fiscal and
monetary policy adjustment, even if the external financial support anticipated by the authorities
materializes.



In 2017 and beyond, staff expects growth to remain at 3.5 percent and largely reliant on
agriculture—with attendant spillovers to other sectors—as low domestic savings, sanctions, and
limited access to external financing weigh on investment. The overvalued official exchange rate
and foreign exchange restrictions will also weigh on trade and economic activity despite
anticipated foreign direct investment (FDI) in agriculture. Inflation will likely remain elevated as
insufficient fiscal consolidation continues to weaken monetary control. The external position will
remain weak, with a financing gap of $1.3–1.9 billion per year that will need to be covered by
foreign aid, allowing international reserves to hover around $1 billion (1 month of imports).

10.
The outlook is subject to significant downside risks. The large and persistent external
financing gaps over the medium term, if unfilled, could lead to disorderly adjustment, depressed
economic activity, and rapid inflation. Mitigating these risks while maintaining the fixed exchange
rate regime will require significant fiscal and monetary adjustment. Other downside risks include
lower oil receipts from South Sudan; reduced FDI and remittances from the Gulf; and continued
withdrawal of CBRs. Progress with the national dialogue and the roadmap for peace is an upside
risk.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
Policy discussions focused on the urgent need to achieve macroeconomic stability,
raise inclusive growth, and reduce poverty. Staff emphasized that current policies—maintaining
the fixed exchange regime without significant fiscal and monetary policy adjustment—are
unsustainable and are raising the likelihood of disorderly adjustment. In this regard, staff called for
decisive policy actions and reforms:


Greater flexibility of the official exchange rate, with a view to liberalizing the foreign exchange
market and reducing external imbalances.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

SUDAN



Continued fiscal consolidation focused on mobilizing domestic revenues, with a view to
generating fiscal space for investment in infrastructure, education, and health, while reducing
the budget deficit and its monetization.



Tighter monetary policy, including by limiting quasi-fiscal activities of the central bank.



Strengthened social safety nets to mitigate the cost of adjustment on vulnerable groups.



Improved business environment to support private sector growth.



Continued engagement with international partners to progress toward debt relief and the lifting
of sanctions.

A. External Stability and the Exchange Rate
12.
Exchange rate flexibility would support fiscal and monetary policies to reduce
external imbalances. Macroeconomic stability will require tight fiscal and monetary policy, but will
remain elusive without greater flexibility of the official exchange rate, with a view to significantly
reducing the parallel market premium. Moreover, widening (or eliminating) the band for the
commercial bank rate would help liberalize the foreign exchange market for banks. These reforms
will help strengthen competitiveness, increase FDI, and promote inclusive growth. Efficient operation
of a more flexible foreign exchange regime would require developing an interbank market and
strengthening reserve management, including by establishing rule- and market-based interventions.
13.
Staff presented an illustrative scenario with adjustment of the official exchange rate
accompanied by a tighter policy mix. In this scenario, growth would likely be slower and inflation
higher in the short term due to the impact of devaluation on imports, prices, and customs receipts.
However, macroeconomic performance would improve over the medium term as the elimination of
foreign exchange distortions would improve competitiveness and encourage FDI. In staff’s view, the
inflationary effects of official exchange rate devaluation would be manageable, as most prices
already reflect the parallel rate. The revenue gains from the devaluation may be significant, as
imports would be valued at a higher exchange rate, increasing the import tax base.
14.
Measures to mitigate the impact of exchange rate adjustments on the poor are critical
for the success of reforms. Staff proposed maintaining temporarily the subsidy regime for fuel and
wheat to allay concerns over the social impact of greater exchange rate flexibility. The higher
subsidy costs could be covered by the revenue gains from the devaluation. The CBOS should use all
available instruments to forestall second-round effects of exchange rate adjustment on inflation.
Authorities’ views
15.
The authorities shared staff’s assessment regarding the need to reduce external
imbalances, but prefer a more incremental approach than proposed by staff’s illustrative
scenario. They considered large exchange rate adjustments destabilizing—both economically and

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

socially—and premature without sufficient foreign exchange reserves to prevent overshooting. In
their view, a flexible exchange regime is a long-term objective. They expressed concern about the
inflationary impact of exchange rate adjustment, its effectiveness given price-inelastic commoditybased exports, and the risk of the social unrest that followed the September 2013 devaluation. Their
reform strategy, as per the Five-Year Program, is to gradually allow the private sector to use the
parallel foreign exchange market to import key commodities, and to gradually adjust the official rate
and diversify exports in the medium term. In the meantime, the authorities anticipated continued
foreign aid from Gulf countries to cover financing gaps.

B. Fiscal Consolidation and Revenue Mobilization
16.
The 2016 budget poses risks despite ongoing efforts to strengthen tax administration
and treasury management. Given lower oil revenues and transfers from South Sudan, the targeted
deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP will be difficult to achieve. Full spending of budget appropriations
would bring it close to 3 percent of GDP, implying sizable recourse to CBOS financing.
17.
In the short term, fiscal consolidation is needed to curb monetization of the deficit and
contribute to the external adjustment. Limiting the 2016 deficit to 1.9 percent of GDP would be
consistent with manageable domestic financing. This would require, like last year and in the first
quarter of 2016, containing spending on current goods and services, and prioritizing capital
spending. In response to exchange rate adjustment, current subsidies could be maintained in the
short term to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable, offset by the corresponding revenue
gains. Mobilizing additional non-oil revenues—especially by expanding tax bases—will also be
important. While current tax administration reforms will help, they would need to be accompanied
by tax policy measures.
18.
In the medium term, domestic revenue mobilization will be critical to generate fiscal
space for investment and social spending. Despite recent improvements, tax revenues remain low
by international standards. Measures to raise revenues would include further rationalizing
exemptions, ceasing to grant new tax holidays and phasing out existing ones, introducing a
presumptive tax for small businesses, reforming gold taxation, increasing personal and business
income tax rates and their progressivity, and continuing to strengthen customs and tax
administration. Adjusting the customs exchange rate in tandem with adjustments in the official rate
would boost tax collections, while gradually phasing out fuel subsidies would create space for
targeted pro-growth and pro-poor social spending. Over time, targeting a gradual reduction in the
nonoil primary balance would lower dependence on uncertain oil revenues.
19.
Continued efforts are needed to strengthen public financial management. Recent
progress to introduce a treasury single account (TSA) should be sustained by (i) strengthening
budget formulation and planning, with emphasis on revenue projections and the recently
established macro-fiscal unit; (ii) improving the preparation of the medium-term fiscal framework
and incorporating it into budget planning; (iii) expanding the coverage of the TSA; and
(iv) deploying an integrated financial management system.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

SUDAN

Authorities’ Views
20.
The authorities acknowledged the challenges posed by low tax revenues for fiscal
management. In the short term, they plan to achieve their policy targets by cutting spending to
offset revenue shortfalls. Faced with sizable development needs and insufficient external financing,
the authorities will rely on domestic financing to cover deficits. To raise revenue, they increased last
year the income tax rate (from 15 percent to 30 percent) on cigarette producers and recently
introduced royalties on gold production. In line with their Five-Year Program, they plan to expand
tax bases—including by reducing exemptions and introducing electronic collection of VAT and other
taxes—rather than increase tax rates. They believe that increasing the effective tariff and VAT rates
on imports by adjusting the official exchange rate would not increase customs revenues significantly
because of high import-price elasticity.
21.
The authorities plan to improve the quality of spending and continue to enhance PFM.
They will continue to liberalize fuel prices to reduce subsidies. At the same time, they will provide
more resources to social programs and productive sectors, including agriculture and infrastructure.
Also, the authorities are strengthening the TSA and expanding it to include all government
ministries and departments. They also introduced electronic payment systems for salaries and are
strengthening internal and external audit.

C. Monetary Policy and Financial Stability
22.
Monetary policy should be tightened and instruments to manage liquidity be further
developed. Monetary policy is burdened by the government’s large financing needs and by QFAs
that lead to sizable liquidity injections. These, and a shortage of liquidity management instruments,
undermine the central bank’s ability to control reserve money. In response, the CBOS should
continue to adhere to existing limits on advances to government, curtail QFAs by limiting gold
purchases to levels consistent with reserve money and international reserve targets, discontinue
financing of agriculture, and develop Sharia-compliant securities. To enhance transparency, the
CBOS should report all lending to government (including payments of letters of guarantees and
wheat subsidies) and QFAs as credit to government.
23.
Building on progress to date, the CBOS should continue to upgrade its capacity to
supervise and mitigate financial stability risks. Priority areas include: (i) modernizing the
framework to deal with weak banks, including by limiting access to “lender of last resort” support to
solvent banks, expanding the range of resolution regimes, and empowering CBOS to initiate
resolution processes; (ii) divesting CBOS’ equity in commercial banks; (iii) strengthening CBOS’
capacity for financial stability analysis; and (iv) continuing to enforce limits on net foreign exchange
positions to mitigate risks stemming from foreign currency mismatches. Moreover, the CBOS should
continue to strengthen risk-based AML/CFT supervision.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

Authorities’ views
24.
The authorities remain committed to their monetary targets. Reserve money growth
slowed in the first quarter of 2016 on account of lower QFAs. Moreover, the monetary policy
framework was strengthened by the launch of the Liquidity Management Fund in 2014, which
reduced CBOS liquidity support for commercial banks. The CBOS will continue to buy gold as an
important source of foreign exchange and to reduce smuggling.
25.
The authorities noted that despite the strains caused by sanctions and the withdrawal
of CBRs, the health of the banking sector has improved—banks are liquid, return on assets is
high, and NPL ratios have declined. The banking sector’s net open foreign exchange position is at
manageable levels, in line with regulatory limits. The authorities were committed to strengthening
the AML/CFT framework, but regretted that sanctions were undermining its effectiveness by
encouraging a shift to cash-based and informal transactions.

D. Inclusive Growth
26.
Improving the business environment will be key to support the private sector and
strengthen economic growth. Sudan is at the bottom twentieth percentile of the 2016 Doing
Business rankings. Weaknesses include access to credit, international trade, and investor protection.
Addressing these issues by streamlining regulations and liberalizing trade and foreign exchange
markets would, together with macroeconomic stability, encourage greater private sector investment
and job creation. Furthermore, better public infrastructure (including water and electricity provision)
and improved human capital would support private sector development, strengthen growth, and
help address the persistently high unemployment rate—at 22 percent in 2015, with higher rates for
the youth and women (see Annex II on challenges of inclusive growth and policy options).
27.
Staff welcomed plans to launch the preparation of the 2016–20 Poverty Reduction
Strategy (PRS). Social safety nets should be expanded and their targeting improved, especially the
cash transfer program which currently supports about 500,000 households (20 percent of the poor).
Furthermore, strengthening other social programs, including education and health services, is
essential to improve social outcomes, expand opportunities, and raise productivity.
Authorities’ views
28.
The authorities regretted that sanctions and the withdrawal of CBRs raised formidable
obstacles for the business environment and poverty reduction efforts. Despite these obstacles,
the authorities’ evaluation of the interim poverty reduction strategy (2012–14), completed recently
with World Bank assistance, confirmed that pro-poor spending had increased. The authorities have
also launched:


Initiatives to improve the business environment, including the automation of tax collection to
reduce transactions costs and information campaigns to seek inputs from investors on reforms
to encourage investment. The authorities also established a high-level committee to review land

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

SUDAN

laws and regulations to facilitate investment. They are encouraging the expansion of bank
branches and the development of microfinance, and are strengthening the credit registry of the
CBOS to improve access to credit.


The preparation of a full PRS incorporating specific policy measures, through a consultative
process involving domestic stakeholders and external partners. A household survey, to be
completed this year, will document Sudan’s poverty profile. In the meantime, the authorities
expanded education and health services to the poor, and plan to expand the coverage of the
cash transfer program to 600,000 households in 2017, while strengthening its management and
targeting, with World Bank support.

E. External Debt
29.
The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) confirms that Sudan continues to be in debt
distress. Both public and external debt ratios remain high, and most of the external debt is in
arrears. Debt ratios would be higher with GDP valued at the parallel exchange rate (Table 3).
Consistent with the results of past DSAs, Sudan’s external debt is assessed to be unsustainable. All
external debt indicators breach their indicative thresholds under the baseline scenario, and many of
them stay above the thresholds throughout the time horizon of the analysis. It is therefore critical
for Sudan to follow sound economic policies, including a prudent borrowing strategy that minimizes
non-concessional borrowing and relies instead on grants and concessional financing, and to
continue garnering support for debt relief.
30.
Sudan is eligible for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative, but has yet to meet all the requirements. Debt relief hinges on normalizing relations
with international creditors, including the Fund (Box 4). The authorities should continue to reach out
to creditors to garner support for debt relief and avoid selective servicing of bilateral debt. Staff
advised the authorities to extend, together with South Sudan, the “zero option” to avoid a complex
and protracted apportionment of external debt.5
31.
Staff encouraged the authorities to continue to strengthen cooperation with the Fund
on policies and payments. Sudan’s arrears to the Fund declined to about SDR 969 million at
end-June 2016 following payments of $10 million each in 2014 and 2015, and $5 million in the first
half of 2016. Staff encouraged the authorities to continue to make payments that are at least
sufficient to cover Sudan’s obligations falling due, make payments regularly, and increase them in
line with improvement in Sudan’s payment capacity.

5

The so-called “zero option” is a 2012 agreement between Sudan and South Sudan whereby Sudan retained all the
external liabilities after the secession, provided that the international community gave firm commitments to deliver
debt relief within two years. In September 2014, both countries agreed to extend the agreement until October 2016,
after which, in the absence of debt relief, Sudan could seek to apportion external debt between the two countries.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

Authorities’ views
32.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to reaching out to international creditors,
making quarterly payments to the Fund totaling $10 million per year, and cooperating with
the Fund on policies. They were disappointed by lack of progress toward debt relief and noted that
the absence of resolution complicated the extension of the “zero option,” which they consider a
sovereign decision.

Box 4. Path to Debt Relief
Sudan is eligible for debt relief under the HIPC initiative, but has not yet met all the qualifications. Importantly,
it still needs to obtain assurances from bilateral official and commercial creditors that they are willing to
consider providing debt relief. As of now, Sudan meets the following conditions for the HIPC initiative:

Sudan faces an unsustainable debt burden that cannot be addressed through traditional debt relief
mechanisms; and

It has developed an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy (I-PRSP) document. Sudan’s I-PRSP was
assessed by the staffs of the IMF and the World Bank and was discussed by both Boards in September 2013.
Sudan is currently developing a full PRSP.
To reach the Decision Point, Sudan would still need to undertake the following:

Obtain assurances of support for HIPC debt relief from a large majority of creditors representing at
least 70 percent of HIPC-eligible debt;

Establish with the IMF an adequate track record of strong policy performance in the period leading
up to the Decision Point, under an SMP judged by the Executive Board to meet the policy standards
associated with upper-credit tranche arrangements; and

Clear its arrears with the IMF, and have a fully financed plan and a timetable to clear arrears with the
World Bank and the African Development Bank to restore its eligibility to borrow from these sources.
The resources required for the IMF's participation in the HIPC Initiative have not yet been identified. As the
costs to the IMF for providing debt relief to Sudan were not included in the original costing estimates for the
HIPC initiative, additional financing will need to be secured when Sudan is ready to clear its arrears and
embark on the HIPC initiative.

F. Statistical Issues
33.
Although data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, there are major
shortcomings due to capacity constraints, especially in national accounts and balance of
payments statistics. The last published national accounts date from 2010. Absence of FDI survey
data impairs compilation of the balance of payments. More resources should be devoted to statistics
and data collection.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

SUDAN

Authorities’ views

The authorities agreed with the need to strengthen economic statistics. They are
working to upgrade national account statistics and are seeking support to conduct FDI surveys.

(MCPs) which are subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII. These measures include an
exchange rate regime with multiple effective exchange rates and a policy of rationing foreign
exchange and allocating it to certain sectors (Box 5). Staff urged the authorities, in line with previous
recommendations, to eliminate the restrictions and MCPs. Although these measures were adopted,
initially on a temporary basis, for balance of payments reasons and are non-discriminatory, they
have persisted, are delaying the external adjustment, and hamper foreign investment.
Authorities’ views
36.
The authorities indicated that they were unable to remove all exchange restrictions
and MCPs because of continued pressures on the balance of payments following the secession
of South Sudan, external sanctions, and the need to finance strategic imports of food, fuel, and
medicine. Nevertheless, while not committing to a timetable for their removal, they remain
committed to gradually removing exchange restrictions and MCPs as conditions improve.

Box 5: Exchange Rate System
Sudan maintains the following exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund
jurisdiction under Article VIII, Sections 2 and 3:

An exchange restriction arising from the government's limitations on the availability of foreign
exchange and the allocation of foreign exchange to certain priority items;

A multiple currency practice and exchange restriction arising from the establishment of an official
exchange rate (the CBOS rate) for use in all government exchange transactions which in practice differs by
more than 2 percent from the rate used by commercial banks;

A multiple currency practice and exchange restriction arising from large spreads between the CBOS
rate and the parallel market exchange rate due to the CBOS’ limitation on the availability of foreign
exchange which channels current international transactions to the parallel market; and

A multiple currency practice and exchange restriction arising from the imposition by the
government of a cash margin requirement for most imports.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Sudan has made notable progress toward macroeconomic stability and growth
following the shock of South Sudan’s secession five years ago. Over the past years, policy
measures—including exchange rate adjustments, subsidy reform, and improved social safety nets—
helped to contain the fiscal deficit, slow money growth, reduce inflation, and support economic
recovery. Institutional reforms strengthened tax collections and public financial management, and
social spending increased. Last year, the authorities started implementing a five-year reform plan for
growth and poverty reduction, and good harvests boosted growth to close to 5 percent.
38.
Despite these efforts, however, large macroeconomic imbalances continue to constrain
growth prospects, along with internal conflicts and U.S. sanctions. The external imbalances
triggered by the loss of three-quarters of Sudan’s oil exports have yet to be resolved. Domestic and
international efforts to end internal conflicts have yet to bear fruit, and the humanitarian situation
remains difficult. Sanctions and the withdrawal of CBRs weigh on trade, investment, and growth.
Absence of progress toward debt relief limits access to official external financing.
39.
External imbalances widened in 2015–16 due to low commodity export prices,
expansionary policies, and insufficient exchange rate adjustment. The terms-of-trade shock
widened the current account deficit to 6 percent of GDP in 2015, while the already low foreign
exchange reserves dropped to 1½ month of imports despite external financial support. The parallel
exchange rate continued to depreciate and the premium soared to 125 percent as the official rate
remained virtually fixed. The budget deficit widened to 1.9 percent of GDP owing to shortfalls in oil
revenue. Inflation, which had been contained last year, rose to 14.3 percent in June 2016.
40.
The outlook is subject to significant downside risks. Low commodity export prices,
absence of policy buffers, economic sanctions, the withdrawal of CBRs, and a weak business
environment will continue to constrain economic activity. Consequently, growth is expected to
remain modest in 2016 and beyond. The fiscal framework faces risks due to low tax revenues and
uncertain oil revenues. Large external financing gaps are likely to persist, heightening risks of
disorderly adjustment in case of shortfalls in external financing. Hence, macroeconomic stability and
growth rest on determined and early policy adjustment and mobilization of external aid.
41.
Policy consolidation and reforms should be accelerated to achieve macroeconomic
stability, address vulnerabilities, and promote inclusive growth. Policies should include greater
exchange rate flexibility to help reduce the external trade deficit; increasing fiscal revenue to create
space for growth-enhancing public infrastructure and social spending, while reducing the fiscal
deficit and tightening monetary policy to contribute to the adjustment and ensure low inflation;
enhancing the resilience of the financial sector; strengthening social safety nets to protect the most
vulnerable; and accelerating structural reforms to improve the business environment and encourage
private investment and job creation.

42.
Exchange rate flexibility is needed to reduce external imbalances. Macroeconomic
stability will require tight fiscal and monetary policy, but will remain elusive without large upfront
exchange rate adjustment, followed by greater flexibility with a view to significantly reducing the
parallel market premium. Restoring exchange rate competitiveness and removing foreign exchange
distortions will help ensure external stability, diversify the export base, and foster FDI.
43.
Fiscal consolidation in the short term would contribute to the external adjustment and
help reduce inflation. Containing spending on goods and services and prioritizing capital
spending, while protecting social spending, will be needed. At the same, accelerating ongoing
revenue administration reforms will help.
44.
Over the medium term, domestic revenue mobilization will be critical to generate
fiscal space for investment and social spending, and achieve pro-growth fiscal consolidation.
Determined implementation of revenue-enhancing measures—such as reducing tax exemptions and
increasing the relatively low personal and corporate tax rates—is needed to complement ongoing
tax administration reforms and raise Sudan’s low tax revenues, create fiscal space, and reduce the
deficit. While fuel subsidies could be maintained in the short term to mitigate the impact of greater
exchange rate flexibility, they should be phased out in the medium term to make space for targeted
pro-poor spending. Continuing to strengthen PFM, in particular budget planning and the newly
introduced treasury single account, would help rationalize policy formulation and execution.
45.
Monetary policy should be tightened to keep inflation in check. This will require that the
authorities continue to adhere to limits on central bank advances to government, limit QFAs and
gold purchases to levels consistent with monetary targets, and develop Sharia-compliant liquidity
management instruments. Greater transparency in reporting government financing and QFAs is also
needed.
46.
The central bank should continue to strengthen its capacity to mitigate financial
stability risks. Priority areas include modernizing the framework to deal with weak banks, divesting
CBOS’ remaining interests in commercial banks, strengthening CBOS’ capacity for financial stability
analysis, and implementing corrective measures to mitigate risks stemming from foreign currency
mismatches. Moreover, following the welcome removal of Sudan from the FATF’s “gray list”,
strengthening the AML/CFT framework and its implementation should continue.
47.
Structural policies should focus on fostering sustained and inclusive growth. Reforms
to improve the business environment for the private sector, financial inclusion, and the quality of
spending to support human capital will be key to raise growth prospects. Expanding social safety
nets and improving their targeting will be critical to reduce poverty. In this context, the full Poverty
Reduction Strategy under preparation should provide a coherent framework to tackle Sudan’s
development challenges. More resources should be devoted to statistics.
48.
Exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices should be removed. These
measures do not address the underlying external imbalances and hamper foreign investment. The
authorities’ commitment to remove restrictions over time as conditions improve is welcome, and

staff urges the authorities to articulate a firm timetable for their removal. The authorities are not
requesting approval for the exchange restrictions and MCPs, and no approval is recommended.
49.
Sudan should continue to strengthen cooperation with the Fund on policies and
payments. Sudan’s arrears to the Fund declined to about SDR 969 million at end-June 2016
following payments of $10 million each in 2014 and 2015, and $5 million in the first half of 2016.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ payments to the Fund and strongly encourages them to make
payments that are at least sufficient to cover Sudan’s obligations falling due, make payments
regularly, and increase them in line with improvement in Sudan’s payment capacity.
50.
Garnering international support for debt relief is critical for Sudan’s economic
development. Sudan remains in debt distress and is eligible for debt relief under the HIPC Initiative.
The large external debt and arrears hinder access to external financing and weigh heavily on
development prospects. The authorities should continue to engage with international partners to
secure comprehensive support for debt relief and the lifting of sanctions, which would pave the way
for foreign investment and financing for growth and poverty reduction. They should minimize nonconcessional borrowing and avoid selective servicing of bilateral debt, and rely instead on grants
and concessional financing. Extending the “zero option” agreement with South Sudan before it
expires in October 2016 would be advisable to avoid a complex and protracted apportionment of
external debt between the two countries.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of
IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below
10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on
the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and
materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

1/ Primary balance minus oil revenue
2/ In the CBOS balance sheet, wheat subsidy obligations are classified as "other items net"; this explains the difference in net credit to government between the fiscal
and monetary tables.
3/ Fuel subsidies minus fuel stabilization fees.
4/ Until 2015, crude oil subsidies, which were not included in the budget, arose from the government’s sales of crude oil to state-owned refineries at a discounted price.
5/ Staff estimates and projections.

Memorandum items:
Fiscal burden of fuel subsidies
Budgetary net fuel subsidies 3/
Crude oil subsidies 4/
Public debt
External
Domestic 5/

Sources: Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ Primary balance minus oil revenue.
2/ In the CBOS balance sheet, wheat subsidy obligations are classified as part of "other items net"; this explains the difference in net credit to government between the fiscal
and monetary tables.
3/ Fuel subsidies minus fuel stabilization fees.
4/ Until 2015, crude oil subsidies, which were not included in the budget, arose from the government’s sales of crude oil to state-owned refineries at a discounted price.
5/ Staff estimates and projections.

Annex I. External Stability Assessment
Overall Assessment
1.
Sudan’s external position continues to be weak and vulnerable to shocks. Exchange rate
misalignment, U.S. sanctions, withdrawal of CBRs, and high costs of doing business have constrained
Sudan’s ability to adjust to the sharp decline in export proceeds following the secession of South
Sudan in 2011. As a result, five years on, the external current account deficit remains large and
international reserves precariously low. Sudan is also vulnerable to external shocks owing to its
narrow and commodity-based exports. Applying the EBA-lite methodology, staff estimates that the
real effective exchange rate is overvalued by about 50 percent relative to economic fundamentals.
Greater exchange rate flexibility and structural reforms, supported by tighter fiscal and monetary
policies, are needed to improve competitiveness and foster private sector investment in the tradable
sector. The removal of sanctions, clearance of external arrears, and debt relief will be critical factors
to improve durably the external position.
Recent Developments
2.
The external current account deficit (on a cash basis) widened to 5.9 percent of GDP in
2015. Exports dropped by 29 percent while
Exchange Rates
imports increased by 3.2 percent. The decline
(In SDG per US dollar and percent)

3.
The official exchange rate
remained virtually fixed in 2015–16. The
official rate was adjusted by only 2 percent,
while the parallel market exchange rate
depreciated by 36 percent since end-2014. As
a result, the premium widened to 125 percent
at end-June 2016 (from 46 percent at
end-2014).

exchange rate in 2015–16. It wiped out the real depreciation that followed the devaluations in June
2012 and September 2013. On the parallel market, the 18 percent REER depreciation between
December 2014 and April 2016 still resulted in a cumulative appreciation of 15 percent since
end-2012.
5.
The real effective exchange rate is overvalued. A number of factors lead to this
conclusion: (i) the large current account deficit; (ii) low international reserves; (iii) the widening gap
between the official and the parallel market rates; (iv) appreciation of the REER in 2013–15; and
(v) the weak external payment capacity as evidenced by the continued accumulation of external
arrears.
6.
Estimates from the EBA-lite methodology suggest that the real exchange rate is
overvalued by about 50 percent relative to economic fundamentals. Based on the Fund's
External Balance Assessment methodology (EBA-lite), the current account norm-the equilibrium
current account balance determined by medium-term values of the fiscal balance, relative income
level, demographic characteristics, and productivity differentials-is estimated at -2 percent of GDP.
Compared to the actual current account balance of -5.9 percent in 2015,1 this implies a current
account gap of about 3.9 percent of GDP, which reflects an external position that is substantially
weaker than implied by fundamentals. The current account gap together with a low long-term
elasticity of the current account to the real exchange rate of -0.077,2 suggests that the real exchange
rate is overvalued by about 50 percent.3 These model-based estimates, however, should be
interpreted with caution given that Sudan faces a specific set of external constraints, such as U.S.
sanctions on trade and financial transactions, which worsen the current account and are not
captured by the model.

on the business climate, U.S. sanctions and
withdrawal of CBRs impose high costs on
international trade and finance. The World Bank’s

Reserve Adequacy
8.
Gross international reserves have
remained low over the past several years,
leaving Sudan vulnerable to external shocks. In
May 2016, reserves stood at only $1.2 billion
(1.4 months of imports) despite an estimated
$2.1 billion in foreign deposits at the central bank
over the previous 12 months. Given the sizable
external imbalances and constraints, there are
little prospects of reserves increasing over the
medium term under current policies. Hence,
reserves are projected to remain at about
1 month of imports, far below the traditionally
recommended minimum of 3 months of imports
and the 6–8 months suggested by the IMF’s
reserve adequacy metric.6

The Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rates countries against a set of 16 criteria grouped in four
clusters: (a) economic management; (b) structural policies; (c) policies for social inclusion and equity; and (d) public
sector management and institutions. The CPIA measures the extent to which a country’s policy and institutional
framework supports sustainable growth and poverty reduction, and consequently the effective use of development
assistance. The outcome of the exercise yields both an overall score and specific scores for all sixteen criteria. For
each criterion, countries are classified from 1 (very weak performance) to 6 (very strong performance). See:

Conclusions
9.
Sudan's external position continues to be weak and vulnerable to shocks. To reduce
external imbalances and enhance resilience, the authorities need to: (i) reduce overvaluation and
close the gap between the official and parallel market exchange rates through a combination of
exchange rate adjustment, gradual removal of restrictions on access to foreign exchange, and fiscal
and monetary policies supportive of external adjustment; and (ii) improve the business environment
and implement wide-ranging structural reforms and infrastructure investments to improve
competitiveness and increase human and physical capital. Continued outreach to garner
international support for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative is also
critical.

Annex II. Challenges of Inclusive Growth and Policy Options
1.
Despite GDP expanding more than seven times since 1960, Sudan's economic growth
has not been inclusive. While growth has averaged 3.9 percent per year since 1960, it has been
volatile with a standard deviation of 140 percent. It

has also depended mainly on natural resources(market prices; in percent)

tenuous macroeconomic stability, continued
resource dependence, arrears to the foreign lenders despite several Paris Club debt restructurings in
the 1970s and 80s, and human development outcomes not much higher than two decades ago. In
sum, the growth of income—while an undeniable achievement—has not been inclusive.
Oil dependence
1999-2011

2.
Several indicators point to Sudan's quality of growth being low. A new composite
measure of the quality of growth ranks Sudan 63rd out of 93 countries in 1990–94 and 86th out of 93
in 2005–11.2 The UN’s Human Development Index (HDI) places Sudan in 167th position among
188 countries rated in 2014. And poverty outcomes have been weak as well: the latest poverty
survey in 2009 counted 44 percent of the population as poor, with 20 percent surviving on less than
$1.25 a day.

Internal conflicts, international isolation, and weak institutions and governance weigh
on growth and inclusiveness in Sudan. The UN estimates that there were 3.1 million internally
displaced people in Sudan in 2015—the most in Africa—owing to internal conflicts. As a result, the
UN maintains a 21,000-strong peacekeeping

4.
Limited fiscal resources, poor budget priorities, and macroeconomic imbalances also
hamper inclusive growth. Government revenue is low (particularly tax revenue at 6.2 percent of
GDP in 2015), thereby limiting resources for social spending and investment in infrastructure critical
for private sector growth. And macroeconomic imbalances are high-inflation has averaged
35 percent in the past four years. International reserves are low at about 1–1½ month of imports,
and the central bank directs foreign exchange to imports of a limited set of priority goods.

Economic Complexity Index

6.
Sudan is a resource-based economy
making products of low complexity and
sophistication, which constrains growth
prospects.7 Complexity is defined here as the
diversity and sophistication of productive capabilities
embedded in a country’s exports. Cross-country
evidence suggests that gains in complexity are
strongly associated with higher growth and lower
income inequality, i.e. countries with higher
complexity products are richer and have better

See: Hidalgo and Hausmann, 2009, “The Building Blocks of Economic Complexity,” Harvard University; and
http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/ for on-line resources on complexity. Economic complexity is a “measure of the
knowledge in a society that gets translated into the products it makes. The most complex products are sophisticated
chemicals and machinery, whereas the world’s least complex products are raw materials or simple agricultural
products. The economic complexity of a country is dependent on the complexity of the products it exports. A country
is considered ‘complex’ if it exports not only highly complex products, but also a large number of different products.”

and was ranked 113th out of 124 countries in 2013.
7.
Productivity has been low and volatile. Total factor productivity (TFP) was a major source
of growth in the pre-oil period. During the oil boom, however, capital dominated as a source of
growth, and productivity has been largely negative in the early 1990s.8 Data gaps do not allow for
estimation of recent productivity trends, as data on the capital stock post-secession are missing.

Infrastructure and energy production
are limited, and access to electricity, water,

dropped in 2013 (the last year of available data)
to the 2006–07 levels, which constrained GDP
growth. Investment in electricity production
would be needed to support economic growth.
Access to electricity lags behind regional
comparators and other fragile states, and
access to improved water sources has not risen
significantly over the past twenty years.

Sudan’s unemployment rate is
persistently high. In 2013 the unemployment
rate was estimated by the World Bank at
15.2 percent of the labor force—virtually
unchanged from 1991. In 2015, the government
reported an unemployment rate of 22 percent,
suggesting a significant worsening following the
secession of South Sudan.9 Unemployment among
women (19.8 percent) was higher than for men
(12.7 percent) in 2013. The persistence of high
levels of unemployment may be the legacy of an
oil-based economy where growth and
employment depended on government spending.
10.
Youth unemployment is also high and
persistent. In 2013, youth unemployment was
estimated by the World Bank at 24.5 percentunchanged since 1991. Unemployment among
young women was higher (26.5 percent) than for
young men (22.1 percent).

13.
Looking forward, supporting inclusive growth will require a multi-pronged package of
macroeconomic and structural reforms to tackle these various issues.10 Reforms should focus on
empowering the private sector and unlocking entrepreneurship to complement public investment in
infrastructure and public services.


Macroeconomic and political stability. Macroeconomic and political stability are critical to
generate confidence and facilitate long-term planning for private sector saving and investment.



Enabling a business friendly environment. Reforms should focus on addressing the
weaknesses identified in the Doing Business surveys, to enable domestic entrepreneurs to invest
and to attract external interests. The main areas of concern include trading across borders,
protecting investors, getting credit, and resolving insolvency. Excessive regulations and
corruption, which favor informality and weigh on inclusive growth, should be tackled forcefully.11
Continued outreach to progress towards debt relief and arrears clearance would help the
business environment.



Increasing female participation in the labor force. Providing opportunities for women to
develop their full potential could significantly boost economic growth through increased labor
supply.12 Policies should support equal access to education, support working parents, reduce the
gender wage gap, and increase mobility and equal opportunity.



Developing infrastructure. Development of electricity production and networks, roads,
railways, and strengthening regional connectivity to facilitate the flow of factors of production
and goods are needed to lower production and transportation costs and improve productivity
and market access. Infrastructure expansion would also aid inclusive growth by supporting the
largest sector—agriculture—which depends almost wholly on rain water. Expansion and
improvement in agricultural irrigation would improve the efficiency and productivity of
agriculture and would insulate it from the vagaries of weather.



Improving access to finance. Reforms to improve access to finance are urgently needed, as
getting credit remains one of the lowest rated Doing Business indicators in Sudan. The
authorities are implementing a number of them including expanding microfinance, increasing
banking coverage in the countryside, developing agent banking, and strengthening the credit
registry to lower costs of credit.



Regional integration. Developing and implementing already developed plans to improve the
connectivity of the rail and road networks with neighboring countries would improve growth
prospects, as Sudan could potentially serve as a gateway to international markets for its
landlocked neighbors.



Reach out to the diaspora. Encouraging investment by the diaspora would involve reforming
the foreign exchange market (to facilitate transfers via official channels) and improving the
business environment.



Investing in human capital through education would improve growth prospects and the
competitiveness of the labor force

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The legal tender is the Sudanese guinea, which replaced the Sudanese dinar in proportion
SDG 1=SDD 100 in mid-2007. Sudan has a de jure “managed float” exchange rate arrangement. Its
de facto arrangement was reclassified from “other managed” to a “stabilized arrangement,” effective
January 1, 2015. The Central Bank of Sudan (CBOS) sets two official exchange rates: an “indicative”
rate and an “official” rate (within ±4 percent) which applies to public transactions and customs
valuation. The difference between the two is currently less than 2 percent. Commercial banks and
foreign exchange bureaus are required to set their rates within ±4 percent of the indicative rate, but
in practice they trade at top end of the band. Thus, the official rate differs by more than 2 percent
from the commercial banks’ rate. Since January 2014, the CBOS devalued the official rate by only
7 percent, of which 2 percent in 2015.
Sudan maintains the following measures subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Sections 2 (a)
and 3: (i) An exchange restriction arising from the government's limitations on the availability of
foreign exchange and the allocation of foreign exchange to certain priority items; (ii) A multiple
currency practice and exchange restriction arising from the establishment of an official exchange
rate (the CBOS rate) for use in all government exchange transactions which in practice differs by
more than 2 percent from the rate used by commercial banks; (iii) A multiple currency practice and
exchange restriction arising from large spreads between the CBOS rate and the parallel market
exchange rate due to the CBOS’ limitation on the availability of foreign exchange which channels
current international transactions to the parallel market; and (iv) An exchange restriction and a
multiple currency practice arising from the imposition by the government of a cash margin
requirement for most imports.
Sudan is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the
Executive Board on December 3, 2014.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 30, 2016)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Sudan’s current statistical data base appears broadly adequate for surveillance, but needs
further improvements, including upgrading the base year, coverage, periodicity and timeliness of
national accounts data; improving labor market and direct investment data; and more detailed and
comprehensive fiscal accounting. Enhancing the status of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) with
the authority and resources to compile and disseminate official statistics and coordinate the
national statistical work program is important for further statistical improvements, and should be
addressed within the context of the ongoing work in developing a five-year National Strategy for
the Development of Statistics (2012-16). Retooling the CBS’ computing infrastructure should also
be accorded high priority.
National accounts: The CBS lacks a comprehensive data collection program, and relies largely on
administrative reporting. Economic surveys were last conducted in the 1970s and 1980s, and the
benchmarks derived from these surveys inform current estimates of value added. Informal activities
are not covered, and are likely to be significant in areas such as retail trade and construction.
Sudan’s national accounts data are based on the System of National Accounts 1968 (SNA 1968),
and the base year of the existing GDP constant price series (by activity and by expenditure) is very
old, 1981. National accounts statistics are compiled with a lag exceeding three years; and there are
no national accounts or industrial production data at sub annual frequencies. On the expenditure
side, data are lacking on final consumption by households, investment, and changes in stocks.
Improving annual source data, both administrative and survey sources, is essential and the
development work on regional GDP needs to be incorporated into the ongoing annual estimates.
The adoption of updated statistical guidelines (SNA 2008), rebasing of the national accounts, and
developing procedures to improve the timeliness of GDP estimates should be among core
objectives. There is also an urgent need to increase funding to the CBS and to rebuild its capacity
for conducting household, agricultural, and enterprise surveys.
Price statistics: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is compiled using weights based on a household
expenditure survey conducted over four months during 2007. Ideally, weights should be based on
an annual household survey and should not be more than five years old so as to ensure that the
index remains representative of current expenditure patterns. In 2014, the CBS published a
Producer Price Index (PPI) for the manufacturing sector covering 2009-13, but this index seems to
have been discontinued. An economic census would be needed to develop the PPI.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

Government finance statistics: Data reported to MCD are broadly adequate, with the main
revenue, expenditure, and financing items reported monthly using an economic classification with
a lag of about one-and-a-half month. The data are for the central government only. While the
allocation of resources by the finance ministry to the various ministries is reported, their actual
expenditures are not. GFS data are compiled and disseminated by the chamber of accounts within
the finance ministry. There is no comprehensive data reconciliation of government claims on and
liabilities to the banking system. There has been some progress in implementing GFS classifications
at the level of state governments. The compilation of consolidated GFS for the general government
with the objective of producing a statement of government operations should be a priority.
Monetary and financial statistics (MFS): Sudan has received significant technical assistance to
improve the collection, compilation, and dissemination of monetary and financial statistics, and all
major recommendations have been implemented. The coverage of Sudan’s monetary statistics
includes the central bank and all commercial banks.
Financial sector statistics: The authorities compile financial soundness indicators (FSIs) on a
monthly basis and provide them to MCD staff. They are encouraged to report those FSI data and
metadata to STA for dissemination by the IMF.
External sector statistics: Data quality has improved as a result of intense technical assistance, but
there are several areas for improvement in the external accounts, particularly with regard to direct
investment (DI) and estimation of informal trade. The implementation of a DI survey has been
delayed due to the lack of financing. Compilation of the data template on international reserves
and foreign currency liquidity should be initiated.
Data Standards and Quality
Sudan participates in the Enhanced General Data Dissemination System (e-GDDS) since August
2003. GDDS metadata and plans for improvement need to be updated. No data ROSC is available.
Reporting to STA
Annual data reported for the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook cover only budgetary central
government up to 1999. No monthly and quarterly fiscal data are reported for the International
Financial Statistics (IFS). The reporting of external trade statistics for inclusion in the Direction of
Trade Statistics (DOTS) database is done with significant lags. National accounts data are not
provided for publication in the IFS. The CBOS compiles and reports monetary statistics regularly to
STA for publication in the IFS. The CBOS also reports to STA quarterly balance of payments and
annual IIP data on the basis of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International
Investment Position Manual (BPM6). The authorities should submit updated e-GDDS metadata for
dissemination on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

July 25, 2016

Approved By
Daniela Gressani and
Catherine Pattillo (IMF)
and John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the International Development Association

This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) confirms that Sudan continues to be in debt
distress.1 Both public and external debt ratios remain high, and most of the external debt
is in arrears. Consistent with the results of past DSAs, Sudan’s external debt is assessed to
be unsustainable. All external debt indicators breach their indicative thresholds under the
baseline scenario, and many of them stay above the thresholds throughout the time
horizon of the analysis. It is therefore critical for Sudan to follow sound economic policies,
including a prudent borrowing strategy that minimizes non-concessional borrowing and
relies instead on grants and concessional financing, and to continue garnering support for
debt relief.

1

This DSA was prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank staff under the joint Fund-Bank Low-Income Country
(LIC) Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF). Sudan’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) Rating
averaged 2.37 for 2013-14 and falls under the weak performer category. Sudan’s fiscal year runs from
January 1 to December 31.

SUDAN

BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The economy of Sudan has yet to adjust fully to the secession of South Sudan in 2011,
which took away the bulk of its oil exports and fiscal revenues. In addition, a heavy debt burden,
U.S. sanctions, and volatile domestic and regional political environments continue to weigh on economic
performance. Although a series of stabilization and reform measures helped the economic adjustment,
large imbalances persist.

Economic performance in 2015 was mixed. Good harvests boosted economic growth to close
to 5 percent, and inflation dropped from 26 percent in December 2014 to 13 percent in December 2015.
However, limited progress with raising domestic revenue to replace shortfalls in oil-related revenues
weakened public finances. The external current account deficit widened and international reserves
remained low. As the official exchange rate was kept virtually unchanged, the parallel exchange rate
premium soared above 80 percent in December 2015 and to 125 percent at end-June 2016. The outlook is
mixed with risks to the downside.
3.
Prospects for debt relief. Debt relief prospects are predicated on obtaining assurances of support
from creditors, normalizing relations with international financial institutions, and establishing a track record
of cooperation with the IMF on policies and payments. In 2014, the Sudanese authorities agreed with South
Sudan to extend the deadline for the “zero-option” until October 2016.2 They also agreed to continue to
reach out to creditors to garner support for debt relief.

STRUCTURE OF DEBT
4.
Sudan’s external debt remained high as of end-2015.3 In nominal terms, it amounted to about
$50 billion (61 percent of GDP) including an estimated $1.6 billion deposited in the Central Bank of Sudan
by official creditors in 2015. 4 About 84 percent of the external debt was in arrears in 2015. The structure of
external debt has not changed over the last decade. The bulk is public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt
($48.2 billion, of which 86 percent in arrears), mainly owed to bilateral creditors and roughly equally divided
between Paris Club and non-Paris Club creditors (Figures 1 and 2). Only a small fraction is private debt
owed to suppliers ($1.7 billion).

The so-called “zero-option” is a 2012 agreement between Sudan and South Sudan whereby Sudan retains all the
external liabilities after the secession of South Sudan, provided that the international community gives firm
commitments of delivery of debt relief within two years. Absent such commitment, Sudan’s external debt would be
apportioned with South Sudan based on a formula to be determined. This deadline lapsed in September 2014, but
the parties agreed to extend it for two years.

Debt data were provided by the Sudanese authorities, complemented by information obtained during the 2011
external debt reconciliation exercise, as well as Fund and World Bank staffs’ estimates.
4

The drop in debt-to-GDP ratios in 2014–15 was partly due to high inflation and nominal GDP growth while the
official exchange rate remained stable. With GDP converted at the parallel rate, the debt-to-GDP ratio would reach
99.5 percent in 2015.

External public borrowing has been limited in recent years. Sudan has been largely cut off

debt—below 1 percent of GDP per year in 2012–15—with a limited number of multilateral and non-Paris
Club bilateral creditors. The newly contracted debt has been mainly used to finance projects in the
agriculture, services and energy sectors. In 2015, $262 million of new debt (0.3 percent of GDP) was
contracted, including $166 million from a multilateral creditor and $96 million from bilateral creditors. There
has not been any new private external debt in decades. In addition, official creditors deposited an
estimated $1.6 billion in the Central Bank of Sudan in 2015 and $0.5 billion in the first quarter of 2016
(these amounts were added to outstanding debt). So far in 2016, only one bilateral loan was contracted to
finance projects in water harvesting.

6.
Sudan’s total public debt reached 72.9 percent of GDP by end-2015. The bulk of the public
debt is external debt. Domestic debt reached 13 percent of GDP by end-2015. Domestic debt has been on
the rise due to increased domestic financing of the budget, albeit to a still relatively low level.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Underlying Assumptions
7.
The macroeconomic assumptions underlying this DSA have been updated based on
developments in 2014–15. The differences compared to the 2014 DSA are driven by higher growth and
lower inflation outturns in 2014–15 relative to previous projections, and by the revised policy and
international environment outlook detailed in Box 1. As in previous DSAs, this update does not include

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

arrears clearance, possible external debt relief, or debt apportionment between Sudan and South Sudan in
its baseline or alternative scenarios.
Box 1. Sudan: Macroeconomic Assumptions 2016–36
Natural resources. The outlook is informed by discussions with the Sudanese authorities. Oil production is
projected at 101 thousand barrels/day in 2016, somewhat below 2015 production level. Ageing oil fields and
a low international oil price outlook combine for only moderate expansion of further exploration and
production to 108 thousand barrels/day in 2021. Meanwhile, non-oil GDP is projected to grow by about
3.6 percent per year by 2021 and remain stable afterwards. Price projections are guided by the IMF’s latest
World Economic Outlook (WEO). The price of Sudan’s crude oil is projected to average US$47/barrel in the
medium term.
Real sector. The real GDP growth rate is expected to stabilize at 3.5 percent through 2021 and remain
unchanged over 2022–36. Medium-term real GDP growth mainly reflects strengthening of non-oil sectors
(mainly agriculture and mining), macroeconomic stabilization, and reforms of the business environment. 1
Inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, is projected to be moderate in the near to long term averaging
12.6 percent in 2016–36.
Fiscal sector. The fiscal deficit is projected to stabilize over the medium term, reflecting a combination of
gradual improvements in tax revenue collection, stable oil revenues, and containment of current spending,
including a gradual phasing out of fuel subsidies and recent unification of the wheat exchange rate with the
official exchange rate which lowered wheat subsidies. Over the long run, the fiscal accounts are expected to
continue to improve owing to (i) gradual increases in tax revenues, against the backdrop of stable oil
revenues and (ii) moderate increases in capital spending. Under those assumptions, the domestic debt-toGDP ratio is projected to be sustainable.
External sector. The current account deficit is expected to improve slightly over the medium term, to below
4 percent of GDP by end-2021, reflecting a stabilizing fiscal deficit as well as slight growth in oil and
strengthening non-oil exports. In the long run, it is projected to decline to about 2 percent of GDP as oil
exports stabilize while non-oil exports continue to gain ground. The deficit will be financed by foreign direct
investment and continued accumulation of external debt arrears. Sizable financing gap are assumed to be
covered by external debt throughout the projection period.
External debt. Reflecting continued limited access to international finance and a deteriorating debt service
capacity, disbursements of new loans are expected to be limited, at about 0.3 percent of GDP during
2016-36. In line with the recent portfolio of new contracted debt, the share of new concessional loans is
assumed at around one-third. It is assumed that Sudan will continue not to service obligations arising from
the stock of arrears, but will service in full in 2022 obligations associated with the deposits at the central
bank referred to in paragraph 5. In addition, the projected financing gaps are added to the external debt
stock.

B. External Debt Sustainability
8.
Sudan’s external debt stock remains unsustainable under the baseline scenario (Figure 1 and
Table 1). All PPG external debt level ratios continue to breach their indicative thresholds throughout the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

SUDAN

20-year projection period. The present value (PV) of PPG external debt is at about 93 percent of GDP at
end-2015—three times of the 30 percent threshold for weak policy performers—and is projected to stay
above the threshold through the projection period.5 Similarly, in 2015, the PV of debt-to-exports is above
1400 percent and the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio is about 872 percent, well above their respective
thresholds. Although these ratios are projected to improve based on the macroeconomic assumptions and
limited external borrowing over the medium to long run, such improvements are insufficient to bring debt
to sustainable levels.
9.
In addition, Sudan’s debt outlook is vulnerable to a range of shocks (Figure 1 and Table 2).
The PV of debt-to-GDP, debt-to-revenue and debt service-to-revenue ratios are most vulnerable to a onetime depreciation shock, whereas the PV of debt-to-exports and debt service-to-exports ratios are most
vulnerable to an export shock. A standard one-time 30 percent depreciation shock in 2017 would increase
the PV-of-debt to 96 percent of GDP in that year and then bring it below its 2017 baseline value only in
2020.6

C. Public Debt Sustainability
10.
Public DSA results mirror those of the external DSA (Figure 2 and Table 3). The debt ratios,
albeit declining remain at relatively high levels in the long term. The PV of public debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to stay above the indicative benchmark throughout the projection period. Similar to the external
DSA, the public DSA bound tests show that public debt path is most vulnerable to a one-time 30 percent
real depreciation (Table A4).

CONCLUSIONS
11.
Sudan remains in debt distress. The results of this DSA are broadly unchanged from those in
previous DSAs, as no debt relief was granted to Sudan in the meantime. External debt remains
unsustainable. In addition, the debt burden increases over time as the amounts needed to close projected
financing gaps are added to the outstanding debt stocks. In nominal terms, in 2026 the debt stock is
2.5 times the amount in 2015. In the long term, all public and public-guaranteed external debt burden
ratios remain well above their respective indicative thresholds. Public debt is also unsustainable, driven
mostly by external debt dynamics.
12.
Debt relief—along with sound policies—is necessary to bring debt back on a sustainable
path and regain access to external financing. Sudan needs to: (i) step up outreach efforts to its creditors
to garner broad support for debt relief; (ii) continue to cooperate with the IMF on economic policies and
payments with a view to establishing a track record of sound macro policies; and (iii) minimize new
borrowing on non-concessional terms, since it further increases the future debt burden, and instead secure

Ratios in terms of GDP are calculated using the official exchange rate, which is overvalued in real and nominal
terms. The parallel exchange rate premium was about 125 percent as of end-June 2016. If the parallel rate was used
to calculate GDP, debt-to-GDP ratios would be correspondingly higher than the ones reported.

foreign support on highly concessional terms to finance necessary development and infrastructure
expenditures.
13.
The authorities generally agree with the results and assessments of the DSA. They agree that
external debt is at unsustainable levels, debt service burdens are beyond Sudan’s debt servicing capacity,
and as a result Sudan continues to accumulate external debt arrears. They agree that non-concessional
borrowing is costly and therefore should be minimized. They reiterate that debt relief is urgently needed
for economic development, and remain hopeful that the international community will provide debt relief in
the near future. In this regard, the authorities are committed to continue reaching out to creditors.
14.
The authorities are developing a national debt strategy. In February 2016, they held a donorsponsored workshop to formulate a national debt policy. The workshop included a high-level seminar
exploring the experience of Ethiopia in receiving HIPC and MDRI debt relief and was followed by a trip to
Addis Ababa. The resulting national debt strategy is awaiting approval by the government. Given uncertain
prospects for debt relief, the strategy focuses on domestic debt markets to finance development projects.
The authorities consider that technical assistance on external debt management, external debt statistics,
macroeconomic policies, and financial programming would be helpful to advance their debt strategy.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Chileshe Mpundu Kapwepwe, Executive Director for Sudan
and Felicia Dlamini-Kunene Advisor to the Executive Director
September 7, 2016
The Sudanese authorities appreciate the continued engagement with the Fund and thank
Staff for the constructive discussions during the Article IV mission in Khartoum. They
broadly concur with the analysis of the challenges facing Sudan and agree with the
assessment and conclusions of the Staff report.
Background and context
Despite underlying challenges, the authorities are making concerted efforts to manage the
Sudanese economy and unlock its great potential. Being one of the largest countries in
Africa, in both population and surface area, the country is well-endowed with natural
resources, including minerals, water and arable land. Benefitting from the successful
implementation of the 2012-2014 three-year Program for Economic Stabilization, Sudan
has maintained reasonable GDP growth rates, exceeding 3 percent post secession of
South Sudan. That said, the country continues to face challenges. The structural
weaknesses and limited market penetration compounded by US imposed economic
sanctions, internal conflicts and debt overhang have limited economic growth and
constrained the country from attaining its full potential. The situation was exacerbated by
the country’s separation from the South which, created huge financing needs and led to
both internal and external imbalances.
Notwithstanding the authorities’ stabilization efforts, the loss of significant oil reserves
has necessitated concerted effort to transform the economy. Within this context, the
authorities have prioritized addressing the structural rigidities to encourage export
diversification. They have adopted a successor five-year (2015-2019) Program for
Economic Reform. The successor program seeks to consolidate progress made under the
three-year stabilization program in order to further enhance economic stability, promote
inclusive growth and achieve sustainable development. To complement the economic
reform agenda, the authorities have also prepared the 2016-2020 Poverty Reduction
Strategy (PRS).
At the same time, the sanctions, by preventing trade between the US and Sudan, and
limiting access to the international financial system, lowers Sudan’s capacity to attract
foreign direct investment. In addition, foreign banks have been slowly withdrawing their
correspondent banking relations, especially following the recent enforcement actions
against international banks for violating US sanctions. This has also had unintended
consequences on private sector activity and ordinary citizens, including the most
vulnerable, in particular through remittances, export receipts, and import financing.
Transaction costs have increased significantly, as well as cash transactions. At the
regulatory level, recent developments are undermining efforts to strengthen the
AML/CMT framework.

On the political front, the authorities have made notable progress toward resolving
internal conflicts. They successfully and peacefully concluded the administrative
referendum in Darfur held in April 2016. At the same time, the National Dialogue is still
ongoing and a comprehensive road map for peace was signed by the leading opposition
parties and armed rebels on August 8, 2016 in Addis Ababa. These positive
developments have laid the foundation for restoring peace and security in Darfur and the
country as a whole. They will encourage reprioritization of resources from war to
development spending. The authorities have also endeavored to normalize relations with
the international community and creditors and to mobilize support for removal of
sanctions and debt relief.
Recent economic developments and outlook
Economic growth slowed to 3.5 percent in 2014 before rebounding to 4.9 percent in
2015. The recovery was supported by better than expected performance in agriculture.
The authorities’ stabilization policies curbed inflationary pressures and helped reduce
inflation from 36.9 percent in 2014 to 17. 3 percent in 2015. Further central bank efforts
to contain growth in reserve money have dampened inflationary pressures and inflation is
expected to average 13 percent in 2016, remaining within the authorities’ target.
The slump in oil and commodity prices led to the deterioration of the current account as
commodity other export earnings declined significantly. This coupled with higher import
transactions costs contributed to widening of the current account. However, external
support from Gulf States helped cushion erosion of international reserves which
contracted to 1.4 months of import cover. Even though the budget targeted a primary
deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP, the deficit is expected to reach 1.9 percent of GDP for
2016 due to implementation of the Darfur referendum.
The economic outlook remains positive, although the low commodity prices, sanctions
and the recent floods are expected present downside risks to growth prospects in 2016.
Fiscal policy
The authorities have endeavored to maintain fiscal restraint while preserving social
spending. However, financing needs remain large, in part, due to the significant fall in oil
prices and also on account of the considerable revenue gaps created by the secession of
South Sudan. Given the limited access to external budgetary and balance of payments
support, the authorities will continue to implement fiscal consolidation with the view to
reduce the deficit to 0.4 percent by 2019. The consolidation plan will combine
expenditure restraint, revenue mobilization and enhanced public finance management.
On the revenue side, the authorities have made significant efforts to increase domestic
revenues. Since tax revenue performance is still relatively low by comparison, they
continue to focus on strengthening revenue mobilization by enforcing compliance,
reducing tax exemptions, reviewing the taxation and royalties on extractive industries

and, reviewing direct taxes including income and corporate taxes. The program for
economic reform also focuses on reviewing and harmonizing the tax codes. On the
expenditure front, the authorities will continue to rationalize subsidies and strengthen the
social safety net. In this regard, they are implementing gradual liberalization of wheat,
hydrocarbons and electricity.
The authorities will continue to strengthen public finance management. Benefiting from
Fund technical assistance, they have introduced an integrated financial management
system and the Treasury Single Account (TSA).
External Debt and the Zero Option
Sudan remains in debt distress and despite significant progress made in meeting the
technical prerequisites under the Fund SMPs, the country has not received positive
response from the international community on debt relief and prospects have not
improved significantly. In addition, the two-year ‘Zero Option Agreement’ which was
seen by the authorities as a means to strengthen efforts through joint outreach between
Sudan and South Sudan towards seeking debt relief expired in 2014. The extension, in
turn, is due to expire in October 2016 without any favorable prospects. Hence the
authorities face a dilemma, the lack of progress has dampened the political appetite for a
further extension while without the zero option the debt has to be apportioned and this
too will be politically challenging. That said, the authorities are cognizant of the
developments in South Sudan characterized by rising conflicts and instability. In this
regard, they may be open to considering further extension of the ‘Zero Option’ which
expires in October 2016 with the anticipation of a positive outcome on debt relief.
Monetary policy
The authorities agree on the need to adopt tighter fiscal and monetary policy to anchor
macroeconomic stability and reduce financing gaps in light of the uncertain and shortterm nature of financing. In this context, monetary policy will continue to focus on
containing reserve money growth and are in the process of developing instruments for
effective liquidity management. The authorities’ consolidation efforts will also focus on
reducing the government deficit and minimizing the central bank’s quasi fiscal activities.
They have also made efforts to strengthen the AML/CFT framework. Successful
implementation of the key recommendations of the MENAFAFT led to Sudan’s removed
from the ‘gray list’ of countries requiring regular follow-up to biennial updates.
Exchange rate policy
Large external imbalances compounded by the loss of correspondent banking relations
created instability in the exchange rate and led to foreign exchange shortages which have
exerted significant pressures on the exchange rate. As a result, the differential between
the official and parallel rates has widened significantly. The authorities recognize that
distortions in the foreign exchange market are weakening the credibility of the exchange
rate policy thereby underlining the need to reform the foreign exchange regime. Though

the rationale for harmonizing the exchange rate and introducing greater exchange rate
flexibility is acknowledged by the authorities, they remain cautious and emphasize the
need for a gradual approach to minimize destabilizing the financial sector and the impact
on the vulnerable population.
Structural reforms
The authorities acknowledge that concerted efforts are required for Sudan’s economic
potential to materialize and are focusing on addressing key structural impediments in the
economy to encourage private sector activity and attract FDI. Although removal of
sanctions would benefit the economy significantly the authorities are taking important
measures aimed at improving the business environment. In this regard, the investment
law is currently under review and should be issued end 2016. The new law focuses on
removing legal and administrative obstacles to private sector investment and growth. In
addition, they will continue investing in infrastructure, particularly roads, ports and
electricity. Further, the authorities are strengthening their efforts to improve human
capital development by designing programs that will remove disparities and strengthen
provision of education and health services.
Conclusion
The authorities will continue to strengthen their efforts to attaining peace and stability by
enhancing progress toward resolving internal conflicts. They remain committed to
cooperating with the Fund on policies and have made progress in strengthening economic
policies and institutions benefiting from Fund support. The authorities will continue their
efforts to normalize relations with the US, which has been an impediment to progress on
debt relief, as well as with creditors in particular to garner support for removal of
sanctions and possibly debt relief.
