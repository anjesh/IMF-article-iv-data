IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Belgium
On March 2, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Belgium.
The recovery is expected to continue at a modest pace in the near term, driven primarily by
private consumption, supported by continued low energy prices. However, downside risks loom
large, including from the slowdown in emerging markets, financial volatility, and geopolitical
stress.
In its first year in office, the new government has taken important steps to promote
competitiveness, job creation, and fiscal sustainability. Key reforms enacted include pension
reforms, a suspension of wage indexation (“saut d’index”), and a “tax shift” reducing the labor
tax wedge. The sixth reform of the state has brought a further devolution of responsibilities,
greater tax autonomy for the regions, and a gradual rollout of a revised funding and transfer
system.
Notwithstanding recent reform progress, major challenges continue to weigh on Belgium’s
economic prospects—including high public debt and severe labor market fragmentation. The
fiscal gains made in previous decades have been reversed since the crisis, and the public debt-toGDP ratio has returned to triple digits. The pace of consolidation since 2010 has been much
slower than in other euro area countries, as public spending continued to grow faster than GDP
until recently. With the deficit hovering around three percent of GDP, fiscal sustainability is
tenuous and sensitive to potential macroeconomic shocks. And while private employment is
beginning to recover, there is entrenched high unemployment and inactivity among certain
groups, including the young, the low-skilled, and immigrants from outside the European Union.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the recent reforms, including wage
moderation, the tax shift away from labor, and the recent pension reform, which should support
job creation and significantly reduce the projected increase in the economic cost of aging.
Looking ahead, Directors considered that high public debt and structural rigidities pose
challenges to the outlook and that risks are tilted to the downside. They noted that in order to
build buffers against future shocks, the focus should be to bring down public debt while
nurturing the recovery and social cohesion. On the structural side, efforts are needed to address
labor market fragmentation and further strengthen the financial sector.
Directors concurred that the government’s ambitious goal of reaching structural fiscal balance
by 2018 would require substantial additional measures. To minimize the drag on growth, fiscal
consolidation should be primarily expenditure-based and underpinned by high quality structural
measures. In particular, Directors saw scope for making public spending more efficient,
including through well-targeted reductions in public employment, enhanced means-testing in
social spending to better protect the most vulnerable, and improved budgetary control across all
levels of government. On the revenue side, Directors recommended more efficient taxation of
wealth and real estate and phasing out of generous tax exemptions.
Directors agreed that addressing the severe labor market fragmentation through a comprehensive
and inclusive jobs strategy is essential to boosting growth prospects. They encouraged further
efforts to reduce the labor tax wedge for the low-skilled, improve education and training, and
strengthen incentives toward active labor market participation. These employment policies
should be complemented by steps to remove barriers to geographic mobility, promote
competition, and reduce the administrative burden on companies.
Directors shared the view that Belgium’s financial sector is generally healthy, and maintaining
its soundness will be important to ensure resilience against shocks. Banks’ business models
should continue to adapt in the context of a protracted low-interest environment. Given the
strong growth in mortgage lending, Directors recommended vigilance and proactive supervision,
including consideration of targeted prudential measures to limit overexposures of vulnerable
borrowers.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
February 12, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. The new government has taken important steps to support job creation and
address the cost of aging—notably through wage moderation, pension reform, and a tax
shift. But growth prospects remain mediocre, public debt very high, and the labor market
severely fragmented. Downside risks loom large, including from the slowdown in
emerging markets, financial volatility, and geopolitical stress.
Policies. The central task is to achieve a lasting reduction in public debt while nurturing
the recovery and social cohesion. With persistent fiscal deficits and public debt again
well above 100 percent of GDP, fiscal sustainability is highly sensitive to shocks. While
employment is recovering, there is entrenched high unemployment among the young,
the low-skilled, and immigrants from outside the EU.
Fiscal. The government’s goal of achieving structural fiscal balance by 2018 is laudable
but ambitious—with almost two percent of GDP of measures yet to be identified.
Adjustment should be based on reforms that improve efficiency, thereby minimizing the
drag on growth. There is significant scope for greater spending efficiency, including
through targeted staffing reductions, enhanced means-testing in social spending, and
improved budgetary control. The tax shift could be partly financed through a more
efficient taxation of wealth and real estate, and a further greening of taxes, including by
eliminating generous fiscal incentives for company cars.
Jobs. To tap Belgium’s full economic potential, there is an urgent need to address the
severe labor market fragmentation via a comprehensive and inclusive jobs strategy. This
should include further cuts in the labor tax wedge for lower incomes, better education
and training to meet language and technical requirements, as well as enhanced
activation policies and work incentives. Barriers to geographical mobility should be
reduced, including by addressing the severe traffic congestion in large urban centers.
And the high administrative burden of regulation should be reduced.
Financial stability. The banking sector has returned to profitability. Challenges from the
protracted low-interest environment and heavy reliance on mortgage lending warrant
further adjustment in business models and targeted prudential measures.

CONTEXT: MODERATE RECOVERY, REFORMS ADVANCE
1.
In its first year in office, the government has taken important steps to promote
competitiveness, job creation, and fiscal sustainability. The three main reforms enacted were
pension reforms raising the retirement age, a suspension of wage indexation (“saut d’index”), and a
“tax shift” reducing the labor tax wedge. Widespread strikes took place in the initial months of the
right-leaning coalition, but recent efforts to better involve social partners in certain policy
deliberations have helped improve relations. At the same time, the sixth reform of the state has
brought a further devolution of responsibilities, greater tax autonomy for the regions, and a gradual
rollout of a revised funding and transfer system. These policies are generally consistent with several
of last year’s Article IV recommendations (Appendix I).
2.
Output growth has been resilient, supported by solid wage growth and comparatively
slow fiscal consolidation. Consumer spending contributed more than half to 2007–14 real GDP
growth, benefiting from healthy private sector balance sheets, robust mortgage lending, and solid
wage growth including from the automatic indexation mechanism (until its suspension a year ago).
In contrast to many other euro area countries, post-crisis fiscal consolidation was very modest,
notwithstanding a sizeable level of debt and deficits, making government spending another
important driver of growth. Investment contributed the remainder, while net exports were broadly
neutral (Figure 1). In 2015, growth was again highly reliant on private consumption as public
spending slowed while trend investment and net export growth (abstracting from large one-off
transactions) were relatively subdued.1
3.
Government policies have also contributed to inflation and employment growth above
euro area averages. Wage indexation and continued government spending propped up domestic
demand in the aftermath of the crisis, and the output gap did not widen as much as in other EU
countries. As a result, core inflation has remained above peers, averaging around 1½ percent
since 2011. Headline inflation rebounded in 2015, as the effect of the collapse of energy prices in
the second half of 2014 wore off. At the same time, employment growth has benefitted from public
support through direct hiring as well as a sharp rise in labor subsidies. As a result, the
unemployment rate, at 8½ percent, is only one percentage point above the pre-crisis level, and
almost entirely structural.

Belgium’s external competitiveness has declined significantly since the early 2000s.
After years of large current account surpluses, Belgium gradually lost export market shares, until a
sharp fall in net exports brought the current account into broad balance during the crisis (Figure 2).
This trend was partly due to high and rapidly growing labor costs that had outpaced productivity
growth since the mid-2000s. More recently, with policy actions imposing wage moderation
(including the saut d’index), a weaker euro, and growing labor productivity, the current account may
again move into a small surplus, thanks to strong growth of service exports and income from the
large net international investment position. Notwithstanding these recent improvements, staff’s
preliminary assessment under the External Balance Assessment (EBA) suggests that Belgium’s
external position is still moderately weaker than medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies
would imply (see Appendix I). On the basis of the EBA exchange rate assessment, staff considers the
real effective exchange rate to be overvalued by between 0 to 10 percent.

Falling export market shares for goods were partially
compensated by gains in services.

A long track record of fiscal consolidation has been undone during the crisis, bringing
the public debt ratio back well into the triple digits. After more than a decade of running large
structural primary surpluses, Belgium reduced its public debt-to-GDP ratio from 131 percent
in 1995 to 87 percent in 2007 (Figure 3). Since then, real primary expenditure growth, driven by
social benefits and the wage bill, outpaced real GDP growth, offsetting much of the revenue-based
adjustment effort. The resulting structural deficits—plus the one-off costs for crisis support to
banks—have brought public debt back to 106 percent of GDP at end-2015. While Belgium exited
the Excessive Deficit Procedure in June 2014, the 2014 deficit turned out still marginally above
3 percent of GDP. The European Commission judged this episode to be due to exceptional and
temporary factors; an assessment that was supported by significant reforms advanced by the new
government and ambitious fiscal structural adjustment objectives.

The recent pension reform is a major step toward addressing the long-term cost of
aging. Successive reforms of early retirement schemes starting in 2012 have been complemented by
a broader pension reform adopted in August 2015 (See Appendix III). The main elements involve:
first, a gradual increase in the legal retirement age from 65 to 66 in 2025 and 67 in 2030; second,
raising the minimum age and career length required for early retirement starting in 2017; and third,

boosting the minimum age for survivor’s pension. The reforms are expected to halve the annual
growth in pension costs in the long run from the current 4–5 percent per year. They should also
accelerate progress in increasing the employment rate as well as the effective retirement age, which
in 2012 was the second lowest in the OECD (59.2 years).
7.
The reduction in social security contributions as part of the tax shift should boost
employment growth. The tax shift aims to improve competitiveness and strengthen purchasing
power through tax relief and lower social security contributions for employers and reduced personal
income taxes for employees. Given that the main measures are targeted toward lower incomes, they
could stimulate significantly employment rates of vulnerable groups (see Box 1). Counterbalancing
measures under the tax shift include increases in the VAT on electricity, excises on diesel, alcohol,
tobacco, and sugary drinks, increases on withholding taxes, and new taxes on certain financial
vehicles and on short-term capital gains. The yield of some of the new tax measures is uncertain,
and the tax shift is not revenue neutral, even if supply-side benefits (Box 1) are taken into account.

minimum wage will be reduced by 6½ percentage
points, while labor costs for the median worker will fall
by only about 1¾ percent. The targeting of low wages
favors the young and the unskilled, who tend to have
lower wages, but also the lowest employment rates.
The tax shift has thus the potential to support
activation for some of the most vulnerable groups.

Wage Distribution in Belgium and SSC Reduction, 2013

1500-1749

To address some of the effects related to the high
and—until recently—rapidly increasing labor costs, the
coalition government, building on the previous
government’s measures, is reducing the employers’
social security contribution (SSC) gradually from
33 percent to 25 percent in 2019. This reduction is in
effect smaller on average than it might seem, given the
numerous existing exceptions which leave the current
effective contribution rate closer to 27 percent.

This could be substantial, particularly for the low-skilled whose employment rate is 37 percent. The
reduction of labor costs alone could increase aggregate employment by an additional 35,000–40,000 jobs, of
which more than a third would be among the lower-skilled. Belgian estimates by the Planning Bureau and
the National Bank of Belgium (NBB) using more fully specified models are in a similar range. They suggest
the creation of an additional 45,000–65,000 jobs by 2021. In the NBB’s model, the reduction of the
employers’ SSC contributions alone will create 49,000 jobs by 2021.

The banking sector has refocused on the domestic market, in particular mortgage
lending. Bank assets have fallen from above 400 percent of GDP in 2008 to about 275 percent
in 2014, largely by shedding activities abroad. Credit to the private sector has risen strongly since
early 2013, driven primarily by household mortgage growth (Figure 4), although the most recent
growth is affected by anticipating reductions in tax deductibility (“bonus logement”) at the regional
level. Gross household indebtedness has risen to about 62 percent of GDP, though net financial
assets have remained comparatively high. Bank credit to non-financial corporations has been
growing much more moderately, partly because large companies can finance themselves on the
markets. The aggregate size of corporate balance sheets, with liabilities at almost 290 percent of
GDP in 2014, reflects Belgium’s position as a corporate treasury center where multinationals raise
funds in Belgium and distribute them to related entities abroad. Excluding these positions, corporate
debt (bank loans and debt securities issued) was around 45 percent of GDP in mid-2015.

OUTLOOK: MEDIOCRE GROWTH, DOWNSIDE RISKS
9.
The recovery is expected to continue at a modest pace in the near term, while inflation
will spike temporarily due to tax measures. Real GDP growth is projected to remain just under
1½ percent in 2016 (as in the previous two years), driven again primarily by private consumption
(supported by continued low energy prices), while investment growth pauses due to base effects
from one-off transactions in previous years. External demand will help somewhat, driven by the
moderate euro area recovery and the depreciated exchange rate. Headline inflation is set to rise to
1¾ percent in 2016 due to tax increases under the tax shift. Under the projected baseline mediumterm recovery, the output gap will close gradually, bringing inflation back closer to euro area
average and unemployment down to its structural level of around 7½ percent by 2020.

services. While capital’s contribution to potential
growth is expected to return close to pre-crisis levels, both those from employment and Total Factor
Productivity (TFP) will likely remain substantially reduced.
11.
In the current volatile global environment, downside risks loom large. External risks are
particularly elevated, while domestic risks are large but more of a medium-term nature. Key risks can
be summarized as follows (see Appendix IV):


China and emerging markets slowdown. Direct exposures are relatively low, but the economy’s
openness and strong integration into global value chains through Germany means high
exposure to indirect shocks from abroad. Preliminary calculations suggest that for every
1 percent reduction in the Chinese average 2016–20 growth due to a domestic negative
investment demand shock, the Belgian economy could grow by about 0.2 percent slower.



Financial markets volatility. New shocks from unanticipated changes in growth and financial
fundamentals in large and emerging economies could enhance financial volatility (from already
elevated levels in recent months), impair confidence in euro area economies, and eventually
stifle the incipient recovery.

Box 2. Potential Output in Belgium
Potential output plays an important role in assessing fiscal
efforts and projecting future growth, inflation,
unemployment, and debt dynamics. Following significant
revisions in recent years, IMF staff has sought to improve
the consistency and robustness of its estimates by using a
multivariate filter approach that incorporates empirical
relationships between actual and potential GDP,
unemployment, and inflation. This filter has been applied to
assess potential output in the global economy (2015 April
WEO) and to some of the euro area’s biggest economies.1

the late 1990s, likely mostly due to a gradual decline in TFP
growth, mirrored in other advanced economies and partially related to structural factors. These include lower
growth returns from ICT and the reallocation of factors to sectors with comparatively lower productivity levels
and slower productivity growth; e.g personal- and non-market services2. In Belgium, more dynamic employment
growth initially offset this decline and maintained potential growth above 2 percent until the mid 2000s.
However, the collapse of TFP growth during the crisis cut potential growth by half; despite labor and capital
contributions that still compared rather favorably with peers. On average, the contribution of TFP has been zero
since the crisis.



Regional risks. If the euro area recovery were to falter, Belgium will be particularly affected given
its openness and strong intra-EU trade linkages, including to Germany, France, and the
Netherlands. The EU’s refugee surge has so far had a modest impact on Belgium, but could
eventually pose a significant challenge, especially given Belgium’s poor track record of labor
market integration of non-EU migrants (see below).



Fiscal policy. A key domestic policy risk relates to the longer-term fiscal outlook, which could
veer off course if benefits of recent reforms (such as the tax shift) turn out to be smaller than
anticipated and/or fiscal federalism hampers the ability to deliver the overall intended
adjustment. This, together with potentially lackluster growth, could worsen debt dynamics and
eventually undermine confidence in fiscal sustainability.



House prices. After a long period of rapid growth, house prices have stabilized since 2013.
A sharp reversal could have a significant impact on consumption, even if banks’ exposures could
be managed (see below). However, staff analysis does not suggest a major overvaluation, as past
price trends were broadly in line with borrowing cost, demographic and income developments.2

POLICY CHALLENGES
12.
Notwithstanding recent reform progress, major challenges continue to weigh on
Belgium’s economic prospects—including high public debt and severe labor market
fragmentation. The fiscal gains made in previous decades have been reversed since the crisis, and
the public debt-to-GDP ratio has returned to triple digits. The pace of consolidation since 2010 has
been much slower than in other euro area countries, as public spending continued to grow faster
than GDP until recently. With the deficit hovering around three percent of GDP, fiscal sustainability is
tenuous and sensitive to potential macroeconomic shocks. While private sector employment is
beginning to recover, there is entrenched high unemployment and inactivity among certain groups,
including the young, the low-skilled, and non-EU immigrants. This has not only considerable human
and social costs, but also detracts from Belgium’s longer-term economic potential.
13.
Belgium needs to rebuild buffers against future shocks by laying the foundations for a
lasting reduction in public debt. Downside risks have already increased, as evidenced by the
increased volatility in financial markets in recent months, underscoring the urgency of rebuilding
buffers while growth remains solid, as projected under staff’s baseline. This requires bringing down
the deficit, but doing so without undermining the recovery or social cohesion. The policy discussions
thus focused on how to square this circle, in particular by making tax and expenditure policies more
efficient, advancing growth-oriented reforms, and maintaining financial stability.

15.
A balanced budget would be a credible medium-term anchor for addressing the debt
problem. The authorities’ objective is to achieve structural balance at all levels of government
by 2018, which means about ⅔ percent of GDP adjustment on average per year for the next three
years.3 This pace can be justified given the importance of underpinning longer-term fiscal
sustainability after a period where structural adjustment has been very limited—just ¼ percentage
point of GDP per year since 2010. Over the medium term, reaching budget balance would help
reinforce the decline in the public debt ratio. However, the design of the consolidation strategy
should take into account that the accelerated pace of adjustment will create significant drag on
aggregate demand (even under modest multiplier assumptions, see text table above), thereby
slowing the initial reduction in the debt ratio compared to the authorities’ stated objective. The
quality of adjustment measures is thus of critical importance.
16.
The authorities’ target is very
ambitious and requires additional
measures, the bulk of
which should come from the
expenditure side. To reach structural
balance by 2018 (using staff’s estimate of
potential GDP), additional structural
effort of 1¾−2 percent of GDP would be
needed over the coming three years.4
There are differing views in Belgium on
how to close the fiscal gap—some are
skeptical about new taxes, while others
are concerned about the impact of
possible spending cuts. Staff argued that,
given the high tax level and past strong
expenditure growth, the consolidation
should be mostly expenditure-based,
especially as staff’s analysis (Selected
Issues) indicates significant scope for
making public spending more efficient,
thus mitigating the impact on growth.

4/ Beyond the government plan to cut social security spending (See Hallaert
and Nowak, 2015). Additional measures could include (1) tightening the
eligibility rules of sickness and disabilities schemes and unemployment to
avoid their use as early retirement scheme and (2) increasing the use of means
testing.
5/ Assuming that the redistributive power of social benefits is increased to the
EU average, Belgium could achieve the same reduction in income inequality at
a fiscal cost lower by 3¼ points of GDP. This number is reduced by the planned
reforms of social security (See Hallaert and Nowak, 2015).
6/ Includes the reform of capital income taxation. Belgium’s High Council of
Finance (2014) estimates that a comprehensive reform of the capital income
taxation alone could increase the revenue by 1 to 2 percent of GDP per year.

3

The European Council calls for structural fiscal adjustment of at least 0.6 percent of GDP in 2015 and 2016. The
calculation of structural balance depends on potential output and the output gap, with Fund staff and the
Commission estimating a less negative output gap than the authorities, implying that to achieve structural balance,
even more structural adjustment would be needed according to staff’s methodology.
4

This fiscal projection reflects the high uncertainty surrounding yield estimates from certain new revenue streams
under the tax shift and substantial budgeted expenditure savings that are yet to be specified in detail. Other
differences from the authorities’ 2016 budget estimates include macroeconomic assumptions and the projection of
the 2015 budget outturn. Both the authorities’ and staff projections include additional security-related spending
following the recent security lockdown in Brussels.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17.
Making public spending more efficient requires deep reforms at all levels of
government. At around 55 percent of GDP, the level of government spending is among the highest
in the EU. While it is projected to decline gradually, there is significant scope for securing additional
adjustment through reforms to ensure that spending translates well into better economic and social
outcomes (Figure 5 and Selected Issues). Possible measures include:


Wage bill. At 12.7 percent of GDP in 2014, the wage bill is high by international standards and
has been increasing rapidly. To complement wage moderation, there is scope for faster than
planned attrition-based and well-targeted reductions in public employment across all levels of
government.



Social spending. The efficiency of social spending could be improved significantly, notably
through enhanced means-testing of benefits with a view to better targeting the most vulnerable.
To illustrate the potential for efficiency gains, if the redistributive power of social benefits was at
EU average, Belgium could achieve the same reduction in income inequality at a lower fiscal cost
by 3¼ percentage points of GDP.



Health spending. A significant factor in the cost of aging, health spending could be made much
more efficient, including by further reducing medication and hospitalization costs, and better
enforcing budget ceilings.



Unemployment benefits. Linking benefits to job search and accelerating the phase-out of
benefits with employer top-up that act as an early retirement scheme could improve the
unemployment benefit system. More generally, as reforms are implemented, care should be
taken to limit the scope for substitution across benefits, for example as observed when the
tightening in early retirement was accompanied by increased use of disability benefits.



Education spending has increased sharply without apparent improvements in test scores.
Reviewing the system and refocusing it on the areas with the biggest education gaps would also
help address labor market issues described below.



Public investment. With overall investment relatively modest, the focus should be on redirecting
resources to more productive projects, notably in transport infrastructure.

Strengthening budget monitoring and close coordination between levels of
government are even more important after the sixth reform of the state. The reform devolves
many fiscal responsibilities to communities and regions, and involves a revised system of financing
and transfers which will require additional adjustment at the sub-national level. For example,
because transfers from the federal government are in part linked to specific taxes such as the
personal income tax (PIT), lower PIT rates under the tax shift will imply lower revenues for
communities. Closer coordination will be needed to ensure that fiscal commitments at the general
government level can be met. In this context, it is crucial to improve budgetary control through
strengthening and integrating intra-year monitoring of budget execution across all levels of
government.

There is still scope to improve the efficiency and fairness of the tax system.5 Beyond the
measures already passed under the tax shift, staff argued for a more efficient taxation of wealth,
including by introducing a broader capital gains tax, shifting real estate taxes from transactions to
recurring charges, and limiting the favorable tax treatment of rental income. Further strengthening
environmental charges and eliminating the generous fiscal incentives for company cars would have
both environmental and fiscal benefits. There is also scope for improving VAT efficiency. Finally,
regions could use their new fiscal responsibilities to further target the income tax cuts toward the
lower wage ranges.

Authorities’ views. The authorities reiterated their commitment to reaching structural budget
balance by 2018. They acknowledged that further measures would be needed, but expressed
confidence that the adopted policies will go a long way toward this goal, especially as reductions in
labor costs under the tax shift will lead to increased employment and revenues. They also pointed to
expected savings from a redesign of the functioning of the federal government, including improving
the management of real estate holdings and centralizing and streamlining procurement practices.
They stressed their determination to continue the reform efforts. For example, they intend to further
reform the pension system in 2016 by focusing on the second pillar, notably by disallowing benefitting
from the supplementary pension before the legal age of retirement. Additional measures to reduce the
growth in spending on health should further help limit the cost of aging over the medium-term.
The authorities also intend to promote reactivation policies for people benefiting from disability
allowance and strengthen the benefit allocation control mechanism. With respect to the sixth reform of
the state, communities and regions have taken steps to improve monitoring and control, and all plan
to close their (relatively small) budget deficits by 2018.

B. Tapping Belgium’s Full Labor Market Potential
21.
The severe fragmentation of the labor market has major social and economic costs.
Belgium’s unemployment rate is slightly below the euro area average, partly thanks to public
employment and labor subsidies. However, the labor market is deeply segmented (Figure 7, Selected
Issues). Differences are particularly stark in four dimensions—regionally, with unemployment just
5 percent in Flanders, almost 12 percent in Wallonia, and a staggering 18½ percent in the Brussels
capital region; age-wise, with employment rates low among the young and the elderly; skill-related,
with mismatches resulting in structurally high job vacancies and low employment rates of the low
skilled; and by immigration background, with only about half of non-EU born residents aged 25–54
employed, compared to over 80 percent for Belgian-born residents. The underlying problems are
complex and interlinked—involving longer-term structural changes affecting the regions, barriers to
labor mobility, language barriers, significant gaps in education and training for certain groups, illaligned incentives for work, and a wage setting process that does not fully reflect economic
conditions.
22.
Addressing this problem is all the more urgent given the ongoing refugee crisis.
Between 2015 and 2017, asylum seekers alone may add up to one percent to Belgium’s population
(Box 3). In the long run, the inflow of refugees could benefit potential output growth and help
reduce the cost of aging, especially when migrants are young and educated. To reap these benefits,
however, Belgium needs to dramatically improve the integration of non-EU migrants. The
government’s decision to reduce the waiting period for refugees to get a work permit from six to
four months is an important step in the right direction. However, staff noted that active labor market
policies in the form of training and language support, and specific adjustments to labor and product
market regulations may be needed to accelerate their integration. Because the benefits of such
policies would not be limited to refugees, substantial synergies exist between facilitating their
integration and addressing the underlying causes of the wider labor market segmentation.

Box 3. Integration of Migrants
Belgium has a poor track record of integrating nonEU migrants into the labor market. Immigration from
other European countries and from outside the EU has
been the main driver behind Belgium’s relatively
healthy population growth. Poor integration of
immigrants from outside the EU is however a source of
concern not only for public finances, but also for social
cohesion. In no other European country is inactivity
among non-EU migrants as prevalent as in Belgium.
Further, the likelihood of a non-EU migrant in Belgium
being employed is the lowest on the continent.

reach 100,000 (including 6,000 under the agreed EU agreement), which would correspond to about
0.9 percent of Belgium’s total population.
Inflows of refugees bring opportunities … Predominantly male, and substantially younger than the
Belgian average, the current wave of refugees can bring a demographic boost and thus benefits in terms
of potential output and fiscal sustainability in the longer run. While details on skill levels are not available,
there are indications that the education level for many refugees may be higher than during earlier refugee
crises. Many natives of Syria and Iraq also have relevant language skills.
… but also risks. Apart from the political and social risks that poor integration can bring, creating labor
market opportunities should be a priority to minimize the short-term burden on public expenditure. The
longer it takes for refugees to find a job, the bigger the social expenditure and foregone tax revenues. A
combination of poor labor market opportunities and a generous welfare system could create inactivity
traps and reduce incentives to assimilate, learn the local languages and upgrade existing skills. This would
be particularly problematic in Belgium, where also low-skilled natives have comparably higher
unemployment and inactivity rates.

20

23.
Tapping Belgium’s full labor market potential requires a comprehensive and inclusive
jobs strategy. Wage moderation and the saut d’index have led to improvements on the cost side,
and the government has reinforced activation policies to address long-term unemployment,
increased the effective retirement age, and strengthened incentives to return to work after longterm illness. These are important steps, which are expected to provide positive impulses for the
coming years. Areas for further policy improvements include:


To lock in the benefits from recent wage moderation, the wage formation process could be
reformed to account not only for price developments but also broader labor market and
economic conditions.



Education and training could be improved to better meet languages and technical skill
requirements. This could be supported by aligning curricula closer to local labor market needs
and by intensifying the cooperation between schools and employers, including under
apprenticeship programs (which are a successful tradition in the German-speaking community).
Promoting and improving the targeting of continuous education could support the labor force’s
flexibility and quality, for example to allow for greater movement between economic sectors.



Work incentives for the unemployed could be strengthened, e.g. by making benefits still more
degressive and enforcing strengthened job search requirements. In the meantime, the job
search could benefit from more effective support by unemployment agencies, and individualized
training offers. Additional targeted reductions in the labor tax wedge could further promote job
creation for the low-skilled.



Geographic segmentation could be addressed by reducing barriers to mobility and improving
collaboration between local governments. Addressing the severe traffic congestion in some
large urban centers (see below), improving public transport, and reducing disincentives to
buy/sell a house (see 2015 Selected Issues) would make the labor force more mobile.
Collaboration between regional entities could be further encouraged to improve the flow of
information, harmonize administrative procedures, and share opportunities more effectively.

24.
Authorities’ views. The authorities acknowledged the labor market challenges, including the
need to integrate non-EU migrants better into the labor force. They noted that the recent efforts at
wage moderation, including through the saut d’index, and the cuts in the labor tax wedge under the
tax shift should help improve conditions for vulnerable groups. They did not favor a special minimum
wage, as previous experiments with lower minimum wages for the young did not boost youth
employment. While a reform of the collective wage negotiation process is being discussed by social
partners—including the role of seniority in the wage setting—it is unlikely that this would involve
moving away from automatic indexation as this system has been an important anchor of the social
contract in Belgium. Other areas for reform include the regulation of night work for e-commerce
businesses and the establishment of career accounts for training. They highlighted the continued
efforts to improve vocational training schemes.

C. Supporting Economic Growth and Financial Stability
25.
To unlock Belgium’s full economic potential, employment policies alone will not
suffice. The administrative burden remains substantial, especially for smaller companies, and heavy
regulation of some product markets is limiting competition and constraining export growth.
Moreover, severe traffic congestion in large urban centers is impeding economic activity. Addressing
these bottlenecks will require targeted policy action:


Alleviating traffic congestion in urban areas. Drivers in Belgium lose more time in traffic than in
any other European country.6 Besides disrupting commuter traffic, congestion also hampers
business and investment in urban centers, and carries significant health costs. To reduce these
pressures, staff recommended abolishing the tax deductibility of company cars (which account
for more than 40 percent of new car registrations in Belgium), expanding road pricing schemes,
and investing in well-targeted public transport projects.



Easing the regulatory burden to support growth and employment. Staff analysis has shown that
liberalization could be most effective in retail, transport, and professional services, notably
accounting and legal professions. Some of the barriers appear to be in the form of selfregulatory organizations, which can impose standards that complicate entry. Staff reiterated that
deregulation of these sectors would benefit competition and exports, both directly as well as
indirectly through linkages with other sectors, as greater productivity in services would improve
service inputs for manufacturing exports. Moreover, despite efforts to lighten administrative
procedures for businesses, compliance remains onerous for SMEs and the regionalization of
market access under the sixth reform of the state could set further hurdles. Additional
simplification as well as harmonization across regions should help support growth and
employment.

26.
Maintaining a sound financial sector is critical for supporting the recovery and
ensuring resilience against shocks. Since the crisis, which resulted in the restructuring of Dexia and
Fortis banks, the banking sector has become smaller and focused primarily on the Belgian market.
It is now more resilient and more profitable. The system’s regulatory Tier I capital ratio reached
15.6 percent in 2015:H1, and NPLs remain low (Figure 8). In contrast to other euro area countries,
Belgian banks’ customer deposits exceed their loans at the system level. However, with interest rates
expected to remain low and continuing mortgage refinancing which will lock in lower returns, banks’
business models must continue to adapt and regulators need to remain vigilant and reactive to
existing and emerging risks:
Recent strong household credit growth could be a cause for concern. Risks to bank’s balance
sheets are mitigated by the prevalence of owner-occupancy and of fixed-rate mortgages, as well
as a default law that protects against selective default, and more generally by a relatively strong
net asset position of households. In addition, recent prudential measures raising risk weights on

mortgages appear to have borne fruit. However, a significant share of loans still have relatively
high loan-to-value and/or debt-service-to-income ratios, suggestive of pockets of
vulnerabilities, particularly in the young and low to middle income borrowers, that warrant
continued vigilance. Staff thus recommended considering more targeted actions to limit
overexposures of vulnerable groups (for example, additional risk weights or caps on loan-tovalue ratios or limits on debt-service-to-income ratios). Staff also cautioned against banks’ overreliance on the mortgage business.
Low growth and low inflation will limit profitability in the medium-term, while new forms of
finance will create competition. Although many banks have started to cut costs, further
adjustment of the business model may be needed in some cases. In this context, the similarity in
strategies being pursued may result in reduced system resilience in the face of shocks that
would likely impact the major banks in the same way. For insurance and long-term savings, the
reduction of some minimum guaranteed interest rates (e.g. on complementary pensions) is a
step towards reducing the sector’s exposure to protracted low inflation.

Authorities’ views. The authorities pointed to progress made in reducing the regulatory
burden and in making the financial system more resilient, but agreed that certain areas still required
further attention, in particular:


The authorities saw some scope for facilitating market entry and reducing the administrative costs
that fall disproportionally on small firms. They pointed out, however, that the overall regulatory
burden in Belgium was comparable to the EU average, and that productivity growth has been
satisfactory in firms linked to the export sector. The authorities agreed with the need to address
traffic congestion including through well-targeted public investment in transport infrastructure.



Regarding concerns about mortgage credit growth, the authorities have extended the add-on to
the risk weights for mortgages while also raising capital requirements for eight banks which were
designated domestic systemically important institutions. Before taking further measures, they
planned to let the impact of changes in tax regimes for mortgage deductibility, now a regional
competency, play out. They also pointed to the more complex institutional environment, with the
European Commission and the European Systemic Risk Board needing to weigh in.

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
One year into office, the government has made important progress in delivering on its
economic reform agenda. At the center of the program are steps to improve external
competitiveness and address the country’s fiscal challenges, with a view to supporting private sector
growth and employment. The saut d’index, building on earlier wage moderation efforts, has further
narrowed the wage gap with neighboring countries. The tax shift, with its reductions in the labor tax
wedge, should support job creation over the medium run. The 2015 pension reform should raise
employment rates and significantly reduce the projected long-term increase in the cost of aging.
29.
The central challenge is to bring down public debt while also nurturing the recovery
and supporting social cohesion. Growth prospects remain mediocre, weighed down by high public
debt and severe labor market fragmentation, and downside risks loom large. The favorable external
conditions that have supported the recovery—including low interest rates, a depreciated euro, and
low oil prices—may not last. And the slowdown in emerging markets, financial market volatility, and
geopolitical stress could dampen or throw the recovery off course. To build buffers against future
shocks, it is imperative to achieve a lasting reduction in public debt. But the challenge is to do so
without undermining the recovery or jeopardizing social cohesion. To this end, fiscal adjustment
should be based on more efficient spending and taxation, while structural reforms should be
focused on the severe fragmentation of the labor market and other obstacles to growth.
30.
The government’s goal of reaching fiscal balance by 2018 is ambitious, and will
require quality measures. Budget balance is a critical milestone toward lasting debt reduction. Staff
estimates that substantial additional fiscal measures are needed over three years to reach structural
balance. To minimize the drag on aggregate demand, it is imperative that fiscal consolidation be
underpinned by high quality structural measures to improve efficiency, even if these may take some

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELGIUM

time to yield results. The bulk of adjustment will have to come from the expenditure side, where
staff sees significant scope for greater efficiency, with a smaller contribution coming from tax
measures, given the already high level of taxation in Belgium.
31.
Public spending should be made much more efficient, while the tax system can also be
further improved. Efforts toward operational improvements at the federal level are welcome, and
there is ample scope for further spending efficiency, for instance through well-targeted reductions in
public employment, enhanced means-testing in social spending to better target the most
vulnerable, and improved budgetary control across all levels of government. These efforts would
allow room for more productive public investment. On revenues, there is scope to partly finance the
tax shift through a more efficient taxation of wealth and real estate and a further greening of the tax
system, including by eliminating generous tax incentives for company cars.
32.
To tap Belgium’s full economic potential, there is an urgent need to address the severe
labor market fragmentation via a comprehensive and inclusive jobs strategy. The current
refugee surge highlights the urgency of adopting measures that would help address deep
segmentation along age, skill level, geographic, and migration background. This should involve
further reducing the labor tax wedge for the low-skilled, improving education and training in
languages and technical skills, strengthening activation policies, and addressing barriers to
geographic mobility. The wage formation process could be adapted to better account for
employment conditions—which could help lock in gains from recent wage moderation.
33.
Efforts to ease traffic congestion and red tape would be important complements to
the employment policies. The severe traffic congestion in some large urban centers could be
alleviated through road pricing schemes, the elimination of tax incentives for company cars, and
well-targeted public transport projects. Structural reforms, such as reducing the administrative
burden on smaller companies and lowering barriers to competition in some service sectors, would
help support employment growth.
34.
The soundness of the financial sector should be maintained to support the recovery
and ensure resilience against shocks. The banking sector has restructured since the crisis, and
returned to profitability. But banks’ business models must continue to adapt. The protracted lowinterest environment weighs on medium-term prospects of both banks and insurance companies,
requiring vigilance and proactive supervision. With credit growth driven primarily by mortgage
lending, additional targeted prudential measures to limit overexposures of vulnerable borrowers
should be considered.
35.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Appendix II. External Balance Assessment
Belgium
Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Background. The net international investment position (NIIP) remains strong, averaging 61 percent of GDP during the first three
quarters of 2015, reflecting very healthy private balance sheets. Despite Belgium’s decline as a financial center, gross foreign assets are
large (averaging 502 percent of GDP). Gross foreign assets of the financial sector stood at 112 percent of GDP, down considerably from
the pre-crisis peak. The external debt of the public sector was 70 percent of GDP. 1/
Assessment. Belgium’s large gross international asset and liability positions are bloated by the presence of corporate treasury units,
without creating macro-relevant mismatches. The remaining risk exposures on the asset side mostly relate to financial sector claims.
Risk exposures on the liability side are related to external public debt. Based on the projected current account and growth paths, the
NIIP to GDP ratio is expected to increase gradually going forward. The strongly positive NIIP and its trajectory do not raise sustainability
concerns.

Current
account

Background. After declining since the early 2000s and reaching deficits of around 1 percent of GDP during the crisis, the CA has been
close to balance during the last three years. 2/ The effect on the trade balance of falling dollar-denominated energy prices was smaller
than expected due to the simultaneous depreciation of the euro and the importance of energy re-exporting, both as raw material and
as input in other exports. The cyclically-adjusted CA balance has also improved to an estimated 0.9 percent of GDP for 2015.
Assessment. The EBA model estimates a CA gap of -1.7 percent of GDP for 2015. The staff assessment is similar, estimating a CA gap in
the range of -2.5 to -0.5 percent of GDP. 3/ The projected CA evolution is consistent with a fiscal consolidation and a recovery in the
household saving rate, which are offset by a more gradual increase in both private and public investment.

Real exchange
rate

Background. Unit labor costs point to a gradual loss of competitiveness since 2005. Most of this loss has come from lower productivity
growth, with a smaller contribution from wage growth exceeding that of trading partners. Real wage moderation since 2013 had only
limited effect on the ULC-based REER, which continued to appreciate between 2013 and 2014 [The CPI-based REER depreciated by less
than 1 percent between 2013 and 2014. However, the substantial nominal effective depreciation, which accelerated in early 2015, has
lowered the 2015 REER by approximately 5 percent compared to its 2014 average.
Assessment. Estimates of the EBA model for 2015 point to a REER overvaluation of 4 (index model) to 6 percent (level model). The staff
assessment, consistent with the CA assessment, is a 2015 REER gap in the range of 0 to 10 percent. 4/
Background. Gross financial outflows and inflows were on an upward trend during the pre-crisis period along the expansion of banks’
cross-border operations. Since 2007 along the bank deleveraging they have shrunk and have been more volatile. Short-term debt
accounts for about 47 percent of the external liabilities and financing need 1/. The capital account is open.

FX intervention
and reserves
level
Technical
Background
Notes

Background. The euro has the status of a global reserve currency.

Assessment. Belgium remains exposed to financial market risks but the structure of financial flows does not point to specific
vulnerabilities. The strong NIIP reduces the vulnerabilities associated with the high public debt.
Assessment. Reserves held by the euro area are typically low relative to standard metrics, but the currency is free floating.
1/ All numbers refer to averages over the first three quarters of 2015.
2/ The Belgian CA numbers have undergone major upward revisions in the fall of 2014 as well as in spring and fall of 2015,
complicating the comparison with the previous ESR assessment.

Overall Assessment:
The external position in
2015 was moderately weaker
than medium-term
fundamentals and desirable
policy settings would imply.
The positive trend compared to
previous years as well as recent
measures to improve
competitiveness point towards
a further strengthening of the
external position in 2016;
conditional on the euro
depreciation and policies not
being reversed
The strong net international
investment position mitigates
vulnerabilities associated with
the high external public debt.
Potential policy responses:
Planned steady fiscal
consolidation, reductions in
labor taxes and continued
wage moderation will help
towards making the external
position fully consistent with
fundamentals and policy
settings. To protect against a
reversal of the projected
improvements, productivity
enhancing structural reforms
(in the labor and product
markets) would be useful.

3/ Belgium’s status as a center of corporate treasury activities and its resulting large gross foreign asset and liability positions
complicate the measurement of the current account, and thus are a source of uncertainty about the CA assessment.
4/ The REER gap assessment is consistent with the staff’s CA gap assessment, considering the relatively high ratios of exports and
imports to GDP, which tend to make the CA more responsive to the REER.

Appendix V. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt sustainability risks remain high. Under the baseline scenario, the public debt-to-GDP
ratio is projected to have peaked at 106.7 percent in 2014 and to decline to 101.1 percent by 2021 as
the fiscal deficit narrows gradually and economic recovery gains traction. Gross financing needs are
estimated at 17.9 percent of GDP in 2016 and are expected to decline to 13–15 percent in the
medium term. The projected decline in public debt is relatively sensitive to macroeconomic shocks,
particularly involving combined shocks.
Baseline and Realism of Projections
Under the baseline, economic recovery and modest fiscal consolidation result in a gradual decline in
the gross financing need and the public debt ratio over the medium term. Relative to the DSA from
2014, the projection for the debt ratio has increased through the whole projection period, mainly
due to slower projected fiscal consolidation and changes in the historical debt ratio (due to statistical
changes on the coverage of public debt).


Macroeconomic assumptions. Growth is estimated at 1.4 percent in 2016 and rising to
1½ percent in 2017 on the back of stronger demand. The output gap narrows over the medium
term and is projected to close by 2021. Inflation is projected to stay below 2 percent throughout
the period, reflecting the still negative output gap, lower oil prices, and the ongoing wage
moderation.



Fiscal outlook. In staff’s baseline projections, the general government deficit comes down from
3.1 percent of GDP in 2014 to 2.1 percent in 2018, before rising again in the medium-term due
mainly to unfinanced revenue losses from tax shift. Similarly, the primary surplus is projected
improve until 2017 and thereafter remain close to balance. The projected fiscal path results in a
structural deficit of 2.3 percent in 2021. This reflects staff’s assessment of the authorities’ plans
over the medium-term, in which some measures remain to be identified.



Debt levels and gross financing needs. Belgium’s high level of government debt and gross
financing requirement calls for using the higher scrutiny framework.7 Government gross debt has
increased significantly since 2007, reflecting sizable fiscal stimulus, declining real and nominal
growth, and a large recapitalization of (and financial support to) the banking sector. Public debt
is estimated to have reached 106.2 percent of GDP in 2015 (helped by early repayment of bank
recapitalization funds) and is projected to stay above 100 percent through the medium term.
Gross financing needs are estimated at 17.9 percent of GDP in 2016 and are expected to remain
around 13–15 percent of GDP in the medium term.

7

For advanced economies that (i) have a current or projected debt-to-GDP ratio above 60 percent; or (ii) have current
or projected gross financing needs-to-GDP ratio above 20 percent; or (iii) have or are seeking exceptional access to
Fund resources; teams are required to use an extended set of tools to identify and assess specific risks to debt
sustainability. For these “higher scrutiny” cases, teams are also required to produce a standardized summary of risks in
a heat map and prepare a write-up to discuss risks, including any country-specific considerations.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELGIUM



Realism of baseline assumptions. The median forecast error for real GDP growth
during 2006–14 is -0.58 percent, while that for inflation (GDP deflator) is 0.2 percent, both of
which are relatively small. The median forecast error for primary balance suggests that staff
projections have been optimistic (a forecast bias of -0.31 percent of GDP), but the forecast biases
are in line with other surveillance countries.



Cross-country experience suggests the projected fiscal adjustment is feasible. The
adjustment in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance (CAPB) over the projection period is
moderate and Belgium was able to deliver impressive fiscal consolidation in the past. However,
staff does not rule out implementation risks, as discussed in the text.



Heat map. Risks from the debt level are deemed high given that the relevant threshold to which
Belgium’s values are compared is 85 percent and this threshold is breached under baseline and
all stress test scenarios. Belgium’s gross financing needs are just below the benchmark of
20 percent of GDP in 2015 and decline over the medium-term. Belgium also faces risks relating
to its external financing requirement and a large share of public debt held by foreigners. At
99 percent of GDP, the external financing requirement is significantly above the upper threshold
of early warning benchmarks and the share of debt held by foreigners is relatively high at
55 percent of total.

Shocks and Stress Tests
The DSA framework shows Belgium’s sensitivity to GDP growth and real interest rate shocks, and a
combined macroeconomic-fiscal shock. They illustrate how difficult reducing public debt could be as
the effect of these shocks, based on Belgium’s own historical record, play out. In some cases debt
ends the projection period on a rising trajectory.


Growth shock. Under this scenario, real output growth rates are lower by one standard
deviation starting in 2017–18, i.e. 1.6 percentage points relative to the baseline scenario. The
assumed decline in growth leads to lower inflation (0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage
point decrease in GDP growth). Under this scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio increases to
111 percent of GDP in 2018 and declines thereafter.



High interest rate scenario. This scenario examines the implications for debt sustainability of an
increase in spreads by 470 basis points (a historical high observed in 1995) starting in 2018. The
deterioration of public debt and gross financing needs are back-loaded as old debt gradually
matures and new higher interest rate debt is contracted. In 2021, the impact on financing needs
is 2.9 percent of GDP. Debt dynamics are reversed as the debt ratio no longer follows a
downward trajectory.



Real exchange rate shock. This scenario assumes 10 percent depreciation in the real exchange
rate in 2017. This shock results in small effects relative to the baseline.



Primary balance shock. This scenario examines the implications of a revenue shock and a rise in
interest rates leading to a cumulative 2 percentage points of GDP deterioration in the primary

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

BELGIUM

balance (one standard deviation shock) in 2017–18. This scenario illustrates risks of delayed fiscal
adjustment, due to insufficient adjustment measures. This shock leads to a deterioration in the
debt ratio of 2½ percentage points relative to the baseline in 2021 and slightly higher gross
financing needs.


Combined macro-fiscal scenario. This scenario aggregates shocks to real growth, the interest
rate, the exchange rate, and the primary balance while taking care not to double-count the
effects of individual shocks. Under this scenario, debt would reach 113 percent of GDP
in 2018 and continue rising through 2021. The impact on financing needs would be significant,
keeping financing needs high through 2018 and remaining above 15 percent of GDP through
2021.



Persistent fiscal deficits shock. This scenario a primary balance close to 1 percent of GDP
through 2021. This results in the debt ratio hovering at current rates over the medium-term.

The authorities agreed with the conclusion of the analysis, and noted that foreign holdership of
public debt can be a source of risk as well as a sign of confidence by investors in Belgium’s public
finances. They also observed that the methodology did not take into account projections for the cost
of aging.

1

Public sector is defined as General government. Medium-term projections for debt differ somewhat from the baseline due to differing methologies.

2

Based on available data.

3

Long-term bond spread over German bonds.

4

Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.

5

Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;

6

The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.

7

The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).

8

Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.

9

Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).

Exchange Rate Assessments:


Belgium’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other currencies.



Belgium has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Section 2(a) and 3, and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on payment and transfers for current international
transactions except for restrictions maintained solely for security reasons, which have been
notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).

Last Article IV Consultation:
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on March 2, 2015. The associated Executive Board
assessment is available at http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2015/pr15111.htm and the staff
report (IMF Country Report No. 15/70) at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2015/cr1570.pdf.
Belgium is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.



Belgium: Financial System Stability Assessment, including Reports
on the Observance of Standards and Codes on the following topics:
Banking Supervision and Regulation, and Insurance Supervision
and Regulation

IMF Country Report
No. 13/124

Summary: During the 2013 FSAP Update, staff assessed progress with the implementation of the
2006 FSAP recommendations. The report outlines that the authorities have made progress in
addressing the recommendations of the 2006 FSAP but many recommendations in the area of
conglomerate supervision and governance remain relevant. The new institutional model is a work in
progress and better communication and coordination between supervisory institutions is needed.
Improvements are evident in the intensity of banking supervision and the adoption of analytical
tools to support system-wide monitoring, including the introduction of an intensive process for
determining Pillar II capital requirements, liquidity stress testing for the banking sector, and
introduction of macrofinancial risk dashboard to monitor systemic and emerging risk. Funding and
risk management standards are being improved. Supervisory tools for monitoring group-wide risks
need to be upgraded. The crisis management framework, while updated for handling systemic firms,
is in need of a further upgrade owing in part to EU-wide developments.
Insurance supervision has been significantly strengthened although further work is needed,
particularly, in strengthening the solvency framework. Both bank and insurance supervisory
frameworks integrate vertical analyses of individual insurers with horizontal review of the sector. The
adoption of the new institutional architecture has allowed the FSMA to focus solely on market and
business conduct and the adoption of EU directives in the interim has addressed many of the
recommendations for the securities sector. The FSMA’s plan to adopt a risk-based approach to
conduct supervision must be adequately resourced. Pension regulation and supervision has been
strengthened. While pension funds remain the remit of the FSMA, there is currently a debate as to
whether this should be the responsibility of the NBB.

Belgium: Report on Observance of Standards and Codes—Fiscal
Transparency Module

IMF Country Report
No. 08/116

Summary: In many areas Belgium meets, and in some cases exceeds, the requirements of the fiscal
transparency code. The basic government finance processes are supported by a sound institutional
and legal framework. Roles and responsibilities in the budget process are clear, with a well-defined
separation of powers between the executive and legislature. Fiscal information is provided through
regular publications and extensive use of the internet. Budget formulation is appropriately
supported by medium-term macroeconomic forecasts and clearly formulated medium-term fiscal
policy goals, and fiscal policy is presented clearly, and in a medium-term context. Finally, audit
processes are extensive and help improve budget management decisions, practices and standards,
with government financial decisions evaluated ex ante and ex post by various institutions.
There is room to improve the quality and openness of budget processes: (i) there is limited insight
about the objectives and targets of government expenditure; (ii) the medium-term budget estimates
need to make budgetary decision-making more oriented to the medium-term; (iii) the presentation
of new policy measures and their medium-term costs could be clarified; (iv) and budget
implementation by departments and agencies could be streamlined. Information available to the
public on the following topics could be increased: (i) fiscal risk and tax expenditures in budget
documents; (ii) in-year budgetary data on local government and agencies; (iii) the content of the
final government accounts; and (iv) the governance of state-owned equity holdings.
Institutional arrangements for fiscal policy coordination could be strengthened by (i) reinforcing and
expanding the role of the High Council of Finance, including by providing additional institutional
safeguards as to its continuity and independence, and having the Council cover all important issues
bearing on fiscal policy; and (ii) converting the budget agreements between the federal government,
regions, and communities into published agreements which specify the targeted balance for each
partner and identify the measures needed to achieve this target.
Finally, internal audit processes could be better coordinated and simplified by reducing the number
of internal control and audit layers. This makes the Court of Audit’s recent Single Audit initiative to
minimize overlap, coordinate work programs, and to share common data and analysis, timely.
Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT):
Belgium’s AML/CFT framework was last assessed in July 2014. The assessment was conducted by the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) against the 2012 FATF standard using the 2013 assessment
methodology, both of which place greater emphasis on the effectiveness of AML/CFT measures in
mitigating the money laundering and terrorist financing risks. The evaluation report was adopted
during the FATF February 2015 plenary meeting and found that the core elements of a sound
AML/CFT regime were present, although some elements remained to be brought in line with the
2012 FATF standard.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Belgium’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes. The
National Bank of Belgium (NBB) regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial data and
provides calendar dates of main statistical releases. On-line access to these comprehensive
databases is facilitated by the NBB’s data search engine, Belgostat. Belgium is a SDDS subscriber.
Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions and monetary aggregates are
prepared on a monthly basis and are timely.
Belgium adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010)
in 2014. Revisions of national accounts were released in September, 2014, to comply with
EUROSTAT requirements to provide national accounts statistics in ESA 2010. Unlike in other
countries, the central bank is responsible for compiling national accounts statistics. Quarterly
accounts are published within a lag of three months. Both annual and quarterly accounts data are of
good quality, with shortcomings mainly related to export and import deflators, which are based on
unit values, rather than prices collected directly from exporters and importers.
Belgium compiles and publishes a complete set of general government accounts on an accrual
basis (ESA 2010). The NBB publishes annual and quarterly data on general government revenue,
expenditure, and net lending/ borrowing; transactions in financial assets and liabilities and a
financial balance sheet data; and details on the consolidated gross debt.
The overall quality and availability of financial indicators are good. The authorities are
providing quarterly updates of financial sector indicators (FSIs) in a timely manner.
