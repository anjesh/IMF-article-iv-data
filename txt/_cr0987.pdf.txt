I. STAFF APPRAISAL AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY1
1.
Belgium currently faces an extraordinary set of economic challenges. The global
financial crisis has hit the country particularly hard in recent months, forcing government
intervention in major financial institutions. The crisis has also sparked a deep recession in
Belgium, in line with the rest of Europe. The boom in energy and commodity prices in early
2008 caused inflation to spike to well above the euro area average, creating risks of secondround inflationary effects and damaging competitiveness. In addition to continued fragility in
the financial sector, the crisis has also highlighted fault lines and structural weaknesses that
aggravated the impact of the exogenous shocks and which need to be tackled for the Belgian
economy to recover resilience, return to growth, and prepare for long-term challenges. In
particular, the long-run fiscal health of the country remains at risk due to high indebtedness
and the future costs of an aging population; the existing fiscal federalism arrangements are
creating unsustainable imbalances; and structural rigidities persist, dampening growth,
impeding job creation, and eroding Belgium’s competitive position in the world. Political
uncertainty is currently high (Box 1), complicating prospects for decisive action to address
the economic difficulties.
Box 1. Complex Political Environment
After parliamentary elections in June 2007, negotiations on a new federal government were
prolonged, necessitating a caretaker administration until Yves Leterme was finally able to form
a government in March 2008. The coalition proved to be fragile—the New Flemish Alliance
Party withdrew in September after months of uncertainty over failure to reach agreement on
measures to further devolve power to the regions, leaving Leterme with a reduced parliamentary
majority. In December, allegations that the government tried to influence a court decision on the
break-up of Fortis Group led to the resignation of Leterme and his government. Former Budget
Minister Hermann Van Rompuy was named as the new Prime Minister, but will head the same
delicate fractious coalition as his predecessor. Prospects for a more stable political environment
are further limited by the approach of regional elections (scheduled for June 2009).
Despite the political environment, the authorities responded quickly and decisively to the
financial sector crisis. However, the 2008 federal budget was delayed by the lack of a
government and was less ambitious than originally envisaged. The 2009 budget was late and
based on outdated macroeconomic assumptions, and legislative action on a fiscal stimulus
package is incomplete. The new government will be facing serious challenges, including
completing work on the budget and stimulus package, dealing with the legacy of the legal case
regarding Fortis, supporting the social partners’ wage agreement for 2009-10, as well as dealing
with pending institutional issues. Clearly, adopting structural measures looking beyond the crisis
will be difficult in this environment.

A team comprising Mr. Franks (head), Mr. De Broeck, Mr. Jarmuzek and Ms. Yontcheva (all EUR) visited
Brussels during December 3-16, 2008. Belgium is an Article VIII country and data provision is adequate for
surveillance (see Informational Annex).

4
2.
Belgium will suffer a significant recession in 2009, and economic activity will
likely remain weak into 2010. Economic stimulus packages in many countries and looser
monetary policy will help cushion the global downturn, but growth is still expected to fall to
around -2 percent in 2009, and it will remain below potential in 2010, as the recovery in the
world economy will be slowed by the aftermath of the financial crisis. Risks to the forecast
are large and tilted to the downside, reflecting the uncertainties surrounding the international
environment. The spike in inflation experienced in early 2008 has begun to reverse, but some
second round effects are being observed, slowing the drop in inflation and harming
competitiveness.
3.
As the financial crisis exploded in Belgium, the authorities responded decisively.
Action was quick, comprehensive, and coordinated in Fortis, Dexia and KBC banks and in
insurance company Ethias in September-October. However, the authorities have now to deal
with legal complications in case of the Fortis operation, and risks in the financial system
remain elevated. A broader intervention framework should now be established to guide future
actions, including a legal framework that provides pre-established rules for future
interventions and allows significant further financial resources to be mobilized if needed (as
has been done in other countries). Specific contingency plans should be prepared for further
action (if needed) in each of the major banks, in smaller banks, and in the insurance industry.
Further intervention should involve EU-wide coordination. The rapid expansion of some
Belgian banks in emerging market economies has been beneficial for both Belgium and host
countries, but also has translated into increased risks. In the current context of deleveraging, a
strong focus on risk management by the banks and effective cross-border cooperation
between supervisors are paramount. In addition, the Belgian authorities should continue to
press for an expansion of pan-European banking supervision mechanisms while
simultaneously strengthening existing venues of cooperation. At home, immediate steps
should be taken to further strengthen information sharing and coordination between the
Banking, Finance and Insurance Commission (BFIC) and the Belgian National Bank (NBB),
and consideration should eventually be given to unifying macrofinancial risk analysis with
banking and insurance supervision under a single structure.
4.
The fundamental challenge for the public finances is to use fiscal policy to
address short-term need for stimulus without derailing medium- and long-term fiscal
consolidation objectives. Fiscal policy in 2009 should allow for full operation of the
automatic stabilizers, plus a moderate discretionary stimulus (around 1 percent of GDP). The
stimulus should be more timely and targeted than proposals advanced in late 2008 by the
Leterme government, and measures should be tied to structural fiscal improvements aimed at
ensuring longer-term sustainability. If the economic situation were to deteriorate significantly
further, a larger stimulus might have to be considered, but only in coordination with the EU.
5.
Once the current crisis is past, the fiscal stance will have to be significantly
tightened to achieve long-run sustainability. The financial crisis has boosted the gross

5
debt-to-GDP ratio by some 6 percentage points, and the deficits in 2008 and 2009 will further
increase public indebtedness, complicating long-term fiscal sustainability. As an anchor to
fiscal policy, the government—in collaboration with regions and communities—should
firmly commit now to a structural adjustment of at least 0.7 percent of GDP per year once the
crisis has past, to return as soon as possible to fiscal balance, and eventually to a surplus to
ensure fiscal sustainability.
6.
The consolidation strategy should be supported by fiscal institutional reforms.
These could include: multiyear budgeting with binding spending ceilings, strengthening the
role of the High Finance Council, and undertaking comprehensive expenditure and revenue
reviews. Moreover, it will be crucial to tackle the imbalances inherent in the current fiscal
federalism arrangements, by shifting more of the burden of fiscal consolidation and
preparation for population aging from federal/social security to community/regional entities,
and by addressing the horizontal imbalances between communities/regions.
7.
Structural weaknesses need to be addressed. An emerging competitiveness gap is
evidenced by declining Belgian shares in European markets, an appreciating real effective
exchange rate, and a deteriorating external current account balance. The spike in inflation
uncovered fault lines in the oil price-setting mechanisms and sparked concerns over
competition in retail. Actions should be taken to raise productivity and market efficiency to
boost competitiveness and improve the living standards and purchasing power of workers and
their families.
•

In the labor market, consideration should be given to modifying indexation
mechanisms within the current centralized bargaining framework so as to achieve
greater real wage flexibility, together with reforms to improve activation policies and
increase training opportunities focused on improving labor productivity.

•

In product and services markets, easing of restrictions on new retail establishments
and deregulating opening hours and sales periods would promote a competitive
environment leading to lower prices to consumers.

•

More transparency in energy supply should be used to guard against abuse of market
power and tighter regulation in energy distribution should help guarantee a fair
evolution of distribution prices.

•

The Competition Council should be reinforced to make it both a vocal public
advocate for competition and a watchdog against rent-seeking behavior.

II. CURRENT CRISIS AND OUTLOOK
A. Macroeconomic Outlook
8.
The current downturn is bringing
to an end several years of strong economic
growth. GDP growth averaged over
2.6 percent from 2004–07 in an expansion
that helped create jobs, reduce
unemployment, and maintain fiscal balance
(Table 1). The upswing was sustained by
robust domestic investment and strong
economic activity in partner countries.
Growth weakened significantly in the third
quarter of 2008, and leading indicators
suggest it turned sharply negative in the
fourth quarter. Business and consumer
confidence indicators are slumping,
industrial production has begun to fall, and
credit conditions have tightened.

Belgium will experience a deep
recession in 2009. Staff anticipate growth
of -2 percent in 2009. All components of
domestic demand will be affected.
Consumption will drop as confidence
effects and rising unemployment cause
consumers to retrench despite the sustaining
effects of wage indexation on household
incomes. Business investment will shrink as
the reduction in demand lowers profit
margins and reduces the capacity for self
financing, in an environment with higher
credit costs and more difficult external
financing. Financing restrictions will also
produce a sharp drop in residential
investment. Government consumption and
investment growth will remain positive,
reflecting the automatic stabilizers and a
modest fiscal stimulus.

10.
The global slowdown will also produce a decline
in external demand. Belgium’s open economy is highly
exposed to the downturn expected in partner countries.2
Slumping exports will accentuate the negative foreign
contribution to growth, compounding an already existing
trend of weak export performance. Belgian exporters have
been losing market share since 1995, as they export mainly
to slower growing economies, do not specialize enough in
differentiated high-value added products, and suffer from
eroding competitiveness in unit labor cost terms.

Risks to the forecast are large and tilted to the downside. Negative risks include:
an additional decline in domestic demand if households increase their precautionary savings
or due to credit constraints from another round of financial turmoil; a further worsening of
the external sector as partner country demand slips by more than currently expected or if
negative competitiveness effects are greater. On the positive side, EU-wide stimulus
packages and aggressive actions to defuse further rounds of financial crisis may mitigate the
downturn. Depreciation of the euro and falling ECB interest rate may also help sustain output
by more than anticipated.

union leaders acknowledged the risks to
competitiveness but argued that recent price increases had raised social tensions. Hence,
social partners proposed a reduction of the labor tax wedge as a solution to labor
negotiations. The mission cautioned against broader wage increases and recommended that
modifications could be made to indexation parameters (see paragraph 32).
14.
The inflation differential between Belgium and the euro area raises concerns
about possible imperfections in goods and products markets as well as in some pricessetting mechanisms. Part of the inflation differential is explained by compositional and

9
measurement issues,3 but most of it is accounted for by differences in processed food prices,
services prices, and gas and electricity prices (see figure below). This suggests the presence
of downward price rigidities in the retail food industry, in services, as well as in the
transmission and distribution of gas and electricity. The mission advised to seek ways to
promote more competition in these areas.

C. Competitiveness and the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)
15.
Export performance in Belgium remained robust in the first half of 2008, but
competitiveness is deteriorating. Over the past year, imports grew more quickly, pushing
the trade balance into deficit. The regional decomposition of exports show continued growth
in intra-EU trade, while exports to the rest of the world have stagnated. For 2008 as a whole,

3

product that had sharper prices increases and (ii) changes in CPI measurements for electricity and gas in early
2007 caused for quicker pass-through of energy prices in CPI

10
preliminary estimates show a trade deficit for the first time in recent years, with a
corresponding current account deficit. This compares to an average current account surplus of
3½ percent of GDP in the period 2002–06. Over the medium term, staff’s baseline forecast is
for current account deficits on the order of 2 percent of GDP, not a level likely to generate
instability, but reflecting a deterioration of export competitiveness compared to recent years.
16.
Analysis of the Real Effective Exchange Rate shows a worsening. Estimates using

difference (and may be reversed
with the recent decline in the exchange rate). However, there has also been an appreciation
compared to key euro area partner countries, such as France, Germany, and the Netherlands
since 2007. Developments in unit labor cost (ULC)-based real effective exchange rates point
to a sharper decline in competitiveness, with a cumulative trade-weighted deterioration of
27 percent since 2000 (compared to a gain of 7 percent in Germany). Despite slow wage
growth, labor costs remain higher than the average of the three major trading partners.
Moreover, the wage indexation mechanism in Belgium is generating higher wage increases in
2008–9, exacerbating the gap in unit labor costs.

D. The Financial Crisis and Macrofinancial Linkages
17.
Belgium’s financial sector weathered the early rounds of financial turmoil in
2007, but succumbed in September–October 2008. The system’s strong capitalization and
moderate exposure to subprime risk appeared to confer relative resilience as the 2007

11
liquidity shock broke (see Box 2 for a presentation of the banking sector). However, when
some banks started to consolidate off-balance sheet exposure, they generated uneasiness
about their earnings. Already by January 2008, volatility in equity prices indicated market
concerns about asset valuations and their implications for banks’ earnings and capital.

Box 2. Belgium’s Banking Sector
The Belgian financial sector is large, internationally integrated and dominated by
conglomerates. It comprises four large firms offering banking and insurance activities, the
Euronext Brussels stock market, and a variety of other private entities. The banking sector is
highly concentrated and offers both banking and insurance services. Past mergers and
acquisitions have produced “bancassurance” groups which offer a wide range of financial
services, providing clients with one-stop financial centers. The four main banks hold 80 percent
of all banking assets, a not uncommon concentration in small countries, albeit much above the
European average (about 45 percent). Over the past decades, in the context of ongoing
integration of European financial markets, reforms have liberalized international flows,
privatized banks, and deregulated financial and insurance activities.

Worsening world liquidity conditions in the wake of the Lehman collapse,
together with specific concerns about Fortis and Dexia banks, triggered the crisis in
Belgium in September 2008. Already in early 2008, Dexia’s CDS spread spiked due to a
loss of confidence by investors in its U.S. monoline and the value of securitized mortgages in
the United States, compounded later by concerns about the effects of the collapse of AIG
(Table 2; Figure 2). In the case of Fortis—Belgium’s largest bank—concerns focused on the
costly and ill-timed acquisition of the Dutch operations of ABN-Amro in 2007. The purchase
depleted Fortis’s capital while the credit turmoil made it difficult to obtain needed liquidity.
In addition, Fortis’s contradictory statements about its involvement in the subprime market
deeply affected market sentiment and investors and depositors’ confidence dropped. As world
financial conditions turned increasingly desperate, the authorities were forced to intervene in
Fortis on September 28 and two days later in Dexia. The third large Belgian-owned bank,
KBC, had stronger capital and liquidity positions but faced increasing pressures in October as

12
the crisis spread to Emerging European markets where it has a large presence, necessitating a
government recapitalization.4
19.
The financial sector crisis will exacerbate the GDP downturn directly through
the reduction in the sector’s value added5 but most importantly indirectly through
macro-financial linkages. In the current environment, banks facing liquidity issues will not
be able to lend enough to consumers and firms to help them stabilize their spending and
maintain economic activity. Lending margins have increased for all borrowers regardless of
the risk profile6 and banks have tightened lending criteria (Figures 2 and 3). This suggests the
ability of banks to act as efficient intermediaries has been compromised as they fail to
mobilize savings and allocate them effectively and therefore spread risks across the economy.
In addition, financing through commercial papers and stock issuance has also become much
more expensive in the last few months.7 Tightening credit conditions for both households and
firms will contribute to the fall in investment and consumption this year. According to NBB
estimates, a shock of 100 b.p. on the credit spread leads to a slowdown in business
investment of 0.4 percent per annum while also reducing household investment in housing by
0.1 percent.
20.
Finally, the stock market adjustment will trigger wealth effects. The Belgian
stock exchange has lost nearly 45 percent of its value over the past year, depressing
household assets by 15 percent. Wealth effects of such an adjustment are expected to reduce
consumption growth by 0.5 percent per annum during 2 to 3 years. This is reflected in staff’s
forecast of an increased savings ratio from 12 percent in 2007 to 14½ percent by 2009,
depressing private consumption and domestic demand.

4

KBC has subsidiaries and investments in the Czech Republic (ČSOB), Slovakia (ČSOB), Hungary (K&H
Bank), Poland (Kredyt Bank) and Slovenia (Nova Ljubljanska Banka). With effect from July 2008, KBC Bank
acquired another small Slovakian Bank, Istrobanka. In practically all of these countries, KBC Bank is a
top-three player by market share.

5

The growth of financial intermediation value-added in real terms averaged 4 percent p.a. in past ten years—
performance to be compared with an average GDP growth of 2.3 percent.

6

For enterprises, margins have increased up to 63 basis points (b.p.). For mortgages, margins have increased up
to 100 b.p. from June to October 2008.

7

The cost of financing through stock issuance has increased by 25 percent between June and September 2008.
The rate on BBB quoted bonds with a 5-to-7 year maturity increased by 150 b.p. from June to September.

13
III. RESPONDING TO THE CRISIS
A. Rescuing the Banking Sector
The authorities responded decisively once the financial crisis broke, intervening in the three
largest banks and an insurance company. However, risks remain elevated, further bank
losses and additional intervention cannot be ruled out. While the initial intervention was
done on an ad-hoc basis, staff recommended moving to a more systematic approach.
21.
Once the crisis broke, the Belgian authorities intervened decisively together with
partner countries. During September-October 2008, the government was forced to step in to
all three of the main Belgian-owned bancassurance groups, along with a medium-sized
insurance company (Ethias) (Box 3). In the case of Fortis, initially there was a joint
intervention with the Netherlands and Luxembourg, with a partial nationalization and capital
injections and a management change. The Netherlands subsequently fully nationalized the
Dutch assets of Fortis (including the ABN-Amro assets), and Belgium nationalized the
remainder of Fortis, agreeing to sell Fortis’s Belgian banking operations to BNP-Paribas
while segregating toxic assets in an SIV and continuing to hold international insurance
operations and some overseas operations. Dexia, a bank originally publicly owned and
specialized in financing local and regional governments, had more stable deposit and investor
bases, and the Belgian, French and Luxembourg governments jointly injected capital into the
bank while providing funding guarantees to keep it afloat. The Belgian authorities also
strengthened KBC’s capital but without changing the current management. Intervention in the
Ethias insurance group was necessitated by a severe weakening in the firm’s assets due to the
crisis and a poor investment strategy.

Risks to the Belgian financial system remain elevated. The government’s timely
action—along with those of the ECB8 and other governments—has brought some respite, but
the situation is fragile. While there is some improvement in the liquidity situation, mistrust
between market participants remains high. The market for unsecured financing reopened but
repurchasing transactions are available only on overnight basis, with larger haircuts and with
prime collateral. The court decision to suspend the sale of Fortis Bank Belgium to BNPParibas has heightened uncertainties and may ultimately require additional government
financing unless a resolution can be reached quickly. A sharp drop in KBC’s share price
following a downgrade of some structured products in its portfolio prompted an additional
capital injection by the Flemish government in January 2009. Additional intervention in
Dexia cannot be ruled out, as liquidity remains tight. Finally, in staff’s view, there are risks

that additional problems in other advanced economies or from emerging markets could spill
over into Belgian banks or into insurance and investment companies.

Box 3. Belgium’s Financial Crisis: Summary of Government Interventions
The authorities have provided direct support to Belgium’s financial sector in two ways:
(i) Direct financial support to three major financial institutions—Fortis, Dexia and KBC—and
to insurance company Ethias
•

Fortis. The federal government invested €9.4 billion to acquire virtually all the equity
in Fortis Bank, and [sold] a 75 percent stake to BNP Paribas in exchange for BNP
Paribas shares.

•

Dexia. The federal government and Belgium’s three regions together invested €2 billion
in Dexia, in exchange for 11.5 percent of Dexia’s equity. In addition, the Belgian and
French government guarantee up to €12 billion of toxic assets held in portfolio by
Dexia.

•

KBC. The federal government acquired €3.5 billion non-voting and non-transferable
securities that qualify as core capital. The Flemish government has announced an
additional €2.0 billion capital injection using similar securities.

•

Ethias. The federal government, and the Flemish and Walloon regions each are
contributing €0.5 billion to a capital injection in Ethias, a mutual insurance company.

(ii) Financial sector guarantees, including an increase in the deposit guarantee ceiling per
depositor from €20,000 to €100,000; an extension on demand of the institution of the
guarantee’s coverage to insurance instruments akin to deposits; and the introduction of a
temporary guarantee for interbank loans and short-term debt instruments issued by financial
institutions. For the time being, only Dexia has asked and received a funding guarantee, which
was granted jointly by the Belgian, French, and Luxembourgian governments and can engage
the Belgian government up to an amount of €90 billion.
No additional interventions have been announced, but further capital injections or the granting
of additional guarantees cannot be excluded.1

______________________
1

In Dexia’s case, a call of the guarantee on toxic assets will be equivalent to a capital injection as the
Belgian and French governments will be entitled to receive Dexia shares in compensation.

23.
To handle any further difficulties, the mission recommended that the authorities
move from an ad hoc approach to a more systematic intervention strategy. This would
involve putting in place pre-established rules for future interventions, allowing significant
further financial resources to be mobilized if needed, and including a strategy for dealing
with toxic assets, as has been done in other countries. Such a mechanism would help reassure
markets that the financial system will remain secure while standardizing the criteria for

15
intervention. Notably, legislation to transparently specify the overall room for and conditions
of additional capital injections and funding guarantees could set clear parameters for future
interventions, while boosting confidence in the government’s backing of the system. The
Government, BFIC, and NBB should also develop tailored contingency plans for further
action (if needed) in each of the major banks, in smaller banks, and in the insurance industry,
detailing the steps to be taken in the event of another round of crisis. While many officials
agreed with the staff’s recommendation to put in place a framework for intervention, others
felt that the existing ad hoc arrangements are adequate to deal with any future difficulties.
B. Fiscal Policy
Fiscal policy in Belgium must balance two competing demands. On the one hand, there is a
need for government support for the financial sector and for fiscal stimulus to cushion the
economic downturn. On the other hand, a high government spending-to-GDP ratio,
continued high indebtedness, and an aging population require adjustments to make the
public finances sustainable in the longer-term. Fiscal policy has responded to the short-term
challenges, but a medium-term consolidation strategy that can address aging-related and
sustainability issues has not yet been announced.
24.
The 2008 general government budget outturn fell short of target. After the
budget had slipped into deficit in 2007, the new federal government that took office in the
spring of 2008 intended to return to budget balance and a medium-term fiscal consolidation
strategy aimed at gradually building surpluses (Table 3). However, the 2008 federal budget
was only approved in May, limiting the impact of adjustment measures, and
communities/regions rejected the federal government’s request to make an additional
contribution to the adjustment effort. A revenue shortfall induced by the weakening economic
growth in the second half of the year pushed the balanced budget objective even further out
of reach. As a result, the general government deficit is estimated to have widened from
¼ percent of GDP in 2007 to about 1 percent of GDP in 2008. Public debt was boosted by
nearly 4 percentage points of GDP by the cost of the support to the financial sector (Box 4).

16
Box 4. Belgium: Fiscal Costs of the Response to the Financial Crisis
With the exception of the €500 million capital injections by the Flemish region in both Dexia
and Ethias, which are financed by drawing down assets, direct financial support from the federal
government and regions is funded through borrowing. This will translate into an increase in
general government debt of €19.4 billion (somewhat more than 5 percent of 2009 GDP). With
capital injections considered to be financing transactions, they would have no impact on the
general government balance other than the increase in interest payments (negative) and possible
dividends and coupon payments (positive):
•

At current interest rates for 10-year government bonds, the corresponding interest
payments would be around €850 million annually (around ¼ percent of 2009 GDP).

•

Possible dividends from the federal government and the regions’ participation in Dexia,
Ethias and Fortis Bank will be part of general government revenue. The KBC securities
entitle the federal government annually to the higher of either €2.51 per security
(yielding 8.5 percent) or 110 percent of the dividend paid in 2009 and 115 percent of
the dividend in the following years. However, the federal government will not receive
any payment in years when KBC is not expected to distribute a dividend (notably,
2008).

Staff and the authorities agreed that Belgium’s ability to respond to the
downturn with large fiscal stimuli is limited by its high indebtedness and population
aging. The public cost of the financial sector bailout has already boosted the debt-to-GDP
ratio to nearly 88 percent of GDP.

The additional guarantees granted by the federal government create contingent liabilities but do
not yet raise the debt or deficit. Financial institutions will have to pay a fee to benefit from the
guarantees, with the draft 2009 budget estimating the additional revenue from fees at
€100 million for the higher deposit guarantee and €500 million for the new bank funding
guarantee.

17
stimulus (around 1 percent of GDP) as appropriate, notwithstanding the severity of the
downturn. The authorities largely shared staff’s concerns, with political pressures remaining
strong to keep the deficit in check. They pointed out that a debt policy based on transparent
communication and aimed at prudently managing rollover and repricing risks would limit the
repercussions of higher indebtedness on the availability and cost of financing.
26.
The budget for 2009, together with a stimulus package announced in December,
would provide a fiscal impulse of around 1 percent of GDP. The federal draft budget
submitted in November still envisaged a balanced general government budget, but only due
to the overly optimistic macroeconomic assumptions.9 The federal government in early
December abandoned the balanced budget target: it revised the real GDP growth forecast for
2009 down to -0.2 percent and in tandem announced a new fiscal stimulus package. Approval
of the budget was delayed until January by the collapse of the Leterme government, and
measures from the new package have yet to be approved by parliament under new Prime
Minister Van Rompuy.
27.
The proposed stimulus package (Plan de Relance) focuses on reducing social
contributions and boosting investment spending. At the federal level, the proposed
measures include new and accelerated public investment, across-the-board reductions in
social security contributions, a VAT reduction for selected construction activities, an increase
in benefits for temporary unemployment, a limited subsidy for household electricity
consumption, and steps to improve the liquidity position of the enterprise sector. The federal
government also invited the regions to each formulate its own set of measures. The regional
emphasis is on public investment in infrastructure and energy conservation, employment
subsidies, and guarantee schemes to facilitate enterprise access to bank loans.
28.
In staff’s view, the composition of the proposed fiscal stimulus package could be
improved. In particular, the mission recommended less ambitious public investment targets:
there are limits to how much new projects can be initiated and existing ones can be brought
forward in order to bring the stimulus to bear at the moment when it is most needed to
cushion the downturn, the first half of 2009. The authorities disagreed on the grounds that
relevant projects and timetables already have been identified. Staff argued to include sunset
clauses or long-term countervailing savings for some expensive reductions in social
contributions and increases in unemployment and other social benefits, a reversal of which
was not envisaged in the Plan de Relance. Government officials conceded that these
measures would be permanent, but considered this appropriate in view of their longer-lasting
benefits. Staff also saw room to sharpen the focus of the proposed cuts in social security

9

GDP Growth of 1.2 percent was envisaged, with only a marginal increase in unemployment.

18
contributions and hikes in social benefits on increasing incomes of those most likely to spend
it (e.g. the low-income and unemployed).
29.
Staff projects a headline general government deficit between 2½-3 percent of
GDP in 2009. Letting automatic stabilizers operate freely would, using staff’s growth
projections, translate in a year-on-year widening of the headline general government deficit
by slightly more than 2 percent of GDP. Staff also projects the Plan de Relance, together with
some measures, including one-offs, previously announced in the draft 2009 budget, to boost
the structural deficit by around ¾ percent of GDP (Table 3). Staff accepted that additional
stimulus might have to be considered given the deteriorating economic situation, but
cautioned that this would be appropriate only in coordination with the EU. With slow growth
extending into 2010, the deficit would remain around 3½ percent of GDP over the period
2010-2012 under current policies.
IV. BEYOND THE CRISIS—RESTORING GROWTH, ENHANCING RESILIENCE, AND
RETURNING FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
The serious economic and financial crises have forced postponement of needed fiscal
consolidation, and have also uncovered some fault lines in the structure of the economy. Staff
recommended that the authorities not lose sight of these longer-term challenges, using the
downturn to crystallize awareness and boost willingness to reform.
A. Lowering Inflationary Pressures and Improving Competitiveness
30.
The sharp economic slowdown just after an inflation peak revealed weaknesses
in price- and wage-setting mechanisms that inhibit rapid adjustment. Two separate
dimensions need to be taken into account: on the one hand, the pass-through of oil and
commodity shocks to domestic food and fuel prices ought to be strictly in line with best
competition practices, and on the other hand, wage moderation to restrain second-round
effects is needed.
31.
Staff recommended improved competition policies to enhance efficiency in good
and products markets:
•

The mission recommended further reinforcing the Competition Council as a vocal
public advocate for competition and a watchdog against rent-seeking behavior. The
Council should accordingly be empowered and sufficiently staffed to analyze areas
where policy changes could boost competition. In addition, cooperation between the
Competition Council and sectoral regulators should be reinforced.

•

In the retail sector, easing of restrictions on new retail establishments, opening hours,
and sales periods would allow for lower consumer prices. Deregulating prices and

19
liberalizing the market for over-the counter drugs would benefit the consumers while
easing the administrative burden on the Ministry of Economic Affairs.10
•

In energy supply and distribution, the mission welcomed the recently enhanced
investigation power of the sectoral regulator (CREG) but also recommended
additional actions to obtain more transparency for the end user.

Reforms along these lines could lower the consumer price level by as much as 1-2 percentage
points over time, boosting purchasing power by hundreds of euros per household while
narrowing the external competitiveness gap.
32.
Wage indexation has sustained domestic demand, but has also produced real
wage rigidity, which is perpetuating inflationary pressures and hurting competitiveness.
The centralized wage bargaining arrangements have served Belgium well by internalizing
macroeconomic considerations in wage setting, but combining these with economy-wide
indexation is perpetuating difficulties from the inflation spike. Staff recommended that the
government and the social partners give consideration to reforming the wage indexation
parameters to permit full coverage for the poorest, most vulnerable workers, while allowing
for less-than-complete indexation for the economy as a whole. Social partners were aware of
the risks of real wage rigidity, but resisted breaking with full indexation, seeing the
competitiveness and inflation problems as temporary ones that would soon reverse.
B. Lessons from the Financial Crisis
33.
While the ad hoc interventions in September and October were well-handled,
significant risks remain and a broader intervention framework should now be
established to guide future actions. Steps that should be taken include:
•

Strengthen information sharing and coordination between the BFIC and the
NBB. This could include creating joint databases for offsite inspections of banks, and
joint onsite inspection teams between banking supervisors from the BFIC and
macrofinancial risk experts from the NBB. The BFIC and the NBB would have to be
fully committed to intense cooperation if the new structure is to be effective and
efficient. Eventually, consideration could be given to unifying macrofinancial risk
analysis with banking and insurance supervision under a single structure,11 while
leaving supervision of financial markets in a separate institution. The authorities’

10

Price deregulation has, however, to go hand-in-hand with market liberalization for the consumer to reap the
benefit in terms of price reduction.
11

Supervision under a single structure could foster a culture of mutual trust, open communication, and common
objectives.

20
reactions to these proposals were mixed, with the BFIC arguing that current
arrangements were working well.
•

Further improve on-site inspections. Supervisors will need resources to ensure that
their capacity to identify risks keep pace with the increasing sophistication of
financial instruments and the complexity of bancassurance conglomerates.

34.
The rapidly expanding exposures of Belgian banks in EME created high profit
opportunities but also increased credit risks, in particular those related to foreign
currency lending. As macroeconomic conditions worsen in EME countries, loan quality may
deteriorate. Any abrupt correction of the prevailing macroeconomic imbalance could—in the
current climate of exacerbated risk aversion—lead to sizeable losses. To help promote an
orderly unwinding of assets in Belgian banks while preserving stability in host countries,
Belgian authorities should pursue cross-border cooperation. Steps that should be taken
include:
•

Continue to press for an expansion of pan-European banking supervision
mechanisms. In the meantime, priority should be given to strengthening existing
venues of cooperation, such as supervisory colleges and bilateral memoranda of
understanding with supervisors in other countries where Belgian banks are active.

•

The supervisors should ensure that banks (i) appropriately manage indirect
credit risk stemming from foreign currency loans, and (ii) promote borrowers’
awareness of risk—both domestically and abroad.
C. Restoring Fiscal Sustainability

35.
While fiscal deficits are part of a proper crisis response, they should not derail a
medium-term fiscal strategy aimed at
2.5

long-run fiscal sustainability. Staff and the

-2.5
budget balance—an objective that had garnered
broad-based consensus in Belgium in the wake

of euro adoption—had been an elusive goal in
-4.5
2007–08. But staff also emphasized that the

financial crisis had boosted the gross debt-toSource: High Finance Council; and Staff Projections.

21
GDP ratio, and that deficits in 2009 and beyond would further increase public indebtedness,
making it more difficult to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. It was therefore imperative
to establish a clear medium-term anchor to fiscal policy. A clearly articulated adjustment
strategy aimed at returning the debt-to-GDP ratio onto a downward trajectory would help
boost market sentiment and reduce the unfair distribution of ageing costs among generations.
Staff recommended that the federal government—together with regions and communities—
should firmly commit already now to a structural adjustment of at least 0.7 percent of GDP
per year once the crisis has past, to return as soon as possible to fiscal balance, and eventually
to a surplus. The authorities indicated their intention to return to a medium-term
consolidation strategy, without specifying underlying growth or policy assumptions.
36.
The medium-term fiscal adjustment strategy should be underpinned by budget
process reforms. In staff’s view these could include:
•

A medium-term budgetary framework to guide the annual budget process. This
would allow the government to articulate spending priorities and set out in detail
plans for the main spending categories over a multi-year horizon.

•

An enhanced role for the HFC. To the existing function of assessing compliance
with Belgium’s stability programs and recommending an appropriate medium-term
fiscal stance, the HFC could take on the role of independent evaluator of submitted
budgets and corresponding outcomes, producing regular reports. The HFC's mandate
could be expanded to include expenditure policy issues and helping set parameters for
the medium-term budgetary framework.

•

More effective arrangements for coordinating fiscal policies among government
levels. The current arrangements involving informal agreements between federal and
community/regional governments should be converted into internal stability pacts that
would be debated by legislatures as part of the regular budget cycle, be published, and
have sanctions for non-compliance. Responsibilities for ensuring fiscal discipline at
the local level need to be clarified, and the reporting standards for local authorities
improved in conformity with ESA95 requirements.

•

Comprehensive expenditure and revenue reviews. Such reviews can help identify
areas where tax expenditures can be reduced, and spending streamlined and improved
in efficiency. They also could help Belgium find ways to reduce the size of
government, which—at nearly 50 percent of GDP—is above the average for advanced
countries.

The authorities were receptive to these suggestions, indicating that the IMF could play a
useful role in helping identify international best practice in budgeting.

22
37.
Increasing strains in Belgium’s fiscal federalism arrangements need to be
tackled through further institutional reforms. Staff and the authorities agreed that vertical
imbalances between the federal level and communities/regions were deepening as the federal
government transfers an increasing share of its revenues to communities/regions, and also
bears the brunt of the increase in health- and aging-related spending. Addressing these
vertical imbalances is complicated by horizontal imbalances between communities/regions.
Staff argued that the institutional reform dialogue recently initiated by communities and
regions would offer an opportunity to reconsider the horizontal imbalances, with a view to
providing a better match between spending authority and revenue-raising responsibilities and
improving the transparency and incentive effects of intergovernmental solidarity
mechanisms.

B. Bound Tests
B1. Real interest rate is at baseline plus one standard deviations
B2. Real GDP growth is at baseline minus one-half standard deviation
B3. Primary balance is at baseline minus one-half standard deviation
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using one-quarter standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2009 9/
B6. 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2009

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange
rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

Belgium’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other
currencies.

•

Belgium maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers
for current international transactions, except for restrictions maintained solely for
security reasons. These measures are established by European Union regulations and
have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision
No. 144-(52/51).

FSAP Participation:

FSAP Assessment

IMF Country Report No. 06/75

Summary: The report concluded that Belgium’s financial system is resilient and benefits from a
number of Belgium-specific features that help stability. These include a traditionally cautious
attitude toward risk by banks, large holdings of government securities, extremely low holdings of
equity by banks, a stable source of funding benefiting from generous tax incentives, a high
standard of banking supervision, and a stable macroeconomic policy framework. Overall,
supervision showed a high degree of compliance with international standards. Near-term
vulnerability appears low, reflecting the soundness of the dominant banking system, the generally
benign financial environment, the strong financial condition of the corporate sector, and the
relatively healthy financial position of the household sector. Financial institutions were found to

34
withstand an adverse macroeconomic stress well, helped in part by the beneficial diversification
in the bancassurance model.
Notwithstanding the strengths of the Belgian financial sector, a number of issues emerged from
the FSAP. The heavy exposure abroad, the open nature of the economy, and the importance of
the Euroclear Group globally, made the domestic financial system potentially vulnerable to
global economic developments and financial contagion. Risks remained and may increase with a
downturn in the business cycle, increased cross-border operations, and deeper links with the
global money centers. In line with the 2005 FSAP recommendations, the supervisory framework
has been strengthened. The Banking, Finance, and Insurance Commission’s (CBFA)
management committee has been streamlined and synergies between the CBFA and the National
Bank of Belgium (NBB) have been further developed. Regular stress tests have helped promote a
systematic dialogue between supervisory authorities and market participants, while detailed
procedures for financial crisis management have been tested. Prudential supervision of the
insurance sector has been upgraded and regulation of the pension funds sector reinforced.

35
ANNEX II. BELGIUM: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Belgium’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes. The
National Bank of Belgium (NBB) regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial
data and provides calendar dates of main statistical releases. On-line access to these
comprehensive databases is facilitated by the NBB’s data search engine, Belgostat. Belgium
is a SDDS subscriber. Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions
and monetary aggregates are prepared on a monthly basis and are timely.
Belgium adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95)
in 1999. Revisions of national accounts started in November 2005 to comply with
EUROSTAT requirements and prepare for the adoption of chain-linked national accounts
statistics. Unlike in other countries, the NBB is responsible for compiling national accounts
statistics. Quarterly accounts are published within a lag of three months. Both annual and
quarterly accounts data are of good quality, with shortcomings mainly related to export and
import deflators, which are based on unit values, rather than prices collected directly from
exporters and importers.
General government revenue, expenditure, and balance on an accrual basis (ESA95) are
published annually. The NBB publishes monthly data on central government operations and
quarterly data on general government operations since April 2007.
The overall quality and availability of financial indicators are good. The authorities are
providing quarterly updates of financial sector indicators (FSIs) in a timely manner.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
BELGIUM
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with the Strategy, Policy, and Review Department)
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Anthony Boote
March 2, 2009

This supplement to the staff report for the 2008 Article IV consultation with Belgium
provides an update on the staff’s revised economic outlook, recent developments in financial
markets, and the 2009 budget and economic stimulus package. The information does not alter
the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Summary
GDP is forecast to contract by 2.5 percent in 2009 due to deeper recessions in partner
countries, a worse outcome than anticipated in the staff report. The financial sector faces
increased risks related to adverse developments in central and Eastern Europe as well as
legal proceedings. Reflecting the downward revision of the growth forecast, the general
government deficit is now projected to widen to 3.4 percent from 3.2 percent in the staff
report.
Outlook
1.
Staff projects the real GDP contraction to deepen to 2.5 percent in 2009, from
1.9 percent in the staff report (Table 1). The revision is driven by worse-than-anticipated
growth results for the last quarter of 2008 and reflects downward revisions to the growth
outlook in Belgium’s main economic partners. Consumer and business confidence further
eroded in February 2009 as labor market conditions are deteriorating. In addition, significant
downside risks remain, related to the international environment and contagion effects from
the global financial crisis.
Financial sector
2.
The need for additional interventions in the financial sector cannot be ruled out.
The shareholders’ rejection of the sale of Fortis Bank Belgium to BNP-Paribas has

2
heightened uncertainties about the future of the group, and has exposed the budget and
Belgium’s sovereign rating to additional risk. The recent sharp drop in KBC’s share price
and jump in its credit default spread manifest market uneasiness about the group’s core
capital ratio and its exposure to emerging Europe where vulnerabilities have risen. The
liquidity position of the third major Belgian bankassurance group, Dexia, remains severely
mismatched, and the group might need to shore up its capital. As the need for additional
government support to these and other financial institutions cannot be excluded, establishing
a broader intervention framework remains a priority.
2009 budget and stimulus plan
The government has updated its fiscal projections to take into account the deterioration in the
economic parameters underlying the budget and the Plan de Relance’s measures. The general
government deficit is now officially projected to widen to 3.4 percent of GDP in 2009. At
this stage, the government is not considering any additional measures beyond the ones
contained in the 2009 budget and in the Plan de Relance, which is still being debated by
parliament. The government intends to return to a medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy
as soon as economic conditions allow it, and has tasked the High Finance Council with
quantifying adjustment objectives.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 10, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Belgium
On March 4, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Belgium.1
Background
The global financial crisis has hit the country particularly hard in recent months, forcing
government intervention in major financial institutions. The boom in energy and food prices in
early 2008 caused inflation to spike to well above the euro area average, posing risks to
competitiveness while uncovering fault lines in domestic price-setting mechanisms and sparking
concerns over retail competition. In addition, political uncertainty is high, complicating prospects
for decisive action to address the economic difficulties.
Looking ahead, staff expects a deep recession in 2009, with a sluggish recovery in 2010 as the
rebound in the world economy will be slowed by the aftermath of the financial crisis. Greater
economic uncertainty and less favorable financing conditions will lower business investment,
and consumption will decelerate in response to more sluggish real disposable income growth
and job losses. Spillovers from the global financial turmoil and recessions in partner countries
will exert an additional drag on activity. Concerns about the depth and persistence of the
ongoing financial market turmoil and its effects on growth constitute downside risks.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Fuelled by increases in world energy and commodity prices, Belgian headline inflation peaked
at 5.9 percent, year-on-year, in July, 2008, almost 2 percentage points above the euro area
average. This spike has now begun to reverse, but the aftereffects will continue to be felt in
2009. Inflation should fall to around 2 percent in 2009, but may still remain above the euro area
average. Indexation mechanisms will generate higher wage growth than in partner countries
over the coming year, which will help sustain demand but also contribute to a continued decline
in external competitiveness. The recent inflation dynamics have also highlighted structural
concerns about price-setting in food and energy markets.
Belgium’s financial sector weathered the early rounds of financial turmoil in 2007, but
succumbed in September–October 2008. The system’s strong capitalization and moderate
exposure to subprime risk appeared to confer relative resilience when the 2007 liquidity shock
broke. However, tighter world liquidity conditions in the wake of the Lehman collapse, together
with specific concerns about Fortis and Dexia banks, triggered a crisis in September 2008.
As world financial conditions turned increasingly desperate, the authorities were forced to
intervene in all three major Belgian banks and in an insurance company.
The implementation of the 2008 federal budget was delayed by the lack of a government, and
its consolidation effort was less ambitious than originally envisaged. Fiscal policy in 2009 allows
for full operation of the automatic stabilizers, plus a moderate discretionary stimulus (around
1 percent of GDP), which will widen the general government deficit to beyond 3 percent of GDP.
As an anchor to fiscal policy and to ensure fiscal sustainability, the government should firmly
commit now to a structural adjustment of a least 0.7 percent of GDP per year once the crisis
has past.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, as a small open economy, Belgium has been severely affected
by the global financial crisis and economic slowdown, as well as the earlier commodity and oil
price shocks. They commended the authorities for their prompt and decisive intervention as the
Belgian banking sector began to face severe pressure in September 2008. On the fiscal side,
Directors concurred that it will be essential to strike the right balance between the need for
short-term stimulus and achieving medium-term fiscal sustainability, given the relatively high
debt level and the aging population. Directors were of the view that at this stage there is no
room for additional fiscal stimulus measures.
Directors noted that the near-term economic outlook is bleak. With a protracted global financial
crisis and recessions in partner countries, GDP growth is expected to contract sharply in 2009
and to recover only sluggishly in 2010, with significant downside risks. Acknowledging that the
current conjuncture presents significant policy challenges, Directors encouraged the authorities
to allow fiscal stabilizers to operate fully, and welcomed the moderate discretionary stimulus.
They noted, however, that to be effective, the stimulus measures need to be timely, targeted,
and temporary, and should be tied to structural fiscal improvements aimed at ensuring longerterm sustainability. Directors encouraged the authorities to adopt a strong and credible program
of medium-term fiscal consolidation.

3
Directors welcomed the government’s initial intervention in the banking sector, and noted that
the need for further intervention could not be ruled out. They called for the authorities to
establish a comprehensive framework for future interventions, in line with the framework agreed
at the EU level.
Directors agreed that the rapid expansion of some Belgian banks in emerging market
economies had been beneficial for both Belgium and the host countries. At the same time,
these increased interlinkages call for strong and effective cross-border cooperation between
supervisors. Directors recommended strengthening existing venues such as supervisory
colleges and bilateral memoranda of understanding, with some Directors suggesting
consideration for expanding pan-European supervisory mechanisms.
Looking beyond the current crisis, Directors encouraged the authorities to tackle longstanding
structural weaknesses, particularly in light of Belgium’s inflation differentials with its European
partner countries and relatively high labor costs. To ease structural rigidities, boost growth,
facilitate job creation, and help reverse the deterioration of Belgium’s competitive position in the
world, they recommended reinforcing the competition authority, liberalizing product and service
markets, and reviewing the price-setting mechanism in energy supply and distribution. Directors
encouraged the authorities to press ahead with labor market reforms so as to boost participation
rates and reduce unemployment. They also advised considering a revision of the wage
indexation mechanisms within the centralized bargaining framework. Consideration should also
be given to reforming the current fiscal federalism framework to improve its efficiency and
effectiveness, with a view to providing a better match between spending authority and revenueraising responsibilities.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
