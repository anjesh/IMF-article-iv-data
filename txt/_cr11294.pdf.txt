Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Russian Federation
September 9, 2011
1.
This statement reports on information that has become available since the staff
report was issued. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Incoming data since the completion of the Article IV consultation in mid-June
have been mixed. The preliminary 2011Q2 outturn for GDP growth was weaker than
expected, suggesting that seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter growth was only 0.1 percent
compared to 0.9 percent in 2011Q1. The extent of the slowdown was surprising given that
short-term indicators suggested robust performances in retail trade and fixed investment in
April-June. Inflation slowed in July on the back of lower food prices, but remained elevated
at 9 percent year-on-year vs. 9.4 percent in June. As in many other countries, financial
conditions have worsened in Russia since the staff report was finalized at end-July as the
MICEX index has dropped by more than 10 percent and the EMBI+ spread has increased by
about 35 basis points. Since end-July, the ruble has depreciated by about 5 percent vis-à-vis
the currency basket. Last, both the end-July federal government nonoil deficit and the endMay general government nonoil deficit outturns were better than projected at 5.1 percent of
GDP and 1.4 percent of GDP, respectively, due to higher nonoil revenues and lower
spending.
3.
Overall, these data and the worsened outlook for global growth have caused staff
to revise its near-term growth forecast downward, though the substance of staff’s policy
advice is unchanged. On the basis of the recent slowdown observed in Russia, a strongerthan-anticipated slowdown in global growth, and lower oil prices, staff has revised down its
GDP growth forecast by half a percent in 2011 and 0.4 percent in 2012, to 4.3 percent and
4.1 percent, respectively. However, the balance of risks to the outlook is tilted to the
downside as both global growth and oil prices could yet be weaker than expected. Staff has
also marked down its forecast for 2011 year-end inflation by half a percent to 7.5 percent,
given recent inflation data and expectations that continued food price deflation will more
than offset the recent ruble depreciation. This level will still exceed the central bank’s own
target range of 6–7 percent for end-2011 and in the staff’s view, further monetary tightening
remains necessary to bring inflation firmly on a path toward an appropriate medium-term
level of 3–5 percent. Staff is now forecasting a slightly more favorable federal government
nonoil deficit of 11 percent in 2011, compared with 11.2 percent in the staff report, to reflect
the latest budget outturn and the expectation of another supplemental budget later this year.
Unless oil prices decrease substantially from current levels and the growth outlook becomes
much weaker, staff’s advice remains for a more ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation
than planned to return the nonoil deficit to a sustainable level, through growth-friendly,
credible measures.

2
4.
An initial draft of Strategy 2020 was released in August. The interim report on this
social and economic strategy to guide Russia’s development through the year 2020 was
developed by a number of expert working groups, commissioned by the government. The
report proposes a set of recommendations as a basis for government discussion and stresses
the importance of policy changes to achieve high-quality economic growth by ensuring
macroeconomic and social stability, improving the business and investment climate, and
diversifying exports. Discussion of Strategy 2020 is now ongoing, and the authorities also
plan to seek input from foreign experts, including the Fund, on their assessment of the report.
This process is expected to lead to changes in the policy recommendations and should be
completed by December 1. Staff’s preliminary assessment is that the recommendations
dovetail well with the reforms discussed in the staff report and, accordingly, would help lay
the basis for sustained growth.
5.
The date for parliamentary elections has been set for December 4. Presidential
elections will follow in the first part of 2012.

RUSSIAN FEDERATION
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 4, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Background: While the authorities’ crisis response was broadly effective, post-crisis
economic performance has been unimpressive, high oil prices notwithstanding. The
exit from crisis-related fiscal stimulus has been slow, while the central bank has been
hesitant to respond to rising inflation. Financial stability has been maintained, but
banks remain burdened with a high stock of nonperforming assets. Meanwhile, the
poor business climate continues to hamper investment.
Challenges: The key challenge is to leverage the commodity boom to put growth on a
sustained higher trajectory and reduce Russia’s economic vulnerabilities. This would
require breaking with the procyclical policies of the past, strengthening economic
policy frameworks, and reinvigorating long-stalled reforms. The authorities broadly
agreed with this assessment, but noted that most difficult reforms would need to be
postponed until after the 2011 parliamentary and 2012 presidential elections.
Policy recommendations: Growth can be lifted through a set of mutually reinforcing
policies, underpinned by stronger economic frameworks: a more decisive fiscal
consolidation; monetary policy focused on inflation; stronger financial sector
supervision; and a more welcoming investment climate. The authorities and staff
agreed that a more credible, ambitious, and growth-friendly deficit reduction,
supported by a sound fiscal framework, would promote economic stability and
balanced growth. However, the authorities noted the difficulty in implementing fiscal
adjustment in a pre-election year. The authorities did not see a clear need to tighten
monetary policy—advocated by Fund staff to lower inflation—expecting that a
slowdown in money growth, a moderation of food inflation, and further ruble
appreciation would reduce inflationary pressures going forward. The authorities
welcomed the recommendations of the recent FSAP stability module mission to
strengthen the financial sector supervision to reduce risks and support sustainable
credit growth and saw a speedy adoption of the legislation on connected lending and
consolidated supervision as a key priority. Finally, like staff, the authorities attached
great importance to improving the investment climate, confirming their intention to
implement the President’s plan to strengthen the business environment.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

EXITING THE CRISIS
Russia’s economic recovery is proceeding in fits and starts amid high inflation. The
current account has strengthened, aided by high oil prices, but capital outflows persist.
Financial conditions are improving and credit has resumed growing, but the banking
system is still vulnerable. The CBR has withdrawn the crisis-related support for the
financial system, while the exit from fiscal policy support has been slow.

A. An Uneven Recovery
1.
The Russian economy has improved,
but the recovery has been uneven, despite
high commodity prices. Russia’s output
contracted by 7.8 percent in 2009—the worst
decline among its peers—as the sharp decline
in domestic demand was only partially offset
by a massive fiscal stimulus and a contraction
in imports. Growth picked up to 4 percent in
2010, intermittently carried by consumption—
supported by large pension hikes—and
investment, while the contribution of net
exports turned sharply negative as imports
surged. But the recovery has been patchy. In
summer 2010, it was interrupted by a
heatwave and drought, compounded by a
weakening in consumer demand as the impact
of fiscal stimulus faded. And while growth
resumed in Q4, fueled largely by a temporary
rebuilding of inventories, short-term economic
indicators point to a notable slowdown in the
first half of 2011 (Figure 1). Unemployment has
declined, while real wages remain volatile.
2.
Inflation remains stubbornly high,
signaling second-round effects of last year’s
spike in food prices. While monthly inflation
has edged down amid easing food prices, an
appreciating ruble, and regulatory pressures to
limit gas price increases, yearly inflation
remained high at 9.4 percent in June—well
above the authorities’ end-year target range of
6-7 percent.

The current account has been
strengthening, but net capital outflows
persist. Following a brief deterioration in the
third quarter of 2010 amid a temporary surge
in imports, the current account has been
improving, aided by high oil prices. Unlike
many emerging markets, Russia experienced
net capital outflows in 2010, which continued
into the first half of 2011. The outflows likely
reflected political uncertainty in the run up to
the 2012 presidential election and a renewed
focus by investors on Russia’s poor business
climate and vulnerable economic structure.

Russia’s exchange rate remains
competitive and international reserves are
adequate. The ruble has appreciated by 12
percent in real effective terms against the
Euro-dollar basket over the past 12 months,
surpassing its pre-crisis level, while gross
international reserves increased by some $63
billion during the same period to $524 billion
at end-June. The CGER estimates and staff’s
analysis suggest that the ruble is slightly
undervalued (Box 1).1 Staff views foreign
reserves as broadly adequate (Annex I).

Russia’s exchange rate is classified as “other

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. 2011 Exchange Rate Assessment*
The most recent CGER estimates suggest that the
ruble is slightly undervalued, but not clearly out of
line with fundamentals. The 2011 Spring CGER
results point, on balance, to a slightly increasing
undervaluation of the ruble relative to the
assessment in the fall of 2010.1 Given the uncertainty
associated with this exercise, however, the current
average deviation from equilibrium of -5 percent
indicated by the three CGER methods is not clearly
out of line with fundamentals.
The results suggest that fundamentals have
improved faster than the ruble has appreciated. The
real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by
about 9½ percent in 2010, broadly reversing the
depreciation incurred in 2009, and this trend
continued in the first half of 2011. But at the same
time the medium-term outlook for oil prices
improved sharply, which allows for a stronger ruble
(or, a lower equilibrium external current account)
under the macro-balance and external sustainability
approaches. On balance, therefore, the gap between
the actual REER and the equilibrium widened on
both approaches, to -10 percent (indicating
undervaluation). The results of the equilibrium real
exchange rate (ERER) approach, however, changed
only marginally and continued to indicate modest
overvaluation.

An alternative dollar-wage comparison broadly
supports the CGER findings. As introduced in the
2009 Russia staff report, and as a supplement to the
standard CGER methods, an additional regression
was estimated that uses dollar wages as a
dependent variable—these are directly comparable
across countries and therefore serve as a useful
proxy of the real exchange rate. This approach is
conceptually similar to the standard ERER approach
but differs in that it draws from a wider sample of
countries, and explicitly allows for the fact that most
transition countries may not have been in a long-run
equilibrium for most of the sample period. For 2010,
this equilibrium wage approach suggests that the
ruble is some 2 percent undervalued, broadly in line
with the findings of the CGER exercise.

uncertainties surrounding peripheral Europe.
Meanwhile, the staff’s aggregate indicator of
financial conditions—which in addition to
equity prices and interest rates also includes
house prices, the exchange rate, and credit
conditions (see Selected Issues Chapter III)—
showed a deterioration in 2011 so far,

Credit growth has resumed,

is liquid and official data suggest
nonperforming loans (NPLs) have come down
from a peak of 10 percent during the crisis to
8.1 percent of loans in April, while profitability
has bounced back from crisis lows. However,
banks remain burdened by a high stock of
nonperforming assets. Against this
background, real credit growth reached only
about 4 percent in 2010, although it has
picked up further in recent months, reflecting

B. A Gradual Exit from Crisis-Related Policies
7.
The Russian authorities are
gradually exiting from crisis policy support,
but the exit has been slow and, in some
areas, not sufficiently ambitious. In
particular, while good progress has been made
in unwinding the crisis support to banks, the
exit from the fiscal stimulus is being drawn out
and monetary policy has been hesitant in
addressing inflation.



The large and poorly-targeted fiscal
stimulus, much of it in the form of
permanent measures, is being only
partially withdrawn. Following a massive
fiscal expansion of some 9 percent of GDP
during the crisis, the general government
nonoil deficit—which is a relevant measure
of the fiscal stance in oil producing
countries, given the volatility of oil price

and nonrenewable nature of oil reserves—
fell by 1¾ percent of GDP in 2010, mainly
on account of the recovering economy and
expenditure under-execution, rather than a
deliberate tightening of fiscal policy
(Figure 3). The medium-term budget plans
only a modest further reduction in the
federal nonoil deficit of some 2¼ percent
of GDP by 2013, with over half of the
adjustment stemming from the increase in
the rate of the payroll tax in 2011 from 26
to 34 percent, and the remainder from a
reduction in civil service employment—
policy plans for which are still being
elaborated—and lower investment and
transfers.


The CBR has been slow to respond to
rising inflation. Even though inflation had
been steadily increasing since the summer
of 2010, a policy tightening was not
initiated until the end of the year.
Following an initial increase in the CBR’s
overnight deposit rate in December 2010,
policy rates were tightened more
comprehensively in February, April, and
May (but rates were left unchanged in
June). In addition, the CBR raised reserve
requirements and differentiated them by
residency. The floating band for the ruble
has been widened and intervention
amounts scaled back (Figure 4).

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

OUTLOOK
A. Near-Term Outlook and Risks
Against the backdrop of a still-fragile banking system, increased risk aversion by
investors, and continued political uncertainty, the outlook is for only modest growth,
despite high oil prices. Risks relate to oil prices and capital flows.
8.
Despite high oil prices, under
unchanged policies, the outlook is for only
moderate growth, accompanied by high
inflation. Staff projects real growth at 4.8
percent in 2011, compared to over 7 percent
during 2000–07, even as the output gap is still
negative and oil prices are high. The muted
outlook reflects expectations that the
combination of high oil prices and large capital
inflows—which, together with procyclical
economic policies, propelled credit and
powered the boom in the run-up to the
crisis—is unlikely to return amid political
uncertainty, a still fragile banking system, and
increased risk aversion by investors. Inflation is
projected to fall to 8 percent by end-2011,
assuming food prices continue to moderate.

9.
Near-term risks are broadly
balanced. On the upside, higher oil prices and
the return of large capital inflows, in the event
political uncertainty lifts, could push growth
up. On the downside, unfavorable external
developments—particularly lower oil prices,
increased global risk aversion, or lower
external demand—or domestic complacency
and a lower appetite for reform could drag
growth down. As indicated in the recent IMF
report on potential spillovers from the Euro
Area (EA), an intensification of the EA debt
crisis, especially if it were to spread to the core
EA, could have a significant negative impact on
the Russian economy through trade and
financial linkages.2 A worse-than-expected
growth outcome in Russia would have
negative spillovers throughout the region,
mainly through remittances and trade (Box 2).

B. Medium-Term Outlook
Under unchanged policies, medium-term growth will be held back by weak policy
frameworks and the lack of economic diversification. By the same token, the Russian
economy will remain vulnerable to external shocks. But Russia can do much better if it
successfully leverages the commodity boom to strengthen policies.
10.
The medium-term economic outlook
is constrained by Russia’s weak policy
frameworks and continued dependence on
oil. Over the past decade, Russia’s economy
has experienced a greater degree of volatility
than its peers, reflecting its dependence on oil,

exacerbated by procyclical economic policies
and lack of reforms. The crisis laid bare these
structural weaknesses of the economy, which
have amplified vulnerabilities and undermined
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

Russia’s medium-term growth prospects. The
current policy plans do not go sufficiently far
in reversing the crisis-related stimulus and
ensuring economic stability and growth.
Unless these weaknesses are forcefully
addressed, growth prospects will remain
subdued, with real growth projected to fall to
3¾ percent by 2016 in the baseline scenario
(Figure 5). Long-term potential growth will be
modest—below 4 percent—and Russia will
20

remain vulnerable to shocks. Inflation will
come down somewhat on the back of a
moderate withdrawal of government demand
and an appreciating ruble, but will remain
elevated. The current account surplus will
gradually decline as oil prices stabilize and
imports pick up. Most official and private
interlocutors agreed that in the absence of
reforms the economic outlook is
unremarkable.

11.
A continuation of weak policies
would amplify Russia’s vulnerability to
external shocks. In an adverse scenario, a
sharp and permanent decline in commodity
prices—following, for example, a significant
drop in global demand—would put
considerable pressure on Russia’s external and
fiscal accounts, triggering another recession.
Over the medium term and in the face of
multiple economic crises in the space of just
over a decade, investor confidence would be
slow to return and capital outflows would
continue putting a drag on long-run growth.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

12.
Elevating the medium-term growth
path would require a major strengthening
of economic policies. The reform scenario
envisages higher medium-term growth—
around 6 percent—supported by a stronger
and more credible fiscal retrenchment,
monetary policy taking control of inflation, a
stronger and more competitive financial
system, and effective implementation of
structural reforms. In this scenario, the shortterm drag on growth from fiscal retrenchment
would be offset by a more stable and
business-friendly economic environment and
greater credibility of government policies. This
would boost investor confidence and support
an early return of productive capital inflows.

Box 2. Regional Spillovers from Russia’s Economic Recovery*
During the crisis, a sharp contraction of the Russian
economy hit hard its regional partners. At the peak
of the crisis, exports to Russia from neighboring
countries plummeted, amid a sharp contraction in
Russia’s demand. Remittances from Russia to CIS
countries fell by over 30 percent in 2009, reflecting
the deep recession in Russia, particularly in the
construction sector—a key employer of migrant
labor. A significant depreciation of the Russian ruble
during 2008-09 triggered sharp currency
devaluations in most CIS countries, weakening
banks’ balance sheets and credit.
Russia’s improving economy is benefiting the region
through trade, remittances, and investment. The
value of the CIS exports to Russia rose by almost 40
percent in 2010. Individual remittances from Russia
to the CIS are recovering gradually, amid Russia’s
still volatile construction activity, with remittances to
Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan already
exceeding the pre-crisis levels. Private capital flows
from Russia to the CIS have also recently picked up.
But Russia’s export ban on cereals, during August
2010-June 2011, and the significant increase in the
gasoline export duty in May 2011 added to
inflationary pressures in the region. While the poor
harvest in Russia and the subsequent export ban
pushed up global grain prices, the adverse impact
on inflation has been particularly acute in Caucasus
and Central Asian countries, given the high weight of
food in their consumption baskets and significant
dependence on imported food. Inflationary
pressures in the region were further exacerbated by
the increase in the gasoline export duty to a
prohibitive level—implemented in May to mitigate
the gasoline shortages in Russia. Policy measures to
ease price pressures in the region—such as higher
subsidies, the release of grain reserves, and wage
and pension hikes—have entailed significant fiscal
costs.

1/ Assumptions for the three scenarios are as follows:
▪ Baseline scenario assumes a continuation of current policies. Monetary policy will continue to focus on multiple objectives,
while allowing some greater exchange-rate flexibility, with inflation remaining elevated. Fiscal policy will implement the 2011-13
medium-term budget, with no additional consolidation after 2013. There will be no major changes in banking sector policies.
Policy frameworks will remain unreformed.
▪ Adverse scenario assumes a permanent external shock, with oil prices declining sharply to $50 per barrel in 2012 and staying
there in real terms for the remainder of the forecast. In 2012, fiscal policy responds by maintaining expenditures unchanged in
nominal terms at their 2011 level, while monetary policy becomes accommodative. During 2013-14, the nonoil deficit of the
federal government is reduced at the same pace as envisaged in the current medium-term budget for 2012-13, with no further
consolidation after 2014, while monetary policy remains neutral. As in the baseline, no progress is made regarding structural
reforms and the strengthening of policy frameworks.
▪ Reform scenario assumes full implementatio n of reforms recommended by the staff. Monetary policy will focus on bringing
inflation down to 3 percent over the medium term, amid a flexible exchange rate. Fiscal policy will implement a more ambitious,
credible, and growth-friendly consolidation with the nonoil deficit of the federal government declining to the government’s longterm target of 4.7 percent of GDP by 2015. The supervisory framework will be strengthened along the lines recommended by the
recent FSAP. Fundamental structural reforms are put in place to improve the business climate and competitiveness, and policy
frameworks will be strengthened in line with IMF staff recommendations.

LEVERAGING THE OIL BOOM TO STRENGTHEN
POLICIES AND LIFT GROWTH
13.
The policy discussions focused on
how Russia could leverage high commodity
prices and the relatively benign external
environment to put in place strong
economic policies and boost growth.
Growth can be lifted through a comprehensive
set of mutually reinforcing measures. A
credible, ambitious, and growth-friendly fiscal
consolidation, anchored in a sound fiscal
framework would reduce fiscal vulnerabilities.
A more decisive and better communicated
monetary tightening—underpinned by a
flexible exchange rate and an improved

monetary framework—would help to bring
down inflation. Stronger oversight of the
financial sector would promote stability and
thereby underpin faster growth. And better
governance and a more welcoming business
environment would help to attract productive
investment and facilitate economic
diversification. Staff encouraged the
authorities to incorporate these reforms into
the 2020 social and economic strategy now
being formulated.

A. Credible Fiscal Consolidation for Stability and Growth
A stronger, more credible and growth-friendly budget deficit reduction is needed to put
public finances on a sustainable path and to promote balanced growth. Durable fiscal
consolidation will require a credible and sustainable fiscal anchor and effective
implementation of fundamental structural reforms, including in pensions, healthcare, and
social protection.
14.
Staff cautioned that continued high
nonoil deficits would amplify fiscal
vulnerabilities and undermine economic
stability—a concern shared by many private
and some official interlocutors. At 12¾
percent of GDP in 2010, the federal
government nonoil deficit was more than 8
percent of GDP above its pre-crisis level. Debt
sustainability is currently not an issue, given
the still-low public and external debt levels
(below 12 percent of GDP, and just over 30
percent of GDP respectively, in 2010).
However, if the output gap closes sooner than
expected and fiscal adjustment is delayed,
fiscal policy risks becoming procyclical, fueling
inflation and real appreciation. This would
undermine competitiveness and contribute to
another boom-bust cycle. At the same time,

the oil Reserve Fund—used to finance Russia’s
massive fiscal stimulus during the crisis—has
been largely run down, leaving public finances
vulnerable to a sudden drop in oil prices.
15.
In this regard, staff views the
medium-term budget as falling short of
what is needed to reduce fiscal risks. The
2011–13 budget envisages that by 2013 the
nonoil deficit will still be some 5¾ percent of
GDP above the government’s long-term deficit
target of 4.7 percent of GDP—suspended
during the crisis—which remains consistent
with fiscal sustainability and equitable
intergenerational use of the oil wealth (Box 3).
Against this backdrop, staff regretted the
recently-approved supplemental budget for
2011, since it further delayed consolidation.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Moreover, preliminary plans for the 2012–14
budget, made public after the mission, are a
step backward, since they propose a less
ambitious fiscal retrenchment in 2012 and
2013 than the current three-year budget, with
the nonoil deficit remaining in double digits

through 2014 (text table). The planned upward
revision to the 2012 and 2013 nonoil deficit
targets puts in question the government’s
commitment to fiscal sustainability and
weakens the credibility of fiscal policy.

16.
There was broad agreement that the
composition of the planned adjustment in
the 2011–13 budget is not supportive of
growth. Staff estimates that the adjustment
could shave off as much as 1½ percentage
points of annual real growth by 2013, as the
government withdraws demand and
employment contracts in response to the
distortionary increase in the payroll tax.
Moreover, the negative growth impact of the
higher payroll tax would persist in the medium
term. The authorities acknowledged that the
increase in the payroll tax could harm the
economy and have since announced plans to
reduce it in 2012. The government is presently
discussing offsetting measures to compensate
for lost revenue.

Discussions highlighted how Russia’s
weak fiscal framework undermines fiscal
sustainability and could amplify the
negative growth effect of fiscal tightening.
In particular, the lack of a credible and
sustainable anchor for fiscal policy, the policy
focus on the overall rather than the nonoil
balance, and the use of supplementary
budgets to spend excess oil revenue add to

Box 3. Applying the Permanent Oil Income Model to Russia*
A Permanent Oil Income Model (POIM) is one
approach used by oil-producing countries to
manage oil wealth. The POIM applies the permanent
income hypothesis developed by Friedman to help
decide on how to allocate government wealth
(including oil in the ground) across generations. The
basic POIM yields a constant per capita level of the
primary nonoil deficit financed by perpetual income
from oil wealth.1 This approach could be attractive to
countries that would like to keep the size of
government constant in relation to the size of their
economies.
An alternative is a POIM-real criterion approach. The
objective of this approach is to maintain the
purchasing power of the wealth distributed each

temporarily suspended during the crisis—has
already been incorporated into Russia’s budget
code, signaling ownership and political buy-in.
Staff calculations suggest a POIM-real criterion
approach would be broadly consistent with the
government’s nonoil deficit target of 4.7 percent of
GDP.2 Based on oil price assumptions from the July
2011 WEO, the POIM-real criteria rule would be
consistent with fiscal consolidation in the mediumterm to about 5½ percent of GDP by 2015. In

Growth-friendly. Staff estimates that the
adverse effect of fiscal retrenchment on
growth can be mitigated by directing the
composition of the adjustment toward
growth-friendly instruments—especially a
reversal in temporary subsidies extended
to strategic enterprises during the crisis,
and a reduction in transfers and tax
exemptions. The impact on growth would
be further mitigated by a relatively
favorable external environment, including
high oil prices, and focusing on items with
low fiscal multipliers.
Credible. A credible fiscal plan could help
to realize some growth benefits of the
adjustment as early as in 2013. The
credibility of the adjustment can be
enhanced by front-loading the
consolidation—for example, by carrying
out two-thirds of the adjustment in the
first three years—strengthening the fiscal
framework, and spelling out clearly the
planned policies. Durable consolidation
will need to be underpinned by
fundamental structural reforms, including
in pensions and healthcare—where

pensions in January 2011 as part of the

options later this year. However, they

Ambitious. To put public finances on a

towards reaching this target by 2015.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 4. Growth-Friendly, Credible, and Ambitious Fiscal Consolidation in Russia*
Staff’s analysis, based on the IMF’s Global Integrated
Monetary and Fiscal model, suggests that the
composition of the 2011–13 medium-term budget is
unfriendly to growth.1 The budget relies mainly on
an increase in the payroll tax (which distorts labor
decisions) and cuts to government investment
(which reduce the productive capacity of the
economy). If market participants were to see the
consolidation as credible only in 2014, there would
be an immediate negative impact on growth (red
line), which would reach about 1–1½ percent
annually in the medium term.
Growth-friendly
If the same size, phasing, and credibility of
consolidation were instead to be delivered via
growth-friendly instruments, the near-term negative
impact on growth would be more muted and there
would be a positive effect in the medium term (light
blue line). In this alternative scenario, three-quarters
of the consolidation is delivered through cuts to
transfers (e.g., by better targeting social transfers),
with the remainder from cuts to government
consumption (e.g. cutting the size of the civil
service). These instruments are considered growthfriendly since they are less distortionary to
investment and labor decisions.

Credible
Credibility affects growth-promoting benefits of
fiscal consolidation. If consolidation is credible,
market participants expect that lower future real
interest rates (from smaller deficits) will create room
for higher government spending or lower taxes,
prompting them to smooth consumption and raise
investment. Thus, if the consolidation package were
to be perceived as credible starting in 2013 (dark
blue dashed line), this would move the positive
effect of the growth-friendly package forward by
one year. The medium-term effect would be broadly
the same.

would be even higher (green line), largely owing to a

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

The authorities are currently considering
whether to reinstate the nonoil deficit target or
to replace it with an oil-price rule, where
revenue above a certain oil price is saved in
the oil funds. They noted that the main appeal
of the oil-price rule is that it is easy to
communicate. In staff’s view, a nonoil deficit
target is the best anchor for fiscal policy in
Russia, since unlike the oil price rule, it
explicitly addresses intergenerational equity
concerns. An oil-price rule could be a secondbest alternative if supplemented by a ceiling
on expenditure or borrowing to avoid
procyclical fiscal policy, but still would not
necessarily preserve the wealth from oil for
future generations. The authorities argued that
the oil-price rule could be based on an oil
price that would ensure intergenerational
equity, but staff cautioned that it could then
be difficult to explain to the public how the oil
price was set.
19.
A stronger fiscal policy framework
will enhance credibility and support
balanced growth. Staff outlined key elements
to achieve this, which would include eschewing
excessive use of supplementary budgets to
avoid procyclical increases in spending, and
replenishing the oil Reserve Fund—taking
advantage of high oil prices—through more
ambitious consolidation to create a cushion
against external shocks. The authorities
acknowledged the important role the Reserve
Fund and the National Wealth Fund had
played in responding to the global financial
crisis. They reaffirmed their commitment to
replenish the funds and noted that the assets
held in the Reserve Fund would double this
year, to 1.4 trillion rubles (2.7 percent of GDP).

20.
Complementary institutional
reforms would further strengthen the fiscal
framework. In particular, staff suggested the
establishment of an independent fiscal agency
tasked with conducting impartial and
transparent fiscal analysis and assessment of
fiscal policy implementation could further
enhance the credibility of fiscal policy and
improve its effectiveness. To broaden support
for fiscal policy reforms, the Ministry of
Finance recently established an external
advisory group representating academia, think
tanks, and the private sector. Furthermore, the
authorities’ planned accounting of tax
expenditures was welcomed by staff as it
would help to better prioritize the use of
budget resources and increase transparency.
Staff recommended a speedy streamlining of
these expenditures to improve allocation of
resources across economic sectors, reduce the
incentives for rent-seeking, and support the
much-needed fiscal retrenchment. Staff noted
that fiscal vulnerabilities could be further
reduced through better assessment, disclosure,
and management of fiscal risks—including
those stemming from contingent liabilities,
such as deposit insurance scheme and statecontrolled enterprises. Finally, to improve the
effectiveness of government spending, staff
and the authorities agreed that public financial
management and procurement should be
strengthened.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

B. Strengthening Monetary Policy to Bring Down Inflation
Monetary policy has been slow to respond to rising inflation but has recently been
tightened. Bringing inflation down from its current high level will likely require a further
tightening, while improvements to the operational framework are key to enhance the
effectiveness of monetary policy and to ultimately anchor inflation at a low level. A more
flexible exchange rate and fiscal tightening should be the first lines of defense if large
capital inflows resume.
21.
Monetary policy has belatedly been
tightened, but inflation looks likely to
remain high in 2011. Inflationary pressures
have been building since the summer of 2010,
but the CBR did not embark on a tightening
cycle until late December 2010. Despite the
still-negative output gap, headline inflation, at
9½ percent in June, as well as core inflation
and inflation expectations, remain high. Staff’s
leading indicators model suggests that
inflation at end-2011 will reach 8 percent
,remaining well outside the CBR’s target range
of 6–7 percent—a target, which has been
revised upward along with actual inflation and,
in staff’s view, is unambitious.

22.
The authorities were not convinced
of the need to tighten monetary policy—
advocated by staff to lower inflation. The
authorities expected that recent positive
trends in food prices and money growth, and
some further appreciation of the ruble, would
reduce inflationary pressures, potentially
bringing inflation down to 7 percent by the
end of the year—close to the CBR target, thus
weakening the case for a further policy
tightening. While noting that it was already
too late for monetary policy to influence end2011 inflation significantly, staff advocated to
be more ambitious and recommended a
continued policy tightening this year to put
inflation on a firm declining trend toward a
more appropriate medium-term level of 3–5
percent. Staff also underscored the importance
of a consistent communication policy, which in
the past has not always been clear about the
direction of policy. In this regard, the
transparency of communications could be
increased by publishing information on
inflation expectations and the CBR’s mediumterm inflation forecast. Looking further ahead,
the need for monetary tightening could be
lessened by a more decisive fiscal
retrenchment.
23.
Policy discussions highlighted the
need to strengthen the operational
framework to enhance the effectiveness of
monetary policy. Staff recommended to
streamline the set of policy instruments to
improve the transmission of monetary policy
signals; drain remaining excess reserves
holdings of banks via open market operations
to make the refinance rate—the CBR’s
headline policy rate—binding; and gradually
narrow the interest rate policy corridor to
reduce interest rate volatility. The ultimate goal
would be to move away from the nonbinding
refinance rate toward a binding open market

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

operations rate, in the center of the policy-rate
corridor, as the main policy target. Effective
implementation of these measures would be
facilitated by communicating to market
participants a time-bound path for these
changes. The authorities broadly agreed with
the staff on the need to strengthen the
operational framework and were preparing
improvements. In the context of the recent
interest rate increases, they had already
effected some narrowing of the policy rate
corridor.
24.
The staff welcomed recent steps by
the CBR toward greater exchange-rate
flexibility. The recent widening of the
operational band for the ruble and smaller,
less frequent interventions are helping to
create room for monetary policy to focus more
squarely on inflation. The authorities and staff
agreed it was important that this trend toward
a more flexible ruble is continued going
forward. Some further appreciation that might
result in the context of high oil prices and a
more flexible exchange rate would not be an
immediate concern for competitiveness since
the ruble appears slightly undervalued at
present.

A flexible exchange rate and fiscal
tightening should be the first lines of
defense against excessive capital inflows.
Staff argued that at present, the differentiation
of reserve requirements by residency appeared
unwarranted, given that Russia was not seeing
net capital inflows. The authorities conceded
that it was largely a preventative measure.
Given that the ruble is somewhat undervalued,

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

staff advocated allowing more rapid exchangerate appreciation if the inflows were to return
in force. In addition, the recommended fiscal
retrenchment would further reduce any
overheating pressures. Staff emphasized that
capital flow management measures (especially
capital controls) should not be used in place of
these (necessary) macroeconomic policy
adjustments.

C. Promoting Sound Financial Intermediation by Strengthening Oversight
Russia’s banking system has weathered the crisis relatively well, but the use of offbalance sheet vehicles for distressed assets and possible overvaluation of on-balance
sheet foreclosed assets and restructured loans, combined with regulatory forbearance
extended during the crisis has likely masked underlying vulnerabilities. The recent FSAP
financial stability assessment identified several areas for improving financial sector
policies and bringing them in line with international standards.4 Such improvements
would be essential if the authorities’ goal of turning Moscow into international financial
center is to be advanced.
26.
The Russian authorities maintained
financial stability in the face of a major
global shock. Although the recent global
financial crisis hit the Russian economy hard,
the authorities succeeded in shielding, to a
large extent, the financial sector from its
impact, including through liquidity support to
banks and a carefully managed exchange-rate
adjustment. The financial system is now
recovering and the performance of financial
institutions improved in 2010. Financial
soundness indicators are rebounding and
compare broadly favorably with peers, even
though they generally remain below pre-crisis
levels and may understate problems owing to
weaknesses in reporting (Figure 6).

banking system is resilient to a variety of
shocks. Under a “severe” double-dip scenario
that assumes a 4 percent contraction of GDP in
2011 (a 1.7 standard deviation shock relative
to the 2000–10 average), net losses would
amount to about 22 percent of system capital.
This would leave the system-wide capital
adequacy ratio (CAR) at 14.1 percent, while
banks representing about 8 percent of the
system by assets would see their CAR fall
below 10 percent. While substantial, such an
impact would appear manageable. Single
factor tests suggest that credit risk (including
concentration risk) is the most important
source of vulnerability, while liquidity risk is
also significant.

27.
Stress tests conducted under the
recent FSAP suggest that the Russian

28.
However, the FSAP concluded that
the financial system may be more
vulnerable than the stress tests suggest. In
particular, the FSAP found that banks’ loan
quality may be overestimated, while the level
of provisions remains lower than it should be,

making the banking sector vulnerable to
shocks. In this regard, it is telling that the
impact of illustrative adjustments of banks’
balance sheets for these factors—though
necessarily based on subjective assumptions—
could well exceed that of the stress tests. This
is a key concern, particularly because the
system remains exposed to significant risks
from fluctuations in oil prices and capital flows.
Thus, while the risks to financial stability are
ultimately mitigated by Russia’s sizable
international reserves, increased vigilance is
warranted in the period ahead. The authorities
broadly agreed with this assessment, but
qualified the finding that current provisions
were too low by pointing to the positive trend
in NPLs.
29.
Recent consolidation in the banking
sector has favored a few large state-owned
banks, reducing competition and
potentially increasing moral hazard. While
the share of state-owned banks in total
deposits had been falling until 2007, the crisis
turned this trend around as depositors fled for
safety and at end-2010 the state banks held 52
percent of total deposits. The share of the
state banks in lending and total system capital
also rose, reflecting their easier access to
funding and capital during the crisis which
allowed them to increase market share. As a
result of the increasingly strong position of the
state banks in core banking segments, some
private banks are trending towards niche
markets and, possibly, greater risk-taking.
Separately, there is a risk that the strong
government support to the systemic stateowned banks during the crisis has increased
moral hazard.

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

30.
Despite recent progress in
strengthening the regulatory and
supervisory frameworks, the FSAP mission
found important gaps. In particular, the lack
of authority for the CBR to supervise bank
holding companies and related parties, issue
binding guidance on risk management by
banks, and use supervisory discretion in
applying laws and regulations to individual
banks greatly limits its ability to conduct
effective supervision, a case in point being the
recent Bank of Moscow episode.5 In the
nonbank financial sector, the recent merger of
the securities and insurance supervisors could
be beneficial, but the merger process remains
surrounded by uncertainties, including with
respect to the powers of the new agency.

The recent discovery, shortly after the mission, of a
large capital shortfall in the Bank of Moscow—
apparently derived from massive related lending,
which appeared to have gone unaddressed for a
considerable time—underscores the importance of
strengthening banking supervision, the regulatory
framework, and early corrective action structures. The
episode also illustrated the issues of non-transparent
ownership structures, and deficiencies in financial
reporting which were highlighted in the recent FSAP as
well as previous FSAPs.

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

31.
The authorities agreed with staff
that a stronger regulatory and supervisory
framework would safeguard financial
system soundness and promote sustainable
credit growth. Key improvements would
include greater supervisory authority for the
CBR—including adoption of the pending
legislation regarding connected lending and
consolidated supervision—and greater
discretion to use “professional judgment” in
applying laws and regulations to individual
banks, which would facilitate the reduction of
the reporting and regulatory burden. Staff
urged the authorities to adopt a transparent
framework for prompt remedial action, with a
clearly delineated set of mandatory measures
that escalate as a bank’s financial situation
deteriorates and ensure the adequacy of
provisions in the system. The authorities
shared staff’s views on the needed
improvements. They noted that the legislation
on consolidated supervision had been
submitted to the Duma, but expressed concern
that the final legislation could be significantly
weakened in the legislative process.
Meanwhile, the CBR indicated that it was
exploring options for a transparent remedial
action framework.
32.
Improved supervision of nonbank
financial institutions should foster public
confidence and a deepening of the sector.
The nonbank financial sector is small and not
considered systemically important, but the
insurance sector is performing poorly and
many companies will not be able to meet the
increased minimum capital requirements in
2012—underscoring the need for regulatory
vigilance. The authorities noted that the recent

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

merger of the securities and insurance
supervisors offers the prospect of giving
supervisors a comprehensive view of the
market, expanding the perimeter of oversight,
harmonizing supervisory approaches and
requirements, and realizing economies of
scale. Staff agreed but emphasized that for
these benefits to materialize, the framework
that was under preparation for the new Federal
Service for Financial Markets (FSFM) should
provide it with the power to issue secondary
regulation and industry-wide binding norms
and ensure its independence and adequate
resources. In this regard, the authorities’ plans
appeared broadly appropriate, but needed to
be followed by full and effective
implementation.
33.
Strengthening systemic risk
monitoring is key to containing moral
hazard and associated vulnerabilities. Given
the outsize importance of a few large banks in
Russia, systemic risk monitoring and the closer
supervision of systemically important banks
are imperative. The authorities are aware of
the challenges involved, and the recent
establishment of an inter-agency working
group under the Presidential Council and the
creation of a special department at the CBR in
charge of macroprudential analysis are
welcome. The FSAP recommended that to
ensure close cooperation and informationexchange between all supervisory agencies,
the Deposit Insurance Agency also be included
in the working group, and the authorities have
noted this was being arranged. In addition, the
FSAP recommended the CBR maintain the
possibility of permanent supervisory presence
on-site in systemically important banks.

D. Improving the Investment Climate
Improving Russia’s ailing investment climate is key to attracting productive capital
inflows and promoting sustainable growth. The authorities announced plans to
strengthen the business environment, but broader structural and governance reforms are
needed to boost investment and support economic diversification.
34.
Staff and the authorities agreed
that Russia’s poor business environment
and weak governance are key obstacles to
economic diversification and vibrant
growth. Adverse demographic trends suggest
that investment and productivity gains will
have to become the primary sources of longterm growth in Russia. This underscores the
need for a stronger business climate and
better governance—dimensions on which
Russia compares poorly to other BRICS and
emerging economies in Europe (Figure 7). The
authorities noted that addressing these issues
is a key reform priority, as reflected in the tenpoint plan to improve the investment climate
recently put forward by President Medvedev
(Box 6).
35.
Staff welcomed the ten-point plan
and called for its expeditious
implementation, but underscored that
some aspects of the plan would need to be
carefully managed. In particular, the lost
revenue from the proposed reversal of the
payroll tax increase should be fully replaced,
for example by reducing subsidies to
connected enterprises, and eventually, by
increasing the retirement age, rationalizing
early retirement schemes, and means-testing

basic pensions. Similarly, the creation of a
private equity fund with government
partnership could encourage foreign
investment by reducing operational
uncertainties. However, its political
independence should be ensured to protect
the fund from being used as a means to
implement marginal, but politically attractive
projects, while the risks to the sovereign
balance sheet from contingent liabilities
would need to be contained.
36.
More generally, staff emphasized
the need for broader governance reforms.
These reforms include the strengthening of
property rights and the rule of law, and the
reform of the judiciary system and civil
service. Accession to the WTO would also
improve the business climate through
increased predictability of the government’s
trade policy. Furthermore, decisive
implementation of the planned extensive
privatization—including in the banking
sector—should help to curtail state
dominance, improve competition, and reduce
moral hazard. The authorities confirmed their
intention to implement an ambitious
privatization program in the next three years.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Russia’s post-crisis rebound is
underway, but bold and decisive reforms
are needed to strengthen the medium-term
outlook. Despite a strong pick up in

commodity prices, growth has been relatively
modest and inflation is high. The economy has
been on an upward trajectory since the second
half of 2009, but the recovery has been

uneven. Meanwhile, weak economic policy
frameworks, an unfavorable investment
climate, and lack of economic diversification
continue to weigh on the economic outlook,
raising the specter of below-par growth and
continued instability.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

its peers, owing to its continued dependence
on commodities, poor governance, and
procyclical economic policies rooted in weak
policy frameworks. To put growth on a
sustained higher trajectory, the focus should
be on reducing fiscal vulnerabilities, reining in
inflation, promoting a stronger and more
competitive banking system, and creating a
welcoming environment for investment.
Improvements to economic policy frameworks
and a reinvigoration of long-stalled structural
reforms would be integral elements of this
strategy and would send a positive signal to
investors and boost Russia’s growth potential.

38.
The authorities have a window of
opportunity, created by high commodity
prices to reduce vulnerabilities and lay the
foundation for stronger growth. The Russian
economy has experienced a greater degree of
instability over the past decade and a much
larger output loss during the recent crisis than

This would also generate positive economic
spillovers for the region. The 2020 strategy
currently under preparation provides an
opportunity to put in place the reforms to
support stronger growth.
39.
Fiscal policy needs to be firmly
anchored on a sustainable nonoil deficit
target. Putting public finances on a
sustainable path and preserving oil wealth for
future generations would require reinstating
the government’s long-term nonoil deficit
target of 4.7 percent of GDP. Concrete plans—
grounded in growth-friendly measures,
including a reversal of the payroll tax increase,
reductions in subsidies and tax exemptions,
and better targeting of social transfers—
should be laid out to reach this target by 2015.
These actions would also help to rebuild fiscal
buffers in the oil funds, in line with the
authorities’ stated goal, thereby reducing fiscal
vulnerabilities. Durable adjustment would
require fundamental reforms, including to
pensions, social protection, and healthcare.
Front-loading the consolidation, while
strengthening fiscal institutions, would
enhance its credibility and help to realize
sooner the growth benefits. In this regard, the
2012–14 preliminary budget should be
reconsidered, since it further delays fiscal
consolidation and thereby exacerbates fiscal
risks and undermines the credibility of fiscal
policy with potentially negative knock-on
effects on growth.
40.
A continued tightening of monetary
policy is needed to rein in inflation. Despite
a still-negative output gap, core inflation and
inflation expectations are uncomfortably high.
While the CBR has appropriately, if belatedly,
embarked on a tightening cycle, continued
policy tightening will be needed this year to
bring inflation down towards a medium-term

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

rate of 3-5 percent. The effectiveness of this
endeavor would be bolstered by
improvements to the operational framework
for monetary policy and a consistent
communications policy, the transparency of
which could be increased by publishing
information on inflation expectations and
medium-term inflation forecasts. Ongoing
steps to enhance exchange rate flexibility are a
positive development. They allow monetary
policy to focus on inflation, and could help
dampen current inflationary pressures. Thus,
the flexible exchange rate and fiscal
adjustment would serve as the first lines of
defense against volatile capital flows.
41.
Addressing remaining gaps in the
regulatory and supervisory frameworks
would help safeguard a sound financial
system and underpin growth. The authorities
successfully maintained financial stability in the
recent global crisis, but the banking system
remains vulnerable to shocks, including
potential spillovers from the Euro area,
underscoring the need for continued vigilance.
Against this background, the recent FSAP
financial stability assessment recommended
strengthening financial sector policies,
including by granting the CBR greater
supervisory powers and adopting the
legislation on consolidated supervision and
connected lending. Effective implementation
of the FSAP recommendations would reduce
banking sector risks and bring supervision in
line with international standards.
42.
Enhancing the attractiveness of the
investment climate remains a high priority.
Given the nonrenewable nature of oil and gas
reserves, the non-energy share of the
economy will need to increase over time and
become the engine of growth. Key to the goal
of achieving economic diversification and

higher growth is attracting durable and
productive investment, including through
macroeconomic stability and an enhanced
business environment. Provided that it is
effectively implemented, the President’s action
plan could help achieve this goal, but
sustained reform efforts will be needed to fully
reap growth benefits. Thus, moving ahead on

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

broader reforms, including WTO accession,
reducing the role of the state in the economy,
and improving governance, is a necessary
complement to the action plan.
43.
It is proposed that the next Article IV
consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

rate; a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

ANNEX I. Russia’s Foreign Currency Reserves—Too Little, Too Much, or Just Right?6
Russia faces unusually large external vulnerabilities, which makes adequate reserves
holdings important as a buffer against external shocks. Separately, as a nonrenewableresource exporter, Russia saves some of its oil wealth for fiscal and intergenerational
equity purposes and, for the time being, these savings are held in the form of reserves.
Accounting for these country-specific factors, Russia’s current reserves appear to be
broadly adequate.
Benefiting from high oil prices in recent years,
Russia has built a considerable stock of foreign
currency reserves, amounting to $444bn at the
end of 2010. Part of this reserves build-up
reflects conventional central bank
interventions for exchange rate and
precautionary purposes, while another part
reflects fiscal savings. The latter savings are
accumulated in two sovereign wealth funds,
which are effectively managed by the Central
Bank of Russia (CBR). These funds are (i) the
Reserve Fund (RF), intended as a medium-term
fiscal stabilization fund, and (ii) the National
Wealth Fund (NWF), an investment fund with a
longer-term objective, aimed at preserving
part of the oil wealth to backstop the pension
system. The twin funds are the successors of
the earlier Oil Stabilization Fund, which was
split in early 2008. At the end of 2010, the oil
funds held at the CBR together amounted to
some $93bn.
700
600

Large vulnerabilities
Russia’s reserves accumulation should be
assessed against considerable external
vulnerabilities. In particular:


First, with oil and gas accounting for some
two-thirds of exports, Russia is heavily
dependent on volatile energy prices and
exposed to frequent disruptive terms of
trade shocks. The recent crisis provided a
stark reminder of this as, following the
sharp decline in oil prices during the global
crisis, Russia’s exports receipts dropped by
34 percent in 2009—a decline topped by
only a small number of other countries
(almost exclusively other oil exporters).



Second, weak policy frameworks and a
poor investment climate exacerbate
external vulnerabilities in downturns in
Russia. The limited credibility of the fiscal
and monetary policy frameworks, as well
as Russia’s unattractive business
environment (it ranks 123rd on the
summary measure of the World Bank’s
“Doing Business” indicators) make interest
in Russia highly sensitive to global risk
appetite.



Third, and partly reflecting the
aforementioned vulnerabilities, Russia is
particularly prone to capital flight,
including on the part of domestic
residents. This, too, was illustrated during

the recent crisis as capital outflows
reached over $130 billion (or 8 percent of
annual GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2008
on account of large portfolio withdrawals,
a flight into foreign currency cash
holdings, rising bank net foreign asset
positions, and net loan repayments by the
corporate sector. These massive capital
outflows put severe pressure on the ruble,
which depreciated by about 30 percent
against the euro-dollar currency basket
(and 15 percent in real effective terms)
during December 2008-January 2009.
In the face of these significant vulnerabilities,
adequate reserves levels are an important
buffer for Russia against external shocks.
Indeed, during the recent crisis, with large
pressures stemming from both the external
current and capital accounts, the authorities
lost more than a third (some $210bn) of their
reserves in a matter of just a few months. And
although the impact of the global downturn
on the economy was still very substantial, the
presence and use of the reserve buffer
arguably helped prevent a much deeper crisis,
such as the one Russia had experienced earlier
in 1998 (see chapter on Russia in forthcoming
IMF book on the crisis in Emerging Europe).

Measures of reserve adequacy
While reserves are useful during times of
external pressures, there are significant costs
to holding reserves.7 So how much is enough
7

Holding reserves entails an opportunity cost because
they could alternatively be used to e.g., finance public
investment or pay down external debt and reduce the
interest bill. Also, the accumulation of reserves often
also entails a sterilization cost. While such costs may
be mitigated by a downward effect on external debt
spreads (see Hauner, 2006), the importance of this

Several measures have been used over the
years to assess reserve adequacy. On one
traditional rule of thumb for reserve adequacy,
full coverage of short-term external debt,
Russia currently has more than 3½ times the
amount of reserves suggested by the rule.
However, in Russia’s experience, short-term
debt has been only one among several sources
of large outflows. Given Russia’s historic
susceptibility to capital flight among domestic
residents, another traditional measure that is
relevant for Russia is coverage of M2, as a
proxy for the total liquid assets held by
residents (Blanchard et al., 2010 and Obstfeld,
2008). And here current reserves cover only
just over half of the potential drain.
The problem, however, with the above rules of
thumb and with similar traditional yardsticks
such as import cover and GDP is that they
each highlight only one dimension of
vulnerability, while in reality there are many. To
mitigate this problem, we base our assessment
of reserve adequacy on the newly developed
IMF metric, which is a composite indicator
effect is proportional to the size of the sovereign
external debt stock (which is relatively small in the case
of Russia) while the marginal benefit from it declines
as reserve levels rise.

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

comprising four channels of potential external
drains—short-term debt, portfolio flows,
domestic liquidity, and export volatility. Each
of these variables is assigned a risk weight
based on the foreign exchange loss observed
at the tenth percentile of a cross-country
distribution for the variable during past
periods of market pressure (the methodology
is described in IMF, 2011).
In the IMF methodology two different sets of
weights are calibrated; one based on countries
with fixed/managed exchange rate regimes,
which tend to be more vulnerable to reserve
losses, and one for countries with floating
exchange rates, which are less vulnerable.
Given that Russia is classified as having a
managed exchange rate arrangement, the
former set of weights applies. When total
reserves at end-2010 are evaluated against this
measure Russia appears to hold somewhat
more reserves, at 197 percent of the metric,
than would be recommended on the basis of a
100-150 percent adequacy range (text chart).

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

As pointed out in IMF (2011), however, careful
judgment is needed in the application of the
metric in individual country cases to account
for country-specific characteristics. In this
context, two important qualifiers are in order
for Russia.
First, as the new IMF metric focuses on the
precautionary role of reserves, the role of
Russia’s reserve holdings that reflect fiscal and
intergenerational savings objectives warrants
special attention. While these holdings are
currently invested mainly in liquid assets and
therefore are part of usable reserves, their
accumulation over time is governed by a
different set of considerations than those for
regular reserves and their adequacy cannot be
assessed solely with reference to potential
balance of payments drains. The further
accumulation of oil fund savings is highly
advisable to smooth fiscal revenue volatility,
and to support the pension system and foster
intergenerational equity—and this desirability
is largely independent of the above
precautionary considerations.
In this context, it could be noted that—given
their longer-term objective—there is no clear
need to hold the NWF savings in liquid assets.
Holding an increasing share of these savings in
higher yielding, less liquid assets would offer
the prospect of better investment returns.
Accordingly, the authorities are looking into
options for diversifying the investment mix,
implying that over time part of the NWF
holdings would likely cease to qualify as
reserves.
Second, as described above, Russia is
encumbered by weak policy frameworks and
faces unusually large external vulnerabilities. In
this respect it is telling that on 3 out of the 4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 47

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

variables in the metric, the actual drains during
the recent crisis exceeded the tenth percentile
of the distribution of the cross-country sample
that is used for the calibration of the metric
weights (text table). As a result, the weights
based on cross-country experience may
underplay the potential drain in Russia. To
illustrate this, the text chart shows how the
reserve adequacy range would shift if the
metric were calculated using weights based on
the actual drains experienced in Russia during
the most recent crisis.

Too little or too much reserves?
In all, combining the above elements, reserves
levels in Russia appear broadly adequate, with
no clear indication of under- or
overaccumulation.
Further accumulation of foreign assets is,
however, desirable for non-precautionary
reasons. While it would be advisable to invest
non-precautionary reserves in higher yielding
(but less liquid) assets, such a shift should take
account of institutional constraints (including
capacity) and not be done in a way that
reduces usable reserves to a level that is
inadequate from a precautionary perspective.
Finally, reserves can only provide a temporary
and partial solution to the vulnerabilities that
stem from Russia’s lack of economic
diversification and weak policy frameworks. To
durably reduce risks it will be imperative to
implement economic reforms that address
these issues directly. Accordingly, in the longer
run, if the authorities strengthen policy
frameworks, increase exchange rate flexibility,
and succeed in making Russia’s economy less
dependent on oil, reserve needs would be
expected to decline in line with ensuing
reductions in external vulnerability.

Exchange Arrangements:
The de jure arrangement is other managed
arrangement—namely, a controlled floating
exchange rate arrangement. The ruble value of
a bi-currency basket is used as the operating
benchmark for transactions on the internal
currency market. The basket is currently
composed of €0.45 and $0.55. The target
boundaries of its permissible fluctuations were
revised based on changes in fundamental
factors governing formation of the country’s
balance of payments in accordance with the
Uniform State Monetary Policy Guidelines for
2008, in response to a gradual transition to a
more flexible exchange-rate-setting policy. The
value of the bi-currency basket is determined
under the influence of both market factors and
exchange interventions by the Central Bank of
Russia (CBR). The interventions take place both
in interbank currency exchanges and on the
over-the-counter interbank market to limit
daily fluctuations. Effective October 13, 2010,
the CBR has eliminated the fixed trading band
of Rub 26–41 against the bi-currency basket, in
force since January 2009. The CBR has also
widened the moving intervention band from 3
to 5 rubles in two installments, with the size of
the maximum intervention amount within the
band reduced from $700 million to $600
million. The permissible fluctuations may be
revised in response to changes in
macroeconomic indicators. Owing to the
continued control of the CBR over the

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

exchange rate determination, the de facto
exchange rate arrangement is other managed
arrangement. The Russian Federation accepted
the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and
4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement with effect
from June 1, 1996, and maintains an exchange
system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for currents
international transactions.

ANNEX II. RUSSIAN FEDERATION: WORLD BANK-IMF
COLLABORATION
1.
The Fund Russia team led by Ms.
Zakharova (deputy mission chief) met with
the World Bank Russia economic policy
team led by Mr. Bogetic (lead economist
and country sector coordinator for poverty
reduction and economic management) on
May 4, 2011 to discuss and reconfirm
macrocritical structural reforms and
coordination of the two teams’ work for the
period September 2010-March 2012. The
teams had previously met on September 7,
2010 to discuss/set the team’s work program
for the period September 2010-August 2011.
2.
The teams agreed that Russia’s main
macroeconomic challenges are to raise
growth prospects and strengthen the
banking system. A timely exit from the crisisrelated stimulus and reinvigoration of
structural reforms will be needed to meet
these challenges.



Public expenditure reforms: Key
elements of reform include: (i) promoting
aggregate fiscal discipline and
strengthening public expenditure
efficiency and management; (ii)
strengthening capital budgeting in the
road and rail sectors; and (iii) improving
the efficiency of public employment. These
reforms are macrocritical as they will help
to identify savings to support fiscal
consolidation and reduce fiscal
vulnerabilities.



Reforming the pension system: Key
objectives of reform include bringing down
long-run fiscal costs and providing
reasonable pension benefits to all
pensioners current and future. These
reforms are macrocritical as they will help
to reduce fiscal vulnerabilities.



Strengthening the monetary policy
framework: Key elements of reform
include (i) streamlining the set of policy
instruments; (ii) draining excess liquidity;
and (iii) a gradual narrowing of the policy
corridor. These reforms are macrocritical as
they will help to improve the effectiveness
of the monetary policy efforts to control
inflation, which is key for macroeconomic
stability and growth.



Financial sector stability module
assessment and financial sector
development: The banking sector is stable
but regulatory and supervisory deficiencies
need to be addressed, specifically: (i)
prompt adoption of pending legislation on
consolidated supervision and connected

3.
Based on this shared assessment, the
teams identified five reform areas as
macrocritical:


4

Strengthening the fiscal framework: Key
elements of reform include: (i) focusing on
the nonoil balance as the anchor for fiscal
policy, (ii) using a Permanent Oil Income
Model (POIM) rule to ensure long-term
fiscal sustainability; (iii) avoiding excessive
use of supplemental budgets; and (iv)
replenishing the Reserve Fund (designed
as a “rainy day” fund). These reforms are
macrocritical as they will help to reduce
fiscal (and economic) vulnerabilities, and
increase the credibility of fiscal policy,
which would support stronger growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

lending; (ii) granting an appropriate
degree of supervisory discretion to the
CBR; (iii) closer supervision of systemically
important banks to contain moral hazard
and improve systemic risk monitoring.
These reforms are macrocritical as financial
sector stability is key for effective
intermediation of savings to promote
investment and growth.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX



Reforming the pension system: The Fund
plans to elaborate reform options, present
them at a high-level conference in Moscow
in January 2012 which will include
representatives from the government,
academia, private sector, and civil society,
and discuss these options in the context of
the 2012 Article IV consultation. The Fund
will also assess the reform proposals of the
Working Group on Pensions that the
authorities have instituted as part of their
Strategy 2020 and which will present its
report by end-2011. The Bank has
completed several recent studies that
relate to the pension system, including a
study of long-term fiscal risks and a recent
paper on the second, private pillar. The
Bank team has shared these studies and is
ready to coordinate with the Fund team, as
needed.



Strengthening the monetary policy
framework: The Fund has elaborated
reform options and discussed them with
the authorities during the 2011 Article IV
consultation.



Financial sector stability module
assessment and financial sector
development: The Fund conducted the
assessment in March/April 2011 and
discussed reform options with the
authorities, along with participation of
Bank staff. The Bank has appointed a new
private sector/financial sector coordinator
for Russia, who is stationed in Moscow to
coordinate the work on longer-term
developmental issues in the
private/financial sector. The Bank is also
preparing a new lending project to (a)
achieve an orderly financial market
expansion and development of domestic
capital markets to better serve the needs

4.
The teams agreed the following
division of labor:




Strengthening the fiscal framework: The
Fund has elaborated reform options and
discussed them with the authorities during
the 2011 Article IV consultation. The Bank
is preparing a new lending project for FY13
to strengthen the fiscal regime to
encourage business investment, streamline
the intergovernmental fiscal system, and
increase oversight of financial risks
through policy advice and capacity
building in the Ministry of Finance and the
Federal Tax Service. The Bank is also
monitoring fiscal developments, reforms
and policies as part of its regular Russian
Economic Reports covering
macroeconomic and structural issues. In
addition, the Bank is providing technical
assistance on program budgeting and
public expenditure efficiency.
Public expenditure reforms: The Bank
has elaborated reform options in its Public
Expenditure Review, which were discussed
with the authorities and published in June
2011. The Bank will further explore
cooperation with the authorities in the
areas of improving the business
environment and public administration
reform, including in the regions.

ANNEX III. RUSSIAN FEDERATION: STATISTICAL
ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate
for surveillance. However, in the context of
emerging data demands for assessing external
vulnerabilities, the scope for further data
improvements exists.
Russia is an SDDS subscriber, has a range of
statistical dissemination formats, and reports
data for the Fund’s statistical publications.
These sources inform surveillance.
National Accounts: Data are broadly
adequate for surveillance, but there have been
concerns about the reliability and consistency
of quarterly GDP estimates among a wide
range of users, including Fund staff. This may
point inter alia to lags in the revision schedule
of the various data formats. The Federal State
Statistics Service (Rosstat) started a national
accounts development plan for 2011–17, which
will expedite compilation of quarterly GDP
estimates consistent with annual GDP
estimate. The introduction of methodological
changes in the compilation of important
indicators without releasing backward
revisions of the series on a timely basis also
impaired economic analysis. However, a
historical revision of the industrial production
index was released in July 2010. Consistent
with the new series, a historical revision of the
annual and quarterly GDP series, incorporating
the results of the 2006 agriculture census as
well as methodological improvements, was
made in the third quarter of 2010.
The Rosstat in general follows the 1993 SNA,
although scope exists for methodological

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

improvements in the calculations of volume
measures of the production-based GDP
estimates, including estimates of the output of
financial intermediation services indirectly
measured (FISIM). The imputed rental services
of owner-occupied dwellings are undervalued.
Improvements in the coverage of source data
are constrained by an inadequate response to
business surveys. The unavailability of balance
sheet data continues to be an obstacle for
analyzing balance sheet vulnerabilities.
Price statistics: Data are broadly adequate for
surveillance, but time series analyses involving
detailed CPI components are a challenge to
perform because of limited time series data on
CPI weights. Monthly CPI and PPI, both
compiled using the Two-State (Modified)
Laspeyres (2000=100), cover all regions of the
Russian Federation. In addition to the general
CPI index, Rosstat also publishes indices for
foodstuffs, non-food products, and services.
Since September 2010, the Rosstat has also
published price indices broken down
according to the Classification of Individual
Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP)
on a monthly basis. Detailed CPI weight data
have been made available in the publication
Prices in Russia beginning in 1995 and on the
Rosstat website beginning in 2006. Since 2009,
detailed consumer expenditure data, used as
the basis to develop the CPI weights, are
posted on Rosstat’s website annually. Earlier
data on detailed household expenditures have
been published in the following publications:
Prices in Russia 2004 and Prices in Russia 2006.
Detailed PPI weight data are published on the

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

Rosstat website for 2006–2011; and detailed
data on total annual sales, which are used to
develop weights for the PPI, are also published
by economic activity on the website under the
Entrepreneurship section, industrial subsection.
However, the detailed weights are available
only on the Russian version of the website,
making it less accessible by users. Further
efforts to improve the treatment of seasonal
items in the core inflation index and a new
household budget survey—which has been
under consideration for some time—could
significantly strengthen data quality.
Government finance statistics: For
surveillance purposes, the timeliness and level
of detail of the data disseminated can be
improved. Since July 2010, data on the
economic classification of expenditures are
published on a monthly basis with a lag of
about 1½ months, but problems with
consistent historical data still remain. The data
on functional classification of expenditure and
financing differ from international standards.
Historical data on the maturity structure of
domestic and external federal debt are not
published, except the most recent observation
available through SDDS. Monthly data on the
size and composition of ruble guarantees are
not available prior to 2011. Historical monthly
data on foreign currency debt are not available
prior to 2009, though quarterly data are
available since 2006. In addition, there is no
integrated debt monitoring and reporting
system. Reconciliation of different datasets of
fiscal statistics (budget execution, cash flow
statement, GFSM 2001 format, SDDS) is
difficult. The website where fiscal statistics are
disseminated can be made more user friendly
by consolidating all statistical links in a
dedicated data dissemination page, available
both in Russian and in English, and
supplementing the data with relevant

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

definitions, description of compilation
methodology, and relevant analytical materials.
The authorities are working to address the
recommendations of the 2010 ROSC Data
Module Update.
Monetary statistics: Since July 2008, the
Central Bank of Russia (CBR) provides to the
IMF, in the MFSM-recommended format for
the surveys, summarized data on (i) the Central
Bank Survey, (ii) the Other Depository
Corporations Survey, (iii) the Depository
Corporations Survey, (iv) the Other Financial
Corporation Survey (data cover insurance
companies and private pension funds), and (v)
the Financial Corporations Survey (data cover
the banking system, insurance companies, and
private pension funds). In the context of the
recent financial crisis, analysis of balance sheet
effects has been hindered by a lack of
comparable data on the currency and maturity
breakdown of banking-sector assets and
liabilities. Adoption of data reporting in full
detail of the framework for Standardized
Report Forms (SRFs), as recommended by an
STA mission in 2007, would provide
information on the currency and instrument
breakdowns of the banking sector assets and
liabilities. Starting in July 2010, the CBR
includes in the Surveys the breakdown of
positions by currency.
External sector statistics: While balance of
payments data are broadly adequate for
surveillance, and significant improvements
have been made to enhance data quality, there
remains scope for improving the coverage of
certain components of the current, capital, and
financial accounts. Improving the detail of
supplemental data on the financial account
would facilitate the analysis of relatively
complex flows. The balance of payments is
compiled according to the framework of the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

Fund’s Balance of Payments Manual, fifth
edition (BPM5) and the CBR is actively
implementing the recommendations of the
BPM6. Partial data from a variety of sources
are supplemented by the use of estimates and
adjustments to improve data coverage. In
particular, the CBR makes adjustments to
merchandise import data published by the
Federal Customs Service to account for
“shuttle trade,” smuggling, and undervaluation.
Statistical techniques are also used to estimate
transactions and positions of foreign-owned
enterprises with production sharing
agreements, and these techniques are
continuously being improved. At the same

time, Russian compilers are seeking to
reconcile their data with those of partner
countries. Improvements have been made in
the coverage and quality of surveys on direct
investment, and the CBR is participating in the
Fund’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey.
Headline data on reserves are reported to the
Fund and the markets on a weekly basis with a
four-business-day lag. Comprehensive
information is reported in the Reserves
Template with a lag of 20 days, exceeding
SDDS timeliness requirement of one month.

B. Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) since January 31, 2005. SDDS
flexibility option used for the timeliness of data
on central government operations.
A data ROSC prepared in October 2003 was
published on the IMF website on May 14,
2004. A data ROSC reassessment in June-July
2010 was published on the IMF website on

February 28, 2011 and concluded that Russia’s
macroeconomic statistics are generally of high
quality. It found that compiling agencies have
made significant progress in adopting
international statistical methodologies and
best practices.

C. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Data are being reported for publication in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS),
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, the
Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance of
Payments Statistics Yearbook. Monetary data
reported as the basis for publication in IFS are
in the format of summarized surveys rather

than in the full detail of the SRFs that present
positions by financial instrument
disaggregated by currency (national and
foreign) and the economic sector of
counterparty.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV
Consultation with the Russian Federation

On September, 9, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Russian Federation.1
Background
The Russian economy has improved, but the recovery has been uneven, high commodity
prices notwithstanding. Growth picked up to 4 percent in 2010, intermittently carried by
consumption—supported by large pension hikes—and investment, while the contribution of
net exports turned sharply negative as imports surged. Following strong growth in the
fourth quarter of 2010, fueled by a temporary rebuilding of inventories following a severe
drought in the summer, short-term economic indicators suggest a notable slowdown in the
first half of 2011. Meanwhile, inflation remains stubbornly high, pointing to second-round
effects of last year’s spike in food prices. Unemployment has declined, while real wages
remain volatile. The current account has strengthened aided by high oil prices, but net
capital outflows persist likely owing to political uncertainty in the run-up to the 2012
Presidential elections and the poor business climate.
The financial system is still in a process of balance sheet repair. Banks are liquid and
official data suggest nonperforming loans have come down from a peak of 10 percent
during the crisis to just over 8 percent of loans in April, while profitability has bounced back
from crisis lows. However, banks remain burdened by a high stock of nonperforming assets
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

and this continues to weigh on the outlook for credit growth. Also, remaining weaknesses in
reporting and banking supervision pose risks, as was pertinently illustrated by the discovery
in June 2011 of a large capital deficiency in the Bank of Moscow, which prompted a
$14.2 billion rescue operation.
The large crisis-related fiscal stimulus, much of it in the form of permanent measures, is
being only partially withdrawn. Following a massive fiscal expansion of some 9 percent of
GDP during the crisis, the general government nonoil deficit—the relevant measure of the
fiscal stance in oil exporters, given oil price volatility and the nonrenewable nature of oil
reserves—fell by 1¾ percent of GDP in 2010. This reduction was achieved mainly on
account of the recovering economy and expenditure under-execution. The 2011–13 budget
plans only a modest further reduction in the federal nonoil deficit of some 2¼ percent of
GDP by 2013. Over half of this adjustment stems from an increase in the payroll tax rate
in 2011—which is likely to be partially reversed in 2012—and the remainder from lower
investment and transfers and a reduction in civil service employment, policy plans for which
are still being elaborated. The recently published preliminary 2012–14 budget further
scales down the planned fiscal retrenchment. The budget leaves the nonoil deficit in
double-digits by 2014 and some 5½ percent of GDP above the government’s own longterm target of 4.7 percent of GDP (suspended during the crisis).
With inflation increasing since the summer of 2010, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR)
initiated a policy tightening at the end of the year. Following an initial hike in the CBR’s
overnight deposit rate in December 2010, policy rates were increased more
comprehensively during February-May 2011. In addition, reserve requirements were raised
and differentiated by residency. Meanwhile, the CBR has continued to increase exchange
rate flexibility as the floating band for the ruble was widened and intervention amounts
scaled back.
The short-term outlook is for only moderate growth. Real growth is projected at 4.8 percent
in 2011—compared to over 7 percent during 2000-07—even as the output gap is still
negative and oil prices are high. The muted outlook reflects expectations that the
combination of soaring oil prices and large capital inflows—which, together with procyclical
economic policies, propelled credit and powered the boom in the run-up to the crisis—is
unlikely to return amid political uncertainty, a still fragile banking system, and increased risk
aversion by investors. Inflation is projected to edge down to 8 percent by end-2011,
assuming food prices continue to moderate.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors observed that while Russia’s post-crisis rebound is underway, growth
has been moderate and inflation high. Downside risks have increased against the backdrop
of a worsened external environment. Directors underscored that high commodity prices
create a window of opportunity to embark on bold and decisive reforms to strengthen
growth prospects over the medium term. The focus should be on reducing fiscal
vulnerabilities, lowering inflation, promoting a stronger and more competitive banking
system, and creating a favorable environment for investment and economic diversification.
Directors observed that the 2020 strategy, currently under preparation, provides an
occasion to introduce the reforms to support stronger growth.
Directors encouraged the authorities to undertake a growth-friendly, credible, and
ambitious fiscal consolidation. They recommended re-anchoring fiscal policy on the
long-term nonoil deficit target of 4.7 percent of GDP. This would also help rebuild fiscal
buffers in the oil funds, thereby reducing fiscal vulnerabilities. Directors underscored that
durable adjustment would require fundamental fiscal reforms, including to pensions, social
protection, and healthcare. Most Directors noted that front-loading the consolidation while
strengthening fiscal institutions, would enhance its credibility and help realize growth
benefits sooner, and, in this regard, recommended reconsideration of the 2012–14
preliminary budget.
Most Directors saw a need for a continued tightening of monetary policy this year to bring
inflation down towards a medium-term rate of 3–5 percent. A few Directors, however, saw
merit in a more cautious approach to further tightening given the still negative output gap
and easing food prices. Directors noted that the effectiveness of monetary policy would be
bolstered by improvements to the monetary operations framework and a consistent
communications policy. They welcomed the ongoing steps to enhance exchange rate
flexibility, which will allow monetary policy to focus on inflation and could help dampen
current inflationary pressures.
Directors encouraged the authorities to address remaining gaps in the framework for
financial regulation and supervision to help safeguard the financial system. They supported
the FSAP recommendations to strengthen financial sector policies, including by granting
the CBR greater supervisory powers and adopting the pending legislation on consolidated
supervision and connected lending. Directors noted that effective implementation of these
recommendations would reduce banking sector risks and bring supervision in line with
international best practice.
Directors underscored the importance of improving the business climate to bolster private
investor activity and diversify the economy. They noted that the President’s action plan, if
effectively implemented, would make progress in this direction. At the same time, they
called for broader reforms, including WTO accession, reducing the role of the state in the
economy, and improving governance, to reap the plan’s growth benefits fully.
