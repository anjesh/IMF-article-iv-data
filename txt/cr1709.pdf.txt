IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Estonia

On January 9, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Estonia.
Notwithstanding sound economic and institutional fundamentals, including one of the strongest
public finances in Europe and a business friendly environment, Estonia’s recent growth has been
subdued. Labor productivity and external competitiveness have weakened. Growth in 2016 is
estimated at only 1.3 percent, driven mainly by private consumption on the back of strong wage
growth in a tightening labor market. Exports are gradually recovering, but investment continues
to contract. Import growth is accordingly low, keeping the current account in small surplus.
Inflation rose moderately to around 1 percent.
The economy should gradually strengthen going forward, as the external environment improves
and existing pro-growth policies come to fruition. Growth is projected at 2.3 percent for 2017
and 2.8 percent for 2018, supported by continued robust consumption and higher investment and
exports, as well as planned fiscal stimulus in 2018. Inflation should pick up to 2.5 percent in
2017, reflecting rising energy prices, sizable contributions from excise tax hikes, and a moderate
pickup in underlying price dynamics. The current account should swing into mild deficit as
investment gathers steam and consumption continues to be strong. However, risks to this outlook
are mainly to the downside, including failure of external demand to pick up and continued rapid
wage growth denting competitiveness.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended Estonia for its strong institutions and determined reforms,
which have delivered solid growth and substantial gains in living standards over the past two
decades. Despite a more disappointing recent growth performance, Directors concurred that the
outlook is for a pick-up in growth, as the external environment improves and existing pro-growth
policies come to fruition. Nevertheless, they cautioned that downside risks dominate and
challenges lie ahead. In particular, Directors noted that rapid wage growth in tandem with
stagnant productivity have started to reduce competitiveness. Against this background, they
underscored the need for structural reforms that improve productivity, supported by prudent
fiscal policies, and measures to mitigate financial sector risks.
To address these challenges, Directors recommended enhancing productivity and preserving
competitiveness through a three-pronged approach that focuses on (i) improving the
effectiveness, scale, and take-up of existing pro-growth programs, including by establishing a
dedicated productivity unit; (ii) re-anchoring wage growth in fundamentals, including by
ensuring that increases in public wages and minimum wages do not front-run private-sector wage
growth, as well as by promoting greater female labor force participation and further streamlining
government employment to boost labor supply; and (iii) enhancing competitiveness through tax
reforms.
Directors agreed that Estonia’s strong public finances provide room to support the strengthening
of the supply side of the economy under the above-recommended three-pronged approach, while
preserving strong fiscal institutions. They also supported the planned further increase in public
investment, while stressing the need to ensure high rates of return for both new and existing
projects. Directors welcomed the government’s steps to tackle income inequality, and took note
of the authorities’ intention to reform the income tax system to help achieve distributional
objectives.
Directors concurred that the financial sector is in a strong position and adequately supports the
economy. They cautioned against spillover risks from potential vulnerabilities in Nordic parent
banks, and recommended further mitigating these risks by strengthening cooperation with
home-country and European authorities in a revamped Nordic-Baltic Stability Group.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 21, 2016
Despite solid fundamentals, strong institutions, and a history of impressive output growth,
Estonia’s more recent growth and productivity performance has disappointed, and wage
rises are putting competitiveness at risk. Growth is projected at 1.3 and 2.3 percent for this
year and next. If competitiveness is maintained and policies to boost innovation and labor
supply bear fruit, it could reach some 3 percent in the medium term.

KEY ISSUES
 Effectively addressing low productivity growth and risks to competitiveness
requires a three-pronged approach: (i) making growth promotion more effective
through oversight of programs by a dedicated productivity unit in the Prime Ministry,
better calibrating programs to company’s needs, incentivizing take-up, and scaling-up
selected programs; (ii) re-anchoring wage developments in fundamentals by moderating
government and minimum wage policies and mobilizing additional labor resources for
the private sector, including through faster reduction of government employment; and
(iii) social security contribution cuts to provide relief from pressures on profitability.
 Fiscal policy has primarily been stability oriented, but should do more to
strengthen the economy’s supply side while preserving Estonia’s strong fiscal
institutions. Demand stimulus is not necessary, but Estonia’s extraordinarily strong
public finances should be utilized to finance the three-pronged approach to boosting
productivity detailed above.
 Estonia’s financial sector is sound, though subject to spillover risks from Nordic
parent banks. High capitalization and ample liquidity are formidable lines of defense.
Cross-border crisis preparedness and management should be further strengthened in a
revamped Nordic-Baltic Stability Group.

CONTEXT AND OUTLOOK
A. Context and Recent Developments
1.
Thanks to strong institutions and determined market-oriented reforms, Estonia’s
economic fundamentals remain solid. The business environment is one of the best in the region,
there is no net public debt, and financial soundness indicators are exceptionally strong. The
macroeconomy is broadly in internal and external balance, with labor force participation historically
high, inflation running slightly above 1 percent, and the current account in small surplus. Some
limited economic slack remains, mainly in the export and energy sectors. There is likewise some
room for unemployment to decline further from its current rate of 7.5 percent and for hours worked
per employee to increase.
2.
Economic growth has, however, disappointed in recent years. Since mid-2013, growth has
only marginally exceeded that of the euro area and labor productivity has been flat. During 2015 and
the first three quarters of 2016 income convergence went into reverse. Adverse shocks are partly
responsible, such as the particularly weak external environment,1 an investment hiatus related to the
transition between the 2007–13 and 2014–20 Multiannual Financial Frameworks (MFF) for EU-funds,
and more recently challenges for the oil shale sector from sharply lower global energy prices.2 But
considering the rather long stretch of weak growth, it likely reflects not only adverse shocks, but also
soft underlying dynamics. Private

3.
Inflation is rising moderately, but remains contained amid muted euro area price
dynamics. In November, headline inflation stood at 1.35 percent, compared to an average of
0.7 percent for the first eleven months of the year—a pickup reflecting primarily base effects, excise
tax increases, and some pass-through from higher wages. But with core inflation hovering around
1.5 percent for the past 12 months and pass-through limited by the low inflation environment in
Europe, price pressures remain well contained. The ECB’s monetary policy stance is broadly
appropriate for Estonia. Estonia mainly benefits indirectly through higher growth in the euro area
and hence better export opportunities in its most important market.
1

Since 2013:Q2, trading partner import growth has averaged only 1.2 percent per year, compared to 3.2 percent for
the euro area. The gap has been even larger since 2015:Q1 with 0.1 percent against 3.0 percent.
2

The oil shale sector accounted for some 3 percent of GDP in 2014, through mining, electricity generation, and crude
oil production. Its contraction reduced annual growth by an estimated 0.5 ppts during 2015:Q1–2016:Q2. However,
during 2013:Q3–2016:Q2 the sector performed in line with the rest of the economy, neither subtracting nor adding
to overall growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

4.
Wages are rising rapidly, partly reflecting a tightening labor market. Wage growth
picked up to 7.6 percent in the first 9 months of 2016, from 5.9 percent in 2015, and 5.5 percent in
2014. With employment close to record highs, a tightening labor market is a key driver, but strong
wage growth in the government sector and large minimum wage hikes are also important factors. In
addition, wage growth seems to feed off expectations for a rapid narrowing of the pay gap with
neighboring Finland.
5.
Strong wage growth is eroding competitiveness, but poses no immediate threat to
Estonia’s external position. With productivity stagnating, unit labor costs are sharply up, eroding
Estonian firms’ profit margins and diminishing their ability to compete abroad. Export market shares
have started to slip and resources are shifting toward nontradable sectors, where higher labor costs
are easier to pass through to prices. However, despite subdued export growth, Estonia’s current
account recorded a surplus of 1.7 percent of GDP in the first three quarters of this year—moderately
stronger than consistent with medium-term fundamentals. Imports have been weak in recent years
because of a decline in investment, which is currently some 6 ppts of GDP below its historical
average. The real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 1).
6.
Public finances remain extraordinarily strong and are overperforming this year.
Estonia’s fiscal policy has been firmly stability oriented and subject to a stringent fiscal rule. Gross
public debt stands at only about 10 percent of GDP and is broadly matched by liquid fiscal reserves.
The budget has been in structural surplus since 2009. Estonia’s Stability Program targeted a general
government deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP this year, but so far fiscal outturns have been stronger
than expected, mainly on account of buoyant revenues.
7.
Estonia’s banking sector is sound and adequately supports the economy. Capital
adequacy above 30 percent, liquidity coverage ratios of over 200 percent, and returns-on-assets
running at 2 percent are all well above regulatory minima and readings in peers. Credit and leases to
households and nonfinancial companies are expanding at a rate of some 6 percent, remaining
prudent while providing adequate financing for investment, although companies chose to use much
of the funding to retire foreign debt instead of investing. The loan-to-deposit ratio has been
brought down sharply in recent years, but recently picked up mildly again to 110 percent when one
bank discontinued accepting non-resident deposits. There are no immediate risks to financial
stability, but the largely Nordic-owned banking sector remains subject to potential spillovers from
vulnerabilities in parent banks.
8.
Estonia’s new government has pledged to boost output growth and make it more
inclusive. The coalition government headed by the pro-market Reform Party fell in November when
the junior partners, the Social Democrats and the conservative Pro Patria and Res Publica Union,
switched sides to form a new collation government with the Center Party. This is the first time an
Estonian government has been led by a Prime Minister from the Center Party, ending a 17-year
stretch of Reform Party governments. A coalition agreement sets out the new government’s policy
intentions. In some areas reforms have already been spelled out in specific terms while other issues

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

are addressed only in broad terms, pending further elaboration.3 The new government will retain the
broad policy thrust of its predecessor, but:


try boost growth through (i) corporate income tax reform to lift investment; (ii) additional public
investment of 0.5 percent of GDP in 2018, 2019, and 2020; (iii) raising labor supply by lowering
the personal income tax for low-wage earners; (iv) yet to be specified plans to simplify and lower
taxes and the administrative burden for small enterprises; and (iv) demand stimulus associated
with somewhat looser fiscal policy.



try redress income inequality, primary through a more progressive personal income tax
schedule, as well as moderate increases of child allowances and yet-to-be-specified spending on
social benefits.
Box 1. Estonia: External Stability Assessment
In 2016, the external position was assessed moderately stronger than the level consistent with
medium-term fundamentals. The EBA-lite methodology finds a positive current account gap of 3.8 percent
of GDP, more than half of which reflects current policy settings. Because the rest of the world is running a
significantly looser fiscal policy than its norm, while Estonia is running a somewhat tighter fiscal policy than
its norm, the current account is unusually strong. In addition, there are a number of temporary factors that
boosted Estonia’s external balance in 2016:
(i) investment was some 6 ppts of GDP below its

account surplus is projected to decline to 0.2 percent
of GDP.
Considerable uncertainties surround the exchange rate assessment, but there is no clear indication of
a sizable over- or undervaluation. The EBA-lite methodology estimates an undervaluation of 7.5 percent
based on the unusually strong current account in 2016. But at least half the factors identified above that are
behind this strength should unwind and deteriorate the current account without a need for the exchange
rate to adjust. Moreover, undervaluation is not confirmed by the supplementary direct assessment of the
equilibrium real exchange rate using the EBA-lite REER model, which suggests a small overvaluation of
around 7 percent. On balance, this points to the exchange rate currently being broadly in line with
fundamentals. Nonetheless, the exchange rate could become overvalued over time should the current wage
and productivity trends persist.
Estonia’s net international investment position is improving and compares well with regional peers.
Substantial inward direct investment is chiefly responsible for a position of -37 percent of GDP. At over
90 percent of GDP, gross external debt is high, but concerns about sudden withdrawals are largely mitigated
by much of it being owed to parent companies or parent banks (Country Report No. 10/4, Box 2). Moreover,
Estonia has large external debt claims, including from investment of the fiscal reserve and second-pillar
pension funds abroad. Net external debt is negative, standing at about -12 percent of GDP by endSeptember 2016.

B. Outlook and Risks
9.
The economy should gradually strengthen in the remainder of this year and next.
Growth is projected at 1.3 percent in 2016 and 2.3 percent in 2017, with private consumption
remaining robust and exports and investment befitting from the dissipation of the effects of adverse
shocks. Medium-term growth could settle at around 3 percent despite adverse demographics, but
this would require successfully implementing productivity-promoting policies, unlocking additional
labor supply, and reining in wage growth. These projections imply reinvigorated convergence with
living standards in Western Europe. Inflation is set to rise to 2.5 percent next year, reflecting a large
contribution from further excise tax hikes together with a moderate pickup in underlying price
dynamics. The current account should swing into moderate deficit as investment gathers steam and
consumption continues to be strong.
10.
Risks to the outlook are mainly to the downside. Compared to baseline projections,
economic developments in trading partners are more likely to be weaker rather than stronger, partly
because of political fragmentation risks, which if realized would pull down prospects for Estonia’s
highly open economy. Direct effects from potentially more volatile global financial conditions would
likely be limited, because of Estonia’s low public debt, its small financial markets, and euro area
membership. But spillovers through more exposed Nordic banks cannot be ruled out and would
likely affect credit supply and growth. On the domestic front, there is a risk that productivity growth
fails to pick up and wages continue growing rapidly, undermining competitiveness and pulling
resources into the less dynamic nontradable sector. On the upside, growth and productivity could
rebound more forcefully as adverse shocks run their course and firms make the most of their
existing work force.
Views of the Authorities
11.
The authorities broadly concurred with the outlook and the risk assessment, but put
more emphasis on the role of shocks in depressing growth. The Finance Ministry’s
macroeconomic projections for the 2017 budget is close to those of staff, while the Bank of Estonia’s
December projections revised growth down to a somewhat more pessimistic 1 percent for 2016. The
authorities shared concerns about the disconnect between wage and productivity developments,
although competitiveness effects are difficult to discern so far, perhaps because firms have sufficient
liquidity to satisfy wage demands, and there is no convincing evidence of exchange rate
misalignment. There was agreement that recent disappointing economic performance partly
reflected weak underlying dynamics, but the Bank of Estonia put more emphasis on headwinds from
feeble external demand, especially from Finland, and low energy prices that hit the oil shale sector
hard. Moreover, adverse shocks affected primarily capital intensive sectors, pulling down the
economy’s productivity through composition effects and helping explain simultaneous labor market
tightness and growth weakness. It saw little to no slack in the economy and, to the extent that it
existed, it was in sectors where domestic demand could not unlock it. Accordingly, the ECB’s
monetary policy stance was seen as somewhat on the loose side for Estonia. The new government
expressed concern about the “economic standstill.” Addressing it is a central plank of its program.

High (medium term)
Structurally weak growth in key advanced and emerging economies:
Weak demand, low productivity growth, and persistently low inflation from a

Medium (short to medium term)
Risks to competitiveness from a further tightening of the labor market.

extended period, starting to affect external competitiveness and to shift
resources from the tradable to the nontradable sector.

Risks to vulnerable Nordic parent banks. They could come under pressure
from a decline in domestic housing markets or tighter global financial
conditions with lower risk appetite.

soundness is strong line of defense.

Preserve high capitalization

cooperation with homecountry authorities.

High (short to medium term)
Rise in populism and nationalism in large economies—especially those
with near-term elections—could slow down or even reverse policy
coordination and collaboration; international trade liberalization; financial, and

exacerbating financial market volatility.
Medium (short to medium term)
Protracted uncertainty associated with negotiating post-Brexit
arrangements could weigh on confidence and investment more than
expected—most prominently in the UK and the rest of Europe with possible
knock-on effects elsewhere. Increased barriers could also dampen the longerrun economic performance of affected countries more than expected.
High (short term)
Heightened risk of fragmentation/security dislocation in part of the
Middle East, Africa, and Europe, leading to a sharp rise in migrant flows,
with negative global spillovers.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF
staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below
10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on
the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and
materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The consultation centered on policies to boost productivity and contain wage pressures with a view to
securing sustainable convergence with living standards in Western Europe and to safeguarding
competitiveness. This included exploring the supportive role that fiscal policy could play in this context.
Separately and regarding financial sector issues, the discussions also covered policies to best contain
potential spillovers from vulnerabilities in Nordic parent banks.

Labor productivity growth has been worryingly weak in the past three years. It has
stagnated since mid-2013 and turned negative more recently, lagging the performance in regional
peers. Poor total factor productivity growth is chiefly responsible—growth contributions of

Estonia’s policy settings are already conducive to productivity growth, but could
nonetheless be optimized further. Predictable and stability-oriented policies are important assets.
The business environment is ranked the best in Central and Eastern Europe, although there remain a
few issues that should be addressed.4 This leaves three main areas for further policy action:


Making existing growth-promoting programs more efficient. Estonia has a large number of
programs in place, but the outcomes appear not to be commensurate with the scale of the

Estonia is the highest ranked country in Central and Eastern Europe in the World Bank’s Doing Business Report
(rank 16 out of 189 countries) and the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index (rank 30 out of 140
countries). Areas for further optimization include: (i) shortening bankruptcy procedures and increasing recoveries;
(ii) strengthening the position of minority shareholders; (iii) reducing exclusive rights for accountants and engineers;
(iv) allowing non-residents to invest in law firms and registering ships; (v) updating the Labor Code to allow modern
forms of employment, such a job sharing; (vi) better connecting transportation modes; (vii) raising weight limits for
timber trucks; and (viii) streamlining environmental inspections.

efforts expended. A productivity unit housed at the highest executive level in the Prime Ministry
should be established to oversee and guide these programs in a coherent and comprehensive
manner. A report on growth commissioned by the previous Prime Minister was a positive step.


Filling gaps and selectively scaling-up growth promotion. There are numerous entities that
offer innovation support, including competence centers, university technology transfer centers,
science parks, and regional competence centers, but take-up by Estonian firms remains limited.
Similarly, commendable offers for re-education and training of adults in the context of Estonia’s
life-long learning strategy have still to attract more applicants. This may suggest a mismatch with
companies’ needs and insufficient demand incentives. Program design needs to take fully into
account that traditional firms still dominate the economy, despite a sizable ICT sector, and are
responsible for the bulk of productivity growth and employment.5 Take-up incentives could be
strengthened through an expanded voucher program that allows the purchase of more
application-oriented services from a wider range of suppliers. The new Company Development
Program is a welcome initiative and should be scaled up. Active labor market programs also
remain too small with spending of only 0.2 percent of GDP.



Restoring high public investment. Estonia’s public investment has traditionally been among
the highest in Europe, but has come down in recent years. Its envisaged reinvigoration in the
2017 budget and medium-term fiscal plans is welcome and should help fill remaining
infrastructure gaps, provided that it is geared toward projects with high economic returns.

14.
Despite stagnant productivity, wages have been growing rapidly in recent years, which
is starting to undermine competitiveness. Since 2011, labor compensation has risen by 5.6 percent
annually, pushing up nominal unit labor costs by 3.1 percent per year for the whole economy and by
5.1 percent in manufacturing. In contrast, unit labor costs were essentially flat in Central and Eastern
Europe and the EU (Box 3). At the same time, export market shares have started to slip, profit
margins are falling and economic resources are reallocating toward nontradable activities. So far, the
current account has remained strong though, because declining investment has helped hold down
import growth and because terms-of-trade have moved in Estonia’s favor.

Box 2. Characteristics of Productivity Growth at the Firm Level1
Productivity growth has slowed significantly since 2005, despite a sizeable productivity gap with Western
Europe. Labor productivity registered only a modest increase according to macroeconomic data. Similarly, firmlevel data point toward disappointing labor productivity and total factor productivity developments. Like in most
countries, productivity growth slowed markedly following the 2008/09 crisis, but the extent of it in Estonia is
surprising, considering the still very sizeable productivity gap of over 50 percent with Western Europe.
Exploring sectoral and firm-level data offers important clues about what drives aggregate productivity, as
well as associated employment trends. Sectoral data help disentangle within-sector productivity developments
from what is due to shifts between sectors with different productivity levels. The sectoral makeup of the Estonian
economy changed significantly over the past decade, but this composition effect was nonetheless quantitatively of
little importance for aggregate productivity developments. Analysis of firm-level data reveal which firm attributes,
such as size, age, export-orientation, or high technology, are conducive to productivity growth. One can also
explore the implications of these same attributes for employment generation.
Catching-up in the more traditional sectors accounted for
the bulk of aggregate productivity gains. Low initial
productivity and unfavorable performance metrics were key
characteristics of firms with strong subsequent productivity
growth. It was not the high-technology sectors that
registered particularly large productivity gains, but rather the
more traditional sectors within manufacturing and
agriculture. The role of firm age changed over time—younger
firms no longer posted superior productivity growth after
2009. This may be an indication of reduced economic
dynamism.

Firms that witnessed greater productivity gains were
more labor intensive and had lower average labor costs. Firms that increased productivity the most had lower
assets per employee, and higher labor cost shares than firms that increased productivity the least. The labor costs
per worker—a proxy for workers’ skill levels—was lower for firms belonging to the high productivity growth group,
suggesting that firms that did well relied more on lower-skilled labor.
Sources: Orbis; and IMF staff calculations.

High productivity gains were associated with low
employment reduction growth. Firms with relatively higher
productivity growth tended to feature relatively lower
employment growth—an association also visible in other
countries but particularly strong in Estonia. This can be seen
by looking at the elasticity of labor productivity with respect
to the employment-share elasticity, calculated from sectoral
data provided by Eurostat for Estonia and Western Europe.
These elasticities are larger for Estonia. In line with the above
findings, they are particularly large in the more traditional
sectors.

Box 3. Developments of Unit Labor Costs and Implications for Competitiveness1
Unit labor costs (ULCs) are a key indicator for assessing developments in external price competitiveness.
Defined as the ratio of labor compensation per employee and real output per employed person, they are identical
to real effective exchange rates when compared to ULCs in trading partners and expressed in a common currency.
The concept has its shortcomings, primarily because of its crude measurement of productivity. Empirically,
catching-up economies often feature faster ULC growth without losing competitiveness and the association
between ULC and export developments is not straightforward to establish. Therefore, supplementary indicators
need to be invoked. Powerful ones include: (i) real ULCs, which relate labor compensation to nominal productivity
and resemble the labor share of income; (ii) export market shares; and (iii) exporters’ profitability.

It is mainly developments in wages rather than productivity that set Estonia apart from the rest of CEE.
Labor productivity growth has been somewhat weaker than in CEE, but wage developments have diverged much
more. They accounted for two-thirds of the difference in ULC growth since mid-2013.
Strong wage growth reflects labor market tightness, but is further fueled by wage policies and momentum.
Empirically, wage developments are closely linked to economic growth and the business cycle. But public sector
and minimum wages also play a role, contributing one percentage point each to annual wage growth in Estonia in
the past three years. Contrary to popular perception, Estonia’s unfavorable demographics do not emerge as an
important wage-push factor. Wages by sector of economic activity seem rather unrelated to sectors’ performance
or sectors’ vacancy rates, suggesting that labor market tightness is far from the only reason why wages grow so
rapidly in Estonia.

15.
Efforts to contain wage growth need to complement measures to raise productivity.
The current divergence between labor cost and productivity developments is unsustainable. Cooling
wage growth requires both measures to address genuine labor market tightness by enhancing labor
supply and measures to address wage dynamics where they are detaching from fundamentals. There
are three levers to directly influence wage growth:


Government wages. Government wage policies have strong direct bearing on the average
wage in the economy as sectors that are dominated by government employment account for
almost a quarter of employment.6 They spill over to private-sector wages, because the average
wage is a “household number” in Estonia serving as a key reference point for all wage
agreements. Wages in the general government have been front-running general wage
developments in the last few years with raises of 9 percent in 2013 and 8 percent in 2014 and
2015 each. This was partly deliberate policy as pay for certain occupational groups was seen as
in need of catching up. It also reflects Estonia’s newly decentralized expenditure allocation
system whereby government entities are given autonomy to raise wages at the expense of
employment or sometimes even other current expenditure. Moreover, in some subsectors, such
as health care, government is inadequately represented in wage negotiations. Going forward,
the government should phase in relative raises for specific occupational groups more slowly and
balance the effect on average government wages through lower increases for the rest of the
government sector. Wage decentralization should be accompanied by strict performance targets
for government entities, overall spending envelopes that anticipate efficiency gains, and
safeguards that ensure equal pay for equal work across the general government. Government
representation in wage negotiations should also be strengthened as needed.



Minimum wages. They are primarily determined in negotiations between social partners, but
government representatives are present, minimum wage agreements are given legal force by
government decree, and minimum wages feature in parties’ political platforms. Minimum wages
have risen by 10 percent each year since 2013 and a further 10 percent increase has already
been agreed for 2017. Even though only a small fraction of workers earns the minimum wage in
Estonia, there are important knock-on effects for other wages that help fuel general wage
dynamics. The government should exert its influence to cool minimum wage growth. A formal
role for independent experts in minimum wage formation could also be useful.



Communication. Wage growth in Estonia seems to go much beyond what can be explained by
labor market tightness alone. Effective government and Central Bank communication to the
public on the risks of unmitigated wage growth when productivity stagnates could help break
this momentum.

16.
Efforts to boost labor supply are key to addressing genuine labor market tightness.
With unemployment low by historical standards, employment at record highs, and the labor force
declining for demographic reasons, there are genuine wage pressures. Mobilizing additional labor

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

supply for the private sector and making the most of existing labor resources are the main avenues
to alleviate them. Possible measures include:


Reducing general government employment.
Employment in sectors dominated by the
government is higher than in Central and
Eastern Europe, as well as in Western Europe
when social work activities are excluded. While
a commendable policy to cut government
employment in line with the declining labor
force is in place, there seems to be room for a
faster reduction that would free up labor
resources for the private sector.7

actually below the EU average. The design of parental leave, which is for 3 years with 18 months
at full pay, may play a role. The recent reform that allows parents returning to work earlier to
keep at least half the benefits they would otherwise be entitled to goes a long way toward
reducing disincentives to work, but it will be important to monitor the results with a view to
identifying other impediments, such as the unavailability of child care facilities, or to improving
the design of parental benefits further.



Reforming the disability system. The authorities are rolling out their commendable “Work
Ability Reform.” It will strengthen assessment of the capacity to work, step up activation
measures, tie the receipt of benefits to the use of activation measures, compensate employers
for workplace adjustment costs, and subsidize social security contributions for those with partial
work capacity. The authorities expect the reform to raise employment by around 1.5 percent by
2018.



Allowing more immigration from outside the EU. It is currently capped at only 0.1 percent of
the population and immigrants must be paid at least 1.24 times the average wage.

17.
Social security contribution cuts would provide useful relief from competitiveness
pressures. With social security contributions paid by employers, cuts would initially help counteract
pressures from wages on profits. In the longer run and as wage contracts are renegotiated, the

benefits would be shared by employers and employees. The previous government had embarked on
a program to reduce social security contribution rates by 0.5 ppts annually in 2016, 2017, and 2018,
which should be accelerated, but the new government reversed course and plans to leave rates
unchanged.
Views of the Authorities
18.
The authorities shared the concerns about stagnant productivity and agreed on the
need to boost labor supply. While composition effects may have dragged down labor productivity,
underlying dynamics have also been weak and the low take-up of innovation promotion programs is
an issue. The new government has not yet formed a view on the establishment of a productivity unit
in the Prime Ministry or how to make innovation programs more effective, but plans a number of
steps to boost growth: (i) a cut in corporate income taxes; (ii) reduced taxes and minimal red tape
for small companies and startups; and (iii) additional public investment worth 0.5 percent of GDP
from 2018 onward over and above the increase envisaged by the previous government. The
authorities underscored their determination to keep the government sector lean, targeting a yearly
staff reduction of 0.7 percent, which has been overachieved in the past 12 months. They will follow
up on staff’s finding regarding the size of government. The reform of the disability pension system
should make more labor resources available. The planned lowering of the personal income tax for
low-wage earners may also boost labor supply.
19.
On wages, the authorities are keenly aware of their rapid rise, but see little scope for
the government to influence them directly. Wage growth looks worrisome and needs close
monitoring, but it may partly be a natural byproduct of an economy advancing out of labor
intensive activities. Company closures have been rare so far, and, where they happened, displaced
workers mostly secured other jobs with relative ease. The authorities maintained that minimum
wages are outside the government’s control. They agreed in principle that the government should
not front-run general wage developments, but underscored their determination to bring pay for
teachers to 120 percent of average wages by 2019 and noted that labor turnover in the government
sector has become very high. Wage decentralization was designed to incentivize efficiency gains in
government entities.
20.
The authorities were skeptical about social security contribution cuts. While they
conceded that the proposal has some logic, the new government has opted to direct fiscal resources
to lowering personal income taxes instead. Both approaches would reduce Estonia’s still relatively
high labor tax wedge, but the planned personal income tax cut also helps address income inequality.

B. Putting Fiscal Policy at Fuller Service to the Economy
21.
Public finances are likely to record a surplus in 2016. Considering the good performance
during the first nine months of this year and the revenue-friendly growth composition with strong
wage and consumption growth, a surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP is likely, corresponding to a
structural surplus of 1.5 percent of GDP. An additional contributing factor is the low execution rate
of investment, due to delays in unlocking EU funds from the 2014–20 MFF.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

22.
The 2017 draft budget targets a small headline deficit and a structural surplus, but
better results are likely. It was largely prepared by the previous government with only limited and
budget neutral changes added by the new administration. Public investment is to rise from
4.2 percent to 4.9 percent of GDP, especially at the local government level and as EU-funds from the
2014–20 MFF are coming fully on stream. Excise tax hikes finance higher family benefits, a moderate
increase of the basic income tax allowance, and higher agricultural subsidies. Previously planned
social security contribution rate cuts, diesel excise hikes, and increases in the VAT for accommodation
services will not go ahead, which is broadly revenue neutral overall. According to the Ministry of
Finance, the fiscal balance will deteriorate to a deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP, corresponding to a
structural surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP. However, revenue projections are on the conservative side
and higher-than-budgeted revenues in 2016 will carry over into next year. In staff’s view, a headline
surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP and a structural surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP are more likely. This
corresponds to a small and unproblematic fiscal stimulus, especially as much of the reduction of the
structural surplus reflects higher investment, which has a high import content.
23.
The new government plans to implement more far-reaching fiscal policy changes from
2018 onward. They comprise a variety of initiatives:


Tax policy. Under the corporate income tax firms will have the new option to avail themselves
of a reduced rate of 14 percent (instead of 20 percent) if they regularly distribute dividends.
Corporate investors will be better off, but any benefit for domestic household investors will be
offset by an additional 6 ppts tax on dividend income under the personal income tax. For the
personal income tax, the reform plan is to more than double the basic allowance to €500 per
month, bringing it to about 45 percent of the average wage in Estonia. At the same time, the
allowance will become income dependent, phasing out with rising incomes. These changes to
the personal income tax are likely to cost over 1 percent of GDP. There are also plans to
introduce an excise on sugared beverages, a motor vehicle registration levy, a yet-to-bespecified small tax on the financial sector, additional excises on alcohol, etc. Funds of 0.1 percent
of GDP for sectoral tax cuts to improve competitiveness have also been set aside.



Expenditure policy. Investment equivalent to 0.5 percent of GDP will be added to previous
plans each year during 2018–20, with some projects already specified. Funds of about
0.4 percent are reserved for yet to be specified measures, including improving social benefits.
Additional support for local governments and local transport will cost another 0.1 percent of
GDP each.



Fiscal framework. Estonia’s current fiscal rule mandates public finances to be at least in
structural balance every year. Unforeseen deficits need to be compensated with subsequent
surpluses, while unforeseen surpluses are not allowed to be credited against subsequent deficits.
The new government intends to remove this asymmetry, subject to a ceiling of 0.5 percent of
GDP on structural deficits. Financing deficits by issuing bonds in financial markets is also under
consideration, which Estonia has eschewed for over a decade.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

These plans imply a considerable fiscal impulse of almost 1 percent of GDP in 2018 and a structural
deficit of about 0.2 percent of GDP. On current projections, there is no need for such a large
stimulus in 2018 because economic slack is located in sectors where it would not be reached. The
stimulus associated with the reform of the personal income tax should be reduced or at least spread
out over several years by gradual implementation, while preserving its welcome redistributive
properties. Instead, fiscal space should be reserved for measures that strengthen the supply side of
the economy without much affecting domestic demand. The following package should be
considered: (i) a one percentage point cut in social security contributions; (ii) a 50 percent increase
in ALMP spending; (iii) a tripling of outlays for the innovation voucher program; and (iv) a doubling
of the Company Development Program. It would cost about 0.6 percent of GDP, which could be
accommodated by redesigning the personal income tax reform to make it less costly.
24.
More generally, Estonia’s successful fiscal institutions should be preserved. They have
served the country well, underwriting one of the strongest public finances in Europe, keeping the tax
system simple, low-rate, and predictable, and securing high public investment. There is substantial
fiscal space and more of it could be accessed through the welcome envisaged modification of the
fiscal rule, while still preserving a high degree of fiscal prudence. But it will be important to ensure
that fiscal space is put to good use, i.e. that it strengthens the economy’s supply side and that
existing spending programs are efficient.
Views of the Authorities
25.
The government underscored its commitment to fiscal policies in support of broadlyshared growth, but the Bank of Estonia also saw risks of counterproductive fiscal stimulus and
weakening fiscal discipline. There was agreement that fiscal policy should help promote
productivity growth and investment. Corporate income tax reform and better conditions for smaller
firms and startups are important in this regard. Making the personal income tax more progressive
while preserving the standard flat rate of 20 percent takes precedence over social security
contribution cuts. The Ministry of Finance saw the associated demand stimulus as an additional
boon, but the Bank of Estonia expressed concern about untimely fiscal stimulus, further fueling
already high wage and consumption growth. In addition, the envisaged modification of the fiscal
rule could lead to persistent fiscal deficits given the practical difficulties of estimating structural fiscal
deficits in real time, thereby risking to undermine fiscal discipline.

C. Further Bolstering Financial Sector Resilience
26.
Efforts to address potential spillovers from vulnerabilities in Nordic parent banks
should be stepped up further. Subsidiaries are strongly capitalized and liquidity coverage is high
thanks to both sizable central bank deposits and parent bank funding at reasonably long maturities.
In addition to these formidable lines of defense, cross-border crisis preparedness and management
should be further strengthened in a revamped Nordic-Baltic Stability Group that also comprises ECB
supervisors. MoUs should be concluded by all involved agencies on pertinent issues in areas of their
respective mandates. Conducting cross-border crisis simulation exercises would also be helpful.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

Recovery and resolution plans that recognize the systemic importance of the subsidiaries in Estonia
should be finalized expeditiously.
27.
Locally owned banks are losing established correspondent banking relationships, but
alternative providers have already been lined up. The one remaining western correspondent
bank is retreating from Estonia, putting locally-owned banks at risk of losing access to dollar
clearing. Alternative providers based in China and Russia have been lined up, but it will be important
that these new relationships are stable and that strict AML/CTF standards are in place.
28.
The planned establishment of a pan-Baltic bank requires vigilance. Earlier this year, DNB
and Nordea announced their intention to merge their Baltic businesses in a joint venture. The new
bank would be domiciled in Estonia and operate branches in Latvia and Lithuania. It would be the
largest bank in Estonia—and as such fall under direct ECB supervision—and increase the size of the
banking system by about one third. While the establishment of the new entity will take time,
relevant permissions and approvals are being sought in the nearer term. In this context it will be
important to ensure that the new entity will be comfortably capitalized and that existing parent bank
funding is either retained or replaced by other equally reliable arrangements.
Views of the Authorities
29.
The authorities assess the near-term risks to the financial sector in Estonia as small.
They put risks associated with Nordic parent banks at a 4 on a 1-to-6 scale and concur that solid
capitalization, high liquidity, and home-host cooperation are key to reducing spillovers. They look
forward to the revitalization of the Nordic-Baltic Stability Group to be kicked off at the forthcoming
meeting under Swedish chairmanship, including progress on a new MoU. Regarding correspondent
banking relationships, the authorities noted that the issue was less critical than in many other small
jurisdictions, because subsidiaries have access to dollar clearing through their parents and all banks
have access to euro clearing. But they agreed that stability in the new relations is important and
noted that all new correspondents were top-tier banks. As far as the DNB-Nordea joint venture is
concerned, the authorities were confident that parent funding would continue. They also noted that
Estonia’s Deposit Guarantee Fund is adequately positioned to take over coverage of the additional
deposits. The authorities are keen to see bank recovery and resolution plans with due attention to
the Estonian subsidiaries finalized expeditiously.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Strong institutions and determined reforms have delivered solid growth over the long
run, but more recent performance has disappointed. Gains in living standards have been among
the largest in the region over the past two decades on the back of a business friendly environment,
steady policies, and prudent macroeconomic management. However, since mid-2013 GDP has
expanded by only 1.8 percent annually and labor productivity has stagnated. While negative shocks
played a role, these developments also speak to weaker underlying dynamics. As the external
environment improves and existing pro-growth policies come to fruition, growth should pick up

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

from 1.3 percent this year to 2.3 percent in 2017 and around 3 percent in the medium term, but this
acceleration cannot be taken for granted and downside risks dominate.
31.
Rapid wage growth in an environment of stagnant labor productivity adds another
layer of concern. Wage growth keeps increasing, reaching 7.6 percent so far this year. The
diverging paths of wages and labor productivity are unsustainable and are already denting
competitiveness. Profit rates are falling and are below their long-term average. Export market shares
have started to slip.
32.

A three-pronged policy approach is needed to address these challenges.



Making pro-growth programs more effective. A commendable set of programs is already in
place, but outcomes could be improved by establishing a dedicated productivity unit in the
Prime Ministry for coherent and comprehensive guidance and oversight. There is also scope to
scale up certain programs, such as ALMPs and the Company Development Program, and
improve the take-up of innovation promotion and educational programs by better matching
them to companies’ needs and by providing additional financial incentives.



Re-anchoring wage growth in fundamentals. Policies can contribute to this goal by ensuring
that increases in public wages and in the minimum wage do not consistently outpace private
sector wage raises. Leaning against the demographic decline of labor supply by releasing labor
resources from the relatively large government sector faster, allowing more immigration, and
boosting female participation rates would also be helpful.



Alleviating pressures on competitiveness. Previous plans to cut social security contributions
should be retained and accelerated to provide valuable breathing space for profits that are
under pressure from rapidly rising wage costs. Over time, these benefits would be shared by
labor and firms as wages adjust.

33.
Public finances are in excellent shape with room to support the three-pronged policy
approach while preserving Estonia’s strong fiscal institutions. Net of liquid reserves,
government debt is close to zero and the budget has been in structural surplus since 2009. There is
no convincing case for general demand stimulus because economic slack is mainly in the export and
energy sectors, which are beyond the reach of conventional fiscal policy. Instead, fiscal space should
be used judiciously to strengthen the economy’s supply side and finance the measures under the
three-pronged approach, subject to the private sector’s ability to usefully absorb them and the
public sector’s ability to efficiently provide them. Public investment should also be lifted while
ensuring high rates of return. Steps to tackle Estonia’s high degree of income inequality are
welcome but should be redesigned so as to achieve distributional objectives at lower costs.
34.
Estonia’s financial sector is strong and supports the economy, but spillover risks from
Nordic parent banks could be further mitigated. Indicators of capitalization, liquidity, asset
quality, and profitability are all impressive. The return to measured credit growth of some 6 percent
currently is welcome. The financial sector remains subject to spillover risks from vulnerabilities in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

Nordic parent banks. Those could be further mitigated by strengthening cooperation with homecountry and European authorities in the Nordic-Baltic Stability Group and expeditiously finalizing
recovery and resolution plans for cross-border banking groups that fully recognize the systemic
nature of their Estonian subsidiaries.
35.
It is recommended that Estonia remain on the 12-month consultation cycle, with the
next Article IV consultation anticipated to be held in early 2018, after Estonia's EU presidency
in the second half of 2017.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Article IV Consultation: Estonia is on the 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation
was concluded on December 14, 2015 on a LOT basis.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs: A review under the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was
completed at the time of the 2000 Article IV Consultation. Further Reports on Observance of Standards
and Codes (ROSC) modules were discussed in the 2001 Article IV Consultations and updated during
the 2002 Consultation. A FAD mission concluded a fiscal transparency ROSC in January 2009 and an
FSAP update was completed in February 2009.
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT): MONEYVAL’s report
on the 4th round assessment of Estonia adopted in September 2014, which is a follow-up round on the
2003 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standard, highlighted the authorities’ progress in
strengthening the AML/CFT legal and supervisory frameworks, specifically development of a risk-based
approach to determine priorities for AML/CFT activities, amendments to the financing of terrorism
offence, and the establishment of the Economic Crime Bureau. The report notes some remaining
deficiencies, in particular with respect to the sanctioning regime for AML/CFT breaches and the
beneficial ownership identification of legal persons. The authorities are addressing these issues,
including by preparing amendments to the penal code to allow for “administrative sanctions.” They are
also working on ensuring compatibility of the widespread use of information technology and AML/CFT
requirements. Regulation has been issued with respect to the e-Residency program, namely with
regards to customers’ identification for non-face-to-face opening of bank accounts. As the e-residency
program is in its early stages, it will be important to follow up on appropriate safeguards that should
be put in place to ensure integrity of the program and limit the potential for abuse. Estonia issued its
first regular follow-up report to MONEYVAL in September 2016 and was invited to seek removal from
the follow-up process not later than September 2018.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
General: Estonia’s data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes. A May 2001
data ROSC mission found that the quality of macroeconomic statistics was generally good. The 2009
fiscal transparency ROSC indicated that Estonia now meets nearly all of the requirements of the
transparency code, and approached best international practice in some areas. Estonia subscribed to
the SDDS on September 30, 1998, with metadata posted on the DSSB on January 27, 1999, and met
SDDS specifications on March 30, 2000. The latest (2010) annual observance report for Estonia for
the SDDS was posted on the Fund’s website in May 2011:
(http://dsbb.imf.org/images/pdfs/AnnualReports/2010/EST_SDDS_AR2010.pdf)
SDDS webpage for EST: http://dsbb.imf.org/Pages/SDDS/CtyCtgList.aspx?ctycode=EST
National Accounts: The national accounts are compiled by Statistics Estonia (SE) in accordance with
the guidelines of the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010). Quarterly GDP estimates at
current and at constant prices are compiled using the production, income and expenditure
approaches. The annual and the quarterly national accounts are compiled at previous year prices
and chain-linked to 2010, using double deflation. As of September 2011, data are compiled on the
basis of the new version of classification of activities EMTAK 2008.
However, there is room to improve the quality of national account statistics. Early releases are often
subject to large subsequent revisions, statistical discrepancies between headline GDP and its
expenditure components tend to be sizable, and indirect taxes minus subsidies in the production
accounts sometimes make implausibly large growth contributions. All this complicates economic
analysis.
The authorities plan to address these issues by implementing a number of methodological upgrades
suggested by the 2016 Article IV Consultation mission. These include: (i) more timely compilation of
supply-and-use tables; (ii) use of volume indexes as the primary source for all real indirect taxes
minus subsidies rather than partly deriving them by deflating nominal values; (iii) relying more on
direct measures of volumes in estimating real gross value added generated by real estate activities;
(iv) carrying forward input-output ratios in volume terms rather than in value terms when calculating
value added by economic activity for non-financial corporations; and (v) integrating the estimation
of gross fixed capital formation with the production and imports of capital goods and services. The
authorities are working toward implementation in time for submitting revised national accounts
statistics to Eurostat by September 2017.
Public Finance: Fiscal data are published by the Ministry of Finance (MoF), while historical data are
also available on Statistics Estonia’s website. Monthly central government data are disseminated
with a lag of up to 25 days after the end of the month. This data provides detailed revenue
breakdown, but expenditure breakdown is not available. Quarterly data on foreign loans and
guarantees by the central government are published in Estonian with a monthly lag. The Ministry is
using one of its two allowed SDDS flexibility options on the timeliness of monthly central
government operations data, and disseminate these data on the National Summary Data page.
Comprehensive annual data on central and general government operations (accrual basis) are

4

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

compiled according to the ESA2010 methodology. They are also reported in the GFS Yearbook.
These data include a statement of operations and the government balance sheet, including data on
financial assets and liabilities, both domestic and foreign. Quarterly data for the general government
are included in the International Finance Statistics.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The Bank of Estonia (BoE) compiles and reports monetary and
financial statistics consistent with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. Aggregate
financial data are compiled by the BoE and reported on a monthly basis. The majority of statistics
are disseminated on the Bank of Estonia’s webpage on the 17th banking day after the end of the
reporting period. Data for individual banks are also available on a quarterly basis since 2008Q1 on
the Financial Supervision Authority’s webpage. Estonia also regularly provides requested Financial
Soundness Indicators.
External Sector: Quarterly balance of payments, external debt, and international investment
position (IIP) data are compiled by the BoE consistent with the Balance of Payments Manual sixth
edition (BMP6). Daily exchange rate data are available with a one working day lag. Monthly
import/export data are available with a two-month lag. The Data Template on International Reserves
and Foreign Currency Liquidity is disseminated monthly according to the operational guidelines and
is hyperlinked to the Fund’s DSBB.
Dissemination of Statistics: The Estonian authorities disseminate a range of economic statistics,
with a significant amount of data are available on the Internet:


metadata for data categories defined by the Special Data Dissemination Standard are posted on
the IMF’s DSBB (http://dsbb.imf.org);



the Bank of Estonia website (http://www.eestipank.info/frontpage/en/) provides data on
monetary statistics, balance of payments, IIP, external debt and other main economic indicators;



the Statistics Estonia website (http://www.stat.ee/en) provides information on economic and
social development indicators;



the Ministry of Finance homepage (http://www.fin.ee/?lang=ee) includes information on the
government’s annual multi-year State Budget Strategy, as well as information and data on the
national budget, and government finance statistics (deficit, debt, financial assets).

Republic of Estonia: Table of Common Indicators Required for Surveillance
As of October 31, 2016

Statement by Thomas Ostros, Executive Director for the Republic of Estonia
and Eve Anni, Alternate Executive Director
January 9, 2017

On behalf of the Estonian authorities, we would like to thank staff for the comprehensive and
constructive policy discussions in Tallinn during the Article IV consultations as well as for
the insightful set of reports. The authorities broadly agree with staff’s assessment and
appreciate the policy recommendations.
Recent macroeconomic developments and outlook
Estonia’s real GDP growth remains around 1 percent in 2016 after having lost the momentum
in recent years. Robust private consumption, supported by rapidly rising real wages, has been
the main driver of growth, while weak external demand and uncertainty about trade prospects
have been a drag on exports and investment. The primary dampeners on economic growth in
2016 were oil shale and energy sectors that suffered from the low oil price. However, recent
data indicates a turning point with manufacturing growth picking up as the oil shale sector’s
negative effect dissipates and exports recover.
Going forward, economic growth is forecast to gather pace as exports and investment
strengthen. In particular, public sector investment is expected to contribute significantly as
the EU structural funds under the new allocation period are absorbed. Domestic demand,
being supported partly by favorable monetary environment, will remain the main driver of
growth, however, external demand and corporate investment will strengthen gradually and
exports will play a more important role.
The authorities share the view that a sustained acceleration in growth requires a solid pick up
in productivity. Productivity gains are considered critical in order to avoid growth falling
behind the projected trajectory, particularly given that the growth contribution of increased
employment becomes exhausted. While there is some room to increase labor productivity
through lifting average hours worked, the decline in corporate investments in recent years has
probably reduced growth potential for the economy. The authorities concur with the staff
assessment that it is essential to increase productive investments. Estonia’s recently
appointed new government envisages further simplifications of business regulation for
SMEs, reductions in corporate tax rates for intercompany dividends in order to stimulate
investments, and improvements in the regulative and tax environment for high growth
potential sectors in order to enhance competitiveness. The government has renewed the
commitment to achieve the 1 percent of GDP level of public R&D expenditures and seeks to
further encourage the business start-up rate. The authorities also agree with staff that
strengthening the oversight of government programs for enhancing competitiveness is
beneficial for ensuring their effective implementation. Staff’s advice on setting up a separate
productivity unit within the Prime Minister’s Office, following examples of best practices
from around the world, is already being considered.

2
The authorities agree that risks to the growth outlook are skewed to the downside. Estonia’s
small and very open economy is particularly vulnerable to the external environment,
including political risks in Europe, and weaker economic prospects for its main trading
partners could further delay a rebound in growth. Domestically, it is primarily the labor
market developments that could dampen prospects for productivity growth and erode
competitiveness and the authorities will monitor labor market developments particularly
closely.
Labor market developments
The labor market participation rate in Estonia has reached historically high levels, partly as a
result of higher wages, which have motivated more active labor market participation of the
working age population. Additionally, measures like raising the official retirement age and
more specifically, the phasing in of the Work Ability Reform aimed at reviewing the
assessment of capacity to work within the disability pension system, should unlock resources
for lower paid sectors. After a long lasting decline, 2016 was the first year when the
population of Estonia increased. Nevertheless, total employment is likely to shrink due to
demographics, keeping the labor market tight and a continuous upward pressure on wages.
The rapid wage increase, which has been consistently above productivity growth in recent
years, is a concern and the authorities agree that the divergence between labor costs and
productivity developments is unsustainable. Although the latest data indicates moderation in
the growth of labor costs, the associated risks to competitiveness persist. While wage
negotiations in Estonia are outside the authorities’ direct control, the government
acknowledges that public sector should not front-run general wage dynamics and future
developments in this area will be closely monitored.
Fiscal policy
Estonia’s fiscal rules and actual outcomes have been fully compliant with the requirements of
the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact. Estonia’s gross public debt is currently at around 10
percent of GDP and net debt is close to zero due to sizable liquid reserves. The budget has
been in surplus from 2014 onwards. In 2016, the nominal budgetary position of the general
government will reach a surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP as revenues exceeded expectations
while the execution rate of investments was lower than anticipated.
The new coalition government will introduce changes to fiscal and tax policies but has
confirmed a commitment to preserving a sound and sustainable fiscal policy while
maintaining a structurally balanced budget in the medium term. The fiscal rule will be made
more symmetric by allowing structural surpluses of previous years to be followed by
structural deficits, which cannot exceed 0.5 percent of GDP. To promote long-term economic
growth, the government foresees stepping up public investments into infrastructure and
information technology. The government envisages fully or partly privatizing a number of
state owned enterprises. A significant change will be introduced to the personal income tax
system by lowering the tax wedge for lower and middle income earners. The corporate
income tax rate on regular dividend payments will be reduced to 14 percent and adjustments

3
are going to be made to the excise tax system. The cuts to social security contributions
planned by the previous government are not going to be implemented. However, labor tax
alleviations or tax credits for rapidly growing and start-up companies together with the
indirect effect of raising the tax free personal income are assumed to work for the same
purpose.
The authorities agree that fiscal policy should be geared towards improving competitiveness.
However, in the environment of already robust wage growth and a historically high
employment rate, public investments should be scaled up only when there are clear supply
side benefits and positive returns for the entire economy without causing labor market
distortions.
Financial stability
Estonia’s financial sector is sound and stable, with well capitalized, liquid, and profitable
banks, whose asset quality is high and non-performing loan ratios low. Risks to the financial
sector are reduced by the financial buffers of non-financial corporates, the relatively good
finances of the households and the high level of capitalization in the banking sector. Credit
demand has been relatively strong, while the ability of corporates and households to service
their loans has remained good due to previous buildup of financial buffers and the low
interest rate environment.
The dominant Nordic cross-border banks (over 90 percent of the banks operating in Estonia
are part of the large Nordic banking groups) imply mainly external financial risks that are
mitigated by sizable capital buffers of the banks. Domestic risks relate mostly to potential
spillovers from the housing market but these risks are not acute as mortgage lending growth
remains moderate.
Various macro-prudential measures have been introduced in recent years to increase the
resilience of the financial system and to reduce systemic risks. Since August 2016, a systemic
risk buffer requirement of 1 percent applies to all banks in Estonia with additional capital
buffers of 2 percent required for the two systemically important credit institutions. The
counter-cyclical capital buffer requirement was introduced in 2016 and its level is adjusted
according to quarterly assessments of changes in the credit cycle.
Close cooperation with Nordic banks’ home-country authorities is essential and mutual
efforts will continue to revitalize the Nordic Baltic Financial Stability Group. A few weeks
ago the Nordic and Baltic central banks signed an agreement on the principles for sharing
information and providing emergency liquidity assistance with regard to cross-border
banking groups. The new agreement, which replaces the one agreed in 2003, will further
improve financial stability in the region.
