IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with the Union of the Comoros
On December, 7, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with The Union of the Comoros.
The Comorian economy encountered difficulties in 2015 and the first half of 2016. Growth in
2016 is estimated at 1 percent in 2015, below the annual population growth rate of 2½ percent.
An ongoing crisis in the electricity sector and slower-than expected implementation of the public
investment program have been the main factors behind the growth deceleration. Inflation
remained well anchored at an annual rate of about 2 percent. Fiscal policy was challenging for
most of 2015 as the impact of slowing economic growth was compounded by a deterioration of
revenues, with the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio declining to 11.1 percent and continued to decline
during the first months of 2016. With the public sector wage and salary bill continuing its upward
trend to 9.1 percent of GDP in 2015, domestic arrears arose on wages and salaries in the course of
the year. However, a large budget grant from Saudi Arabia in December 2015 dramatically
changed the fiscal picture, allowing arrears to be cleared and resulting in an overall fiscal surplus
of 2.9 percent of GDP for the year and providing sizeable financing in the first 6 months of 2016.
The balance of payments improved sharply, mainly owing to imports being held back on account
of the real depreciation and the large grant. At the end of the year international reserves amounted
to the equivalent of more than 9 months of imports.
A new administration took office in mid-year, recognizing that accelerated reforms and urgent
action on the budget were needed to establish a basis for achieving sustainable growth. As a start
to addressing the problems the government adopted a set of measures to improve revenue
mobilization and reduce expenditures for the remainder of 2016, including cancellation of
contract of recently hired government employees. Measures were also taken to improve the
supply of electricity. The government efforts are supported by a staff monitored
program with the IMF. It is projected that growth should pick up somewhat to 2 percent in 2016
and revenues are projected to increase to 12 percent of GDP. The government aims to build on
these measures in 2017 and to implement further reforms to strengthen revenue administration,
improve public financial management and pursue reforms in the electricity sector.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that the Comorian economy is experiencing weak growth due to
difficult challenges including electricity shortages and other infrastructure inadequacies. Poor
tax revenue performance and a rising public wage bill have also led to a structural fiscal
imbalance. Against this background, Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
implement a six-month staff-monitored program, which aims to stabilize the fiscal situation.
Looking ahead, Directors stressed the need to forcefully address the underlying structural
problems to raise economic growth and reduce poverty.
Directors emphasized the need to address the fiscal gap to create space for growth-enhancing
infrastructure investment and priority social spending. They welcomed the important revenue
administration and public financial management measures the authorities have taken to
rebalance the budget and minimize and eventually eliminate domestic arrears. Nonetheless,
they saw a need for further reforms to enhance revenue mobilization and contain the wage
bill. In particular, the procedures for budget preparation, execution, and monitoring need to
be strengthened. In addition, urgent implementation of a fully effective registry of public
workers remains essential for controlling the wage bill.
Directors noted that Comoros will need additional external support. They stressed, however,
that borrowing to meet priority development needs should be on concessional terms only to
safeguard debt sustainability. Directors encouraged the authorities to send a positive signal of
prudent debt management by meeting its external debt service obligations on time and
implementing a mechanism to facilitate such repayments.
Directors noted that the financial system in Comoros remains fragile. They encouraged the
authorities to step up supervision of the sector and resolve the difficulties of the state-owned
postal bank. They also stressed that efforts to promote financial inclusion will be important.
Directors noted that the recent acquisition of new diesel generators is necessary to address
inadequate electricity provision in the country. They encouraged the authorities to continue
to work with external partners to develop a long-term strategy for improving the capacity of
the state-owned electricity company. Directors also welcomed the arrival of a second
telecommunications operator in Comoros, which will increase competition and help lower
prices and improve service quality. They recommended further reforms to the business
environment to catalyze additional private sector investment.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to improve the production of statistics and
disseminate reliable economic data in a timely manner to aid policymaking.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION;
AND STAFF - MONITORED PROGRAM

KEY ISSUES


A new government has taken the reins of power at a challenging time for Comoros.
Economic growth is anemic due to electricity shortages and other infrastructure
inadequacies. Poor tax revenue performance and a continuously rising wage bill have led
to a structural imbalance between domestic resources and recurrent spending resulting
in intermittent domestic arrears accumulation.



Comoros needs accelerated economic growth in order to overcome fragility and to
achieve an improvement in living standards and a meaningful reduction in poverty.
The highest priority needs to be given to creating fiscal space to tend to the country’s
development needs through infrastructure investment and to create buffers against
external shocks, including natural disasters. Strengthened revenue administration and
public financial management are key to creating fiscal space but additional external
support is also needed.



A strengthened environment for investment and business is essential. A more
reliable supply of electricity, better telecommunications services, and a more effective
judiciary to handle commercial disputes are all key in this regard.



The financial system in Comoros is fragile and strengthened supervision is required.
The government needs to develop a plan for dealing with the troubled state-owned
postal bank.



The authorities have requested support from the IMF in the form of a six-month
staff-monitored program through March 2017 that could serve a precursor to
discussions of a new ECF arrangement in the second quarter of 2017. Management has
approved this program, the main objectives of which are to stabilize the fiscal situation
and put in place policies to eliminate domestic arrears in 2017.

UNION OF THE COMOROS

CONTEXT
1.
Comoros is a small, poor, and fragile-three island state with limited natural resources
and connectivity to the rest of the world.1 Political instability marked the country in the first
quarter century after independence from France in the mid-1970s but over the last decade and a half
the country has seen three peaceful and democratic transitions of presidential power based on a
2001 constitution, which stipulates the autonomy of the three islands that constitute the Union of
the Comoros and the rotation of the presidency among them every five years. However, coordination
challenges between the Union government and the islands remain significant, giving rise to
problems with revenue collection and service delivery. Moreover, the private sector exhibits little
dynamism in an unfavorable business environment. Overall, this has resulted in limited
improvements in living standards and stagnant poverty rates.
2.
The traction of IMF policy advice has been limited in recent years. While the authorities
invariably expressed a willingness to pursue sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms,
progress was mostly disappointing (Annex I). Severe capacity constraints—an important dimension
of fragility in Comoros (Box 1)—undoubtedly contributed to this.
3.
Following presidential elections in April 2016, Mr. Azali Assoumani was sworn in as
president of the Union of Comoros in late May. Mr. Azali was previously head of state during
1999-2006. Mr. Azali has repeatedly declared that poor revenue collections, a high public sector
wage bill, and corruption are major challenges for his administration. He also indicated to the
mission that he wished for a close engagement with the IMF, preferably through a new three-year
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement. In view of the poor recent performance, a satisfactory
track record under a new staff-monitored program (SMP) would provide the basis for considering a
new ECF arrangement.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Macroeconomic performance over 2014-15 fell below expectations at the time of the
last Article IV consultation in January 2015 (Figures 1 and 2 and Table 1). At that time, annual
economic growth was projected at 3-3½ percent. Current estimates put growth at 2 percent in 2014
and 1 percent in 2015, below the annual population growth rate of 2½ percent. An ongoing crisis in
the electricity sector, as well as the slower-than expected implementation of the public investment
program (Box 2), has been the main factor behind the growth deceleration. Notwithstanding a sharp
real depreciation of the Comorian franc in 2015, owing to the depreciation of the euro against the
dollar, inflation remained well anchored at an annual rate of about 2 percent.2

1

Comoros’ per capital GDP is $740, while the poverty rate in 2014 was 42.4 percent.

Severe data deficiencies across the board are an impediment to the precise analysis of economic developments in
Comoros. For example, no consumer prices surveys were undertaken during large stretches of 2014 and 2015.

UNION OF THE COMOROS

Box 1. Comoros: Strategy for Addressing Fragility
The Union of the Comoros is characterized by three aspects of fragility. First, the country’s
history has been marked by inter-island tensions and conflicts since independence from
France in 1974, which have spilled over into political instability and a series of coups and
secession attempts during the 1990s and into the early 2000s. Recent years have, however,
seen three successive democratic political transitions. Second, Comoros is characterized by
severe capacity limitations, which drastically impede effective macroeconomic management
and reform implementation. Third, the provision of basic infrastructure, such as roads and a
reliable source of electricity, is weak.
The strategy for engagement with the Comoros focuses on simple capacity building efforts to
build resilience going forward. Measures such as ensuring the effective operation of the single
treasury account, enhancing coordination between the different arms of the tax collection
authority (AGID) and implementation of a computerized central register of public sector
workers (GISE) aim to increase efficiency and transparency to help reduce inter-island tensions
and bolster political stability. At the same time, enhancing revenue mobilization and
controlling the wage bill will create the fiscal space needed to address infrastructure gaps.
Furthermore, an intensive program of technical assistance, undertaken in cooperation with
AFRITAC South, aims at alleviating the severe capacity limitations.
Near-to-medium term capacity building efforts focus on improving revenue administration,
public financial management, and enhancing statistical capacity. Urgent measures are needed
to boost revenue collection capacity and raise tax revenues from their current perilously low
level. In the medium term, root and branch reform of the tax and customs administration is
needed to put the public finances on a sustainable footing. Concerning public financial
management, priority areas are improving budget preparation and execution, as well as
implementation of proper cash flow management practices. Weak statistical capacity is being
addressed through an ongoing program of technical assistance designed to improve the
reliability of the national accounts and price statistics.
5.
Fiscal policy implementation was challenging for most of 2015 (Table 2). The impact of
slowing economic growth on revenue was compounded by the deteriorating performance of
revenue administration, particularly customs. The tax revenue-to-GDP ratio declined from
11.8 percent of GDP in 2014 to 11.1 percent in 2015.3 Non-tax revenue was, however, bolstered by
more than 2 percent of GDP from the proceeds of the sale of a second telecommunication license in
December. With the public sector wage and salary bill continuing its upward trend—from 7.6 percent
of GDP in 2013, to 8.5 percent in 2014, and 9.1 percent in 2015—and with statutory advances from
the central bank already at their ceiling—the inevitable result of these trends were rising domestic
arrears in the course of the year; to three months of wages and salaries in October and November.
The tax revenue ratio in 2015 would have been even lower had the government not forced profitable state-owned
companies to pay profit tax as part of an effort to obtain a disbursement under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) and an
SMP; see Union of the Comoros—Request for a Disbursement under the Rapid Credit Facility; and Staff-Monitored
Program. The request for the RCF disbursement was withdrawn at the last minute due to a large Saudi budget grant
and the SMP was subsequently cancelled by the authorities due to difficulties in implementing the program in the
run-up to elections.

6.
The disbursement of a Saudi budget grant of €40 million (equivalent to 7.5 percent of
GDP) in mid-December 2015 dramatically changed the fiscal picture for 2015. It enabled the
authorities to clear the wage and salary arrears before year-end and record an overall fiscal surplus
on a cash basis of 2.9 percent of GDP, and thereby substantially improve the government’s position
vis-à-vis the central bank.
Box 2. Comoros: Public Investment Program (PIP)
The public investment program (PIP) in
Comoros has declined substantially in
recent years. The planned PIP shrank
from 26 percent of GDP in 2012 to 14.6
percent in 2015. Meanwhile, the
executed PIP declined from 12.4 percent
of GDP in 2012 to 6.1 percent in 2015
(Figure 1).
The PIP can be broadly categorized into
four classes: government capacity
building, social development,
infrastructure, and productivity
enhancements. The executed PIP has
declined in all areas except for
infrastructure (Figure 2).
The financing of the PIP is predominantly
foreign (Figure 3). The PIP financing
includes budgetary support, foreign
grants, and foreign loans. Typically, the
foreign component is in excess of 90
percent of the total, while the domestic
component represents well less than 10
percent.
The low and decreasing execution ratio for the PIP is a major concern. The execution ratio of the
PIP has been on a declining trajectory in recent years, decreasing from 47 percent in 2012 to 42
percent in 2015. The low execution ratio not only signals a waste of investment opportunities, but
also leads to the delay and even failure of many projects. To increase the execution ratio, the
authorities can help improving infrastructure, enhancing project management, and strengthening
the communications with the donor countries.
7.
For most of 2015, the growth in monetary aggregates was fairly subdued (Table 3). The
receipt of the Saudi grant distorted the end-year monetary figures sharply; broad money grew by
17.1 percent, only slightly more than private sector credit, while net foreign assets were up by
38.4 percent and credit to government down 4.8 percent.

8.
The balance of exports and imports of goods and services improved sharply in 2015
(Table 4), mainly owing to non-fuel goods imports being held back by the real depreciation. Goods
exports also declined, but from a small base, largely owing to low world market prices for cloves.
Remittances from the large Comorian diaspora, a mainstay of the economy, also appear to have held
up reasonably well.4 All told, the current account recorded a surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP. The large
overall balance of payments surplus led to a rise in international reserves of about 10 percent in
dollar terms, providing cover for prospective imports of goods and services of more than 9 months
at end-2015.
9.
Developments during the first half of 2016 point to a continuation, even an
amplification, of the trends seen in 2015. Revenues, particularly from customs, have continued to
lag expectations and the outgoing government added many employees to its payroll. As a result,
public sector wages and salaries consumed 85 percent of tax revenues, and 74 percent of all
revenues, during the first six months of the year (Table 2C). The authorities were able to continue to
draw on the remaining proceeds of the Saudi grant to avoid the incurrence of domestic arrears;
however, some external arrears (about $1½ -2 million) were incurred despite resources being
available for external debt service, mainly due to inadequate communications within the Ministry of
Finance. Imports were subdued during the first months of the year, mainly because of strikes on the
French island of Mayotte (an important transshipment point). International reserves held up fairly
well even with high levels of government spending during the first half of 2016; at the end of July,
reserves were down 13 percent in nominal terms from their elevated level of end-2015.
10.
Reflecting the country’s fragility and the mostly negative per capita GDP growth over
the last 10-15 years, progress in improving social indicators has been limited (Table 5).
According to a 2014 household survey, 42.4 percent of the population is poor, a marginal
improvement over the 2004 poverty rate of 44.8 percent.

OUTLOOK, RISKS, AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
11.
In the discussions, the authorities and the mission agreed that, absent corrective
measures, growth would continue to be tepid, revenues would remain stagnant, and
substantial arrears would reappear. In a baseline scenario, developed jointly by the authorities and
the mission, growth would remain in the 2 percent range, the revenue-to-GDP ratio flat, and,
domestic and external arrears rising, leaving no room for additional infrastructure investment
(Baseline Scenario in Text Table 1). The authorities and the mission agreed that this was clearly an
unsustainable scenario.

While Tables 1 and 4 indicate a decline in net private transfers from 21.6 percent of GDP to 18.4 percent between
2014 and 2015, this represents the proper inclusion of private outflows in the data; gross remittance inflows were
broadly unchanged relative to GDP.

12.
Under a joint active policy scenario (Policy Scenario in Text Table 1), growth would
accelerate modestly in 2016 and 2017 and converge to the pre-2014 trend of close to
4 percent over the medium term. With some improvement in the electricity situation through
government purchases of additional generating capacity and support for fuel purchases, real GDP
growth could be close to 2 percent in 2016 and accelerate to the 3.5-4 percent range thereafter.
However, in addition to a more reliable electricity supply, this would be predicated on other
improvements in infrastructure and the business environment to strengthen the attractiveness of
Comoros as an investment destination. Under this scenario, the tax revenue ratio would increase by a
½ percentage point of GDP annually over the medium term based on determined actions to improve
revenue administration. This scenario also assumes that the rise in the wage bill (Box 3) would be
curtailed while additional funds would be available for domestically-financed public sector
investment. Moreover, additional external funding would be needed to eliminate remaining financing
gaps.
13.
Comoros faces both domestic and external risks (Annex I). On the domestic side the
principal risks are continued fiscal instability arising from lack of success in mobilizing additional
domestic revenue and reining in the wage bill in the amounts and time-frame envisaged and a
prolongation of the period of electricity shortages. On the external side, the main risks relate to
remittance flows and international food and fuel prices. Comoros is also at risk from natural disasters,
including volcanic eruptions and flooding.
14.
A DSA update confirms Comoros’ moderate risk of debt distress rating (Union of the
Comoros—Staff Report for the 2016 Article IV Consultation—Debt Sustainability Analysis). The
government is currently drawing on two previously-contracted external loans, one from India (from
2013) in the amount of US$33 million for the construction of a heavy fuel power plant, the other
from China (from 2010) for US$32 million for strengthening the domestic telecommunications
infrastructure. While additional borrowing likely will be needed over the medium-term, the
authorities have not identified a pipeline of specific credits. The mission urged the new authorities to
only borrow on concessional terms and only for high-priority projects with a clear economic benefit
and after consultation with the Fund and the World Bank. The mission indicated to the authorities
that the incurrence of arrears on external debt service, even in small amounts, by a country, such as
Comoros, that had recently received comprehensive debt relief sent a very bad signal to the
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNION OF THE COMOROS

international community and explored with them possible steps to strengthen external debt
management to avoid such incurrence in the future, including the establishment of a mechanism that
would provide standing authority to the central bank to debit the government’s account to facilitate
debt service payments.
Box 3. Comoros: The Wage Bill
The Union of the Comoros is an outlier with respect to the ratio of the wage bill to tax revenues, which is one of
the most elevated in Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 1).
In contrast to other countries in the region, the wage bill in Comoros has taken an ever-larger share of tax
revenues. In both the Seychelles and Comoros, the ratio of the change in wage bill / change in tax revenues was
negative during 2014-15. In the Seychelles, this occurred since the wage bill fell, while tax revenues increased.
However, in Comoros, it was tax revenues that declined, while the wage bill held steady.
The nominal wage bill has increased at the Union level, as well on the individual islands of Anjouan, Ngazidja and
to a lesser extent Moheli. The fiscal outturn for 2015 indicates that the wage bill breached the budgetary celling of
the 2015 budget law, mainly in Anjouan (+5 percent) and for the Union (+2 percent).
Many neighboring countries exhibit a stable relationship between the wage bill and tax revenues, however, a
similar phenomenon is not observed in the Union of the Comoros. When the wage bill exceeds its equilibrium
level, many countries make an effort to reduce the wage bill (and increase tax revenues). In Comoros however,
wages and salaries appear to evolve independently of tax revenues.
Increases in the wage bill may result from higher salaries and/or more workers, yet the diagnosis for the Comoros
is not clear. It is impossible to distinguish between these two effects in the Comoros, since comprehensive
information regarding the total number of public servants and wages at the Union and island levels is currently
unavailable.
Available data indicate that at the Union level, the overall wage bill is mainly concentrated in the Finance, Foreign
Affairs and Justice ministries. The foreign affairs ministry pays the highest average salary per employee and has
the highest base wage bill. Bonuses account for about 38 percent of the total wage bill in the finance ministry.
Bonuses significantly deepen inequities in the wage bill distribution. Inequalities are moderate in the base wage
bill distribution, but they are more evident in the distribution of bonuses. Although the total of bonuses and other
benefits is capped at 50 percent of the basic salary, this rule appears not to be applied.
The main obstacles to effectively controlling the wage bill are: i) irregularities in the list of public sector workers,
particularly on Anjouan, ii) ineffective application of laws defining employment levels in each ministry, the
management of the recruitment process, and the revaluing of salaries and bonuses, and iii) significant recruitment
during the recent electoral period. Moreover, the central registry of public sector workers (GISE) is not fully
effective throughout the country. Efforts should be reinforced to address these outstanding issues and to get
better information on the composition of public employment and the pattern of wages and bonuses.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Introduction
15.
The authorities recognize that Comoros needs accelerated economic growth in order to
overcome fragility and to achieve an improvement in living standards and a meaningful
reduction in poverty. A number of factors hold back growth, including the country’s small size and
geographic isolation and weak inter-island and international transport connections and
telecommunications connectivity, as well as weak implementation capacity. Moreover, poor physical
infrastructure, notably in the electricity and road sectors, and an inhospitable business environment,
partly caused by an ineffective judiciary, are also obstacles to growth.
16.
Comoros ranks firmly in the bottom quartile of countries in terms of ease of doing
business according to the World Bank’s Doing Business Indicators for 2016. Overall, Comoros
ranks 154th out of 189 countries, with particularly poor scores for enforcing contracts (179th) and
resolving business disputes (189th and last). However, the assessment of the external position using
standard EBA-lite tools indicates that at end-2015 it was broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals (Annex III).

B. Growth Policy
17.
Against this background, the authorities and the mission agreed that the highest
priority should be given to the following:


Creating fiscal space for increased investment. A part of increased fiscal space should
come from a better balance between domestic resource mobilization and recurrent spending
(Text Figure 1 and Box 4). However, the country also needs additional external support,
particularly budget support. In this regard, staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to
convene a donors’ conference in parallel to discussion of a possible ECF arrangement in the
first half of 2017.5



Ensuring that the electricity situation continues to improve to provide a stable energy
supply to businesses, without which investors will remain reluctant to continue existing
activities and start new ones. The authorities indicated that they would continue to work
closely with the World Bank and the African Development Bank on a longer-term strategy for
the electricity sector. In the short term, the mission argued that subsidies to the state-owned
electricity company (MAMWE) should be transparent rather than made on an ad-hoc basis as
in the past. Over the medium term, these subsidies should be phased out.



Paving the way for the success of the second telecommunications license. The authorities
recognize that the arrival of a new provider of telecommunications services holds out hope
for significant positive effects on activity through higher quality and lower costs in both the

5

short and long run, but will pose a restructuring challenge to the existing state-owned
monopoly provider.


Strengthening the judiciary, through improved selection and training of judges, to better
enable it to handle contract enforcement and business dispute resolution, as well as tackle
governance/corruption issues. The government is aware that, without improvement in this
area, banks will not provide the credit needed for the private sector. Donors are already
providing some support in these areas but more would be welcome.



Seeking foreign investment, including from the diaspora, in agriculture, fishing, and
tourism, that could boost production and create employment in these and related sectors.
The government sees these sectors as potential drivers of growth for the economy and is
preparing to adjust the country’s poverty reduction strategy (Strategy for Accelerated and
Durable Development, SCA2D) to better accommodate the need for a more favorable
environment for investment and business.

Box 4. Comoros: Fiscal Trends 2005-2015
The fiscal performance of and outlook for Comoros continues to be adversely affected by a
number of systemic challenges, particularly in the areas of revenue administration and public
financial management. In particular, Comoros experiences a structural imbalance between
domestic resource mobilization and current spending, particularly on public wages and salaries,
leaving little scope for domestically-financed capital spending that is essential for spurring
economic growth and social development.

Comoros is constrained by weak tax mobilization,
reflecting poor effectiveness in customs and tax
administration. In comparison with other SSA
PRGT-eligible countries, tax revenue in Comoros
has remained at or below the first quartile over
the last decade (Box Figure 1.1).

High government expenditure on wages and

The combination of poor tax collection and a

spending, including priority social spending. In
particular, domestically-financed capital
spending has remained especially low over the
last decade, general being at or below the first
quartile relative to peers (Figure 1.3). The only
exception to this was during the period of

C. Fiscal Policy
18.
The new government’s overriding objective is to create fiscal space for investment in
infrastructure investment that improves the operating environment for the productive sectors
of the economy and will help accelerate growth. It is acutely aware that this requires that the
imbalance between domestic revenue mobilization and current spending needs to be radically
redressed. Its longer term objectives are to raise domestic revenues by 50 percent and reduce public
spending by 40 percent relative to current ratios to GDP. However, the government recognizes that
short-term options are much more limited partly because of the need to take into account the
fragility of Comorian society when considering measures to reduce the wage bill. The government
also recognizes that fiscal stability predicated on balance between available resources and spending
is a precondition for the macroeconomic stability required for sustained growth.
19.
For the remainder of 2016, the authorities and the mission discussed the measures the
authorities plan to take to prevent arrears on wages and salaries, and minimize other arrears
to the extent possible (Text Table 2). The revenue measures, which should raise overall revenues by
about 10 percent relative to the baseline, focus on (i) immediately improving the effectiveness of tax
administration and customs through strengthened leadership; (ii) applying new tax measures,
including a five percent consumption tax on telecommunication services, the elimination of all
discretionary tax exemptions, and a tax on external business services; and (iii) ensuring that the
profitable state-owned enterprises contribute additional dividends to the treasury. On the spending
side, the focus is on (i) eliminating unnecessary and irregular spending on goods and services; and
(ii) containing the wage bill in the short-term by cancelling all employment contracts granted since
January 1, 2016. This would reduce projected spending by almost 9 percent. The authorities
confirmed that they did not expect to receive any external budget support beyond the US$3 million
anticipated from the World Bank in 2016. Moreover, they reiterated that the government’s general
policy would be to use one-off resources, such as from occasional budget support grants, for one-off
expenditures, such as state-enterprise restructuring, or for building buffers against external shocks,
including natural disasters. With these measures fully applied, the government should be able to fully
pay all wages and salaries due in 2016, leaving only a small financing gap (about 0.8 percent of GDP)
resulting in the accumulation of domestic arrears of the same magnitude. The authorities
acknowledged that these measures were ambitious, but felt that, with a determined effort, they
would be feasible, especially given the profitable status of the state enterprises that would be
contributing a large part of the additional revenues.
20.
The authorities and the mission also agreed on a macroeconomic and fiscal framework
for the budget proposal for 2017. The framework is based on a realistic but ambitious revenue
target and the repayment of the domestic arrears accumulated in 2016. It also aims to further
contain the public sector wage bill through better control of the number and salaries of public sector
employees at both Union and island levels. With the measures outlined in Text Table 2 and based on
the further revenue administration and public financial management reforms outlined below, the
projected financing gap, even with some additional allocations to domestically financed capital
spending, has been significantly reduced relative to the baseline, to 2½ percent of GDP. To close this
remaining financing gap, the government plans to call on the international community, including the
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNION OF THE COMOROS

IMF, for additional support, particularly budget support. To this end, it intends to convene a donors’
conference in the first half of 2017. The fiscal program would need to be revisited if it does not prove
possible to fully close the financing gap for 2017.

D. Revenue Administration
21.
The authorities underscored their firm commitment to revenue administration (RA)
reform. They accepted that, at the institutional level, both the general tax administration (AGID) and
customs administration needed to be strengthened and had already taken steps to this end although
more would be needed. In designing revenue administration reforms, the government has taken its
lead from IMF tax administration TA provided in July 2016 (Text Table 3). The main reforms to be
implemented in the near term include (i) concentrating the tax treatment of all large companies,
including state-owned enterprises, in the large tax payers unit on Ngazidja (Grande Comore); (ii)
expanding the lists of large and small and medium-sized tax payers and ensuring that those on the
lists pay their taxes; and (iii) introducing a clear classification system, interfaced with the information
system Sydonia, as a first step to improving the management of the tax and customs exemption
regime. A comprehensive program with additional reforms based on the provided TA is being
developed.

E. Public Financial Management
22.
The authorities aim to build on progress already made in strengthening public financial
management (PFM) by focusing on strengthening control of the wage bill and addressing
remaining weaknesses relating to cash management and budgeting and budget execution, as well as
transparency (see Text Table 3). In particular, they intend to immediately (i) ensure that the central
registry of public sector workers (GISE) covers the Union and the three islands and that only workers
in the registry are paid; (ii) strengthen the preparation of the table for central government financial
operations (TOFE); (iii) undertake a comprehensive audit of domestic arrears at the Union level; and
(iv) ensure that all receipts from the single tax on petroleum products (TUPP) accrue to the single
treasury account and that all of the offsets between the government, the state-owned oil importing

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNION OF THE COMOROS

company (SCH), and the state-owned electricity company (MAMWE) are eliminated. Moreover, the
treasury and central bank will organize monthly meetings to reconcile treasury cash flow data with
bank data.

F. Financial Sector Policy
23.
The new government attaches great importance to Comoros’ monetary cooperation
agreement with France which simultaneously pegs the Comorian Franc to the euro and anchors
fiscal policy through the ceiling on statutory advances from the central bank to the treasury based on
the average of internal revenue over the previous three years. The government envisages no changes
to these arrangements. The mission agreed that these arrangements continued to serve Comoros
well.
24.
The mission noted that the Comorian financial system is fragile and that the
macroeconomic environment was challenging for financial institutions (Box 5 and Table 6).
While these institutions were generally adequately capitalized and liquid, their profitability had been
sluggish, the ratio of non-performing loans rising, and provisioning lagging. The central bank (BCC)
underscored its commitment to further strengthening banking supervision and the monitoring of
financial sector stability. The BCC would also continue to closely monitor developments in the postal
bank (SNPSF), including through participation in a government committee established to make
proposals on how the bank’s difficulties could be resolved. The government committed to preparing
an action plan for the resolution of the bank’s difficulties by March 31, 2017, building on
recommendations made by an MCM technical assistance mission earlier this year.
25.
The central bank will also continue working closely with the Ministry of Justice to
address weaknesses in the application of the legal provisions with respect to the recovery of
doubtful and disputed receivables, which currently is a serious impediment to the ability and
willingness of the banks to extend credit.

G. Electricity Sector
26.
The new government indicated that it was keenly aware that persistent electricity
shortages and blackouts were significant obstacles to economic growth and development in
Comoros and that it was determined to overcome them as soon as possible. For immediate
relief, the authorities confirmed that they had purchased a number of diesel generators with a
combined capacity of 25 MW and expected to take delivery of them in late 2016 or early 2017. The
mission expressed understanding for the government’s decision to go ahead with the purchase of
these generators but noted that it would add significantly to budgetary outlays (about 1½ percent of
GDP) in 2017. The government has also affirmed its support for the heavy-fuel plant being financed
with a concessional loan from the EXIM Bank of India. The mission noted that these two projects
would provide a firm supply foundation for the electricity sector in Comoros for the medium term.
The authorities also continue to work with the World Bank and African Development Bank on a
longer term strategy to strengthen the technical, management, and commercial capacity of MAMWE
and minimize the dependence on expensive diesel oil for electricity generation by diversifying to
solar, wind, and geothermal energy.

UNION OF THE COMOROS

H. Telecommunications Sector
27.
The government confirmed that it is committed to lowering the cost and improving
the quality of telecommunication services in Comoros through increased competition. To this
end, the government would provide a level playing field of competition between state-owned
Comores Telecom and TELCO, the holder of the new telecommunications license which was expected
to begin to offer services to customers once it had made the requisite investments in infrastructure
in late 2016. The mission welcomed this position, noting that the arrival of a new
telecommunications service provider could prove an important spur to economic activity in the
country.

I. Economic Data
28.
The mission reiterated that economic data gathering and dissemination had serious
shortcomings that hampered analysis of economic developments, as well as policy design (see
Comoros—Statistical Assessment Appendix in the Informational Annex). The highest priority needed
to be given to the preparation of a timely and accurate table of consolidated government financial
operations (TOFE), for which the Fund was already providing technical assistance. The mission noted
that this table provided a crucial basis for budget preparation, execution, and monitoring, as well as
for ensuring transparency in fiscal operations. Almost equally important were continuing efforts to
strengthen the compilation of price, national accounts, and balance of payments data. To this end,
further efforts to improve capacity, including through technical assistance by the Fund, the World
Bank, and the AfDB, should be vigorously pursued. Moreover, adequate funding of the statistics
agency would be essential. The authorities acknowledged this problem and committed to continuing
efforts.

J. Outreach
29.
The mission engaged in various outreach activities. It met with representatives of
parliament, civil society, the private sector, and donors. The mission organized a seminar attended
by government officials and others, at which mission members made analytical presentations on (i)
regional economic trends, (ii) longer-term fiscal trends in Comoros relative to peers in Sub-Saharan
Africa, and (iii) various financial sector issues in Comoros, including financial inclusion. The seminar
was followed by a roundtable at which seminar attendees debated what could be done to strengthen
revenue administration in Comoros.

STAFF MONITORED PROGRAM
30.
The new government requested support, including financing, from the Fund in
navigating the challenging circumstances it faces. The mission noted that, given the recent poor
record of macroeconomic performance, a satisfactory track record under a new staff-monitored
program, covering the six-month period from October 1, 2016 through March 31, 2017 could
provide a basis for considering a new ECF arrangement. Discussions on such arrangement could be
held in the second quarter of 2017 and could also coincide with the authorities’ efforts to mobilize
additional external support through a donor’s conference. The authorities agreed with this
18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNION OF THE COMOROS

approach. Their objectives during the six-month program period are detailed in the Letter of Intent
and Memorandum of Economic Policies in Annex IV, approved by Management. The program
includes test dates on December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017.
31.
The main objectives of the SMP are to achieve fiscal sustainability through policies that
aim to limit domestic arrears in 2016 and eliminating them in 2017, relying on a combination of
a strong adjustment effort and additional external budget support. The macroeconomic and
structural targets and policies under the SMP are in line with the quantitative framework and policy
undertakings discussed above. The main quantitative targets relate to revenue mobilization and the
avoidance of arrears, while the structural measures focus on the revenue administration and public
financial management reforms listed in Text Table 3, with additional measures relating to the
preparation of an action plan for dealing with the problems of the state-owned postal bank and
setting up a mechanism among the Ministry of Finance, the treasury, and the central bank for
ensuring the external debt service payments are made on time.

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
The new Comorian government has come to power at a particularly difficult time.
Economic growth is anemic due to electricity shortages and other infrastructure inadequacies. Poor
tax revenue performance and a continuously rising wage bill have led to a structural imbalance
between domestic resources and recurrent spending resulting in intermittent domestic arrears
accumulation. The new government should seize the opportunity to more forcefully address the
country’s underlying problems.
33.
The authorities have a clear understanding of the main challenges that Comoros faces.
In order to support accelerated economic growth to overcome fragility and achieve an improvement
in living standards and a meaningful reduction in poverty Comoros needs to create fiscal space for
infrastructure investment and eventually build financial buffers upon which it can draw in case of
external shocks. Increased fiscal space should come from an improved balance between domestic
resource mobilization and recurrent spending, but the country also needs additional external
support, particularly budget support. Future borrowing to address development needs should be on
concessional terms only.
34.
The government has already taken important steps toward rebalancing the budget. The
revenue administration and public financial management measures it has already announced will go
a long way toward minimizing domestic arrears in 2016 and eliminating them altogether in 2017.
Additional efforts will be essential to achieve the long term goals the government has established.
35.
The government appropriately emphasizes the need for continuing revenue
administration reforms. Compared to peers, revenue mobilization in Comoros is weak and more so
because of weak revenue administration than inadequacies in the tax system.
36.
Further public financial management reforms are also needed to ensure the effective
use of public resources. The procedures for budget preparation, execution, and monitoring need to
be strengthened. Moreover, while the establishment of the single treasury account represented a
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

UNION OF THE COMOROS

milestone in cash management, more needs to be done to strengthen liquidity forecasting and
transparency. Finally, achieving better control of the wage bill through a fully effective registry of
public sector workers is a matter of the utmost urgency.
37.
The financial system in Comoros is fragile and strengthened supervision by the central
bank is required. The government needs to develop a plan for dealing with the troubled stateowned postal bank.
38.
The government’s purchase of new diesel generators, while costly for the budget, is
appropriate in order to provide immediate relief from the recurrent electricity shortages and
blackouts. The authorities also continue to work with the World Bank and African Development Bank
on a longer term strategy to strengthen the technical, management, and commercial capacity of the
state-owned electrical company.
39.
The incurrence of any arrears on external debt service by a country such as Comoros
that has recently received comprehensive and deep external debt relief sends a bad signal to
the international community. Better monitoring and communication procedures are needed and
the proposed mechanism to facilitate payments directly with the help of the central bank should be
put in place without delay. Efforts should also continue to address the small amount of remaining
pre-HIPC external debt.
40.
The arrival of a second telecommunications services provider in Comoros is welcome.
Through increased competition, with lower prices and better quality services, it could prove an
important spur to economic activity.
41.
Comorian economic data are in urgent need of an upgrade. The authorities need
continue to work with external partners to improve capacity and ensure that adequate resources are
made available for the compilation of reliable and timely data on central government finances,
prices, national accounts, and balance of payments.
42.
The six-month SMP through March 2017 aims to establish a track record of
performance regarding macroeconomic management and structural reforms. Satisfactory
performance under the SMP would set the stage for discussions on a new three-year arrangement
under the ECF in the second quarter of 2017.
43.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 5. Comoros: Selected Financial Sector Issues
Financial institutions in Comoros operate in a challenging macroeconomic environment, while financial
vulnerabilities are rising and profitability is sluggish (Box Figure 2.1). In the current slow growth environment,
the ratio of non-performing loans to gross loans has increased further, reaching 27.4 percent at end-March
2016. Profitability in the sector is low, with an overall return on assets of less than 1 percent in 2015.
The financial sector in Comoros is shallow, underdeveloped and mildly concentrated, but is deeper than
comparators in low-income Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Financial institution assets amounted to just over
47 percent of GDP in 2015, with the three largest financial institutions controlling about 57 percent of total
sector assets. Assets consist mainly of loans to the domestic private sector and deposits at the central bank.
High liquidity levels reflect underdeveloped financial markets that constrain investment opportunities.
Holdings of net foreign assets are insignificant, as is lending to the public sector. Traditional metrics of
financial sector depth and intermediation indicate that at end-2015, the depth of the Comorian financial
sector was comparable to the low-income Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) average, yet well behind that of frontier
SSA economies (Box Figure 2.2).
Some financial institutions are large enough to be considered systemic, but financial interconnectedness is
limited. Deposits and loans are concentrated in a few institutions but financial interconnectedness is limited
as interbank markets are nonexistent and inter-institution deposits are limited to the excess liquidity of
microfinance institutions, reducing the scope for spillovers between banks in the event of financial distress.
Financial institutions are broadly well-capitalized and liquid, but the increasing NPL ratio and lagging
provisioning of recent years are a concern (Box Figure 2.3). Moreover, provisioning has not kept pace with
the rise in doubtful loans.
Although Comoros compares well with low-income SSA regarding financial access, there is significant
inequality across income levels and gender (Figures 2.4 and 2.5). The proportion of survey respondents aged
15 and over in Comoros with access to an account at a financial institution (‘financial access’) in 2011, at
21.7 percent, was well above the average for low-income SSA countries. However, the ratio of the bankable
‘better-off’ to the ‘poor’ and males to females is higher in Comoros than for low-income SSA countries.
For a detailed analysis of financial sector issues see the Special Issues supplement accompanying this report.

from a failure to fully address crisis legacies and
undertake structural reforms, leading to lower
medium-term path of potential growth (the Euro

exacerbating legacy financial imbalances especially
among banks (the Euro area) (high likelihood).
Tighter financial conditions and insufficient reforms
undermine medium-term growth in emerging

Significant slowdown in other large

cycle and fallout from excess household and
corporate (FX) leverage as investors withdraw from
EM corporate debt, generating disorderly
deleveraging, with potential spillbacks to advanced
economies.
Significant China slowdown and its spillovers:
Key near term risks are a loss of investor
confidence, disorderly corporate defaults, a sharp
fall in asset prices, and a quicker fading of the
stimulus impact. Weak domestic demand further
suppresses commodity prices, roils global financial
markets, and reduces global growth (Likelihood:
low in short-term, medium thereafter).

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of
IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability
below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff
views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact
and materialize jointly.

Annex III. Union of the Comoros—External Sector Assessment1
The overall current account balance recorded a surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2015. Foreign
exchange reserves increased to about 35 percent of GDP on the back of a one-off large grant from
Saudi Arabia that was received in mid–December. Meanwhile, exports continued to stagnate against
the background of a real effective exchange depreciation of about 16 percent. Statistical tools indicate
that at end-2015, the external position of Comoros was broadly consistent with medium-term
fundamentals; estimates of the real equilibrium exchange rate point to a small undervaluation. Yet
Comoros’ inhospitable business climate, including an ongoing energy crisis and persistent
infrastructure bottlenecks, continues to hinder competitiveness.

A. External Sector - Recent Developments
1.
The current account balance of Comoros switched from a deficit of 8.6 percent of GDP
in 2014 to a surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP at end 2015. The key factors underlying this result
were the receipt of revenues from the sale of a second telecommunications license to the Malagasy
company TELMA, as well as a one-off budget support grant received from Saudi Arabia in midDecember 2015 (40 million Euros or 7.5 percent of GDP). The current account deficit excluding
official and private transfers narrowed from 32.9 percent of GDP in 2014 to 27.7 percent of GDP. This
was largely attributable to a decline in the value of imports and the subsequent narrowing of trade
deficit, as well as increased services receipts.
2.
Foreign exchange reserves remained more-than-adequate at about 35 percent of GDP
(9 months of imports of goods and services) at end 2015. Foreign exchange reserves at end
2015 were boosted by the receipt of the grant from Saudi Arabia. Absent this grant, reserves would
have decreased by about 3 percent in 2015.
3.
The real effective exchange rate depreciated in 2015, yet Comoros’ export
performance remained disappointing (Figure 1). The real effective exchange rate depreciated by
about 16 percent in 2015. However, exports, which measured as a share of the economy are very
low, showed no sign of improvement, having remained well below the average of non-oil exporters
in Sub – Saharan Africa (SSA) since 2009. In comparison, peer countries boosted their export
performance over this same period.

account gap (the difference between the actual level of the current account and the estimated
current account norm), the one-off grant from Saudi Arabia, which was received in mid-December
and, therefore, was unlikely to impact external competitiveness, is excluded from both the current
account and estimation of the current account norm. At optimal policies, the current account gap is
small (Figure 2) and implies a real exchange rate misalignment of only -1.1 percent (Table 1).
Although the IRER approach suggests an undervaluation of the real exchange rate of a larger
magnitude, this estimate is subject to considerable uncertainty (large residuals) and should therefore
be treated with caution.

Indicators of Structural Competitiveness

5.
Despite marginal improvements in the business climate in 2015, Comoros continues to
face deep-seated and persistent competitiveness problems (Figure 3). On the back of
improvements in the ease of starting a business and the ease of obtaining firm credit, in 2015
Comoros moved up five places in the World Bank Doing Business Indicators, to 154th place out of
189 countries. However, little progress was made in other key areas, for example in the ease of
enforcing contracts, while other aspects of the business climate worsened. As such, Comoros,
characterized by chronic infrastructure bottlenecks most notably in the electricity sector, continues
to have one of the most inhospitable business climates amongst peer countries.
6.
Improving the business climate is key to improving Comoros’ medium-term
competitiveness. The unreliability of the electricity supply is a brake on growth and must urgently
be addressed. Improving other aspects of the business environment, such as the legal and judicial
framework surrounding contract enforcement and insolvency resolution, is also critical for spurring
private sector activity in the medium term.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
Moroni, Union of Comoros
November 15, 2016
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
1.
The new government of Comoros has inherited a very difficult economic situation from the
previous government, one that borders on crisis. Economic growth is lackluster and there is an acute
shortage of jobs for the country’s young population. The environment for economic activity is poor,
with persistent electricity shortages, the main roads in an appalling state, and telecommunications
services substantially inadequate. Notwithstanding the large budget support from Saudi Arabia at
the end of 2015, the fiscal situation is serious with substantial financing gaps projected for 2016 and
2017 in the absence of corrective measures. However, even the strongest possible fiscal actions,
given the fragile social context of Comoros, may prove insufficient to close the gaps. We are in
urgent need of external support, from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as from our
other multilateral and bilateral partners.
2.
The new government’s immediate priority is to revive economic growth in the context of
macroeconomic stability. To this end, we are committed to implementing strong fiscal measures in
the second half of 2016 that should allow us to avoid wage and salary arrears and keep other arrears
at a minimum. Through the 2017 budget we will implement additional measures that will further
reduce the projected financing gap. We intend to seek external financial support for closing any
remaining gap by convening a donors’ conference in the first half of 2017.
3.
The new government of Comoros is interested in obtaining a new three-year ECF
arrangement with the IMF as soon as possible to help us maintain economic stability and make
progress towards inclusive growth and poverty reduction over the medium term in line with the
country’s poverty reduction strategy (Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Durable Development,
2015-19, SCA2D). We are in the process of adjusting the strategy to better reflect the new
government’s focus on strengthening the basis for accelerated economic growth through
infrastructure investment in the electricity, road, and telecommunication sectors. However, we
recognize that, before we can move to a new program, we need to establish a track record of strong
policy implementation and that, for this purpose, we will need close engagement with IMF staff,
notably concerning the formulation of strong fiscal measures for the remainder of 2016 and for the
2017 budget, as well as the design of a reform program focused on revenue administration (RA) and
public financial management (PFM). We, therefore, request that IMF staff monitor the
implementation of our economic program covering the period October 1, 2016 through March 31,
2017.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

UNION OF THE COMOROS

4.
We believe that the policies and measures set out in the attached memorandum of
economic and financial policies (MEFP) are adequate to achieve the objectives of our program, but
we will take any further measures that may become necessary for this purpose. We will consult with
IMF staff prior to any revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the IMF’s
policies on such consultations. We will continue to provide to IMF staff the information required to
monitor accurately the staff-monitored program on a timely basis. We agree with the publication by
the Fund of these documents.
Sincerely yours,

/s/

UNION OF THE COMOROS

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
I. Introduction
1.
The new government is committed to pursuing policies that will lead to accelerated and
inclusive economic growth and sustainable development over the medium term, as laid out in the
country’s poverty reduction strategy Stratégie de croissance accelérée et de développement durable,
2015-2019 (“Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Durable Development, SCA2D) adopted in 2015.
The strategy is based on strengthening the foundations for strong, sustainable, and inclusive
economic growth, improving the quality of life of the population and guaranteeing equitable
access to social services, preserving the country’s natural and cultural heritage and promoting the
optimal utilization of natural resources, and strengthening good governance. We recognize that a
stable macroeconomic environment is a prerequisite for attaining these objectives. However, to
improve on the initial performance under the strategy, the new government feels that some reprioritizing is needed, particularly toward greater focus on infrastructure investment in the
electricity, road, and telecommunications sectors. The poor state of affairs is significantly
hampering existing economic activity and undermining the attractiveness of Comoros as an
investment destination.
2.
This memorandum of economic and financial policies lays out the Comorian government’s
macroeconomic and structural policies for the period through end-2017, with a particular focus on
the period through March 31, 2017, covered by the requested staff-monitored program (SMP).

II. Economic Context
3.
The new government has inherited a precarious economic situation. Economic growth has
been lackluster in recent years, of the order of 2 percent per annum and below the rate of
population growth. There is serious shortage of job opportunities for the young population of
Comoros. The factors behind this poor growth performance include the persistent electricity
shortages and the slower-than-expected implementation of the foreign-financed public investment
program (PIP). Inflation, although somewhat volatile, has remained broadly contained at around
2 percent per annum, anchored by the exchange rate peg to the euro. Moreover, the large trade
deficit continues to be broadly covered by remittances from the diaspora and project grants. The
international reserve position was greatly bolstered by the Saudi Arabian budget grant at the end
of 2015.
4.
The immediate outlook for the Comorian economy points to continued challenges ahead.
While the electricity situation has improved somewhat because of an improved supply of fuel to
the state-owned electricity company (MAMWE), it is far from resolved. Furthermore, the PIP
continues to encounter delays in financing and execution. Against this background, the
government assumes that the real GDP growth rate will be 2.2 percent in 2016. Through
considerable additional investment in the electricity sector, as well as in other infrastructure sectors,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

UNION OF THE COMOROS

the government foresees a gradual acceleration of the growth rate to 3.5-4 percent over the
medium term.
5.
The fiscal situation and outlook are difficult. The previous government used most of the
budget grant from Saudi Arabia in the amount of €40 million (7.5 percent of GDP) to clear the wage
and salary arrears that had been accumulated in the course of 2015 and remain broadly current on
its obligations through the end of May 2016 when the new government came to power. With the
recourse to additional domestic financing exhausted, the very large imbalance between domestic
revenue mobilization and current spending obligations, has made itself felt with enormous force. A
baseline projection based on the continuation of the trends observed in the first half of 2016 points
to financing gaps of 3-4 percent of GDP in 2016 and 7-8 percent in 2017. With the wage bill
absorbing 80-90 percent of tax revenue in the first half of 2016, this situation is obviously
unsustainable.

III. Fiscal Policy
A. Commitment to Growth in the Context of Fiscal Stability
6.
The new government’s overriding objective is to accelerate inclusive economic growth
through the creation of fiscal space for investment in infrastructure investment that improves the
operating environment for the productive sectors of the economy. The government is acutely aware
that this requires that the imbalance between domestic revenue mobilization and current spending
needs to be radically redressed. The government’s long term objectives are to raise domestic
revenues by 50 percent and reduce public spending by 40 percent and has appointed commissions
with Union and island representatives to develop proposals to these ends. However, the government
recognizes that short-term options are much more limited partly because of the need to take into
account the fragility of Comorian society when considering measures to reduce the wage bill. The
government also recognizes that fiscal stability predicated on balance between available resources
and spending is a precondition of the macroeconomic stability required for sustained growth. It is
against this background that the government has decided on its fiscal policy measures for the
remainder of 2016 and 2017.

IV. Remainder of 2016
7.
For the remainder of 2016, the government’s objective is to avoid incurring arrears on wages
and salaries, and minimize other arrears to the extent possible. The revenue and spending measures
and their impacts are itemized in Table 1.
8.
The revenue measures focus on (i) immediately improving the effectiveness of tax
administration and customs through strengthened leadership; (ii) new measures, including the
application of a 5 percent consumption tax on telecommunication services, the elimination of all
discretionary tax exemptions, and the application of a tax on external business services; and

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNION OF THE COMOROS

(iii) ensuring that the profitable state-owned enterprises contribute additional dividends to the
treasury.
9.
On the spending side, the focus is on (i) eliminating unnecessary and irregular spending on
goods and services; and (ii) containing the wage bill in the short-term by cancelling all employment
contracts granted since January 1, 2016.
10.
At this time, the government does not expect to receive any external budget support
beyond the US$3 million anticipated from the World Bank. Moreover, the government’s general
policy is to use one-off resource, such as from occasional budget support grants such as the one
from Saudi Arabia, for one-off expenditure, such as state-enterprise restructuring, or for building
buffers against external shocks, including natural disasters. We have, therefore, agreed to an
adjustor for the use of un expected external budget support that limits the use of such support to
one-half of the amount received (quantitative indicator, Table 2).
11.
These measures should allow the government to fully pay all wages and salaries due in 2016,
leaving only a small financing gap (about ½ percent of GDP) resulting in the accumulation of arrears
of the same magnitude.
A. Budget for 2017
12.
The government is in the process of preparing a budget proposal for 2017 based on the
macroeconomic framework agreed with IMF staff. It is based on a realistic but ambitious revenue
target. It also aims to further contain the public sector wage bill through better control of the
number and salaries of public sector employees at both Union and island levels. With the measures
outlined in Table 1 and based on the further revenue administration and public financial
management reforms outlined below, the projected financing gap has been significantly reduced
from that of the baseline, to 2-3 percent of GDP, for which we intend to seek external budget
support through a donors’ conference, which the government is planning for the first half of 2017.
B. Revenue Administration
13.
The new government underscores its firm commitment to revenue administration (RA)
reform. It recognizes that, at the institutional level, both the general tax administration (AGID) and
customs administration need to be strengthened and has already taken steps to this end although
more is needed.
14.
In designing revenue administration reforms, the government has taken its lead from IMF
tax administration TA provided in July 2016. The main near-term reforms are listed in the structural
measures table (Table 3) and include (i)concentrating the tax treatment of all large companies,
including state-owned enterprises, in the large tax payers unit on Ngazidja (Grande Comore);
(ii) expanding the lists of large and small and medium-sized tax payers and ensuring that those on
the lists pay their taxes; and (iii) introducing a clear classification system, interfaced with the
information system Sydonia, as a first step to improving the management of the tax and customs

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

UNION OF THE COMOROS

exemption regime. A comprehensive program with additional reforms based on the provided TA is
being developed.

V. Public Financial Management
15.
The new government aims to build on progress already made in strengthening public
financial management (PFM) by focusing on strengthening control of the wage bill and addressing
remaining weaknesses relating to cash management and budgeting and budget execution, as well
as transparency (structural measures, Table 3). In particular, we will (i) ensure that the central registry
of public sector workers (GISE) covers the Union and the three islands and that only workers in the
registry are paid; (ii) strengthen the preparation of the table for central government financial
operations (TOFE); (iii) undertake a comprehensive audit of domestic arrears at the Union level; and
(iv) ensure that all receipts from the single tax on petroleum products (TUPP) accrue to the single
treasury account and that all of the offsets between the government, the state-owned oil importing
company (SCH), and the state-owned electricity company (MAMWE) are eliminated. Moreover, the
treasury and central bank will organize monthly meetings to reconcile treasury cash flow data with
bank data.

VI. Debt Management
16.
The new government is committed to a prudent debt management strategy. It recognizes
that Comoros’ rating of moderate risk of debt distress provides some scope for additional external
borrowing. Presently, apart from a concessional loan from the Export-Import Bank of India of
US$33 million for the construction of a heavy fuel oil electricity generation plan, and a US$32 million
loan from China to strengthen the domestic telecommunications infrastructure, the government has
neither contracted nor guaranteed any other external loans. For the foreseeable future, the
government will continue to borrow only on concessional terms and only for high-priority projects
that bring a clear economic benefit based on thorough feasibility studies and after consultations
with the staffs of the IMF and the WB.
17.
The new government is committed to meeting its external debt service obligations on time
and in full. To this end, the government has instructed the Treasury to clear all remaining external
arrears by the end of 2016 and thereafter to pay all debt service as it falls due in close collaboration
with the Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance and the central bank. To formalize this process,
the central bank will develop a foreign exchange cash flow table that incorporates all debt service
payments due by end-2016 for which the treasury will issue a standing payment order (structural
benchmark, Table 3)

VII. Monetary and Financial Sector Policy
18.
The new government attaches great importance to Comoros’ monetary cooperation
agreement with France which simultaneously pegs the Comorian Franc to the euro and anchors
fiscal policy through the ceiling on statutory advances from the central bank to the treasury based

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNION OF THE COMOROS

on the average of internal revenue over the previous three years. The government envisages no
changes to these arrangements.
19.
The central bank (BCC) remains committed to further strengthening banking supervision and
the monitoring of financial sector stability. The government and the BCC will also continue to closely
monitor developments in the postal bank (SNPSF), including through participation in a government
committee established to make proposals on how the bank’s difficulties can be resolved. The
government is committed to preparing an action plan for the resolution of the bank’s difficulties by
March 31, 2017 (structural benchmark, Table 3).
20.
The central bank will also continue working closely with the Ministry of Justice to address
weaknesses in the application of the legal provisions with respect to the recovery of doubtful and
disputed receivables, which currently is a serious impediment to the ability and willingness of the
banks to extend credit.

VIII. Energy Sector
21.
The new government is keenly aware that persistent electricity shortages and blackouts are
significant obstacles to economic growth and development in Comoros and is determined to
overcome them as soon as possible. For immediate relief, the government has purchased several
diesel-fueled generators with a combined capacity of 25 MW. The government expects to take
delivery of these generators in early 2017 and pay for them from budgetary resources in the same
year. The government has also affirmed its support for the heavy-fuel plant being financed with a
concessional loan from the EXIM Bank of India. These two projects will provide a firm supply
foundation for the electricity sector in Comoros over the medium term.
22.
The government is also working with the World Bank and African Development Bank on a
longer term strategy to strengthen the technical, management, and commercial capacity of MAMWE
and minimize the dependence on expensive diesel oil for electricity generation by diversifying to
solar, wind, and geothermal energy.

IX. Telecommunication Sector
23.
The government is committed to lowering the cost and improving the quality of
telecommunication services in Comoros through increased competition. To this end, the
government will provide a level field of competition between Comores Telecom and TELCO, the
holder of the new telecommunications license. We expect the new company to begin to offer
services to customers once it has made the requisite investments in infrastructure in late 2016.

X. Economic Data
24.
The government recognizes that Comorian economic data have serious shortcomings and
deficiencies in all sectors that hamper economic analysis and policy formulation and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

UNION OF THE COMOROS

implementation. The government is committed to ensuring that INSEED will have sufficient
resources to collect timely price data and to continue its updating of the national accounts.

XI. Program monitoring
25.
The staff-monitored program (SMP) will be monitored based quantitative indicators (Table
2) and structural measures (Table 3). The first review will be based on targets for December 31, 2016
and the second on targets for March 31, 2017.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) defines the concepts and data
reporting procedures mentioned in the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) for
the Staff Monitored program covering the period October 1, 2016-March 31, 2017, prepared by the
authorities of the Union of the Comoros. It describes more specifically: (a) definitions and
computation methods; (b) quantitative targets; and (c) adjusters of the quantitative targets;
(d) structural measures; (e) reporting procedures; and (f) other commitments taken within the
framework of the MEFP.

I. DEFINITIONS AND COMPUTATION METHODS
2.
Unless otherwise indicated below, the term government is meant to include the
government of the Union of the Comoros and the autonomous island governments. Local
governments, the central bank, and any government-owned entity with independent legal status are
excluded from the definition of government. The units covered under this definition of government
are consolidated for purposes of the program.
3.
Total tax revenue is tax revenue as defined in the Government Finance Statistics Manual of
2001 (GFSM 2001, Chapter 5) and is recorded on a cash basis. Proceeds from the Economic
Citizenship Program and asset sales as well as external grants are not considered government
revenue for the purposes of measuring revenue performance under the program.
4.
Total government expenditure is the sum of expenditure on wages and salaries of
government employees, goods and services, transfers (including subsidies, grants, social benefits,
and other expenses), interest payments, and capital expenditure. With the exception of capital
expenditure, which is defined as in GFSM 1986, all other spending items are defined as in GFSM
2001 (paragraphs 6.1-6.88). Total government expenditure also includes expenditure executed
before payment authorization and not yet regularized. Total domestically financed social spending
(current and capital) is calculated for each category of current expenditure (wages, goods and
services, transfers and subsidies) and capital expenditure as: (1) expenditure executed by the
Ministry of Health (under “health”), and (2) expenditure executed by the Ministry of Education
(under “education”).
5.
Domestically-financed social spending is defined as health and education expenditures
based on the 2015 fiscal outturn. Total domestically-financed current and capital social spending
includes social spending financed by domestic resources, including revenues, domestic financing,
and general external budget support, and excludes all social spending financed by project-specific
foreign grants and/or loans.
6.
The consolidated domestic primary fiscal balance (payment order basis) is calculated as
total government revenue (defined above), less expenditure, excluding interest payments, and
foreign-financed technical assistance and capital expenditure. The consolidated fiscal balance
(cash basis) is calculated as the difference between total revenues and grants and total spending,
including net lending and net changes in arrears.
52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNION OF THE COMOROS

7.
Net domestic credit to the government is defined as overall net credit extended to the
government from domestic bank and non-bank sources as recorded in the central bank’s net credit
to government table. Net bank credit to the government reflects the net debt position of the
government vis-à-vis the central bank, commercial banks, and the National Postal and Financial
Services Company (SNPSF), as well as microfinance institutions. It is the difference between the
government’s gross indebtedness to the banking system and its claims on the banking system.
These government claims include all deposits at the central bank and commercial banks, as well as
Treasury cash holdings. The government’s debt to the banking system includes central bank credit
(statutory advances, as well as any long-term credit) and commercial bank credit, as well as net
deposits at the SNPSF. For purposes of program monitoring, net credit to the government excludes
net credit to the IMF and movements in donor accounts at the central bank beyond the control of
the government.
8.
Debt is defined as in Point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to
Foreign Debt (Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140), as amended by Executive Board Decision
No. 14416-(09/91), effective December 1, 2009), but also includes contracted or guaranteed
commitments by the government for which value has not been received.
9.
Loan concessionality is assessed on the basis of the grant element of a debt. For program
purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at least 35 percent. The grant
element of a debt is the difference between the present value (PV) of debt and its nominal value,
expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its
contracting is calculated by discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on this
debt using a unified discount rate of 5 percent.
10.
New domestic payment arrears of the government are defined as any of the following:
(i) invoice that a spending ministry has received from a supplier of goods and services, delivered and
verified, and for which payment has not been made within 90 days from the date the payment order
(ordonnancement) was cleared; (ii) in the case of specific contracts between the suppliers and the
government, any invoice received and not paid on the due date stipulated in the contracts; (iii) tax
credits confirmed by the proper authorities after review, and not paid within 60 days from the date
when the payment order was issued; or (iv) wages and salaries and any payments to a government
employee that were due to be paid in a given month but remained unpaid on the 15th day of the
following month.
11.
External payments arrears are defined as the sum of payments due (including interest)
but unpaid on outstanding external debt that has been contracted or guaranteed by the
government, with the exception of external payments arrears arising from public debt being
renegotiated with creditors, including Paris Club members.

II. QUANTITATIVE TARGETS AND ADJUSTERS
12.
The quantitative targets of the program are specified in Table 2 of the MEFP. Unless
stated otherwise, all quantitative targets will be assessed cumulatively from the beginning of the
calendar year to which they apply.

UNION OF THE COMOROS



A floor on government tax revenues.



A ceiling on net domestic credit to the government. For program monitoring purposes,
this ceiling will be adjusted downward for one half of budget support in excess of KMF 1,500
million before end-December 2016 and one half of any budge support received in the first
quarter of 2017.



A floor on domestically financed social spending.



A ceiling on the accumulation of domestic payment arrears by the government of KMF
2001.1 million by end-December 2016 and zero by end of the first quarter 2017. This ceiling
will be assessed continuously.



A zero ceiling on the accumulation of external payments arrears by the government.
This ceiling will be assessed continuously.



A ceiling on the contracting or guaranteeing of debt by the government on nonconcessional terms. Normal short-term import credits (e.g., revolving credit lines) are
excluded, these being self-liquidating operations because the sales of imports are used to
repay the debt. This ceiling will be assessed continuously.



A ceiling on the contracting or guaranteeing of new short-term external debt. Shortterm debt refers to debt with an original maturity of one year or less. Normal short-term
import credits (e.g., revolving credit lines) are excluded, these being self-liquidating
operations because the sales of imports are used to repay the debt. This ceiling will be
assessed continuously.



A floor on the payment of external debt service arrears by end-December 2016 of KMF
644.5 million.

Summary of Safeguards Assessment. The last safeguards assessment was conducted in
2010. The BCC continues to publish its annual audited financial statements, but has not yet
implemented International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The assessment also
recommended that the bank establish an internal audit function, progress on which has been
slow. IX. Implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI): Not applicable.
Exchange Rate Arrangements: The currency of Comoros is the Comorian franc, which is
pegged to the Euro at €1 = CF 492. Comoros has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

Article IV Consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded on February 4, 2015
(Country Report No. 15/34). Directors welcomed Comoros’s improved policy implementation
and economic performance in recent years. However, they noted that significant challenges
remained - including high poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and vulnerabilities characteristic
of small island economies. They saw achieving fiscal stability as a key near-term objective,
encouraging the authorities to strike a better balance between available resources and
expenditures and calling for efforts to strengthen revenue mobilization and public financial
management by implementing quick-win reforms in both areas. Directors also cautioned
against excessive reliance on the potentially volatile proceeds from the Economic Citizenship
Program. They further stressed the need to develop the financial sector and expedite the pace
of structural reforms in order to boost external competitiveness and growth prospects.

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK GROUP
A. Bank Group’s Support in Comoros
The African Development Bank Group (AfDB) started its operations in Comoros in 1977
and has since then approved seventeen (18) operations and one (2) economic and sector work
(ESW). Cumulative Bank Group commitments net of cancellation amounted to UA 78.26 million as of
October 2016. These operations targeted the public sector and were mainly financed from ADF
resources (87.6 percent). One (1) port infrastructure project was financed through the ADB window for
a net UA 9.67 million representing 12.4 percent of total net commitments. In addition, the AfDB
approved three (3) emergency operations to assist in mitigating the adverse impact of the food crisis
in 2008 (UA 1.5 million) and support victims of floods in 2009 and in 2012 (UA 1.28 million). Since
2009, in addition to the ADF, Comoros are eligible for Pillars I and III of the Fragile States Facilities
(FSF), on which they have received additional resources of UA 21.46 million. On the Pillar I, Comoros
received UA 10 million in ADF 12 and UA 15 million in ADF 13 e), respectively addressed to support
Energy Sector in the ADF 12 and Road sector in the ADF 13. The resources on Pillar III have supported
the statistical capacity building in the PRCI (UA 595.000), the preparation of SCA2D (UA 241.000), and
recently the assistance to private sector (UA 625.000). In November 2015, the Bank approved a PRCI
phase 2 under the resources of pillar I of TSF (UA 6 million)

Overall, AfDB operations in Comoros have been mainly directed toward supporting
economic-related infrastructure, support to public finances and improvement of rural
livelihoods. They have primarily concerned Energy sector (69.89 per cent), and multi-sector
(30.10 percent).

B.

Strategic Orientation

The Bank Group concretely re-engaged in Comoros in 2010 following the resolution of
the Anjouan crisis and the lifting of sanctions in February 2009 after clearance of its arrears with
the Bank. A two-year Interim Country Strategy Paper (I-CSP) 2009-2010 focusing on economic and
financial governance and water and sanitation was approved in April 2009. In December 2011, the
Board of the AfDB approved a full Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for 2011–2015 based on a single pillar
focusing on the energy sector in support of economic diversification. This new CSP draws on the
Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for 2010-2014 and spans over two ADF cycles ADF 12 and ADF 13. In April 2016, the Bank approved a second full CSP for 2016-2020, based one
single pillar: Developing basic energy and road infrastructure to support economic diversification. The
current CSP is aligned on the national Strategy of growth and sustainable development (SCA2D 20152019) and is financed by ADF 13 and 14 resources, corresponding to a total amount of UA 40 million,
including
UA 10 million from the Transition States Facility (TSF). These resources will primarily aim to finance (i) a

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

UNION OF THE COMOROS

road project (UA 15 million), (ii) an energy investment project (UA 10 million), and (iii) a sectoral
budget support –energy and road- operation (UA 15 million) whose main objective will be to support
government efforts in rehabilitation of roads and energy sectors in which the country faces major
challenges.
Moreover, aware of the weak of institutional capacity of Comoros, the Bank approved, in
November 2015, the second Phase of the Project of Institutional capacity building (PRIC 2) to
strengthen the operationalization of Tax department (AGID), improve the capacity of
programming and management of public investment (CGP), and improve the effectiveness of
the department in charge of energy (DGME).

5.
As of October 2016, the Bank’s ongoing portfolio in resources amounts to UA
22.005 million comprising 4 operations: (i) Energy Sector Support Project (ii) Energy
Production, Transport & Distribution Plan, (iii) Private Sector Support Project, and (iv) the
Institutional Capacities Building (PRCI 2). A Midterm review of CSP combined to Country Portfolio
Performance Review (CPPR) is planned in 2018.

C. Non Lending Activities
6.
Along with other developing partners, the AfDB aims to provide Comoros’s authorities
with policy advice and decision tools on key strategic directions with the objective of leveraging
and sustaining economic growth over the medium-long term. In this respect, the first phase of a
study on the sources of growth in Comoros was completed in December 2010 and provided a series of
preliminary key recommendations on ways of boosting growth and improving the economic and
business climate. A second ESW concerning Fragility study is achieved in April 2014, to support the
finalization of SCA2D.

STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
Inadequate staffing, funding, and institutional environment undermine the accuracy and
comparability of almost all macroeconomic statistics, with the partial exception of monetary and
financial statistics.
National accounts. The latest estimates for GDP are for 2008 and therefore inadequate for
surveillance. Source data from either surveys or administrative sources do not support
compilation of key aggregates required to compile GDP. The national statistical office lacks
adequate financial resources, staff capacity, and institutional environment. The authorities have
made limited progress implementing recommendations of technical assistance to produce a GDP
time series by extrapolating from the current base year (2007). No quarterly estimates are
produced.
Consumer prices. The accuracy and reliability of the consumer price index (CPI) represents
another key source of uncertainty. Expenditure weights are based on a survey from the late
1980s and sub-indices are compiled irregularly across the islands. Most price data are collected
only for the country’s capital. CPI compilation is largely conducted by one person. The African
Development Bank assigned an international Expert from May 2011 to January 2012, who helped
the NSI to design a new consumer price index (CPI). Baskets of products, expenditure weights,
collection locations as well as calculation techniques were revised. An IT tool was implemented
and the responsible official was trained in managing the whole compilation process. Next STA
Technical Assistance mission dedicated to price statistics is planned for November 2016.
Government finance statistics. In August/September 2005 an STA mission found that the
public chart of accounts did not accurately record the execution of the budget and that a
standardized presentation on outstanding public debt is not compiled. Classification of
budgetary data is often not consistent over time or across the islands. In particular, problems
arise in data on domestic arrears, external debt, and external support, including its investment
spending components, complicating fiscal analysis. An August 2016 STA mission proposed
various steps to improve compilation and quality of data.
Monetary and financial statistics. The Central Bank of Comoros (BCC) produces adequate
monetary statistics on its own accounts, for the commercial banks, the development bank, the
deposits collected by the Société nationale des postes et des services financiers (chèques
postaux and saving passbooks), and for two microfinance networks. The Franc Zone arrangement
has established accounting and prudential standards that prevent data disruptions. A major
shortcoming is the absence of data on the large amount of Euro cash in circulation,
handicapping surveillance. In June 2009 the BCC started reporting monetary and financial
statistics to the IMF using Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). The current presentation and

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNION OF THE COMOROS

content of monetary statistics accords largely with the methodology in the IMF’s Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual 2000.
1.
External sector statistics. Despite technical assistance and some improvements over the
past few years, shortcomings in coverage and compilation continue to affect accuracy and
reliability. Currently two BCC economist are responsible for compiling balance of payments
statistics. The last TA mission (January 2016) recommended the recruitment of one additional
staff, to assure regular compilation of balance of payments (BP) and the development of the
International Investment Position (IIP).

II. Data Standards and Quality
Comoros has participated in the enhanced
General Data Dissemination System (eGDDS)
since May 2015 and disseminates metadata for
11 of the 15 recommended data categories, as
well as one supplementary category (producer
price index).

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA
National accounts: Comoros is not reporting any national accounts data to STA.
Consumer prices: In July 2015 Comoros delivered to STA a set of monthly consumer price
indexes covering period January 2000 – October 2014. Since then no further reporting.
Government finance statistics: There is no regular compilation and dissemination of fiscal data
(TOFE). No GFS data are reported to GFSY or IFS. Data are compiled on GFSM 1986 / TOFE basis,
only when it is requested by the African Department; this data is incomplete (both transactional
and institutional coverage) and thus data do not accurately reflect the fiscal position. The last TA
mission (June 2016) noted deficient material and technical resources.
Monetary and financial statistics: Comoros reports MFS data for the depository corporations
on a monthly basis using the standardized report forms (SRFs). The institutional coverage of
monetary statistics does not include other financial corporations.
Financial Soundness Indicators: Comoros has begun reporting Financial Soundness Indicators
(FSIs) to STA on a regular basis, with monthly/annual data beginning in 2010 M1.
External sector statistics: Only annual BP data are reported to STA; the most recent dataset
(received in 2014) is related to year 2012. Data on IIP and External Debt are not reported.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION;
AND STAFF-MONITORED PROGRAM—DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By
David Owen (IMF) and
Ms. Anos-Casero (IDA)

Prepared by the staff of the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank Group.

Based on an updated external LIC DSA, Comoros’ risk of debt distress continues to be
assessed as moderate. The inclusion of remittances in the analysis remains a key factor
underlying the debt sustainability outlook but is also a source of vulnerability. The results
also highlight that it is essential that any eventual future borrowing take place on
concessional terms. Public sector domestic debt and private sector external debt are
minimal in Comoros and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future.1

1

Comoros’ three-year average CPIA score is 2.77, implying a weak policy performance rating for the current
DSA.

UNION OF THE COMOROS

BACKGROUND
1.
Comoros reached the completion point under the HIPC Initiative in December 2012.
Following agreements with all but one bilateral creditors2, Comoros received extensive irrevocable debt
relief in 2013 which resulted in a decline in nominal external debt from 40.5 percent of GDP at end-2012 to
18.5 percent at end-2013 (Table A1). Moreover, all the debt and debt service indicators were brought
below their respective thresholds of the debt sustainability framework. Since the completion point,
Comoros has contracted only one loan, with a concessionality level close to 50 percent, with India of about
$33 million for the construction of a heavy-fuel electricity generation plant. Disbursements on this loan, the
first of which was made in 2015, are anticipated to continue through 2017. Disbursements of an earlier
loan, on similarly concessional terms, with China of $32.3 million for strengthening the domestic
telecommunications infrastructure began in 2015.3

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
2.
The medium to long-term macroeconomic assumptions for the DSA are broadly similar to
those for the previous DSA prepared in connection with the 2014 Article IV consultation and
released in February 2015 (Text Table 2). However, the DSA update reflects the economic difficulties that
Comoros is facing as a result of the electricity crisis and ongoing fiscal challenges.



Real Growth in 2015 is estimated at 1 percent compared to a projected 3.5 percent in the DSA for the
2014 Article IV report. Moreover, the growth projection for 2016 has been lowered from 4 percent in the
previous DSA to 2.2 percent currently, amidst a persistent and deep electricity crisis and a poor business
environment that is adversely impacting the economy. Thereafter, economic growth is projected to
converge gradually to an average of 4 percent growth per year as in the previous DSA, due to a more
stable political environment, the coming online of the heavy-fuel plant that will improve the energy supply,
the arrival of a new operator in the telecommunication sector, and improvements in infrastructure resulting
from a more effective execution of the public investment program in roads, hospitals and schools.



Inflation is expected to remain moderate, at a projected 2.0 percent per year in the medium term, guided
by the exchange rate peg to the euro and the monetary cooperation agreement with France.



The current account deficit is projected to average around 10 percent of GDP per year over the medium
term. This largely reflects an increase in imports stemming from current investment projects in the energy
and telecom sectors and a stagnation of exports relative to the size of national income.4 Indeed, as in the
previous DSA, the growth of imports in volume terms is expected to far outstrip that of exports in the
medium term. The current account deficit is assumed to remain stable at around 10 percent of GDP by the
end of the projection period, representing continuing net resource transfers to Comoros in the form of
external financing (both grants and loans, as well as some foreign investment) in support of growth and
development.

4

While exports are expected to grow at the pace of world trade in the medium term, as a percentage of GDP they
are projected to remain steady at about 17 percent of GDP over the forecast horizon.



Gross private remittances received from the diaspora in France, which have been resilient in the face of
recession and slowdown in Europe, are projected to continue to grow in nominal terms but decline
gradually relative to GDP, from 26.9 percent of GDP in 2016 to about 24 percent in 2020 and 19.0 percent
by 2035.5 This represents an upward revision relative to the previous DSA. These remittances are assumed
to continue to finance the bulk of imports to Comoros.



Gross investment in support of growth is projected to rise. Investment is projected to average
20.8 percent of GDP over the medium term and rise slightly thereafter.



Public investment is projected to on average account for more than half of investment in the medium
term, initially mainly financed by project grants. Over time, foreign borrowing (on concessional terms; an
average grant element of 42 percent, corresponding to non-Paris Club bilateral terms in the LIC DSA
template) is assumed to gradually replace some of the grant financing so that by 2036 grants account for
two-thirds of foreign-financed capital spending and loans with concessionality levels close to 50 percent for
one-third. After a hump in 2016 and 2017 due to the disbursement of the Indian and Chinese loans, new
external borrowing is assumed to rise from 2.1 percent of GDP in 2018 to 4.25 percent in 2036, averaging
US$45 million per year. This assumption of increased external borrowing over time plays an important role
in the DSA and largely explains the upward slope of the debt burden indicators in the baseline. While this
assumption is not based on any concrete borrowing plans, it seems reasonable to expect that the share of
grant financing in overall financing will decline, and that of loan financing rise, over time, at least in relative
terms, even though per capita income is projected to increase only slowly over the next two decades. It is
anticipated that investments associated with external borrowing will be made in infrastructure such as
electricity, roads, tourism, and other sectors. Domestically-financed capital spending is projected to rise
modestly over the projection period. No domestic borrowing by the government is assumed.



The overall fiscal overall deficit is projected to average 4.7 percent of GDP in the medium term, reflecting
Comoros’ ongoing fiscal challenges related to revenue mobilization and containing current spending. Due
principally to Comoros’ ambitious public investment program, intended to address their urgent
development needs, the fiscal balance is expected to remain in deficit over the long term. It is expected
that the deficit will be mainly financed through external loans for investment purposes.

5

Historical remittance figures are based on central bank data, which are prepared according to the BPM5
methodology and the corresponding definition of remittances. Projections of remittances are based on consultations
with the authorities. The remittances play an important role in the DSA and a faster decline relative to GDP than
assumed would adversely affect the debt sustainability outlook.

EXTERNAL DSA
3.
Comoros qualifies for the inclusion of private remittances in the denominator of the debt
and debt service indicators for the purposes of the baseline of the DSA. For Comoros, private
remittance inflows represent a large source of foreign exchange—currently estimated to be in excess of
27 percent of GDP—and sizable inflows are expected to continue over the medium to long term. That said,
the debt sustainability outlook is highly sensitive to the level of remittance flows, which more than doubled
relative to GDP in the decade to 2014, and are potentially subject to downside risk should the economic
slowdown in Europe continue.
4.
The baseline scenario is broadly in line with that of the previous DSA although there has
been a marginal improvement in debt burden indicators. Whereas in the previous DSA, the ratio of PV
debt-to-exports and remittances breached the threshold toward the end of the projection period, in the
current DSA this ratio only rises to the threshold by the end of the projection period. All other debt or debt
service burden indicators are well below their respective thresholds in the baseline scenario (Figure A1;
Tables A1 and A2). The improvement in the debt-to-exports indicator reflects a combination of factors, on
the negative side the inclusion of the Chinese and Indian loans, which were not included in the previous
DSA, while on the positive side the higher remittances.
5.
The results of the stress tests and alternative scenarios share similarities and differences with
those under the previous DSA. As before, the ratio of the PV of debt to exports plus remittances shows a
breach of its threshold under a stress test. Whereas previously the most severe stress test was that to nondebt creating flows (chiefly remittances), this time around the shock to the terms of new borrowing is the
most critical.6 Also in contrast to the previous DSA, currently the ratio of debt to GDP plus remittances, as
well as the PV of debt to revenue ratio, moderately breach the threshold towards the end of the projection
period under a one-time depreciation shock.7 The potential impact of these two shocks on Comoros’ debt
sustainability highlights the importance of a prudent debt management strategy, particularly as relates to
obtaining loans on concessional terms, as well as the stability provided by the exchange rate peg of the
Comorian Franc to the Euro under the monetary cooperation agreement with France. Under the historical
scenario, the initial improvement in the debt and debt service indicators mainly reflects that the projected
current account deficits in the baseline are larger than the historical deficits over the medium term. The
historical scenario is, therefore, over-financed during this period.

6

Refers to public sector loans on less favorable terms during the period 2016 – 36. Less favorable terms are defined
as 2 percent increase in the interest rate for new borrowing, which would see the grant element of new borrowing at
30 percent or below from 2017 onwards.

Defined as a one-time 30 percent annual depreciation relative to the baseline in 2017.

CONCLUSION
6.
It is the view of the staffs of the IMF and the World Bank, shared by the authorities, that the
updated DSA warrants maintaining a moderate risk of debt distress rating for Comoros. The impact
of the somewhat higher borrowing (Chinese and Indian loans) than assumed previously has been offset by
the higher remittances. While there are no breaches of debt or debt service thresholds in the baseline and
only a modest breach of the threshold in three stress tests, the DSA continues to underline the critical role
that remittances play in maintaining the moderate risk of debt distress rating. As such, Comoros remains
vulnerable to shocks to remittance inflows, increasing the importance of fostering a climate conducive to
the productive use of remittances, and limiting the recourse to external financing, particularly on nonconcessional terms. The analysis also highlights the importance of striving to maintain higher growth levels
compared to historical average by implementing planned structural reforms in infrastructure and the
businesses environment and the electricity and the telecom sectors in a timely fashion. The considerable
amounts of external borrowing built into the DSA also underscore the need to strengthen debt
management capacity.

Introduction

The Comorian economy is facing growing macroeconomic imbalances. To help address these
imbalances and also create the conditions for a higher, more sustainable growth, the
authorities have requested the assistance of the IMF under a Staff Monitored Program. The
staff’s advice has been invaluable, helping to formulate strong reform measures, particularly
in the fiscal area in which the design of a reform program has appropriately focused on
strengthening further revenue administration and public financial management.
2.

Policy Context

Following presidential elections held in April 2016, and declared free and transparent by
international observers, the newly elected president, Mr. Azali Assoumani, appointed a
government with a mandate to take immediate actions to address the country’s weak fiscal
revenue collection and the high public sector wage bill. The authorities recognize that a
stable macroeconomic environment is a prerequisite for reviving economic growth. They are
also aware that a precondition for macroeconomic stability is fiscal stability based on a
balance between available resources and expenditures. However, fiscal imbalances in
Comoros are deep-rooted and structural in nature. These result notably from a particularly
narrow production base, which typically characterizes island economies like Comoros. The
country also lacks the kind of dominant industries that are found in other small states notably
tourism, and a financial sector. In addition, the Comorian economy is dominated by the
public sector with no alternative engines of growth.
The authorities are determined to achieve progress in their efforts to address fiscal
imbalances. In this process, the assistance of multilateral and bilateral partners will be
critically important. My authorities are grateful to the country’s partners for their continued
technical and financial support.
The country’s weak business environment continues to hamper economic activity due to
persistent electricity shortages, a largely run down road network, and a costly and inefficient
telecommunications sector. To address these bottlenecks, the authorities are also taking steps
to accelerate the implementation of their development strategy adopted in 2015 (Stratégie de
croissance accelérée et de développement durable, 2015-2019). As part of this strategy,
greater focus is put on infrastructure investment in the electricity, road, and
telecommunications sectors to overcome obstacles to growth. In addition, the authorities are
aware that improving other aspects of the business environment, including the legal and
judicial framework, will be key to boosting private sector activity over the medium term.
However, Comoros’ limited natural resource endowment and a small market impede the
realization of economies of scale, making the authorities’ aim of further enhancing growth

outcomes particularly challenging. Addressing these deep-rooted challenges requires a
comprehensive approach to the development of the country and progress will be dependent
on a strong and sustained involvement of donors.
The authorities would like to reiterate their strong commitment to build a sound track record
under the SMP, with a view to paving the way for an ECF-supported program as soon as
possible. Such a Fund-supported program will contribute to addressing more effectively
longer term challenges facing the country and helping catalyze donor support. The authorities
remain committed to a prudent debt management strategy and aim to continue contracting
external borrowing only on concessional terms and also only for high-priority projects that
bring a clear economic benefit to the country’s growth potential.

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook

Persistent electricity shortages and the slower-than-expected implementation of the public
investment program have largely contributed to the country’s recent weak growth
performance. The economy grew only at an average of 1.5 percent between 2014 and 2015,
and growth is projected to reach 2.2 percent in 2016. Inflation was moderate at about 2
percent in 2014-15, thanks largely to the fixed exchange rate system which continues to serve
the country well. The international reserve position has reached a strong 9.1 months of
imports in 2015 thanks in large part to external grant and remittances.
The fiscal situation, however, continues to be particularly challenging due to the very large
imbalance between the country’s domestic revenues and current expenditures. The wage bill,
in particular, absorbs 80-90 percent of tax revenues. Should this unsustainable trend
continue, the financing gaps would reach 3-4 percent of GDP in 2016 and 7-8 percent in
2017.
The overall outlook for the Comorian economy remains challenging, as well. The public
investment program continues to encounter delays in execution and financing, and the
electricity situation is yet to be resolved. To address the persistent electricity shortages, the
authorities have recently invested in power generation and intend to continue taking steps in
this direction. This will provide much-needed additional electricity supply in Comoros over
the medium term. In the telecommunication sector, the authorities intend to lower the cost
and improve the quality of telecommunication services in Comoros through increased
competition between Comores Télécom and TELCO, the holder of the new
telecommunications license.
These investments in the electricity and telecommunications sectors, along with other
infrastructure projects should help raise growth over the medium term to approximately 3.5-4
percent.

Policy Agenda and Implementation

The authorities’ main policies focus on containing the imbalance between domestic revenue
mobilization and current spending. They plan to undertake a number of fiscal policy
measures for end-2016 and 2017. These revenue measures include the application of a 5
percent consumption tax on telecommunication services, and also ensuring that the profitable
state-owned enterprises contribute additional dividends to the treasury. On the spending side,
the main focus is on containing the wage bill by cancelling all employment contracts granted
since January 1, 2016.
The authorities’ budget proposal for 2017 will be prepared based on the macroeconomic
framework agreed with Fund staff under the SMP. It aims at further containing the public
sector wage bill through better control of the number and salaries of public sector employees.
The main near-term revenue administration reforms are derived from recent Fund TA, and
include concentrating the tax treatment of all large companies in the large tax payers’ unit
located on Grande Comore, and expanding the lists of large and small and medium-sized tax
payers while ensuring that those on the lists pay their taxes.
The authorities intend to implement a number of measures and reforms to strengthen public
financial management. These measures will help ensure that the central registry of public
sector workers covers the Union and the three islands and that only workers in the registry
are paid. The authorities will also undertake a comprehensive audit of domestic arrears at the
Union level, and make sure that all of the offsets between the government, the state-owned
oil importing company, and the state-owned electricity company are eliminated.
The authorities share the staff’s assessment that the Comorian financial system is overall
adequately capitalized and liquid but that banks’ profitability had been sluggish, the ratio of
non-performing loans rising, and provisioning lagging. Against this backdrop, the central
bank remains committed to continuing to closely monitoring financial sector stability. The
government and the central bank will also continue to monitor developments in the postal
bank (SNPSF) and will prepare an action plan for the resolution of the bank’s difficulties by
March 31, 2017.

Conclusion

The Comorian authorities are determined to undertake all necessary adjustment measures to
reduce macroeconomic imbalances and place Comoros on a sustainable growth path. They
look forward to embarking on a medium-term program of reforms with the Fund’s support,
under an ECF arrangement. The authorities believe that such an arrangement with a
particular focus on addressing the country’s structural impediments to growth would help
catalyze donors’ assistance to address the country’s macroeconomic and structural
challenges.
