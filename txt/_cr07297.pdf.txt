Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Tonga
Approved by Steven Dunaway and Anthony Boote
June 25, 2007

Discussions: Nuku’alofa, April 11–20, 2007. The team met with Prime Minister Sevele,
Minister of Finance ‘Utoikamanu, National Reserve Bank of Tonga Governor Mafi, and
other senior government officials.
Team: Messrs. D’Hoore (head), and Mses. Amornvivat and Fujita (all APD). Mr. Gordon
(APD) and Ms. Sucharitakul (OED) joined the discussions.
Political and Economic Context: Tonga, a constitutional monarchy with substantial
powers assigned to the King and the nobility, is in the midst of a difficult transition. Prodemocracy riots broke out in the capital city in November 2006, resulting in extensive
damage and disruptions to economic activity. On the policy front, a 70 percent wage award
to civil servants in 2005, and a large redundancy program in 2006, have put strains on the
budget.
Exchange Rate: Tonga’s currency, the pa’anga, is pegged to a basket of currencies
(comprising the US, Australian, and New Zealand dollars, and the yen), with the
arrangement allowing monthly deviations of up to 5 percent from the peg. Tonga has
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. Tonga presently imposes an
exchange restriction subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a), in the form of tax
certification requirement imposed on certain current international transactions.
Outreach: Staff met with business leaders, donors, and representatives of the diplomatic
corps.
Statistical Issues: Tonga’s data quality remains hampered by deficiencies that complicate
surveillance of policies.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

The economy has experienced large shocks. Following the 70 percent civil service
wage award in late 2005, almost 20 percent of civil servants took voluntary redundancy
in mid-2006, at large cost to the budget. Riots in November 2006 caused serious damage
to the capital city’s business district, and disrupted economic activity. Real GDP is
projected to fall by 3½ percent in the fiscal year ending in June 2007. Yet the economy
appears to be recovering; and inflation has continued to decline, owing largely to a tight
credit policy and the maintenance of a basket peg.

•

Cautious conduct of fiscal and monetary policy has helped to contain the negative
impact of the wage settlement. The strains on the fiscal position due to the wage
settlement and redundancy payments were partly contained through expenditure restraint
and large revenue gains. Despite revenue losses in the wake of riots, the authorities have
maintained their deficit target for the year. Monetary policy succeeded in reining in high
private credit growth in 2006, and has since been eased.

•

Significant threats to debt sustainability have emerged. The authorities are seeking a
possible $50 million (20 percent of GDP) loan to finance reconstruction projects. This
and other loans’ debt service requirements would place serious strain on the mediumterm fiscal and external positions.

Key Policy Issues
Against this background, the staff recommended that the authorities:
•

Capitalize on recent gains to place fiscal policy on a sustainable track, by sustaining
revenue gains, resisting pressures on the wage bill, and ensuring that non-wage spending
is prioritized. The authorities should consider scaling back external borrowing plans that
would heighten medium-term risks of debt distress.

•

Closely monitor credit developments. While the recent easing of policy to
accommodate reconstruction-related credit is understandable, the external position
remains fragile. Monetary tightening may become necessary, particularly if new fiscal
pressures emerge, and the authorities should make greater use of the flexibility in the
foreign exchange regime to counter real exchange rate appreciation.

•

Accelerate the pace of implementation of structural reforms to improve the business
environment for the private sector and make the economy more dynamic.

4
I. THE COUNTRY CONTEXT
1.
Since mid-2005, the economy has come under repeated stress. Following a 6-week
strike in July-August 2005, the government agreed to a settlement with the unions calling for
civil service wages to be raised by 70 percent over two years, at a full annual cost of about
7 percent of GDP. To contain the medium-term fiscal impact of the settlement, the
government launched a voluntary redundancy program in the last weeks of the fiscal year
ending in June 2006, which resulted in an 18 percent reduction in civil service staffing—
about 3 percent of Tonga’s total labor force, at a substantial cost to the budget (Box 1).
2.
More recently, Tonga’s political transition was marred by an unexpected bout of
violence. A democratic movement has

3.
These developments came against a background of longstanding economic
challenges. Tonga is an island economy with a small population (about 100,000), and a high
exposure to shocks. Economic growth has been muted for much of the past 15 years—real
per capita GDP growth averaged about 1½ percent per year. Emigration has been substantial:
an estimated 100,000 Tongans live abroad, mainly in New Zealand, the United States, and
Australia. As a result, remittances have grown to the equivalent of almost half of GDP.

5
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Developments
4.
Economic activity was disrupted, albeit briefly, by the November unrest. Output
growth, having slowed in FY05/06, is now projected to turn negative in FY06/07, with real
GDP declining by 3½ percent, owing mainly to the direct and indirect impacts of the
November unrest, with a sharp drop in commerce and tourism services. However, the
disruption to activity was temporary, as several businesses quickly relocated their operations
elsewhere. Meanwhile, consumer price inflation slowed to about 5 percent by early 2007,
from about 10 percent in FY04/05, owing to a deceleration in fuel and food prices, a broadly
stable nominal exchange rate, and a firm monetary policy. Contrary to earlier concerns, the
wage settlement does not appear to have put upward pressure on private sector wages so far.1
5.
The conduct of fiscal policy after the settlement contributed to mitigate its
negative impact.2 In FY05/06, the fiscal balance swung into a deficit of 3⅓ percent of GDP
from a 2½ percent surplus the year before. The wage bill rose to 20 percent of GDP from
12 percent of GDP in FY04/05, reflecting payment of the first installment of the wage
settlement and the voluntary redundancy program which was implemented at a cost of about
7½ percent of GDP to the budget3, financed by a drawdown of government deposits in banks.
Nonetheless, non-wage spending was kept under tight control, and revenues increased
sharply, much of the gains reflecting an improvement in collection efficiency brought about
by the consumption tax introduced in April 2005 and higher customs revenues. Against this
background, the FY06/07 budget targeted a modest narrowing of the deficit to 2⅓ percent of
GDP, with revenues expected to remain buoyant, a decline in the wage bill ratio to GDP, and
a substantial increase in non-wage spending projected to be funded by donor grants and
loans. With the November unrest, fiscal plans came under strain. However, despite revenue
losses, the authorities have decided to maintain their overall deficit target, which would
require trimming non-wage spending.
6.
The National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) took steps during 2006 to limit
private credit growth and cope with the liquidity implications of the large severance
payments. Credit ceilings had been introduced in January 2006 to counter rapid credit

suggested that public sector wages had lagged private sector wages before the wage settlement.

December 2006. In early 2007, however,
the NRBT eased liquidity in response to the riots, lowering reserve requirements and
reducing the outstanding stock of notes, to support private credit for reconstruction and
business restocking. Nonetheless, the public sector is also expected to play a large role in
reconstruction and the authorities are attempting to secure a financing package from the
People’s Republic of China (PRC) of up to US$50 million (20 percent of GDP).
7.
External developments remained mixed. The external current account deficit is
projected to widen to 10½ percent of GDP in FY06/07 from 8¼ percent of GDP in FY05/06,
as imports remain steady despite the drop in output, and transfers reportedly declined, despite
higher donor grants.6 Donor loans, mainly from the Asian Development Bank, and recorded
private inflows should remain broadly at their FY05/06 level. While the NRBT remained
concerned about pressures on official reserves, they remained broadly stable from mid-2005
to early 2007, despite the riots.
B. Medium-Term Outlook and Risks
8.
Economic growth should return to positive, albeit low, levels in the medium
term. Real GDP growth is projected at 1 percent in FY07/08, held back by low business and
consumer confidence, despite the temporary boost provided by reconstruction activity. For
the medium term, real GDP should remain on a low trend rate of about 1 percent a year, as
the economy remains beset by numerous physical or structural impediments, including its

5

NRBT notes of 28 days or shorter maturity were issued at rates around 4-5 percent. Notes issues had been
discontinued in early 2001, because of their negative impact on the NRBT’s financial position.

6

Private remittances data show a decline of about 10 percent cumulatively over FY05/06-FY06/07 (Box 2). The
data remains plagued with serious weaknesses, however. The authorities, as well as bankers and other business
people met by the staff, do not believe that remittances dropped sharply. Moreover, no plausible explanation for
a large change in the behavior of remitters could be advanced.

7
small size and remoteness, and the legacy of high government involvement in productive
activities. Moreover, there remain low expectations for the strong push on structural reform
that would be needed to achieve faster growth.
9.
The external situation is likely to remain fragile and vulnerable to any loosening
of macroeconomic policies. Excluding the impact of external borrowing plans currently
being considered, the medium-term fiscal deficit would remain in the 1-1½ percent range, at
a level broadly consistent with the authorities’ de facto policy of eschewing recourse to
domestic bank financing. As a result, the external current account would improve marginally
over the medium term, and official reserves would stabilize at 2¼ months of imports of
goods and services by 2010—just under 3 months of imports of goods, the authorities’ own
benchmark—, a small buffer for a country subject to frequent shocks (Table 5).
10.
Even this relatively unfavorable scenario is subject to significant risks. The
economy will continue to be subject to uncertainty and shocks, foremost in the context of
Tonga’s difficult political transition. There are lingering risks on the policy front that could
derail efforts to restore stability, in particular those that might arise from pressures to
increase public sector hiring in the face of slow private employment growth. Moreover, a
further drop in remittances and terms of trade shocks could present significant challenges,
especially as reserves would remain at a low level.
11.
Against this backdrop, the borrowing plans currently being considered raise
serious concerns for debt sustainability. At close to 37 percent of GDP, public external
debt is high, and stress tests suggest that fiscal and external sustainability remain susceptible
to domestic and external shocks, placing Tonga at a high risk of debt distress. Given these
risks, the authorities’ recent efforts to secure a large loan form the PRC to pay for
reconstruction would make it difficult for Tonga to maintain a sustainable debt profile in the
medium term. 7 The loan would mainly support reconstruction and urban infrastructure
development, yielding at best a limited increase in medium-term productive capacity and
without any immediate generation of exports. Even under the terms sought by the Tongan
authorities, the permanent increase in the external debt service profile—about 2 percent of
GDP per year for 20 years starting in 2013—would heighten pressures on the budget and on
the balance of payments, and a sharp increase in risks of debt distress.

7

The short-term effect on debt ratios would be large, as GDP would not change and the likely grant element
would be low. With most labor and material inputs expected to be procured externally, there would be little
impact on growth and inflation during the construction phase. Loan terms sought by the Tongan authorities
would entail a relatively low grant element of about 30 percent, reflecting an interest rate of 2 percent, a 5-year
grace period, and a 25-year maturity.

8
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The discussions covered short- and medium-term economic prospects and policies. The
authorities underscored their intention to exercise caution in policy making, noting that
current challenges were more difficult than in previous years. The staff welcomed this
emphasis and highlighted the need to restore significant buffers to deal with future shocks
and ensure fiscal and external sustainability.
A. Fiscal and Debt Policy
12.
The authorities’ fiscal policy objective for the remainder of FY06/07 is to offset
the impact of the November events on the budget deficit. Recognizing that fiscal room
remains critically limited, the authorities have maintained their overall deficit target for
FY06/07 at the level of the original budget target (about 2⅓ percent of GDP). They were
confident that, with a vigorous collection effort in the second half of the year, the revenue
losses from the riots could be limited to less than 2⅔ percent of GDP. There was scope for
expenditure savings of the same magnitude, given that emergency spending had been
contained within the budget’s general contingency allowance, and that non-wage current and
capital spending were running well below budget by the end of the third quarter. The staff
supported the overall approach, underscoring the need for tight control on spending to ensure
that savings were realized.
13.
For the FY07/08 budget, the team encouraged the authorities to capitalize on
recent achievements to place fiscal policy on a sustainable track. Continued efforts in
improving revenue administration and compliance would be necessary to sustain the recent
gains in collection efficiency. The wage bill is projected to decline to about 15 percent of
GDP—a saving of 3 percent of GDP—, provided hiring pressures are resisted. The team
understood the need for a measured increase in non-wage current and capital spending, after
several years of compression, but it argued for a careful prioritization of the budget in these
areas. In all, assuming donor financing in line with recent averages (about 1 percent of GDP),
a reduction in the overall deficit to about 1 percent of GDP for FY07/08 appeared achievable.
14.
While the authorities intend to submit a draft budget to Parliament broadly in
line with the staff’s views, they confirmed that they would continue to seek a large loan
from the People’s Republic of China. The authorities indicated that while they would target
a small budget deficit in FY07/08 of about 1 percent of GDP, they were in discussion with
the Chinese authorities on a large loan to finance mainly reconstruction projects. While
acknowledging the political momentum behind these efforts, they considered that
implementing these projects was not inconsistent with their short-term macroeconomic
objectives given that, with most labor and material inputs procured externally, little pressure
would be placed on domestic demand and inflation; nor with their long-term goals, as they
were confident that debt service obligations could be met by savings in future budgets.
However, they recognized the currency risk attached to the loans.

15.
The staff expressed serious concerns about the risks that such large borrowing
would impose on fiscal and external debt sustainability. The staff shared the results of its
preliminary debt sustainability analysis, pointing to heightened risks of medium-term debt
distress, and urged the authorities to consider scaling back their borrowing plans and ensure
that all risks were carefully accounted for in their analysis of debt sustainability, including
the risks related to changes in currency valuation. The staff also argued that, given that the
size of the planned projects was considerable, maximizing the role of the private sector in
reconstruction efforts would help reduce the need for public financing.
16.
As regards revenue policy, the authorities intend to complete the comprehensive
reform envisaged under WTO accession in FY07/08 (Box 3). The remaining tax bills are
planned to be tabled at the 2007 session of Parliament, starting in June. The bills include a
reduction in tariffs compensated by increases in non-discriminatory excises as well as income
tax reform. The authorities were confident that the revenue impact of these tax changes would
be neutral, as it was designed to be. The staff welcomed these plans, and encouraged the
authorities to stand ready to take corrective revenue measures if the need arose, noting that
recent progress in improving tax administration would need to be sustained. The authorities
agreed on the need to pursue recent initiatives in this area, with donor and PFTAC support.
17.
For the medium term, the authorities and the staff agreed that continued efforts
to reduce the wage bill would be crucial to ensure that fiscal consolidation is sustained.
Despite the retrenchment, the wage bill remained large by international or regional standards,
reflecting high unit wages relative to per capita income, or a high level of civil service
employment. A lower wage bill would allow more flexibility in allocating public resources
toward development priorities. The authorities intend to pursue their public sector reform
program, which focused on improving professionalism, efficiency, and accountability, and
they expect that attrition would allow a reduction in staffing numbers. They also favored
adopting a more orderly mechanism to adjust public wages to avoid the disruption associated
with large one-off settlements. In this regard, developing a medium-term fiscal framework,

10
with support from the AsDB, would also be beneficial in strengthening public financial
management.
18.
The staff argued that a government purchase of the power company would
constitute another source of fiscal and debt risk for Tonga. In 2005, the authorities had
come under political pressure to re-acquire the power assets of a private telecom and power
company.8 As recent negotiations with a potential private investor broke off following the
riots, the authorities are reconsidering taking temporary ownership of the assets, at an upfront
cost that could exceed 4 percent of GDP. The staff stressed the risks to public finances
associated with the transaction. In the staff’s views, the authorities could best facilitate the
process by ensuring that the policy environment for the power sector, including price
regulation, was conducive to private sector participation.
B. Monetary, Financial and Exchange Rate Policies
19.
The team took the view that the recent easing of the monetary stance was
understandable, given the disruptions caused by the November events. The NRBT’s
prudent conduct of monetary policy had been instrumental in reducing inflation and limiting
pressures on foreign reserves in the wake of the wage settlement. This said, a concern of the
staff remained that, with the lifting of credit ceilings and sharp increases in liquidity, private
credit could expand rapidly and prove difficult to control. The NRBT stressed, however, that
it monitored monetary developments closely, and would take prompt action if needed.
20.
The greater use of indirect monetary policy instruments has strengthened the
NRBT’s monetary policy capabilities. The issuance of NRBT notes in mid-2006, for the
first time in several years, had opened to way to a more flexible conduct of monetary policy.
While the NRBT might still have to rely on distortionary credit ceilings, the staff encouraged
the bank to push forward with the strengthening of the legal framework underlying the use of
indirect instruments, including planned amendments to the NRBT Act that provide for a
doubling of the central bank’s capital and a clarification of profit transfer rules. The
authorities confirmed their plans to table these amendments at the 2007 parliamentary
session. The staff also called for introducing statutory limits on central bank credit to the
government, giving a legal basis to the authorities’ de facto policy, as a way to solidify
progress toward monetary policy independence.

Private owners of this company include the new King, who, upon acceding to the throne, indicated his desire
to divest from the power company.

21.
The NRBT’s pegging of the pa’anga to its reference basket has brought both
benefits and risks. The staff agreed that the anchoring role of the exchange regime had been
useful in reducing inflation in recent years.

22.
The authorities tightened foreign exchange regulations in 2006. Reflecting in part
its concerns about incipient pressures on reserves in FY05/06, the NRBT issued four
exchange control directives aimed at tightening documentary requirements for applications to
authorized dealers. The NRBT indicated that the new exchange control directives were
intended to improve the efficiency of existing regulation, while yielding a reduction in the
scope for avoidance of capital account restrictions. In reviewing Tonga’s exchange system in
connection with the issuance of the NRBT exchange control directives, the staff has
determined that the tax clearance certification requirement imposed by the authorities on the
making of payments and transfers for certain current international transactions constitutes an
exchange restriction under Article VIII, Section 2(a). It constitutes an exchange restriction
since its scope is not limited to the payments of outstanding taxes related to the relevant
payments or transfers but extends to the payments of all other taxes due by the applicant for
foreign exchange.
9

Moreover, the staff noted that, in the event of a permanent decline in remittances (not fully offset by a
concurrent decline in imports), a fall of the real exchange rate would be needed to restore external balance. As
noted above, however, the authorities were not convinced that remittances had sharply declined.

23.
Banking soundness indicators suggest that banks’ balance sheets and incomes
remain solid. Financial stability was preserved in the wake of the November events, despite
the liquidity position of some banks coming under stress. While there was a small increase in
the share of impaired assets in total loans in the year to December 2006, bank profitability
remained healthy, and provisioning levels were adequate. While the NRBT did not see a
systemic risk, it agreed that bank supervision should remain vigilant, as the debt servicing
capacity of some borrowers had clearly deteriorated. The NRBT also noted that the
prudential framework had improved with the adoption of additional supervision guidelines in
2006 after the Financial Institutions Act of 2004 became effective in October 2005.
C. Structural Reforms and Other Issues

The accession to the WTO is an important achievement on the structural policy
front, but, as recognized by the authorities, further reforms are needed to improve the

investment, particularly in Tonga’s
promising sectors of tourism and marine resources. The authorities concurred with this
assessment, which formed the basis of the work of a public-private task force set up in
early 2006, and indicated that they would revive efforts to implement the task force’s
recommendations.
25.
The staff encouraged the authorities to step up the pace of implementation of
their reform program for public enterprises. A comprehensive agenda had been
developed in recent years, with the enactment of a Public Enterprise Reform Act, but
implementation has been hampered by capacity constraints and political sensitivity. The staff
supported the authorities’ focus on improving enterprise management and accountability,
which would help reduce the fiscal risks associated with poor performance.
26.
The staff pressed for additional efforts to improve statistical capacity. Key
weaknesses in the national, external and public accounts hamper effective surveillance. The
authorities were aware of these shortcomings, and will continue to seek technical assistance
to improve the reliability, coverage, and timeliness of statistics.

13
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
The economy has shown resilience in the face of large shocks. Following the
70 percent wage award to civil servants in 2005, almost 20 percent of staff took voluntary
redundancy in mid-2006 at a large cost to the budget. Tonga’s first violent bout of civil
unrest, in November 2006, led to serious damage to the capital city’s central business district,
and a blow to business and consumer confidence, and as a result, real GDP is projected to
decline by 3½ percent in FY06/07. Yet the effects on activity appear to have been limited;
inflation had stabilized in the mid-single digits; financial stability had been maintained, and
exchange reserves losses had been contained. This said, medium-term growth prospects are
expected to remain muted, and the economy remains vulnerable to shocks.
28.
Cautious conduct of fiscal policy remains crucial to ensure stability. The
persistent strains on the fiscal position arising from the wage settlement were partly
contained through expenditure restraint and revenue gains. Despite the riots, the fiscal
position is expected to improve this year. Going forward, putting fiscal policy on an
appropriate track, while allowing moderate growth in non-wage spending after several years
of compression, will require consolidating revenue gains, and resisting wage and hiring
pressures. Reducing the wage bill remains the linchpin of medium-term fiscal consolidation
efforts.
29.
The authorities should consider scaling back their external borrowing plans.
Their current plans to borrow externally for reconstruction projects up to US$50 million
(20 percent of GDP) entail considerable risks for external debt sustainability in the medium
term. The loan’s debt service requirements would place severe pressure on the fiscal and
external position, heightening risks of debt distress. For the same reason, the staff advises the
authorities against a possible state acquisition of the power company.
30.
The NRBT should continue to monitor closely monetary and credit
developments following its recent easing of policy. The authorities successfully reined in
private credit growth in 2006, and took forceful action to absorb the large amount of liquidity
arising from the redundancy payments. The recent easing of monetary policy to provide
liquidity in the aftermath of the riots seems justified in the short term. In the period ahead,
the desirability of sustaining the current stance will hinge, inter alia, on the direction of fiscal
policy, with a possible need to tighten credit policy should fiscal pressures re-emerge.
Furthermore, while the current level of the exchange rate does not clearly suggest
overvaluation, the recent trend is a cause of concern, and the authorities should also make
greater use of the flexibility in their foreign exchange regime to counter real exchange rate
appreciation. Moreover, as explained in paragraph 22, the tax certification requirement
imposed on certain current international transactions gives rise to an exchange restriction
subject to Fund approval. As the restriction has been imposed for balance of payments
reasons, it applies to all relevant applications for foreign exchange on a non-discriminatory
basis, and the authorities intend that the problem of tax arrears giving rise to this requirement

14
will be resolved within 12 months, staff recommend the approval of the retention of the
exchange restriction through July 9, 2008 or the conclusion of the next Article IV
consultation with Tonga, whichever is earlier.
31.
WTO accession will be a significant step whose impact could be much leveraged
by stepping up other reforms. The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to seek
parliamentary ratification of WTO accession, which will help integrate Tonga in the world
economy. Other reforms remain imperative, however, to achieve faster growth and
encourage private foreign investment. The focus of policymakers efforts should turn to
implementing existing well-developed plans.
32.
The staff encourages the authorities to pursue efforts to improve statistical
capacity. The Fund will continue to assist the authorities with technical assistance in various
areas where there remains a need to improve the reliability, coverage, and timeliness of
statistics.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Tonga takes place on a
12-month cycle.

15

Box 1. The Civil Service Wage Settlement
Tonga has experienced substantial increase in wage and salaries expenditures over the last
years. Following a civil service strike that lasted six weeks over July-August 2005, the government
and unions agreed on a settlement under which salaries of civil servants would increase by 60–
80 percent, effective from July 2005, with the salary increase for the first year paid in two phases, in
FY05/06 and FY06/07.1
These developments have had significant fiscal implications. The total cost of the wage increase
was about 4¼ percent of GDP for FY05/06, reflecting the first phase of the wage increase, a partial
adjustment of paychecks. In FY06/07,

level 70 percent above this base.
Partly offsetting these large wage increases, staffing cuts have reduced personnel by a
significant 18 percent, albeit adding the short-term costs of severance packages. Staff cuts were
achieved in a short round of voluntary redundancies implemented in the last weeks of June 2006. The
severance packages for the voluntary redundancies imposed an additional cost on the budget,
estimated at 5½ percent of GDP, while under pension law, the government was required to fund
pension liabilities of departing civil servants, at a cost of 2 percent of GDP. To finance the cash cost
of the redundancy program, the government had considered an asset sale to a foreign investor, but
discussions did not conclude by the end of June. As a result, the program was financed by the
government withdrawing its domestic bank deposits, which depleted the fiscal cushions accumulated
during previous years.
1

As part of the public sector reform program, the government introduced performance-based contracts for public
workers in 2004. Disparities in salaries among civil servants became large, as senior workers obtained high
salary increases, causing widespread dissatisfaction among civil servants at lower grades.

16

Box 2. Remittances in Tonga
Remittances grew at a rapid pace in the first half of the decade. Tonga’s private transfer
receipts grew by close to 15 percent a year (in pa’anga) over 2000-05. As a result, aggregate
remittance flows reached 45 percent of GDP in 2005, placing Tonga among the world’s largest
remittance recipients in relation to GDP. The bulk is remitted from Tongan migrants in Australia,
New Zealand, and the U.S. towards the household sector.1 While remittance growth was
supported by sustained income growth in the host economies—and valuation effects played a
limited role over the reference period—, growth in private transfer receipts in Tonga consistently
outpaced income growth in the main host countries over the past decade, faster even than the
continued increase in the number of migrants might imply.

Lately, however, there appears to have been a break in this trend. Based on overseas
exchange transaction (OET) data, private transfer receipts in U.S. dollar terms peaked in the third
quarter of 2004 and have since declined. Total gross receipts in 2006, in U.S. dollar terms, were
12 percent below the level in 2005.

have declined sharply, with the
apparent drop possibly related to the
fact that in-kind remittances, which are not tracked in OET data, have become more common.
Moreover, some positive response of remittances to the recent unrest are expected in the
short term. Apart from household income support, remittances have long served as a shock
absorber in Tonga: filling in the financial gap needed for reconstruction of damaged assets; and
smoothing consumption for those affected. The latest data showed a pick-up of remittances in the
months of January and February, albeit still at levels below than those of the same period in the
previous year.

A recent survey prepared for G-20 workshop estimated that close to 90 percent of total remittances went to
households

17

Box 3. Tonga: Comprehensive Tax Reform
Tonga is in the process of a comprehensive tax reform. As a part of trade liberalization
process, a comprehensive tax reform package was approved in 2002, shifting revenue sources
away from trade taxes to greater reliance on domestic taxation. For the first phase of the reform, a
broad-based consumption tax was introduced in April 2005. Administrative efforts have also
been made to strengthen tax compliance and enforcement, including registration of large
businesses, introduction of a new computer system, and reorganization of one-stop shop for
customs tariff payments.
The remaining parts of the tax reform are scheduled to be implemented in FY07/08. With
planned accession of the WTO and associated reduction in tariffs, the authorities plan to submit
the final set of domestic tax bills to the Parliament in June 2007. The key features of the reform
include:
•

Corporate income tax rate of 25 percent will be introduced for both domestic and foreign
companies, replacing the current differential rates for foreign companies of 37-40 percent
and domestic companies of 15–30 percent;

•

the individual income tax threshold will be raised;

•

excise tax coverage will be extended from domestically manufactured goods to both
domestic and imported excisable goods, such as beer, cigarettes, motor vehicles, and
liquor; and,

•

customs tariff duty rates will be reduced to a maximum of 15–20 percent.

This set of tax reform is planned to be revenue neutral. Care has been taken to set tax rates to
prevent a potential revenue shortfall. The authorities plan to offset the revenue foregone resulting
from tariff reduction mainly through excise tax collection.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TONGA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 20071
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
The International Development Association
Approved by Anthony Boote and Steven Dunaway (IMF)
and Deepak Bhattasali and Vikram Nehru (IDA)
JUNE 22, 2007
The updated debt indicators suggest that Tonga’s risk of debt distress has increased. With the
anticipated increase in the external debt burden, the baseline scenario indicates a substantial
breach of the threshold for NPV of debt-to-exports over the projection period. Alternative
scenarios and stress tests demonstrate vulnerability of the debt profile to adverse shocks and
highlight the importance of prudent fiscal policy management.
A. Background
Tonga’s total external debt as a percentage of GDP has declined over the past few years.
External public debt fell from 42 percent of GDP in 2003/04 to 35½ percent of GDP in 2004/05
and remained broadly stable in 2005/06, in line with the decline in loan disbursements following
the completion of large projects financed by the ADB. Fiscal surpluses in 2003/04 and 2004/05
have also helped to reduce public debt, bringing it down to below 50 percent of GDP in 2005/06
from over 60 percent of GDP in 2003/04.2 With the government’s efforts to limit domestic
financing, meantime, domestic public debt has declined substantially to 11¼ percent of GDP in
2005/06 from 19¾ percent in 2003/04.

This supplement provides an updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for Tonga. The DSA was prepared jointly
with the World Bank in accordance with the Debt Sustainability Framework for low-income countries approved by
the Executive Boards of the IMF and IDA. The debt data underlying this exercise were provided by the Tongan
authorities.

Tonga was not included in the list of countries potentially eligible for debt relief under the HIPC initiative (See the
joint Fund/Bank board paper "Review of Financing of the Fund’s Concessional Assistance and Debt Relief to LowIncome Member Countries" March 2006, page 7).

Debt burden indicators have remained below indicative policy-based thresholds, with the
exception of the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio.3 At end-2005/06, the stock of external public
debt amounted to $80.7 million, with a net present value of 20¾ percent of GDP. Most of the
relevant indicators including the NPV of debt-to-GDP remained below the thresholds. However,
the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is estimated at 115 percent in 2005/06, higher than its threshold
of 100 percent.
More recently, the civil unrest in November 2006 has increased risks of debt distress.
Economic activity was briefly disrupted: output growth, having slowed in 2005/06, is now
projected to turn negative in 2006/07, with real GDP declining by 3½ percent, owing mainly to
the direct and indirect impacts of the unrest. The public sector is also expected to play a large
role in reconstruction and is attempting to secure a financing package from a donor of up to
$50.0 million (20 percent of GDP).
The medium-term framework assumes a fiscal adjustment to take place, with large loan
disbursements in coming years posing an additional debt burden. A fully-tied project loan of
$50.0 million, mainly for reconstruction of the central business district, is expected to be
disbursed in 2007/08 and 2008/09. A fiscal deficit of between 1 and 1½ percent is projected
thereafter, with continued improvement in revenue administration and expenditure restraint. As
external assistance is expected to gradually increase, the government will be able to allocate its
resource to capital expenditure while successfully avoiding domestic financing, keeping inflation
at about 6 percent. In this environment, GDP growth will remain at about 1¼ percent over the
projection period.

B. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
In the baseline scenario, the NPV of debt-to-exports breaches its indicative policy-based
threshold by a large margin and increases substantially over the medium term (Table I.1).
The net present value of external public debt to exports is expected to rise steeply to above
245 percent in 2008/09, reflecting the planned large loan disbursement. While the indicator is
projected to decline in subsequent years as the high level of remittances continue to have a
countervailing effect, however, it remains above its indicative threshold of 100 percent. The
3

The debt thresholds for Tonga based on the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment in 2005
are: NPV of debt-to-exports (100 percent), GDP (30 percent) and revenues (200 percent); and debt service in percent
of exports (15 percent) and revenues (25 percent).

3

NPV of public external debt as a percent of GDP is projected to increase significantly over the
next few years to 41⅓ percent in 2008/09, declining gradually but remaining above the policydependent threshold of 30 percent through 2023/24.
Stress tests underscore that Tonga’s debt profile is vulnerable to adverse shocks. (Table I.2,
Figure I.1). One of the main risks identified in the set of stress tests is new public sector
borrowings on less favorable terms. If this were to occur, the debt stock indicators would rise
well above their threshold levels, although the debt service ratio would remain under its
threshold. In contrast, a return of key variables including GDP and export growth to historical
averages would imply an improvement in all ratios.
C. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
The planned loan disbursements in 2007/08 and 2008/09 pose a significant risk to public
debt sustainability (Table I.3). Total public debt is projected to increase over the next two years,
reaching a high of 64⅓ percent in 2008/09 in nominal terms (52 percent in NPV terms). While
total public debt is projected to gradually decline in subsequent years, mainly attributed to
favorable fiscal management, it is expected to remain above 50 percent of GDP over the
projection period. Domestic public debt is also projected to narrow gradually, in line with the
recent policy commitments, to below 10 percent of GDP in 2011/12 and thereafter.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests highlight the vulnerability of the total public debt
position (Table I.4, Figure I.2). The public debt trajectory is most sensitive to growth shocks,
which would cause quite a sharp increase in the debt stock and debt service indicators.
Furthermore, if other debt-creating flows increase or the exchange rate is depreciated in 2007/08,
the public debt dynamics would look less favorable. On the other hand, a return of real GDP
growth and primary fiscal balance to historical averages would see a marked improvement in all
ratios.
D. Staff Assessment
Based on the LIC-DSA, staffs conclude that Tonga’s debt dynamics are subject to a high
risk of debt distress. The NPV of debt-to-exports remains above the threshold by a large margin
over the projection period, and the threshold for the NPV of debt-to-GDP is also breached with
the anticipated loan disbursement starting in 2007/08. Stress tests highlight vulnerabilities to debt
sustainability, including the risks around lower growth and a sharp fall in the value of the
currency, while the alternative scenario shows that a return of real GDP growth and primary
fiscal balance to historical averages would strongly enhance debt sustainability. This emphasizes
the critical importance of fiscal discipline and prudent debt management, and progress on key
areas of the reform agenda to ensure economic recovery.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

the U.S. dollar as the intervention currency. In July 2000, the Japanese yen was
added to the basket, and the monthly maximum adjustment limit was raised to
5 percent from 2 percent that had prevailed since March 1998, when the allowance
for adjustment was introduced. Tonga has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3 and 4. Tonga presently imposes an exchange restriction subject to
approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a). This restriction consists of the tax
certification requirement imposed by the authorities on the making of payments and
transfers for certain current international transactions: (i) payments for oil imports;
(ii) airline ticket sales; (iii) payments for specified charges/fees/services; (iv)
insurance payments; (v) lease payments; (vi) payments for medical expenses
incurred by residents; (vii) transfers by nonresidents of profits and dividends abroad;
(viii) external loan payments; and (xi) maintenance payments including remittances
for family living expenses.

ANNEX II. TONGA: RELATIONS WITH THE
PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE1
(As of April 2007)
Assistance to Tonga since 2002 included 31 advisory missions, mostly on tax and customs
administration and banking. During 2000–06, Tonga has sent 54 officials to the Centre’s
regional seminars, workshops and training courses, and six attachments were organized.
Public Financial Management
Since 2003, PFTAC's missions have focused on complementing the considerable assistance
provided by other TA agencies, including through the introduction of a midyear economic
review and fiscal update, reconciliation of monetary and fiscal data, and changes in budget
documentation. For the 2003/04 and 2004/05 budgets, assistance was provided in presenting
the final aggregate budget figures on a GFSM2001 basis. In 2004, PFTAC arranged for a
Tongan official to participate on a delegation of Pacific Island officials to the Australian
Commonwealth Ministry of Finance. During 2005, the PFTAC PFM Advisor participated in
a joint donor/government Feasibility Study related to a proposed long-term Financial and
Economic Management Program (FEMP), as well as worked with the Ministry of Finance on
assessing the financial implications of the proposed civil service wage increase. Since then
assistance in the form of a peripatetic advisor has been provided in 2006, and again in 2007,
to assist in revenue estimation work. The PFM Advisor has also been requested by the
government to deliver lectures on PFM to all CEOs, in late April, 2007.
Tax Administration and Policy
A tax reform package, including a new consumption tax, was designed by PFTAC in 2002.
Follow-up missions in 2003 and 2004 were designed to assist preparations for the
implementation of that package. At the end of January 2005, the Minister of Finance
announced a substantially altered plan to implement a consumption tax and some other
changes on April 1, 2005. PFTAC was not requested to assist in its implementation. The
Centre will, however, provide assistance in the redrafting of the Customs legislation. In
late 2005, NZAID offered additional assistance to PFTAC to fund three short expert visits to
Nuku’alofa to assist with revenue forecasting; the first of these missions took place in
February 2006.
Following the restructuring of the Public Service, PFTAC carried out a mission in
September 2006. The mission also coincided with the public consultation of a new income
tax and Customs bills, both based on self-assessment principles. The mission’s primary
recommendations related to the compliance management of large taxpayers, a post

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji is a regional technical assistance
institution operated by the IMF with financial support of the Asian Development Bank, Australia, Japan, Korea
and New Zealand. The Centre's aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and
financial management that can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands,
Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa,
Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

implementation review of the Consumption tax, workforce management—including change
management and the managing of risk in the Customs. The mission identified a number of
areas where PFTAC could be of further assistance. No formal response has been received to
date which PFTAC recently followed up on. In that context, account does need to be taken of
the disruption in Nuku’alofa of the recent civil riots and the resulting change to the
governments priorities that would have created.
Banking Sector Regulation and Supervision
An assessment to determine compliance with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking
Supervision (BCP) was conducted in 2002. It identified some shortcomings in Tonga’s legal
framework and resulted in a review of the Financial Institutions Act (FIA). The enhanced
FIA was enacted in late 2004. A TA mission provided assistance with drafting regulations
and guidelines, and establishing procedures for their implementation in April 2005. Further
assistance in supervision was provided in late 2005 and again in February 2006, as the on-site
examination process has been regularized with PFTAC assistance. Amendments to the
NRBT Act, which will strengthen the central bank’s enforcement capacity, are still awaiting
Parliament’s enactment. PFTAC also arranged, through funding provided in late 2005 by
NZAID, for the renewal of the secondment of a central banking manager from the Reserve
Bank of Fiji to serve as the Deputy Governor of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga.
Economic and Financial Statistics
In 2002, two reviews were undertaken in accordance with the GDDS and the Data Quality
Assessment Framework; one on BOP statistics and the other on the wider statistical system.
Subsequent missions in 2004 finalized GDDS metadata, provided training in BOP concepts
and practices, developed a new BOP business survey, and reviewed national accounts data.
In September 2005 a partial update of the 2002 statistical system review was done, focused
on outputs of the Statistics Division of the Ministry of Finance. Further assistance was
provided to peer review GDP and BOP estimates prior to publication. GDDS metadata was
approved and published in 2006 on the Data Dissemination Bulletin Board. A TA mission in
April 2007 provided further assistance with reviewing BOP statistics.

ANNEX III. TONGA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP2
(As of April 2007)

Since becoming a World Bank Group member in 1985, Tonga has received a total of five IDA
credits totaling SDR 15.2million (original amount USD equivalent of 22.8 million). Tonga is
eligible for an IDA 14 allocation of SDR 4.2 million (indicative only) over FY2006–08. The
IDA allocation for FY07 is SDR 2.9 million (includes front-loading from FY06) and this is on a
grant-financed basis. The key components of the Bank’s current program in Tonga are:
•

Health: The Tonga Health Sector Support Project (USD10.9 million credit approved in mid2003) aims to support the Government in improving the performance of its health sector
through appropriate health financing policy, revised health information systems, and
improved management and infrastructure of the country's main hospital. With project
support, the Ministry of Health has prepared two National Health Accounts; reviewed the
allocation of government resources between public health, primary care, and hospital
services; and developed draft policies on introducing limited user fees whilst addressing
equity issues in the sector. The project has also supported revisions of health information
systems and will soon finance a hospital information system for better sector management
and monitoring of results. In collaboration with the Government of Japan, the project has
financed the refurbishment of Tonga's principal hospital to adapt the hospital's design to the
demands of non-communicable diseases, which are now the health priority in Tonga.

•

Natural Hazard Management: The Cyclone Emergency Recovery and Management
Project, with an IDA credit of US$5.9 million approved in 2002, is assisting Tonga in
replacing and strengthening the resilience of social infrastructure and helping upgrade
Tonga’s emergency and risk management capacity to ensure it can cope better with future
disasters and the risk posed by climate change.

•

Education System: The Tongan Education Support Project with an IDA credit of
US$1.0 million and an NZAID trust fund of US$4.1 million (managed by the Bank) was
approved in June 2005. Together with NZAID, the Bank is helping to structure a sector-wide
approach that pools donor and Government funding to comprehensively target education
priorities, particularly: school curriculum development and associated learning materials
development, non-salary resource allocations through school grants, student assessment, and
the supply and quality of teachers.

•

Financial Management and Procurement: An IDF grant of US$200,000 was approved in
December 2003 to support public procurement reforms and procurement capacity building
through the provision of technical assistance. The draft Procurement Law, prepared by the
government-appointed consultant and based on the UNCITRAL Model Law, has been
reviewed by the Bank and comments were provided to the Government. The Government’s
Crown Law has drafted the Public Procurement Act 2007, which is expected to be enacted by
the Legislative Assembly of Tonga in FY2007. The draft Procurement Act, which has been
shared with the Bank, deviates from the draft Procurement Law on which the Bank provided
comments as it only provides for the creation of a Government Tenders Board, specifying
membership, powers and functions.

Prepared by World Bank staff.

6
•

Transport Sector Reform: The Bank has completed a Transport Sector Review Study that
provides analytical assistance to support the Government’s commitment to improve the
structure and efficiency of the sector, including assessing options for sustainable financing. A
study of opportunities for public-private partnership in the airport sector was completed in
April 2006, leading to the corporatization of the airport on a business basis (ongoing). The
Bank is preparing a lending program to help the Ministry of Transport to consolidate its
recent laws and realign its functions, as well as to improve inter-island ferry services. The
Bank prepared the Pacific Infrastructure Report (PIR), which among other things, reviews
and compares access to infrastructure services among the Pacific Island countries and other
small island states. There is a follow up ADB RETA study with a steering committee from
ADB, AusAid, and NZAid to build upon PIR findings and preparation of individual country
investment programs.

•

Private Sector Development/Business Recovery: The Bank is providing analytical and
technical assistance in cooperation with FIAS and PEP Pacific to support the Government’s
initiative to create a joint public-private task force as an effort to tackle regulatory
impediments to private sector development. In collaboration with the Pacific Enterprise
Development Facility (PEDF), the IFC has supported 18 projects in Tonga, 13 of them
raising finance locally to start or expand local businesses in fisheries, agriculture, insurance,
professional services, laboratory, manufacturing and port services. In 2004, IFC completed a
piece of advisory work for the Government on Royal Tongan Airlines.

In December 2006, IFC led a multi-agency mission to Tonga which aimed to analyze and report
on the overall impacts of the recent civil unrest on Tongan business, and recommend options to
the Government and its donor partners on how to address constraints upon private sector
recovery. With some caveats, the Government accepted the overwhelming majority of the
mission’s recommendations. Discussions are continuing between the IFC, the Government of
Tonga, and various private sector organizations with regard to addressing liquidity constraints in
the banking sector, providing support for a revitalized program of asset sales and privatization.
An extraordinary meeting of the World Bank Group supported regulatory reform taskforce in
January 2007 has approved an accelerated program of regulatory reform with the aim of both
reducing the immediate burden upon business, and to begin clawing back business confidence.

ANNEX IV. TONGA: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK3
(As of April 2007)
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy for Tonga supports the Government’s
development goals aimed at improving the quality and standard of living for all Tongans.
The Government’s strategic objectives emphasize the need to achieve a steady average GDP
growth of around 2.5% in real terms through a dynamic and highly competitive economy
driven mainly by the private sector and an efficient public sector. Achieving this target has
now become difficult in light of the political situation, particularly the riot that destroyed the
business district of Nuku’alofa in November 2006.
A Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Tonga is currently under preparation, with its
approval tentatively schedule in July 2007. The strategy of the ADB in Tonga for 2007–2001
is to support the implementation of Strategic Development Plan (SDP)-8, with a particular
emphasis on the achievement of three SDP-8 goals. ADB’s lending program under the CPS
will focus on the delivery of basic social services and urban reconstruction under an
Integrated Urban Development Project to be approved 2007. The recently approved TA
4865-TON is providing support for SDP-8 implementation, including its midterm review,
and will be complemented by new technical assistance during the period 2007-2009,
addressing: (i) improved fiscal governance, (ii) private sector development, and (iii) further
support for process of rationalization of public enterprises. ADB will also (iv) provide a TA
for preparing the Urban Planning and Management System to complement the PPTA
currently ongoing.
ADB has approved fifteen loans totaling $57.8 million from the Asian Development Fund
(ADF) to Tonga since it joined ADB in 1972. Fifty-four technical assistance projects with a
value of $20.1 million were also provided to improve capacity and strengthen institutional
development in various sectors. Past ADB investments have focused on finance development
and infrastructure development in transport, power, agriculture and fisheries.
Active projects include five TAs in the country portfolio. The latest loan on Economic and
Public Sector Reform was completed successfully in 2004. The five ongoing TAs focus on
public enterprise reforms, youth micro-enterprise development, preparing the integrated
urban development projects, support for the implementation of the Strategic Development
Plan 2006/2007—2008/2009, and Rationalization of Public Enterprises, Phase III. Another
TA on strengthening pro-poor policy in the Pacific for Tonga for $0.2m has been
implemented on a regional basis to support economic sector work and some work is being
prepared to complete that work. It is counted as country TA.

ANNEX V. TONGA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
While economic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance, data deficiencies continue to
complicate the monitoring of economic conditions and policy formulation. The Statistics
Department (SD) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) have received, on a regular basis,
technical assistance in national accounts, government finance, and balance of payments
(BOP) statistics from STA as well as the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre
(PFTAC); nevertheless, data provision to the Fund continues with long delays.
The two main sources of statistical information are the Quarterly Bulletin of the National
Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT), and the annual and semi-annual budget reports from the
MOF. Since May 30, 2006, Tonga has been participating in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS). The metadata is posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board and was certified in May 2006
(http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/gdds/gddscountrycategorylist/?strcode=TON ).
Real Sector Statistics
The national account estimates are based primarily on the production approach; only rough
estimates of expenditure components are available. The SD has completed the revision of the
national accounts (base period 2000/01), based on the results of a new business establishment
survey, and with technical assistance from the Secretariat for the Pacific Community.
Significant inconsistencies remain in agricultural, fishing and forestry data. There are
insufficient source data and indicators to derive value added for commerce, hotel and
restaurant sectors. In August 2004, a PFTAC mission proposed improvements to source data
and methodologies and suggested revisions of recent year GDP estimates.
The Consumer Price Index is based on a basket of goods and services from the 2000/01
Household Income and Expenditure Survey.
Labor market statistics are weak: employment statistics have not been compiled since 2003;
and average earnings statistics are not available.
Government Finance Statistics
The FY 2002/03 Budget Statement introduced a presentation of fiscal data compiled
according to the methodology of the 2001 Government Finance Statistics Manual
(GFSM 2001). However, improvements are still needed to ensure accurate and reliable fiscal
data. Proper classification of transactions is needed to permit reconciliation with monetary
financing data. Lags in updating the accounting system should be shortened. Published data
are often subject to significant revisions.

9

External Sector Statistics
Official BOP figures are compiled annually by the SD with long lags. Monthly trade figures,
derived from customs data, are available with a three-month lag. Unofficially, the NRBT
compiles monthly balance of payments statistics based on the Overseas Exchange
Transactions records of the banking system with a six-week lag. There are significant
differences between the BOP estimates compiled by the two agencies. Moreover, large errors
and omissions point to possible under recording of imports. Work is needed to reconcile the
data on stocks of reserve assets that are available from various data sources. The MOF has
put in place a system that provides detailed information on official sector external
disbursements and debt service.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
The reporting of monetary and financial statistics to the Fund for publication in International
Financial Statistics has recently become irregular and less timely. This is particularly
worrisome since these data are shared with APD through an integrated monetary database.
Responding to an STA’s request, the authorities have submitted test monetary data using the
standardized report forms (SRFs). These data have yet to be published in the IFS Supplement
on Monetary and Financial Statistics because data for other depository corporations exhibit
significant discrepancies and no current data for the reserve bank have been reported beyond
August 2006. Due to resource constraints, the NRBT has not been able to devote sufficient
resources to finish this project.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Tonga
On July 11, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Tonga.1
Background
Economic activity was disrupted by the November 2006 unrest, albeit temporally, following the
civil service wage settlement and the voluntary redundancy program in FY05/06 (fiscal year
July-June). Real GDP growth, having slowed in FY05/06, is now estimated to turn negative in
FY06/07, declining by 3½ percent. The external current account deficit is also estimated to
widen to 10½ percent of GDP in FY06/07 from 8¼ percent of GDP in FY05/06, as imports
remain steady despite the drop in output, and transfers reportedly declined. Meanwhile,
consumer price inflation slowed to about 5 percent by early 2007, from about 10 percent in
FY04/05, as the public sector wage increase does not appear to have put upward pressure on
private sector wages so far.
The conduct of fiscal policy after the wage settlement contributed to mitigate its negative impact.
In FY05/06, the fiscal balance swung into a deficit of 3⅓ percent of GDP from a 2½ percent
surplus the year before. The wage bill rose to 20 percent of GDP from 12 percent of GDP in
FY04/05, reflecting payment of the first installment of the wage settlement and the voluntary
redundancy program. Nonetheless, non-wage spending was kept under tight control, and
revenues increased sharply, much of the gains reflecting an improvement in collection efficiency
brought about by the consumption tax introduced in 2005 and higher customs revenues.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Despite revenue losses stemming from the November unrest, for FY06/07, the government has
maintained its deficit target in the Budget of a deficit of 2⅓ percent of GDP, with buoyant
revenue collection and a decline in the wage bill ratio to GDP.
The National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) took steps during 2006 to limit private credit
growth and cope with the liquidity implications of the large severance payments. Credit ceilings,
introduced in January 2006, were reset in July 2006 for the 6-month period to December to
counter rapid credit growth reflecting strong demand for housing loans and ample bank liquidity.
In addition, to contain the expected liquidity effects of the government’s redundancy payments,
the NRBT also stepped up its issuance of central bank notes. In the event, growth in private
sector credit decelerated sharply to an annual rate of 10½ percent by end-December 2006. In
early 2007, however, the NRBT eased liquidity in response to the riots, lowering reserve
requirements and reducing the outstanding stock of notes, to support private credit for
reconstruction and business restocking. Nonetheless, the public sector is also expected to play
a large role in reconstruction, and the government is seeking a possible large external loan to
finance those projects.
However, the economy will continue to be subject to uncertainty and shocks. While economic
growth should return to positive, albeit low, levels in the medium term, there are lingering risks
on the policy front that could derail efforts to restore stability, in particular those that might arise
from pressures to increase public sector hiring. The government’s borrowing plan currently
being considered also raises serious concerns for debt sustainability, as debt service
requirements would place serious strain on the medium-term fiscal and external positions,
placing Tonga at a high risk of debt distress. Moreover, a further drop in remittances and terms
of trade shocks could present significant pressures on official reserves.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the resilience of Tonga’s economy in the face of recent large
shocks, with inflation declining, continued financial stability, and a contained international
reserve position. These achievements reflect the authorities’ cautious economic policies,
including a tight credit policy and the maintenance of a basket exchange rate peg. Looking
forward, Directors stressed that impediments to private sector activity will need to be eliminated
in order to improve medium-term growth prospects. A constructive political transition will help to
limit economic vulnerabilities on both the domestic and external fronts.
Directors commended the authorities for pursuing prudent fiscal policies in a difficult
environment, and looked forward to continued efforts to set fiscal policy on a sustainable track.
While the persistent fiscal strains arising from the 2005 wage settlement have been partly
contained through expenditure restraint and revenue gains, further fiscal consolidation through
the prioritization of nonwage spending and the rationalization of public sector wage setting
practices will be needed over the medium term. Directors also noted the importance of resisting
pressure for new hires in the short term, and stepping up efforts to build public support for a
continued reduction in civil service staffing over the medium term. They welcomed recent gains
in revenue collection efficiency, and agreed that continued improvements in revenue

3
administration and compliance will be critical, especially in light of the planned cuts in import
duties and income tax reforms.
Directors stressed that a cautious public borrowing policy is essential to ensuring sustainable
public and external debt dynamics. Noting the increased risks to external debt sustainability
associated with the proposed reconstruction loan, several Directors encouraged the authorities
to consider scaling back their borrowing plans or to attempt to improve the concessionality of
the loan. Other Directors, however, pointed out the urgent need and positive growth effects of
the planned reconstruction projects. Some Directors encouraged the authorities to maximize the
role of the private sector in the reconstruction efforts. Directors also noted the financial risks
stemming from a possible state acquisition of the power company.
Directors observed that, while monetary easing in the aftermath of civil disturbances had been
justifiable in the short term, credit policy may need to be tightened if fiscal pressures re-emerge.
In this light, they welcomed the NRBT’s commitment to monitor monetary and credit
developments closely. Directors looked forward to the reform of the legal framework supporting
the use of indirect monetary instruments and enhancing the independence of monetary policy.
They supported recent initiatives to improve financial sector supervision, while calling for
continued vigilance in the face of rapid growth in credit to the household sector.
Directors agreed that Tonga’s basket peg exchange rate regime has provided a credible
nominal anchor and contributed to low inflation. They recommended that the authorities make
greater use of the flexibility of their exchange rate regime, as needed, to counter real exchange
rate appreciation, and welcomed the authorities’ assurance that they will monitor developments
affecting Tonga’s external balance closely. Directors, however, also pointed to the role of
structural reforms in preserving external competitiveness.
Directors underscored the importance of sustaining reform momentum in order to achieve faster
growth through an enhanced business and investment environment and strengthened public
enterprise performance. To this end, they encouraged the authorities to step up the pace of
implementation of their public sector reform program and the recommendations of the
public-private task force on the business climate. Directors welcomed Tonga’s accession to the
World Trade Organization.
Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen statistical capacity further, and supported
continued assistance from the Fund to help improve the reliability, coverage, and timeliness of
statistics.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
