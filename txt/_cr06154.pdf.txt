Executive Summary
Background and Outlook: The new government formed after the June 2005 presidential
elections has committed to the reform agenda outlined in the Fourth Five-Year Development
Plan (FFYDP) and the Twenty-Year Vision. After a temporary slowdown in 2004/05,
growth has resumed on the back of high oil prices and an expansionary policy stance, and is
expected to accelerate to about 6 percent in 2005/06 (the fiscal year starts on March 21).
With the government spending a large part of the oil price windfall and an accommodative
monetary policy, inflation remains relatively high at 13 percent. The external position has
strengthened significantly, with the current account surplus expected to reach 6½ percent of
GDP in 2005/06. While short-term prospects remain favorable, the economic outlook is
dominated by uncertainties related to the volatility of oil prices, international tensions over
the nuclear issue, and developments in Iran’s relations with its major trading partners.
Policy Discussions: The key issues addressed were:
a.
The appropriate fiscal policy stance. Based on current projections of oil
revenues, medium-term sustainability is not a concern. Fiscal restraint is required to
help monetary policy reduce high persistent inflation, and to build fiscal savings to
cushion against an unexpected downturn in oil prices. However, the authorities
maintain their view that job creation in the non-oil sector is the top policy priority and
that this requires a supportive policy stance. In the staff’s view, fiscal tightening
could be achieved through cuts of the extensive energy subsidies, which are
inefficient and environmentally unsound.
b.
Monetary and exchange rate policies should aim at reducing inflation.
The FFYDP identifies single-digit inflation as a medium-term objective, which the
authorities seek to achieve. Staff argued, however, that monetary policy had largely
accommodated the increase in government spending out of oil revenue. It also
indicated that effective monetary instruments and a clear mandate to control inflation
were needed, and that exchange rate policy had to be subordinated to this primary
objective. The authorities noted that they had already allowed greater exchange rate
flexibility, having experienced some nominal appreciation in the course of 2005/06,
but were concerned about the rapid growth of imports and the need to build a reserve
buffer against oil price fluctuations.
c.
The structural reform agenda. As the effects of the reforms undertaken at
the beginning of the Third Five-Year Development Plan (TFYDP) may start to taper
off, new impetus is needed to consolidate and strengthen the foundations for further
growth. The authorities reiterated their commitment to pursue a wide range of
reforms under the FFYDP, but plans are still being elaborated by the new
government.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The Iranian economy has continued to benefit from high oil prices and the
reforms introduced in the last few years. In the period 2000/01–2002/03, several important
reforms were implemented, including exchange rate unification, reduction of exchange
restrictions and import tariffs, new legislation on foreign direct investment (FDI), tax reform,
and licensing of private banks and insurance companies. By increasing the openness of the
economy and removing major obstacles to trade and investment, these reforms improved
long-term growth prospects, with some of the benefits already showing. During the Third
Five-Year Development Plan (TFYDP, 2000/01–2004/05), real GDP growth reached
5½ percent on average, contributing to a significant reduction of unemployment. The growth
momentum was also supported by high oil prices and increased government spending out of
abundant oil revenue, together with an accommodating monetary policy.
2.
Notwithstanding these positive developments, difficult challenges lie ahead.
Unemployment remains high and, due to the age structure of the population, the labor market
is likely to be under increasing pressure in the coming years from large inflows of new
entrants. Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, partially aimed at alleviating
unemployment, have maintained inflation relatively high at around 13 percent. With non-oil
exports accounting only for 15 percent of the total, the economy remains dependent on oil. In
this context, economic policies continue to face the dilemma of reconciling the need of high
growth and employment creation with macroeconomic stability, while enhancing the
competitiveness of the non-oil sector. Distortions induced by extensive administrative
controls on prices and rates of returns (interest rates), consumer and energy subsidies, and
rigid employment regulations remain widespread, with large efficiency costs.
3.
Iran’s political landscape has undergone important changes over the last two
years. In February 2004, conservatives won a majority of seats in the parliament, and the
presidential elections held in June 2005 led to a large victory of Mr. Ahmadinejad over
former president Hashemi Rafsanjani. The parliament has strengthened its oversight role as
demonstrated during the confirmation process of new cabinet members, as well as in taking a
more assertive role in economic and financial matters. On the international front, there has
been an escalation of tensions over Iran’s nuclear program.
4.
The new government has committed to the reform agenda outlined in the
current Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (2005/06–2009/10) and the Twenty-Year
Vision. The authorities indicated that their economic policy and reform strategy would aim at
achieving the objectives of the FFYDP, including through privatization, financial sector
reform, an overhaul of the subsidy system, and development of technology and knowledgebased activities. Within this framework, the new government also vowed to concentrate its
efforts on improving social justice, eliminating corruption, and reducing regional economic
disparities.

Box 1. Effectiveness of IMF Surveillance
The main themes of recent IMF surveillance have focused on the macroeconomic imbalances induced by
an expansionary policy stance and the structural impediments to growth and employment creation.
Staff advice has focused on the need to contain the growth of current expenditure while expanding the
non-oil revenue base; enhancing fiscal transparency; reducing the pro-cyclicality of fiscal policy; and
improving its coordination with monetary policy. In principle, the authorities agree with these
recommendations, and have made significant progress in reforming tax administration, improving transparency,
and creating the Oil Stabilization Fund as a buffer against oil price volatility. However, reducing subsidies and
other current expenditure has proved more difficult. Given the sharp rise in oil revenue and the high
unemployment rate, the authorities continue to face intense political pressure to increase spending.
Staff has stressed the need to reduce inflation via more effective policy instruments, greater central bank
independence, and increased exchange rate flexibility. The role of administrative controls in monetary policy
has been reduced somewhat and central bank independence has been recognized as an objective in the FFYDP.
The unification of the exchange rate in 2002 has been successful, paving the way for Iran’s acceptance of the
obligations under Article VIII. However, little progress has been made in reducing inflation and the
effectiveness of monetary policy instruments remains weak. The authorities are reluctant to allow for greater
exchange rate flexibility because of its possible implications for market stability and the competitiveness of the
non-oil sector.
Staff recommended a number of measures aimed at fostering the role of the private sector and improving
the functioning of markets. The authorities have made progress in streamlining regulations on foreign trade
and investment, with the elimination of all non-tariff barriers, continued tariff reduction, and a new FDI law
approved in 2002. Important changes have also been introduced in financial markets, with the implementation of
a large number of the 2000 FSAP recommendations. Following staff advice, the quality of statistics has
improved in important areas. Progress has been slow, however, on privatization, subsidy reform, and labor
market reform.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
5.
After a temporary slowdown in 2004/05, growth resumed on the back of
favorable external conditions and an expansionary policy stance. With agriculture output
affected by adverse weather conditions and weaker construction activity, real GDP growth
decelerated to 4.8 percent in 2004/05 (Figure 1). Preliminary information for the first half
of 2005/06 point to robust economic activity in the non-hydrocarbon sector, while growth in
the oil and gas industries was constrained by capacity. Supported by external demand and
continued strength in consumption and investment, real GDP growth is expected to
accelerate to about 6 percent for 2005/06 as a whole.

6.
The unemployment rate has continued to hover above 10 percent. Reflecting
improvements in economic activity, employment grew strongly in 2004/05 and
unemployment fell to an eight-year low of 10¼ percent. In 2005/06, despite the acceleration
of growth, job creation has not been sufficient to match the new entrants in the labor force—
averaging about 700 thousands or 3.3 percent of the labor force, every year—and
unemployment is projected to edge up to 11 percent.
7.
Inflation remains high, despite its recent decline. Owing to high government
spending and rapid money growth, average CPI inflation failed to decline significantly in
2004/05, hovering above 15 percent (Figure 2). Reflecting the impact of improved weather
conditions on food prices, the price freeze on certain goods and services—including on
highly-subsidized petroleum products—and some exchange rate appreciation, average
inflation is expected to decline to 13 percent in 2005/06. Under the current policy stance,
however, this slowdown is likely to be temporary, and inflation may pick up again once the
adjustment of food prices is completed and the price freeze lifted.1

1

The impact of these transitory factors, although difficult to estimate precisely, is likely to be substantial. While
the weight of explicitly regulated prices in the CPI is relatively small, pricing by the extensive network of stateowned enterprises typically reflects social policy considerations.

A large part of the oil price windfall has been spent by the government. Higher
oil prices raised government revenues by 2¼ percentage points of GDP in 2004/05, and a
further increase of about 2¾ percent of GDP is estimated by staff in 2005/06. Additional
spending on current outlays and subsidies, however, more than offset the oil revenue increase
in 2004/05. With the overall fiscal position deteriorating slightly, the non-oil fiscal deficit of
the central government reached a nine-year high of 19½ percent of GDP (Figure 3 and
Table 2). Large increases in current spending, particularly in subsidies, continued in 2005/06,
although delays in forming the new cabinet and putting in place administrative changes held
back budget execution.2 Due to high oil revenues, the overall fiscal balance is expected to
move into a surplus of 4¼ percent of GDP in 2005/06, while the estimated improvement in
the non-oil deficit to 17½ percent of GDP largely reflects accounting changes.3

2

New measures taken in 2005/06 include the setting up by the new government of a US$1.3 billion fund
(0.8 percent of GDP) to help young couples pay for the cost of marriage and other household expenditure.

3

More specifically, a US$5 billion transfer of tax revenue in domestic currency from the National Iranian Oil
Company (NIOC) to the budget is classified as non-oil revenue, whereas US$2.3 billion subsidies of imported
petroleum products—previously born by NIOC—are now explicitly charged to the government budget. Net of
these changes, the non-oil deficit would have increased slightly as a percentage of GDP.

The external position strengthened significantly over the last two fiscal years.
With hydrocarbon exports increasing by 35 percent in US dollar terms, the current account
surplus reached 2.5 percent of GDP in 2004/05 (Figure 4). Non-hydrocarbon exports also
grew, but not as rapidly, and their contribution to total exports remained relatively small. In
2005/06, notwithstanding some real exchange rate appreciation (see para. 10), export growth
continued apace and import growth decelerated, but remained high. As a result, the current
account surplus is projected to have improved markedly to 6½ percent of GDP, and
international reserves are expected to reach US$47.4 billion by year’s end, equivalent to
9.4 months of next year’s imports of goods and nonfactor services. Although still low at
10¼ percent of GDP, external debt increased significantly in 2004/05, reflecting a larger use
of letters of credit for trade finance and, possibly, to exploit arbitrage opportunities. The
tightening of prudential controls and changing market conditions helped curb this practice in
2005/06.

In the context of the managed float exchange rate regime, the authorities have
allowed the currency to appreciate. To compensate for the inflation differential vis-à-vis
Iran’s trading partners and preserve the competitiveness of the non-oil sector, the central
bank has in the past targeted a gradual nominal depreciation. In 2004/05, despite rising oil
prices, the nominal effective exchange rate depreciated by 11¼ percent, thus helping
maintain the real effective parity unchanged. As external developments became increasingly
favorable and fiscal policy remained expansionary, the central bank allowed the rial to
appreciate in nominal effective terms in the new fiscal year, while the depreciation vis-à-vis
the U.S. dollar continued, albeit at a slower pace. The nominal effective exchange rate had
appreciated by 9½ percent from March to November 2005. Combined with a positive
inflation differential, this led to a significant real effective appreciation (12½ percent),
marking a departure from previous trends (Figure 5).

Monetary policy has remained accommodative. As oil-related inflows grew larger,
the central bank increased its unsterilized purchases of foreign currency. With
administratively-set lending rates relatively low in real terms, credit growth remained close
to 38 percent in 2004/05 and domestic liquidity, as measured by broad money, grew by some
30 percent (Figure 6). As fiscal policy remained expansionary in 2005/06, the central bank
moved to tighten access to its overdraft facilities by commercial banks, and allowed the
exchange rate to appreciate. The task of the central bank was complicated by new challenges
to its operational autonomy, as the authority to approve the issue of central bank participation
papers (CBPPs) was transferred from the Money and Credit Council to parliament, thereby
reducing flexibility in the use of this instrument. Moreover, the rate of return on CBPPs was

- 12 -

lowered from 17 percent to 15.5 percent.4 As a result, new issues of CBPPs were not
sufficient to cover the amortized amounts, which translated into a net injection, rather than a
net withdrawal, of liquidity. Overall, despite the tightening of the central bank credit
facilities, the desired slowdown in money growth could not be achieved, with M2 expected
to increase by 31½ percent in 2005/06 (Figure 6).

Financial markets suffered from political uncertainty. After having experienced
rapid growth in previous years, the stock market lost 20 percent of its value in 2005/06,
reflecting uncertainty in connection with the presidential election and the negotiations on the
nuclear program (Figure 7). Despite the continued rise of nonperforming loans, profitability
in the banking sector strengthened, reflecting increased provisioning in earlier years
(Table 8). For the first time, bank capitalization reached above the 8 percent level
recommended by the Basel I Capital Adequacy Accord.

CBPPs are central bank bonds complying with Islamic finance principles. Issued to the public at a provisional
rate of return (equivalent to an interest rate), they are the key liquidity management tool. The Money and Credit
Council includes, among others, the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance and the head of the Management
and Planning Organization, and is chaired by the Governor of the central bank. The Council sets the rates of
return on the participation papers as well as minimum lending rates for state-owned banks.

Box 2. Subsidies in Iran
Explicit subsidies, which amount to 6 percent of GDP, include budgetary subsidies to households for a number
of essential commodities such as wheat, rice, oil, sugar, milk, and cheese; imports of medical equipment and
pharmaceuticals; fertilizers; gasoline imports; as well as for some debt service payments on publicly-guaranteed
debt. Initially, most of these subsidies had been provided implicitly through the official exchange rate.
Following the 2002 exchange rate unification, they became explicit in the budget. Subsidies are also provided to
farmers by a specialized government-owned agency to guarantee minimum purchase prices of agricultural
products. Food subsidies are rationed through coupons, which are given to all households irrespective of their
income levels. They had a cost of about 4 percent of GDP in 2004/05. Gasoline import subsidies had an
estimated cost to the budget of US$2.1 billion (1.3 percent of GDP) in 2004/05, and are estimated at
US$4.4 billion in 2005/06 (2.3 percent of GDP).
Implicit subsidies to energy prices are estimated at 15½ percent of GDP, based on border prices of hydrocarbon
fuels. The price of gasoline in Iran is about US$0.09 per liter, one of the lowest in the world. Due to car
emissions, air pollution is emerging as a major environmental and health problem, especially in Tehran, which is
among the most polluted cities in the world according to indicators elaborated by the World Resource Institute.

Progress on structural reforms was uneven. Financial system reform has
continued. Minimum lending rates and reserve requirements were unified and the clearing
house was moved from Bank Melli to the central bank. The share of credit subject to
mandatory allocation was further reduced, and banking supervision strengthened. Two
private banks and three non-bank financial institutions were licensed. Parliament approved a
new capital market law and a bill to improve corporate governance in state-owned banks is
under discussion. Other reforms to strengthen central bank operational independence are
being implemented (para. 22). Article 44 of the constitution, which delineates the domains of
activity of the public sector, the cooperative sector, and the private sector, was amended in a
way that opens the door to the privatization of both financial and non-financial enterprises.
Although this change is an important legal step, the scope and modalities of actual
privatization plans are yet to be determined. No progress was achieved on the key reform of
energy subsidies, despite the increasing economic and environmental costs of the current
system.
III. THE POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.

Key issues addressed during the policy discussions were:
a. The economic outlook. While high oil prices and expansionary policies will
continue to boost growth in the short term, medium-term prospects depend largely on
the authorities’ ability to consolidate macroeconomic stability and accelerate
structural reforms.
b. The appropriate fiscal policy stance. Based on current projections of oil
revenues, medium-term sustainability is not an immediate concern. However, fiscal
restraint is required to help monetary policy reduce high persistent inflation, and to
build fiscal savings to cushion against an unexpected downturn in oil prices.
c. Monetary and exchange rate policies aimed at reducing inflation. The FFYDP
identifies single-digit inflation as a medium-term objective. Monetary and exchange
rate policies would need to be consistent with this objective.
d. The structural reform agenda. As the effects of the reforms undertaken at the
beginning of the Third Five-Year Development Plan (TFYDP) may start to taper off,
new impetus is needed to consolidate and strengthen the foundations for further
growth.
A. Economic Outlook

15.
Iran’s short-term outlook is benign. Economic activity will continue to be boosted
by high oil prices, which, under current WEO projections, are expected to persist in the near
future. Based on current policies, the overall fiscal position would remain in surplus, but
inflation could return to its previous levels unless the policy stimulus is reigned in.
Reflecting large current account surpluses, the external debt would continue to decline.
16.
Medium-term prospects, however, look challenging. After strengthening in
2005/06, growth is likely to decelerate gradually in the absence of significant policy changes,

- 15 -

reaching well below the authorities’ average target of 8 percent under the FFYDP. Capacity
constraints in the hydrocarbon sector, high inflation, and the possibility of a prolonged “wait
and see” attitude on the part of the private sector could restrain growth, aggravating the
unemployment problem. This outlook is subject to a high degree of uncertainty related to the
volatility of oil prices, the international tensions over the nuclear issue, and developments in
Iran’s relations with its major trading partners. While the long-term sustainability of current
policies crucially depends on oil prices, a baseline scenario prepared by the staff on the basis
of WEO oil prices suggests that Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF) reserves would decline
significantly by 2010/11 in the absence of policy adjustments (Text Table 1 and Table 7).

B. Fiscal Policy
17.
Staff argued that, while the oil price windfall gave policy more leeway, fiscal
restraint was required for macroeconomic stability. The authorities broadly concurred,
stressing that a downsizing of the government was one of the medium-term objectives of the
FFYDP. In their view, however, job creation in the non-oil sector remained a top policy
priority, for which supporting policies, including the use of increased oil revenue, were
needed. Nonetheless, the authorities stated their commitment to reducing current spending
across government departments, and suggested that the Majlis (parliament) was likely to
discontinue the current practice of authorizing withdrawals from the OSF to finance
expenditure not foreseen in the budget.
18.
The 2006/07 budget currently being discussed by parliament foresees additional
fiscal expansion. Based on current information, the non-oil fiscal deficit is expected to
increase to 18 percent of GDP in 2006/07, raising further concerns about the inflationary
impact of fiscal policy. Staff suggested that the budget be formulated within a framework
aimed at achieving the FFYDP inflation target of 11½ percent. In this regard, it
recommended a fiscal adjustment of about 2 percent of GDP relative to the budget proposal
in order to bring broad money growth down to about 22 percent, compared with a projected
increase to about 35 percent in the absence of additional measures. The required fiscal effort
could be smaller if monetary policy were to be tightened further. Fiscal adjustment could be
achieved mainly by cutting and targeting subsidies, reducing other current outlays, and

- 16 -

containing the growth of capital expenditure, which is expected to rise by some 50 percent.
While the authorities recognized the need to reduce subsidies, they argued that more time
was needed to complete the preparatory work and build consensus on such a difficult reform.
The staff called for steadfast progress in this area and stressed the need for interim measures
to adjust the prices of energy and other subsidized goods and services.
19.
Continued tax reform and increased fiscal transparency remain crucial. The
authorities referred to some reforms introduced in 2004/05, including the removal of tax
exemption for bonyads (charitable organizations), and confirmed that plans to introduce the
VAT in 2007/08 were on course. They also highlighted recent improvements in fiscal
transparency, with the total cost of implicit and explicit subsidies—including on imported
petroleum products—now being fully reflected in the budget. Staff commended the
authorities’ efforts, but stressed the need for further improvements in several areas. In
particular, staff underscored the importance of clarifying the complex financial relationships
within the public sector, consolidating the accounts of the OSF with the central government,
strengthening the budget process and cash management, and improving the quality of fiscal
information (Appendix III).
20.
The authorities concurred with staff that a medium-term fiscal framework could
help anchor fiscal policy and reduce its pro-cyclicality. Staff suggested that a
macroeconomic framework, which should be periodically updated to reflect new
circumstances, would contribute to clarifying the policy trade-offs, improving policy
coordination, and encouraging a more prudent use of oil resources. It would also facilitate
setting fiscal targets consistent with a gradual reduction of inflation to single digits by 2010,
as envisaged by the FFYDP. The authorities underscored that the FFYDP provided such a
medium-term framework, but agreed that it needed to be updated more frequently.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
21.
A more effective and less accommodative monetary policy is needed. Staff
pointed out that money growth had systematically exceeded the central bank target, and that
the volume of CBPPs issued was not sufficient to curb the rapid growth of credit and M2.
Based on the current draft budget, the continuation of an accommodative monetary policy
stance could cause inflation to increase above 15 percent in 2006/07. The authorities noted
that some tightening of monetary conditions had already occurred through higher sales of
foreign exchange to banks and more restricted access to the central bank’s overdraft facility.
Staff called for further monetary policy tightening, including through issuance of CBPPs,
limiting even more the access to the central bank overdraft facility, and a more active use of
the open deposit account (a standing deposit facility at the central bank). Moreover, lending
rates should be increased if warranted by developments in credit and liquidity.

- 17 -

22.
Views differed on the need to strengthen the framework for monetary policy
formulation and implementation. Staff pointed out that a clear mandate and greater central
bank independence in the use of monetary policy instruments were needed to achieve welldefined time-bound objectives. The recent shift of the authority to approve the issue of
CBPPs from the Money and Credit Council (MCC) to parliament and the reduction in the
rates of return on those instruments were clearly inconsistent with these objectives.
Moreover, the use of these policy instruments requires a high degree of flexibility and does
not lend itself to a lengthy parliamentary approval process. The authorities, however, did not
consider the required parliamentary approval for the issue of CBPPs as significantly affecting
central bank autonomy or policy effectiveness. They also pointed to a number of reforms
aimed at strengthening central bank operational independence, which were being introduced
under the FFYDP, such as i) the explicit prohibition of government financing from the
central bank; ii) the transfer of the chair of the MCC from the minister of finance to the
governor of the central bank; and iii) the direct appointment of the governor by the president.
23.
There is a need to allow for greater exchange rate flexibility to help reduce
inflation. Staff noted that, with continued high inflows of oil revenue and an expansionary
fiscal policy, the real effective exchange rate was bound to appreciate. Attempts to resist
nominal appreciation would eventually be followed by higher inflation, thereby undermining
the stated objective of preserving the competitiveness of the non-oil sector. Noting that the
authorities had recently allowed some nominal effective appreciation to take place, staff
advocated further exchange rate flexibility in line with the authorities’ objective of lowering
inflation. The authorities indicated that their exchange rate policy had been successful in
providing stability to the market and enhancing confidence, and that it had contributed to
containing the rapid growth of imports and to building up reserves as a buffer against risks
related to oil price volatility. Staff argued that the vulnerability to oil prices could be better
addressed through a larger accumulation of savings in the OSF, and that fiscal and structural
policies were more appropriate tools to foster competition in the non-oil sector.
24.
Traditional indicators of competitiveness seem adequate, but there is a need for
improvements in the business climate. Staff assessments do not find any significant
misalignment in the exchange rate (Box 3). The recent appreciation in real effective terms is
moderate and can be fully explained by higher long-term oil prices. Moreover, the non-oil
export dynamics do not seem to have been affected adversely. Other impediments to
competitiveness, which are mainly related to the business climate and are likely to
overshadow the importance of the exchange rate, need to be addressed through structural
reforms.

- 18 -

Box 3. Competitiveness and Business Climate in Iran
A recent study by staff concludes that there is no evidence of a significant misalignment of the exchange rate
in Iran.1/ Several indicators suggest that the level of the exchange rate is not an obstacle to the performance of
the tradable sector. One such indicator is the current account “norm,” which defines the long-term level of the
current account for Iran as a function of a number of macroeconomic variables (fiscal balance, net foreign
assets, dependency ratio, terms of trade volatility, financial deepening, relative PPP-adjusted income). The norm
for Iran has been estimated on the basis of coefficients from a cross-country study.2 Depending on the
specification, the estimates vary from a small deficit to a surplus of 1½ percent of GDP for 2003/04, which is
reasonably close to the actual outcome (Table 4). This conclusion is reinforced by the good performance shown
by the tradable sector in recent years, with the volume of non-oil exports increasing by almost 10 percent a year
on average since 2000/01. However, the Iranian economy is affected by various distortions, including interest
rate and price controls, as well as significant direct and indirect subsidies. These distortions may have helped
improve the performance of the tradable sector in the short run, but at the expense of a less efficient allocation
of resources in the long run.
The regulatory environment is a key determinant of competitiveness. Excessive regulation and controls can
impose considerable costs on businesses, preventing competition and stifling innovation. The table below
compares some indicators of business climate in several countries drawn from the World Bank’s Doing
Business database.

These indicators point to several areas where the business climate in Iran could be improved. Obtaining a
license to build a warehouse or completing import procedures takes a large number of procedures and much
longer than in any of the listed countries. Labor market regulations are more restrictive. The cost of hiring a new
workers―expressed as the sum of social security payments and payroll taxes as a percentage of the worker’s
salary―is high by international standards. Employment rigidity―measured by an index encompassing
regulations concerning contract flexibility, minimum wage, working time, and dismissals―is also very high.
Contract enforcement is slow and bankruptcy procedures are protracted. In addition, investor
protection―measured by an index reflecting different aspects of corporate governance―is weak.

D. The Financial Sector
25.
Stepped-up efforts are needed to strengthen the financial sector. The staff
stressed the importance of strengthening the financial system and further enhancing its
supervision. It welcomed the licensing of private banks, insurance, and leasing companies, as
well as the progress being made in upgrading banking supervision. Under the approved
amendment to article 44 of the constitution, bank privatization is possible after restructuring,
and the authorities expressed interest in receiving Fund technical assistance in this area.
While the authorities plan to license additional private banks, they would seek to avoid
creating too many small banks. A major review of the central bank law is expected to start in
2006, and a new portfolio investment law to regulate foreign investment in the stock market
has been prepared. In addition, new legislation on AML/CFT and bank corporate governance
has been tabled for discussion by parliament. The authorities also stated their interest in an
FSAP update during the next fiscal year.
26.
The authorities concurred on the need for close scrutiny of the risks to financial
stability. The authorities agreed that the continued increase in nonperforming loans was a
reason for concern, but noted that it reflected past difficulties in some sectors—like
consumer durables, construction, and textiles—as well as more stringent classification rules.
The recent increase in capital adequacy was largely a result of asset revaluations, but the
authorities were committed to recapitalize public banks. Risks stemming from the excessive
use of letters of credit in the recent past had been averted through effective supervision. The
authorities saw limited risks from the stock market price correction, which followed two
years of very strong performance. The losses incurred were spread among a large number of
investors, with limited repercussions on the balance sheet of financial intermediaries, and
equity prices had stabilized in recent months. The mission underscored the need to further
strengthen the regulatory framework and supervision of the Tehran Stock Exchange and
develop its infrastructure.
E. Structural Policies
27.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to pursuing a wide range of
reforms under the FFYDP. Particular emphasis was given to development of infrastructure
and improvement of the provision of basic services in the most disadvantaged regions outside
Tehran in an effort to reduce economic disparities among the provinces. This is to be
achieved through budgetary allocations and tax incentives to attract private sector investment
in remote areas. Staff pointed out that this program should preferably be carried out through
a reallocation of existing resources, rather than an overall increase in spending.
28.
The authorities expressed their intention to initiate a gradual disengagement of
the government from various economic activities, which is seen as critical to the
development of the private sector. As policies are being reconsidered, the initial
momentum for privatization under the TFYDP has slowed down over the past two years, but
the privatization process is expected to receive new impetus following the amendment of

- 20 -

Article 44 of the constitution.5 However, details concerning major privatization operations
have yet to be worked out and announced. Moreover, under a new privatization scheme
called “justice shares”, which is currently being elaborated, a number of restructured firms
would be grouped in holding companies, and a large proportion of their shares would be
transferred to low-income families and paid for from future dividends. Staff cautioned about
the difficulties encountered in Eastern Europe and other countries with similar privatization
schemes, and encouraged the authorities to seek World Bank assistance in this area.
29.
Further steps have been taken to liberalize trade. Following the end of the ban on
car imports in 2003/04, all import quotas have now been eliminated, with the exception of
those motivated by security and public morality. In addition, the gradual reduction of tariffs
continued during 2004/05, bringing the simple average tariff rate below 23 percent, from
about 25 percent in 2003/04 and 27 percent in 2002/03 (about 60 percent of imports have
tariff rates below 20 percent). Furthermore, the standard tariff rate was consolidated with
commercial taxes on imports.6 On May 26, 2005, a Working Party was established to
consider Iran’s application for accession to the WTO. Accession negotiations could
commence after Iran submits the required Memorandum on Foreign Trade Policies.
30.
On September 6, 2004 , the Islamic Republic of Iran accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. In this regard, the IMF
approved the retention of the exchange restriction and multiple currency practices described
in paragraph 2 of Country Report No. 04/306, Supplementary Information. The exchange
restriction arises from limitations on the transferability of (periodic) rial profits from certain
foreign direct investment under the by-laws of the Foreign Investment Promotion Act.
Notwithstanding the authorities’ commitment to remove this exchange restriction, action was
delayed by the June 2005 presidential elections and the inauguration of the new government.
The authorities have confirmed their intention to review and eliminate this restriction within
one year. The multiple currency practices arise from measures taken in the context of the
unification of the exchange rates in 2002 (Appendix I). One multiple currency practice arises
from budget subsidies for foreign exchange purchases in connection with payments of certain
letters of credit opened prior to March 21, 2002. The outstanding amount of such debt has
continued to decline and now stands at US$2.7 billion. The other multiple currency practice
arises from the obligation of entities that had received allocations of foreign exchange for
payments based on subsidized “allocated rates.” The outstanding amounts are very small.

5
6

In the period 2001–05, 272 state-owned companies were sold for a total exceeding US$2 billion.

The tariff rate is composed of the standard tariff rate and commercial benefit taxes. The former is set by
parliament and has remained unchanged at 4 percent in recent years. In contrast, commercial benefit taxes,
which are set by the government and vary by import category, have changed at least once a year over the recent
past.

- 21 -

F. Other Issues
31.
Further progress has been made in improving statistical information and its
dissemination. Staff noted the authorities’ efforts to enhance the transparency of fiscal
operations, including by making subsidies for imported petroleum products and lending rates
to specific sectors explicit in the budget. However, adequate and timely consolidated data on
fiscal developments for both the central government and the OSF are still lacking. Staff also
pointed out that full compliance with the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS)
required the publication of data on international reserves and the international investment
position. While not ready yet to commit to a timetable, the authorities confirmed their
intention to conform to SDDS requirements. They are also considering a proposal by the
IMF’s Statistics Department for a data ROSC.
32.
The authorities confirmed that discussions were ongoing regarding their contribution
to the new shock facility and the debt relief to Nicaragua and Tanzania under the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
The growth momentum in Iran has continued, but the outlook is fraught with
uncertainties. Iran has enjoyed several years of sustained high growth and employment
creation, following initial advances in opening up the economy and introducing economic
reforms. The growth performance has been supported by high oil revenues and expansionary
policies. While most macroeconomic indicators have continued to improve, inflation remains
relatively high and large subsidies and administrative impediments to economic activity
continue to hamper efficiency. Moreover, the recent escalation of tensions over Iran’s
nuclear program has increased economic uncertainty.
34.
Against this background, a challenging task for the authorities is to consolidate
macroeconomic stability while strengthening the momentum of structural reforms. In
particular, there is a need to focus on lowering inflation and a consistent set of policies to
achieve this objective. In parallel, a deepening and acceleration of structural reforms would
help complete the transition to a market economy, tap Iran’s considerable economic
potential, and provide much needed confidence on the direction of future policies.
35.
Reducing inflation from current levels requires the adoption of a tighter
financial policies stance, which remains expansionary and pro-cyclical. While fiscal and
monetary policies have brought about some short-term gains in terms of output and
employment, this has been achieved at the cost of high and persistent inflation, which can
undermine long-term growth and adversely affect the poor. In addition, attempts to minimize
the side effects of these policies on the competitiveness of the non-oil sector through nominal
exchange rate depreciation can only compound the problem.
36.
A more ambitious fiscal effort involving greater moderation in the pace of
government spending is necessary to reduce demand pressures. While the central
government non-oil deficit is estimated to have declined in 2005/06, additional efforts will be

- 22 -

required in 2006/07 and thereafter to put overall liquidity growth on a declining trend. In
particular, the authorities need to effectively tackle the large subsidies, including on energy
prices, which are a major source of waste and inefficiency and have negative environmental
implications. This would create fiscal space that could be used in part for high-quality
projects in infrastructure and social services, as well as for protecting vulnerable groups.
There is no doubt that competing demands for public resources in an environment of
abundant oil revenue will severely test the authorities’ resolve to rein in public spending.
This strengthens the case for anchoring fiscal policy within a medium-term framework, as
called for by the FFYDP, in order to help reduce its pro-cyclicality and improve policy
coordination.
37.
Monetary policy should be tightened and effective policy instruments provided
to the monetary authorities. A credible disinflation program—based on the targets set by
the FFYDP, with periodic revisions to reflect changing circumstances—requires a clear
definition of the central bank mandate and effective policy instruments. The upcoming
review of the central bank law presents a good opportunity to give adequate emphasis to the
objective of price stability. The central bank should have full authority to issue its
participation papers and greater leeway in ensuring that the MCC decisions about rates of
return are consistent with monetary policy objectives. In addition, a more active use of the
open deposit facility to mop up liquidity would be desirable.
38.
Although the managed float regime has worked well in providing stability to the
foreign exchange market, additional exchange rate flexibility would help attain the
inflation objective. While the recent moderate appreciation in the nominal effective
exchange rate is a welcome step, further flexibility would contribute to lowering inflation,
particularly if high oil prices persist and an expansionary fiscal policy is maintained. In turn,
a vigorous implementation of structural reforms would help foster competitiveness in the
non-oil sector.
39.
Further efforts are needed to address banking sector weaknesses, although there
are no immediate threats to financial stability. The continued increase in nonperforming
loans is a source of concern, both for its fiscal implications and its repercussions on the
health of financial institutions. The authorities should closely monitor bank credit quality to
avert problems that could arise from rapid credit growth. Moreover, it would be important to
move ahead decisively with the government’s plans to improve the management of the large
public banks, recapitalize them, and license additional private banks. A series of reforms
should also be introduced to allow market forces to play a more important role in financial
intermediation, particularly in the determination of rates of return, while ensuring a level
playing field for public and private banks. Further strengthening of supervision for the
banking, insurance, and securities sectors is necessary.
40.
The structural reform agenda should be revived as an effective way to improve
the business climate and accelerate employment creation. Key reforms would need to
focus on reducing the heavy administrative and regulatory burden, removing the distortions
created by subsidies and state ownership of companies, and streamlining labor market

- 23 -

rigidities. Plans for restructuring and privatizing state-owned banks should be accelerated to
complement the ongoing financial sector reform.
41.
The statistical information is adequate for Fund surveillance purposes, but
further improvements in quality are needed. The authorities are encouraged to complete
the necessary steps for full compliance with the SDDS, with a special focus on improving the
quality, timeliness, and availability of information on the operations of the public sector.
42.
The remaining exchange restriction should be removed. The staff welcomes the
authorities’ intention to review the restriction and eliminate it within one year. Therefore, the
staff recommends approval of the retention of the exchange restriction through
March 10, 2007. Regarding the two multiple currency practices, the retention of which had
been approved by the Executive Board though September 10, 2006 (see Country Report
No. 04/306, Supplementary Information), the staff recommends approval of their retention
through March 10, 2009 as these practices are not maintained for balance of payments
purposes, do not materially impede Iran’s balance of payments adjustment, and do not
discriminate among, or harm the interest of, other members.
43.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Islamic Republic of
Iran be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Exchange System

On March 21, 2002, a unified exchange rate regime, based on a managed floating exchange
rate system, was adopted and the former official exchange rate of Rls 1,750 per U.S. dollar
was abolished. The new exchange rate is determined in the interbank foreign exchange
market. As a result, effective March 30, 2002, the exchange rate arrangement of the
Islamic Republic of Iran has been reclassified to the category of managed floating with no
preannounced path for the exchange rate from the conventional pegged arrangement. Under
the new foreign exchange regulations (a) there is no surrender requirements of the foreign
exchange earned by non-oil exporters; (b) the need for and the amount of advance deposits
for opening letters of credit are now left to the discretion of the authorized financial
institutions; (c) the procedure of foreign exchange allocation for authorized imports has been

- 34 -

APPENDIX I

eliminated; (d) the distinction between internally and externally sourced foreign exchange
deposit accounts has been largely eliminated; and (e) the base rate for converting the
U.S. dollar value of imports for the collection of customs duties and commercial benefits
taxes were revised from Rls 1,750 per U.S. dollar to the market rate.
With effect from September 6, 2004, the Islamic Republic of Iran accepted the obligations
under Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Prior to
March 21, 2002, the foreign exchange market operated mostly under a multiple exchange
system, consisting of two officially approved rates: (a) an official exchange rate pegged
at Rls 1,750 per U.S. dollar that applied mainly to imports of essential goods and services as
well as servicing public and publicly guaranteed debt; and (b) an effective Tehran Stock
Exchange (TSE) rate, applicable for imports from a positive list issued by the Ministry of
Commerce. There was also an unofficial exchange market and the CBI allowed commercial
banks limited access to this market to cover certain current transactions.
Based on the information available to date, the staff concludes that Iran maintains one
exchange restriction and two multiple currency practices subject to Fund jurisdiction under
Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. The restrictions identified are as follows:
a.
The exchange restriction arises from limitations set out in the by-laws adopted to
implement the Foreign Investment and Promotion Act on the transferability of (periodic) rial
profits from certain foreign direct investments.
b.

The multiple currency practices arise from:
Budget subsidies for foreign exchange purchases in connection with payments
of certain letters of credit opened prior to March 21, 2002 under the previous multiple
exchange rate system; and
•

Obligation of entities that had received allocation of foreign exchange for
payments based on subsidized “allocated rates” under the previous multiple exchange
rate system to surrender unused allocations to the CBI at the allocation rate.
•

The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on September 10,

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of January 31, 2006)
1.
As of January 31, 2006, Iran received 54 World Bank loans totaling $3,163 million
net of cancellations and terminations, of which $1,989 million have been disbursed. The
ongoing portfolio consists of nine loans in the total amount of $1,355 million, of which
$1,167 million remain undisbursed.
2.
World Bank lending to Iran resumed in 2000 after a hiatus of seven years. This
coincided with the revival of the government’s large reconstruction effort. Between 2000 and
April 2005, the Board approved seven projects: Tehran Sewerage Project, Second Primary
Health Care and Nutrition Project, Environmental Management, two Emergency Earthquake
Reconstruction projects (following the Qazwin and Bam earthquakes), Environmental
Management, Ahwaz and Shiraz Water and Sanitation, Urban Upgrading and Housing
Reform, Northern Cities Water and Sanitation, and Alborz Integrated Land and Water
Management.
3.
On May 2001, a two-year Interim Assistance Strategy (IAS) was approved by the
Board of Executive Directors. This strategy followed a two-pronged approach: (a) policy
dialogue on the reform program through nonlending services; and (b) targeted lending in key
social and environment areas consistent with the Third FYDP objectives. During the IAS
period, the World Bank undertook a series of economic studies in support of the
government’s reform efforts, which formed the basis for policy dialogue and analysis. These
include a study on the reform of the Energy Pricing System, a Trade and Foreign Exchange
System Reform Study, a Public Expenditure Review, and a Country Economic Memorandum
(CEM), as well as other sectoral studies. In addition, Policy Review Notes were prepared for
urban water, housing, agriculture, and air pollution control. Work is under way on the
pension system and safety nets.
4.
A new four-year Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) is under preparation. The
overarching aim of the new CAS is to assist the government in implementing the structural
reform agenda, supporting the transformation of the economy, promoting high and
sustainable growth, and creating employment opportunities. The CAS lays the emphasis on
poverty alleviation and capacity building for a knowledge-based economy. It envisages a
lending program in water and sanitation, urban transport, agriculture, community-based
development, and education and vocational training. The analytical and advisory program
proposes to include public finance, financial and public sector reform, and human capital
development, in addition to ongoing work on growth diagnostic as well as public expenditure
and pension strategies. The CAS also seeks to align its policy recommendations with the
government’s priorities and the objectives of the Fourth FYDP. To support Iran’s reform
efforts, the World Bank is intensifying its assistance for capacity building in the formulation,
sequencing, and implementation of economic and sectoral policies.

- 38 -

APPENDIX II

5.
The International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) support of the World Bank’s program
for Iran will focus on selected investments as well as technical assistance and advisory
services. IFC’s activities will support the private sector supply response that Iran needs to
achieve higher and sustained growth and accelerate job creation. IFC will support the
establishment of a modern, open, and competitive financial sector, a cornerstone for private
sector development. As of January 31, 2006, IFC’s committed portfolio in Iran was $29
million, primarily in the financial sector.
6.
Iran became a full member of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
in December 2003. In May 2005, MIGA has issued $122 million in guarantee coverage for a
joint venture petrochemical project, its first coverage ever for a project in Iran. At present,
MIGA is considering several arrangements to provide coverage for both inward and outward
investment. There appears to be significant potential demand for MIGA guarantees among
Iranian investors venturing abroad. As the Iranian government and Iranian companies
become more aware of MIGA’s potential value added in South-South transactions, MIGA
may see more requests for coverage, especially for transactions with neighboring countries
like Afghanistan and Iraq.

APPENDIX III

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Iran’s data provision to the Fund is adequate for effective surveillance,; however, adequate
and timely consolidated fiscal data for both the central government and Oil Stabilization
Fund (OSF) are still lacking. The data transmitted to the Fund, through direct contacts with
the authorities and/or through the Executive Director’s office, provide a basis for adequate
assessment of economic developments and a realistic perspective on Iran’s medium-term
prospects. The Central Bank of Iran’s new Economic Accounts Department has implemented
significant improvements in the statistical database, including the regarding dissemination of
data to the public. The quarterly publication on economic and financial data, Economic
Trends, is disseminated on the internet at <http://www.cbi.ir/e/>, ahead of the release of the
hard copy publication. However, the timeliness of key monthly data could be improved by
the implementation of data dissemination practices that incorporate revision policies and by
the utilization of electronic modes of data release that would also enhance data accessibility.
A multisector mission of the Statistics Department (STA) of the Fund visited Iran during
June 18–July 1, 2002 to assess current data dissemination practices against the requirements
of the SDDS. The mission also provided assistance on ways to further improve the
compilation of the macroeconomic statistics. In December 2003 and June 2004, STA
reviewed data dissemination practices and further advised the authorities on the steps needed
to subscribe to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
Real sector statistics
•

National accounts statistics are reasonably sound. The CBI has updated the quarterly
GDP statistics for the period 1988–2003. Most of the recommendations made by the
1999 STA mission have been fully implemented, most notably concerning the change
of the base year to 1997/98 for the constant price calculations; implementation of the
1993 SNA; and the development of quarterly national accounts. Improvements have
also been made in the coverage of the informal economy. However, there is scope for
further work, especially in the coverage of small-scale industries and services. Also,
the recommended joint project between the CBI and the Statistical Center of Iran
(SCI) to compare and analyze the two sets of estimates of GDP they compile is
pending.

•

Price statistics have generally been reported to the Fund in a timely manner. The
official labor market statistics are released by the Statistical Center of Iran (SCI), and
are based on the definition recommended by the International Labor Organization
(ILO). The data are based on an urban and rural population sample of about 100,000
households, and the threshold for considering a person employed is two days a

- 40 -

week. Labor market statistics, however, could benefit from further improvement,
particularly with regard to employment and wage data.
Government finance statistics
•

One significant improvement has been the adoption of the classification
recommended by the Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2001 (GFSM 2001)
Government Finance Statistics (GFS) classification for the core central government
operations which will enhance transparency and help improve fiscal management.

•

Coverage of the 2003/04 budget was broadened and implicit energy subsidies were
have been included in the budget for the first time.

•

Data on the central government operations cover the general budget, the special
purpose funds, and transactions with the Social Security Organization. There is a
need to expand the coverage of central government to include the complete
transactions of the Social Security Organization, four pension funds, five
procurement and distribution centers, and the OSF.

•

Only experimental data for the consolidated central and general government,
comprising the central government and the municipalities, are compiled. The
preliminary data are compiled with a sample of municipalities (including all the large
municipalities and a reduced number of smaller local governments). About one or
two years later more complete municipalities data are used to compile the final
estimates. Based on the available information, these data are not disseminated,
although they are used for compiling the SNA.

•

The existing cash-based government accounting system should be upgraded to enable
recording of expenditures at the pre-payment stage.

•

Financing data in the GFS are not broken down by residency of debt holders or by
type of debt instruments. Data used by the Economic Research and Policy
Department (ERPD) for preparing financing data could be further analyzed to
distinguish debt by type of holder and by instrument. The discrepancy between fiscal
and monetary data on deficit financing remains has often been relatively large. From
an SDDS perspective, this discrepancy raised questions about the accuracy of the
fiscal data. The SDDS missions held a number of meetings with the authorities with
the objective of explaining ways to improving improve the collection and
classification of government debt. No information is available on the status of the
implementation of these recommendations.

•

Information on domestic government debt with the CBI and commercial banks are
disseminated in the Table, “Monetary and Credit Aggregates Outstanding at the end
of the Period” in Economic Trends. However, domestic debt with the public at large,
or economic sectors excluding the banking sector, mainly in the form of Government

- 41 -

Participation Papers (GPP), are debt held by nonbanks, with the public at large, or
economic sectors excluding the banking sector, mainly in the form of Government
Participation Papers (GPP), is not monitored. There is a need to develop a
comprehensive database on domestic public debt, with a breakdown by domestic
creditor.
•

The Bonyad-e-Mostazafan va Janbazan (BMJ, Foundation of the Oppressed and
Injured) could be considered a holding company and can be classified in the
nonfinancial public corporations sector.

Monetary statistics
•

Monthly monetary data reported to STA on a regular basis for publication in IFS, but
periodicity has been lagging recently.

•

Compilation of monetary statistics diverges from international standards in the
application of the residency criterion and in sectorization and classification. The
authorities are undertaking improvements in each of these areas, in line with the
recommendations of two recent STA missions.

•

The measure of broad money employed by the CBI does not include deposits of
public nonfinancial corporations, local government, and or foreign-currency deposits
of residents. As a result, the broad money stock tends to be underestimated.

•

In the CBI’s analytical accounts, central bank participation papers (CPPs) are
included in other unclassified liabilities. Separate data on holdings of CPPs broken
down by bank holders and nonbank holders should be collected in the CBI monthly
report. These Disaggregated separate data will allow the CBI and other data users to
construct broader liquidity measures, which will include CPPs held by nonbank
sectors.

External sector data
•

The accounting system for foreign exchange receipts and payments of the CBI and
banks is being designed implemented in line with the methodological guidelines of
the Fund’s Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5) and is being put in
operation. Periodic dissemination of balance of payments presentation based on
BPM5 is expected later this year.

•

In line with the effort of improving the balance of payments estimates for transactions
not recorded in the BPM4 format and for which historical data are unavailable, the
coverage of services and other balance of payments entries have been significantly
improved. In particular, the services debit and credit entries for 2000/01–2002/03
have been revised. Work is proceeding to carry these revisions to past seven years.

- 42 -

Moreover, the balance of payments has been revised to better reflect buy-back
transactions under direct investment and other balance of payments entries.
•

Data on the international investment position are compiled, but not disseminated.
Only data on public and publicly guaranteed debt are compiled and disseminated, but
classifications do not fully accord with the guidelines of the External Debt Guide.
The data template on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity is not
compiled; the June 2004 STA mission provided technical advice on the methodology
and compilation aspects of this dataset.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
March 10, 2006
Since the issuance of the Staff Report, the following information has become available to
staff. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
CPI inflation declined from an annual rate of 11.3 percent in December 2005 to
10.7 percent in January 2006. In the twelve months ending in January 2006, the average
inflation rate was in line with the staff projection for the Iranian year 2005/06 as a whole.
Preliminary information for the quarter ending in December 2005 indicates that monetary
aggregates continued to grow rapidly, with broad money increasing at an annual rate of
33 percent. At Rls 9,131 per U.S. dollar at the end of February 2006, the bilateral exchange
rate has been stable, having depreciated by only 0.4 percent in the last two months.
2.
Based on preliminary information, the balance of payments’ current account surplus
is likely to exceed the staff projections for 2005/06. This reflects strong performance of
non-oil exports, while the growth of imports seems to have been relatively contained.
3.
Developments in the stock market have been mixed. After staging a moderate
recovery from the low level reached in November 2005, trade on the Tehran Stock Exchange
weakened, and the main price index dropped by 4 percent during the two months
January-February 2006.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 27, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
the Islamic Republic of Iran
On March 10, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Islamic Republic of Iran.1
Background
During the Third Five-Year Development Plan (TFYDP, 2000/01–2004/05), real GDP
growth reached 5½ percent a year on average, unemployment declined, and
macroeconomic indicators improved significantly, supported by favorable oil market
conditions. By increasing the openness of the economy and removing major obstacles
to trade and investment, the reforms introduced in the period 2000/01–2002/03
contributed significantly to this strong performance. Many challenges, however, lie
ahead. The economy remains heavily dependent on oil and demographic dynamics will
put increasing pressure on the labor market in the coming years. Expansionary fiscal
and monetary policies have kept inflation relatively high at about 15 percent. Extensive
administrative controls, widespread subsidies, and labor market regulations impose
substantial efficiency costs.
On the back of favorable external conditions and an expansionary policy stance, growth
resumed in 2005/06 after a temporary slowdown in the previous year. Activity has been
strong, mostly in the non-hydrocarbon sector, and real GDP growth is expected to
accelerate to about 6 percent in 2005/06. Unemployment, however, has continued to
hover around 11 percent. Reflecting the impact of improved weather conditions on food
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments
and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

-2-

prices, the price freeze on certain goods and services, and some exchange rate
appreciation, inflation is expected to decline to 13 percent in 2005/06.
Government spending, particularly on subsidies, has continued to increase on the back
of higher oil revenue, and the non-oil deficit is expected to remain high. As external
developments became increasingly favorable and fiscal policy remained expansionary,
the central bank allowed the exchange rate to appreciate in nominal effective terms in
2005/06. However, export growth continued apace and the current account surplus is
projected to rise to 6½ percent of GDP, with international reserves reaching about
$47 billion by year’s end, equivalent to 9½ months of next year’s imports of goods and
nonfactor services. External debt remains low.
As oil-related inflows grew larger, and fiscal policy remained expansionary, the
central bank increased its unsterilized purchases of foreign currency to limit the
exchange rate appreciation. The monetary impact of these purchases was only partially
offset by a tightening of the banks’ access to the central bank credit facility, while the
use of its participation papers (central bank bonds complying with Islamic finance
principles) was not sufficient to mop up excess liquidity. Overall, the desired slowdown
in money growth was not achieved. After having experienced rapid growth in previous
years, the stock market lost about 20 percent of its value in 2005/06, reflecting
uncertainty in connection with the presidential election and the negotiations on Iran’s
nuclear program.
Progress on structural reforms has been uneven. While financial system reform has
continued, no decision has been taken on the key reform of energy subsidies, despite
the increasing economic and environmental costs of the current system. The
amendment of article 44 of the constitution—which delineates the domains of activity of
the public sector, the cooperative sector, and the private sector—opens the door to the
privatization of both financial and nonfinancial enterprises. Although this change is an
important legal step, the scope and modalities of actual privatization plans are yet to be
determined.
The short-term outlook is relatively favorable. Economic activity will continue to be
boosted by high oil prices, although inflation could start rising again, unless the policy
stimulus is reigned in. Reflecting large current account surpluses, the external debt
would decline. In the medium term, however, prospects look challenging. Oil price
volatility and capacity constraints in the oil sector, international tensions over the nuclear
issue, and the possibility of a prolonged period of “wait and see” on the part of the
private sector could adversely affect the economic outlook.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors observed that real GDP growth has been robust in 2005/06 and the
external position has strengthened as a result of the structural reforms implemented at
the beginning of the TFYDP, favorable oil market conditions, and an expansionary policy
stance. However, Directors expressed concern over the persistent high inflation that
hurts the poor and fixed-income earners, the slower pace of structural reforms, and the
vulnerability of the economy to a potential decline in oil prices. Directors considered that

-3-

the key medium-term challenge will be to sustain high growth rates in the non-oil sector
to increase employment opportunities and improve the living standard of the population.
To address this challenge in an effective and sustainable way, it will be crucial to reduce
inflation significantly by tightening financial policies and to accelerate the momentum for
structural reforms to stimulate private sector development, lessen the dependence on
the oil sector, and enhance economic efficiency, consistent with the objectives of the
Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (FFYDP).
Directors noted that the substantial pro-cyclical fiscal stimulus in recent years has
contributed to maintaining double-digit inflation, and underscored the need to reduce the
pace of fiscal expansion and to build up precautionary savings in the Oil Stabilization
Fund (OSF), consistent with the original objectives in the OSF legislation. In this context,
Directors cautioned against using OSF resources to further increase government
spending, as envisaged in the proposed budget for 2006/07. They recommended
instead a vigorous fiscal consolidation with a reduction in government outlays in relation
to GDP and implementation of revenue-enhancing measures through a broadening of
the tax base and an accelerated pace of introduction of the Value Added Tax, which has
been in the preparation stage for a number of years. Moreover, Directors emphasized
the need for fiscal policy to be anchored within a medium-term framework to help reduce
its pro-cyclicality and improve policy coordination. Directors noted with concern the size
of the growing and ill-targeted subsidies, particularly on energy, which have harmful
economic and environmental consequences. They welcomed the indications that the
authorities plan to gradually phase out implicit energy subsidies and reduce explicit
subsidies, in order to enhance economic efficiency and channel resources toward more
productive uses. Accordingly, Directors urged an expeditious design and implementation
of a phased program of overhauling the system, with clear time-bound reduction targets,
as well as an efficient social safety net to protect the vulnerable groups.
Directors called for a tightening and a more effective use of monetary policy instruments
to lower inflation to single-digit levels, consistent with the FFYDP. They welcomed the
reduction in access to the central bank’s overdraft facility and increased use of central
bank participation papers, and encouraged a more active use of the open deposit
account. While welcoming the recent steps, as well as the measures to increase the
operational independence of the central bank under the FFYDP, Directors expressed
concern about the new requirement of parliamentary approval for the issuance of central
bank participation papers, which limits the flexibility of central bank operations in
managing domestic liquidity. They noted that administrative controls on the rates of
return charged on bank loans and on central bank participation papers and the
continuation of directed credit hinders financial intermediation. Directors urged the
authorities to remove these administrative controls and allow the rates of return to be
market-determined to strengthen financial intermediation. More generally, Directors
noted that a credible and successful disinflation effort will require a clearer mandate for
the central bank and more effective policy instruments at its disposal. They considered
that the upcoming review of the central bank law offers a good opportunity to address
these issues in a decisive manner. The authorities were commended for enacting AntiMoney Laundering/Combating Financing of Terrorism legislation, and were urged to
implement it expeditiously.

-4-

Directors noted that the exchange rate had been allowed to appreciate somewhat,
reflecting more favorable external conditions, but, given that the fiscal stance continues
to impart an expansionary impulse to the economy, they stressed the need for greater
exchange rate flexibility to help contain inflationary pressures. Looking forward,
Directors emphasized that the concerns on the exchange rate policy for competitiveness
should be addressed by reinvigorating implementation of structural reforms and major
improvements in the business climate.
Directors welcomed the progress made in establishing a risk-based supervision
framework and other reforms aimed at improving the functioning of financial markets.
However, they expressed concern that the continued increase in nonperforming loans
and the rapid credit growth could exacerbate potential weaknesses in the financial
system. Directors encouraged the authorities to further strengthen the supervision of
banks, insurance companies, and securities markets. They commended the authorities
for licensing additional private banks and insurance companies and encouraged them to
continue opening up the banking sector to private sector participation, including through
privatization, which had been made possible by the amendment to Article 44 of the
constitution.
Directors underscored the importance of fostering private sector development to sustain
strong growth and employment creation. They encouraged the authorities to focus on
reducing the administrative and regulatory burden on private sector activities, removing
barriers to competition, streamlining labor market regulations, and removing other
impediments to efficiency, and accelerating the implementation of the privatization
program.
Directors urged prompt action to eliminate the residual exchange restriction on the
making of payments and transfers for current transactions, and welcomed the
authorities’ commitment in this regard.
Directors recognized the progress made in improving data quality and transparency.
In particular, they were encouraged by the identification of subsidies in the central
government budget. Directors stressed, however, that more work is needed to ensure
an adequate and timely monitoring of public sector operations. Accordingly, they
encouraged the authorities to develop a consolidated public sector balance sheet with
possible technical assistance from the World Bank and the IMF. They urged the
authorities to complete the requirements for full compliance with the Special Data
Dissemination Standard.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of
the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the
country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article
IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional
level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with
longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of
general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

March 10, 2006

My authorities thank staff for the frank, candid, and fruitful dialogue, appreciate their hard
work in preparing this year’s Article IV consultation report, and concur with the thrust of
their appraisal. The new government, which assumed office in August 2005, is aware of the
need to address the challenges ahead—including increasing employment opportunities for the
growing labor force, containing inflation, and reducing the economy’s dependence on oil—
and is committed to continued implementation of the ambitious reform agenda envisaged in
the Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (FFYDP) and the Twenty-Year Vision.
Developments in 2004/05-2005/06
As the staff report notes, growth decelerated in 2004/05 to 4.8 percent due to adverse weather
conditions, slowdown in construction activities, and capacity constraint in the hydrocarbon
sector. Activity is expected to strengthen in 2005/06 to 6 percent, supported by buoyant
aggregate demand and recovery of the construction and agricultural sectors. Inflation has
declined to an average of 13 percent in 2005/06 as a result of lower prices of tradable goods
and house rents as well as the price freeze on food and petroleum products. Unemployment
also receded to an eight-year low of 10.3 percent in 2004/05 as job creation exceeded the
flow of new entrants to the labor market. External position improved on account of high oil
prices and strong non-oil exports, and gross official reserves increased further. The structural
reforms implemented during the TFYDP have resulted in rapid growth of the non-oil sector
at a rate exceeding the pace of growth in the overall economy for the fifth consecutive year.
In addition, reforms have resulted in the steady growth of TFP. Living standards have
improved with per capita income increasing, on average, by 4 percent. According to a recent
study by the central bank, income distribution has improved as the Gini index has declined
by 2 percentage points to about 40 percent.
Fiscal transparency was improved in 2004/05 as implicit subsidies, including on imported oil
products, were incorporated in the budget. This, combined with additional current spending,
resulted in deterioration of the overall fiscal deficit even though government revenues
increased substantially. For the first time in four years, the overall fiscal balance is expected
to turn positive in 2005/06 reflecting higher oil revenues and expenditure restraint in the
second half of the year. Capital expenditure remained broadly constant in GDP terms and the
increase in subsidies was more than offset by higher oil revenues.
Monetary policy remained accommodative despite central bank’s efforts to control liquidity.
The growth in broad money was around 30 percent in 2004/05, of which 23 percent was due
to an increase in net foreign assets. To mop up the additional liquidity, the central bank
issued CBPPs for 5 trillion rials. In 2005/06, it reduced credit to banks and allowed the
exchange rate to appreciate. The Money and Credit Council (MCC) unified the minimum
lending rate at 16 percent, one percentage point higher than the previous average of a
plethora of lending rates. There is no ceiling on the lending rate and, with an inflation rate of
13 percent, there is a positive real rate of return.

-2The central bank has been granted organizational independence. The Governor of the central
bank now chairs the MCC—formerly chaired by the Minister of Finance—and is directly
appointed by the President. With a share of about 9 percent of total assets and 12 percent of
deposits, private banks have rapidly increased their market share since they began operating
in 2001. There are currently five private banks on the mainland, and two foreign banks
operating in the free-trade zones without any restriction. Two private banks and three nonbank credit institutions have been licensed recently. Banks’ profitability has improved and,
for the first time, their capitalization exceeded the 8 percent level recommended by the Basel
I Capital Adequacy Accord. The share of credit subject to mandatory allocation has been
further reduced to about 25 percent, banking supervision has strengthened, and offshore
banks are being supervised in accordance with the regulations for mainland banks. The stock
market has begun to stabilize, the new capital market law has been enacted, and further steps
have been taken to strengthen infrastructure and regulation of the stock exchange. A new
portfolio investment law has been approved by the Council of Stock Exchange to regulate
foreign investment in the stock market.
Despite higher imports stemming from trade liberalization and strong domestic demand, the
external position remained favorable, underpinned by high international oil prices and strong
non-oil exports, with a declining trend of the external debt-to-GDP ratio, and a rapid
accumulation of international reserves. In 2004/05, the current account surplus reached
2.5 percent of GDP. The rapid growth in exports continued in 2005/06 and is projected to
increase the current account surplus to 6.5 percent of GDP. The external debt that had
increased in 2004/05 due to a larger use of letters of credit for trade finance has been curbed
by a tightening of prudential control.
Under a new privatization strategy, a number of restructured firms have been grouped in
holding companies and 30 percent of their shares, called “justice shares,” will be transferred
to low-income families at market prices to be paid from future dividends. This scheme has
already been initiated in four provinces. The remaining 70 percent of the share will be
privatized through the stock exchange. As a result of this privatization strategy, the market
capitalization is expected to increase by 100 percent before the end of 2006. The new
legislation on AML/CFT, recently approved by parliament, awaits the approval of the
Guardian Council, the body responsible for ensuring consistency of all legislation with the
constitution. In addition, a law on bank corporate governance is under discussion in the
parliament. An important decision has been made to allow majority private-sector ownership
of enterprises in key sectors of the economy; accordingly, the sale of up to 65 percent of
shares in most state-owned companies is now permitted. This will further enhance the private
sector share in non-oil economic activities which, in terms of value added, has grown to an
estimated 71 percent of the total. In the trade area, following the earlier important
liberalization efforts, the simple average tariff was reduced further to 22.6 percent from
25.7 percent. A working party for accession to WTO was established on May 26, 2005.
Near-term prospects and policies
The growth momentum is expected to continue as the GDP is projected to grow by
5.8 percent in 2006/07. Fiscal policy will be guided by the objectives of the FFYDP, and

-3fiscal prudence strengthened through revenue enhancement and expenditure restraint. The
2006/07 budget is being discussed by the parliament, and a 20-25 percent cut in expenditures
has been proposed by a special committee charged with the initial vetting of the budget. The
parliament has reiterated that the rule on no-government borrowing from the central bank
will be strictly enforced. Efforts are underway to strengthen tax administration and reduce
exemptions, while preparations for the implementation of the VAT in 2006/07 are
progressing.
Monetary policy will aim at containing broad money growth to about 24 percent to reduce
inflationary pressures. To mop up excess liquidity, the central bank has been authorized to
issue additional CBPPs, as needed. The managed floating exchange rate regime continues to
serve the economy well and competitiveness remains satisfactory, as evidenced by the strong
growth of non-oil exports. It has also provided stability to the market and has helped contain
the rapid growth of imports and build up reserves. The exchange rate policy will continue to
balance concerns for competitiveness and disinflation. In the external sector, increased nonoil exports and high oil prices are expected to keep the current account at a surplus of 6
percent of GDP. External debt is set to decline, while gross official reserves, including the
OSF, are projected to increase further.
The authorities are fully aware that an accelerated pace of implementation of structural
reforms is needed to improve total factor productivity growth and enhance competitiveness.
They intend, therefore, to press ahead with their reform agenda. They will continue to
improve financial operations and management of public enterprises and take steps to enhance
private-sector participation in the economy. To strengthen the growth of the private sector,
access to credit to small- and medium-size firms will be further improved. The monetary and
banking law has been reviewed and a bill is under preparation with new amendments to
enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy, including transfer of the authority of issuing
participation papers back to the central bank, given to parliament in 2004/05. A rial interbank
market, incorporating Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS), will become operational
in 2006/07. Efforts at improving the legal and economic environment for foreign direct
investment will continue.
Medium-term policies
The authorities recognize the need to improve substantially the productive utilization of the
country’s considerable resources. On the fiscal front, they intend to reduce dependency on oil
revenues. In line with the objective of the FFYDP, this includes gradual phasing out of
implicit energy subsidies, reduction in explicit subsidies, strengthening of the non-oil
revenue base, reducing tax exemptions, and improving expenditure management. In the
financial area, they plan to implement a broad reform and liberalization agenda, including
establishment of a dynamic and competitive banking system. Privatization of four stateowned banks is on the agenda; they are being restructured to facilitate their sale under the
amendment to Article 44 of the Constitution. The authorities have requested Fund technical
assistance in this area.

-4The FFYDP aims at reducing economic disparities among the provinces through
redistribution of budgetary resources and improved living conditions of the poor as well as
providing impetus to growth and employment by increasing the role of the private sector in
economic activities in line with the amendment of Article 44 of the Constitution. The
authorities are fully committed to achieving the poverty and unemployment reduction
objectives as well as substantial gains in efficiency and competitiveness as envisaged in the
FFYDP, including through labor market reforms and further improved business conditions.
My authorities have high regards for Fund’s views, appreciate the advice of the Executive
Directors, and look forward to the Board discussion of this year’s Article IV consultation
report.
