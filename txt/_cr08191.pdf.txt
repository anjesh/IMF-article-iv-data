EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions with Kuwait focused on oil sector prospects,
policies to contain inflationary pressures, the fiscal strategy to utilize rising oil wealth, the
financial sector, and domestic and external stability in the context of the pegged exchange
rate regime.
Economic developments and outlook
Kuwait’s macroeconomic performance has been strong and the outlook remains very
favorable. Non-oil GDP continues to expand rapidly and both the fiscal and external current
account remain in large surplus. Although oil sector growth is projected to moderate over the
medium term, non-oil activities are expected to remain buoyant spurred by rising wealth and
confidence, public investment, and structural reforms to support private sector investment
growth.
The authorities’ views and plans
•

Undertake large-scale investments to expand oil production and refining capacity.

•

A fiscal strategy involving higher capital spending, limiting expanding current
expenditure, and saving part of the oil wealth to reduce dependency on oil income for
funding the budget.

•

Continue a basket peg regime that has kept the Kuwaiti dinar (KD) broadly in line with
fundamentals, although it constrains the ability to contain credit expansion and
speculative capital movements.

Staff recommendations
•

Contain inflationary pressures by enhancing the supply response in the nontradables
sector, limiting government current spending to keep the economy from overheating,
and slowing credit growth.

•

Strengthen further the fiscal framework to balance the objectives of ensuring
intergenerational equity, containing inflation, and meeting infrastructural needs of the
oil and non-oil sectors.

•

In the context of the pegged exchange regime and the easing monetary stance in the
U.S., use available tools to restrain credit growth and deter speculative capital flows,
and remain vigilant towards possible financial system vulnerabilities.

•

Support private sector-led investment and growth by bringing capital market,
companies, competition, public-private partnerships and privatization laws in line with
best international practice.

•

Enhance scope for involving foreign technical know-how in the development of
Kuwait’s northern oil fields.

•

This policy mix should contribute to domestic and external stability, and help address
the current moderate undervaluation of the KD.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Since last year’s Article IV consultation, Kuwait’s strong economic and financial
position has improved further, but inflation has risen. Growth in the non-oil economy has
been over 9 percent, and the large increase in oil revenue generated substantial fiscal and
external current account surpluses, enabling the country to build up the stock of foreign
assets.1 Structural reforms continued, aimed at promoting a dynamic private sector driven
economy and enhancing incentives for bringing in foreign technical know-how.
2.
Kuwait made important progress on the issues raised in the 2007 consultation.
The authorities announced a schedule to close the actuarial deficit of Kuwait Public Institute
for Social Security (KPISS) by 2009, strengthened further the fiscal framework, expanded
the privatization program, reduced taxes on foreign investors, worked with parliament to give
priority to the capital market law and other draft laws that would facilitate broadening the
role of private sector, continued to refine their periodic stress-testing of banks, reaffirmed
their commitment to join the GCC monetary union, and continued to apply the Kuwaitization
policy flexibly.
3.
The discussions focused on oil sector prospects, policies to contain inflationary
pressures, the fiscal strategy to utilize rising oil wealth and advancing fiscal reforms,
monetary policy and financial sector developments, structural reforms to support private
sector-led investment and employment generation, and domestic and external stability.

Kuwait has two saving funds managed by the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA): the Reserve Fund for
Future Generations (RFFG) and the General Reserve Fund (GRF), which is primarily a stabilization fund. Ten
percent of total government revenue is transferred to RFFG, which also retains its investment income; any
budget surplus is transferred to the GRF.

•

Growth: Kuwait’s oil production declined by 2.6 percent in 2007 in line with decisions
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) (Table 1). Non-oil
activity—particularly in financial, transportation, and communication services—grew
almost 9 percent, adding jobs in the private sector for both Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis,
and boosting workers’ remittances to poorer countries in Asia and the Middle East.

•

Inflation has been gradually picking up, reaching 7 percent y/y in October 2007, driven
both by domestic demand pressures (especially rents) and higher import prices (mostly
food). Asset prices surged, with a 25 percent increase of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
(KSE) index during 2007 and even higher increases in real estate prices.

•

Exchange rate: The authorities abandoned the peg to the U.S. dollar in May 2007, and
pegged the KD to an undisclosed basket of currencies in an attempt to dampen imported
inflation related to rising world food prices and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar. The
move coincided with speculative inflows as some market participants expected a large
revaluation (similar speculation occurred later in other GCC countries). In the event, the
KD appreciated by 5.9 percent against the U.S. dollar during 2007. The real effective
exchange rate (REER) of the KD has been trending upwards since 2005.

•

Monetary policy: Within the constraints of the peg, the CBK sought to dampen capital
inflows by driving down the KD interbank rate (KIBOR) below LIBOR, and to contain
the expansion of monetary aggregates by tightening the 80 percent loan-to-deposit ceiling
in place since July 2004, requiring the ratio to be met on average during the month rather
than only at the end of the month. Even so, broad money grew by 19 percent and credit to
the economy by 36 percent during 2007 (Table 4).

•

Fiscal policy continued to be expansionary in 2007. Overall spending rose by 21 percent
in 2006/07 fiscal year, with large spending increases across all categories (Table 2). In
addition, the budget made a large one-time payment (KD 2 billions) to the public pension
system (KPISS) to reduce its actuarial deficit. The non-oil deficit (excluding income from

9
oil and investments and recapitalization transfers to KPISS) rose to 50 percent of non-oil
GDP in 2006/07. It is projected to reach 58 percent in 2007/08, driven by continued
growth in wages and capital outlays, most recently an increase in cost of living
allowances for civil servants (½ percent of GDP on an annual basis). Even so, the surge
in oil revenue during 2007 and early 2008 is expected to result in an increase of the
overall budget surplus to 39 percent of GDP for 2007/08.
4.
Structural reforms to promote a dynamic open economy driven by the private
sector gained some momentum.
¾ The National Assembly approved three economic laws that had been stalled for years:
•

Reducing the profit tax on foreign investors from 55 percent to 15 percent and
exempting capital gains from stock investment from tax. The new legislation
removes an important obstacle for the flow of foreign investment into the country.

•

Sale of state properties law. The law sets guidelines for the government to provide
state land to local or foreign investors. It also provides a legal basis for projects
involving public-private partnerships (PPPs).

•

A bill authorizing the privatization of Kuwait Airways. This would be the first
major privatization in Kuwait.

¾ The government granted licenses to three private airlines and four new private
universities, and privatized a number of gas stations.
¾ For the first time, budget preparation (including the wage bill and the capital budget) has
been consolidated in the ministry of finance, thereby strengthening further the fiscal
framework.
¾ The GCC common market agreement went into effect as of the beginning of 2008. This
along with other steps is likely to strengthen further Kuwait’s integration in the world
economy (see Box 1).
¾ Progress is being made in
implementing the 2003 FSAP
mission recommendations; all
those pertaining to the central
bank have been implemented,
except for the removal of the
ceiling on lending rates which
would require parliamentary
approval.

Box 1. Integration into the Global and Regional Economies
Kuwait’s integration into the global
economy has been increasing in recent
years. In particular, portfolio investment
jumped sharply since 2004–05; the number
of expatriate workers in the labor force rose
from nearly 1 million in 2000 to 1.7 million
in 2007; and trade has been growing steadily
as a share of GDP.

of the WTO since 1995, Kuwait also
participates in various preferential trade arrangements, including the GCC customs union and the Greater
Arab Free Trade Area.
The GCC common market agreement was launched in January 2008. While a common external tariff
(5 percent) is already in place, ensuring the uniform treatment of GCC nationals across member countries
(e.g. residency; private and public sector employment) will require further actions.
The GCC common market is viewed as a precondition to monetary union, planned for 2010. Kuwait
has met all convergence criteria as of end-2007. A number of challenges remain toward achieving the
monetary union, notably, the creation of a common central bank. Monetary policy frameworks, payment
and settlement systems, regulatory and supervisory structures, and other central bank functions are also
yet to be fully harmonized.
Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). Following the bilateral FTAs signed by Bahrain and Oman with the
U.S., the GCC took the decision to delegate all bilateral FTA negotiations to the GCC Secretariat, except
those with the U.S. There are ongoing FTA negotiations between the GCC and MERCOSUR, Australia,
China, India, Iran, Japan, Singapore, and Turkey. Negotiations with the European Union (EU) are at an
advanced stage; the planned agreement would also cover legal issues, human rights, and political
dialogue.

Kuwait has continued a strong tradition of providing financial assistance to
poorer countries, and the authorities are considering ways to extend HIPC debt relief to
claims held by KIA, compatible with the rules and laws governing its operations.
III. MEDIUM-TERM POLICIES AND OUTLOOK
6.
The medium-term outlook remains highly favorable. The projected moderate
growth in the oil sector will hinge upon the development of new oil and gas fields. Non-oil
GDP is projected to grow at 8 percent—as Kuwait develops its potential as a regional service
center and a gateway to Iraq and Iran—spurred by high oil prices, infrastructure spending,
and structural reforms to support private investment. Inflation is projected to increase further
in 2008 due largely to supply factors before moderating to about 5 percent over the medium
term.
7.
Both the external current account and fiscal positions are projected to remain in
large surplus, albeit at declining levels due to the high import intensity of the planned
investment projects and the projected easing in oil prices. While the authorities generally
agreed with staff’s projections, they noted several downside risks: a possible sharp decline in
oil prices; intensified domestic pressures for increasing budgetary transfers; setbacks in the
implementation of structural reforms, including due to parliamentary opposition; and
shortfalls in the execution of planned public investments.

IV. REPORT ON DISCUSSIONS
A. Oil Sector Prospects
8.
The authorities reaffirmed that Kuwait would continue to play a constructive
role in the oil market by implementing major investment plans for the sector. The
authorities plan to increase oil production capacity from the current level of 2.7 million barrel

technical service agreements. In
the downstream sector, the authorities plan to double refining capacity to about 1.4 mbpd by
2012–13. Total sectoral investments for 2008–13 would amount to $50 billion, to be largely
financed internally by Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC), with strong involvement of the
Kuwaiti and foreign private sector in the downstream sector. Most projects are currently in
the execution or bid submission stage.

B. Containing Inflationary Pressures
9.
Growth of the nontradables sector, an appropriate fiscal policy framework, and
lower credit growth will be critical for containing inflation. Rising oil wealth has
boosted demand, including for nontradable items and expatriate labor, pushing up prices for
housing, communication, and other services as well as asset prices (notably real estate).
Structural reforms to enhance the supply response in the services sector (including better
access to land) will be key to reduce pressures on nontradable prices. Fiscal policy should
balance the need to spend part of the oil wealth to support consumption and investment,
while avoiding fuelling inflation. Excessive increases in salaries and transfers would add to
demand pressures and increase the risk of a wage-price spiral. Containing credit growth will
also be necessary to restrain demand pressures.
C. Fiscal Policy Strategy
10.
The authorities are working on building a stronger consensus within parliament
around their fiscal strategy of emphasizing higher capital spending to support growth,
limiting current expenditure, and saving part of the oil revenues for future generations
and to reduce dependency on oil income for funding the budget. Accumulation of
financial assets along with investments in infrastructure, education and public services that
help create jobs for Kuwaitis in the private sector are likely to be the most effective way to
ensure current and future generations benefit from the gains in oil wealth. In the face of
strong populist pressures for “sharing the oil wealth”, the authorities will try to contain raises
in salaries and benefits in the public sector—in particular if not closely tied to performance

13
and merit—to contain recurrent expenditures and to avoid weakening the incentives to
acquire marketable skills needed for employment in the private sector. Similarly, they are
aware that further raising already high subsidies will add to price distortions and the
misallocation of resources, notably in the power sector.3 Excessive increases in current
outlays would also limit the resources that could be saved to insure intergenerational equity
and reduce dependency in oil income.
11.
The authorities were skeptical regarding staff suggestions that greater
transparency of KIA and KPISS financial operations could help in strengthening the
consensus for their fiscal strategy, or help to forestall steps towards financial protectionism in
countries where the growing role of sovereign wealth funds has raised concerns. They
stressed that KIA’s financial position was already subject to parliamentary scrutiny, ensuring
accountability.4 Furthermore, KIA’s investment policy is purely commercially driven and
respects regulations in the financial markets it invests in. The authorities hope that the Fund
would play a constructive role in ensuring a positive dialogue between sovereign wealth
funds and recipient countries, although they were not yet convinced of the need for a code of
“best practices.”
12.
The authorities pointed out that many elements of a strong fiscal policy
framework were already in place, but recognized further reforms are needed. There are
clear rules governing transfers to the two government investment funds (RFFG and GRF).
The recent consolidation of budget preparation in the ministry of finance constitutes a
further strengthening of the fiscal framework. The authorities plan sizable transfers from the
budget to close the remaining KPISS actuarial deficit over the next two years and are
considering reforming the contribution and benefits rules to ensure viability of the system.
Furthermore, the authorities believe that further progress should be made towards improved
budget accounting and monitoring, including the adoption of GFSM 2001; and a better
anchoring of one-year budgets in rolling medium-term fiscal frameworks.
D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy and Financial Sector Developments
13.
The authorities see considerable merit in continuing a pegged exchange rate
regime. Underpinned by open trade, capital and labor regimes, it has contributed to decades
of macroeconomic stability. The authorities expect it to weather the current tension arising
from the non-synchronization between the U.S. and Kuwait business cycles, which has led
to the easing of monetary policy in the U.S., while Kuwait is facing an economic boom and

highly inequitable as it could create serious moral hazard in the future.

14
inflationary pressures. The recent move to an undisclosed basket peg should help create
some room for maneuver vis-à-vis U.S. monetary policy and better align the peg with
Kuwait’s trading and investment pattern. Within this constraint, the CBK plans to rely
mainly on prudential measures to keep credit expansion under control. The authorities
remain committed to join the planned GCC monetary union, but are aware of the urgency to
develop very soon with their partners a common framework for exchange rate and monetary
policy, and establish the necessary institutions to support this framework, if the target date
of 2010 is to be met.
14.
While the banking system is sound, the authorities remain vigilant about
investment companies. The banking sector is well capitalized and highly profitable
(Table 6). The recent global financial turmoil appears not to have affected the financial
system. Given the rapid increase in credit and the direct and indirect exposure of Kuwait’s
banking sector to domestic and international stock and real estate markets, the CBK is
monitoring banks closely, including through regular stress testing. The authorities recognize
that the number, size and activities of investment companies have grown significantly over
the last few years, making that sector systemically important (see Box 2). The authorities
are comfortable with the overall current regulatory framework, which covers disclosure,
credit concentration and provisioning, anti-money laundering, and consumer/installment
loans limits. Moreover, the CBK is carefully watching individual banks’ exposures to
investment companies. In the CBK’s view, most investors in investment companies are high
net worth individuals, who should be left to assume risks independently, and there will be
no government bail-outs of any investment company.
E. Domestic and External Stability
15.
In the authorities’ view, the current and planned policy mix will lead to
domestic and external stability over the medium term. While there is no generally
accepted methodology to assess the level of the exchange rate for oil exporters, it seems
reasonable to assume that the large positive terms-of-trade (TOT) shock during 2003–07
appreciated the equilibrium real effective exchange rate (ERER). This is consistent with
staff estimates using CGER-type equilibrium exchange rate and macroeconomic balance
approaches (see Box 3). Either approach suggests that a moderate undervaluation was
caused by the oil price shock, but has been absorbed already or will disappear in the near
future. The authorities view both assessment methodologies as ill-suited for oil economies
and argued that an appropriate assessment should emphasize the need for ensuring
intergenerational equity and reducing dependence on oil revenues. Such an assessment
would, in their view, call for high public investments to build physical and human capital as
well as continued large fiscal and current account surpluses, possibly larger than currently
planned. Finally, the authorities also argued that current account balances were determined
mostly by fiscal policy with little role for the exchange rate. Reducing the current account
surplus would involve either greater fiscal expansion at the risk of creating higher inflation,

15
or reducing oil production, which would undoubtedly affect world oil prices. Furthermore,
since Kuwait produces virtually no other tradables but oil, its real exchange rate had in
particular little impact on other countries’ economies.
Box 2. Investment Companies—Growing by Leaps and Bounds
High oil revenues, financial liberalization and changing investment patterns have spurred the rapid
growth of Kuwait’s asset management industry.1

Regulation and supervision are divided among the CBK, KSE and Ministry of Commerce. The central
bank’s regulatory and supervisory focus aims at facilitating market discipline through dissemination of
information in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Lending activities are largely
subject to the same prudential rules as bank lending.

Staff estimates using the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach suggest that the KD is
currently moderately undervalued. Staff found strong evidence of a long-run cointegration
relationship between the KD REER and certain key fundamentals. Specifically, an improvement in the
TOT by 10 percent appreciates the ERER by 2 percent; an increase in investment income by
1 percentage point of GDP appreciates the ERER by 0.12 percent; and an increase in government
expenditure by 1 percentage point of GDP depreciates the ERER by 0.3 percent. From 2003, when the
actual REER was broadly in line with the estimated equilibrium rate, Kuwait’s ERER has been on a
rising trend driven by a significant improvement in the TOT and investment income and a small decline
in government expenditure. The actual REER

2000=100
started to appreciate since 2004, with a gap to the 120
smoothed ERER of 11 percent in 2007. This gap 110
is projected to vanish by 2009 given the
100
projected inflation-driven appreciation of the

further improvement in the TOT. Changing the
time period underlying the estimation, or
50
replacing the terms of trade with real oil prices or
the net oil balance, does not alter the thrust of
these findings.
The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach indicates that the current account (CA) is close to its
“norm.” Similar to one of the CGER-approaches, a panel-estimate using data for the GCC countries
finds a significant relationship between CA

and per capita income). Specifically, a higher

to gauge external stability. After “overshooting”

case in the medium term under the authorities’
investment program.

F. Structural and Statistical Issues
16.
Acceleration of structural reforms in other key areas would be vital to support
private sector-led investment and employment generation. While Kuwait ranks relatively
high in global assessments of business conditions, procedures for starting a new business are
perceived as cumbersome. The authorities are working with parliament on several reforms
including:

17
•

Broadening incentives for involving foreign technical know-how in the development
of Kuwait’s northern oil fields.

•

Providing a comprehensive legal framework to expand the role of the private sector
through enacting companies, competition, public-private partnership and privatization
laws.

•

Approving the Capital Market Law to unify and enhance the regulatory and
supervisory framework for the market.

•

Enabling further access to land for private business and individuals.

17.
Efforts to improve macroeconomic statistics need to continue. While the provision
of economic data is adequate for surveillance and has continued to improve, the lack of
timely availability of some key data remains an obstacle to economic analysis. In particular,
the authorities concur that the recent delay in the production of the CPI needs to be urgently
addressed, especially given the importance of current inflationary developments for
economic policy. The authorities expressed their intention to continue to improve statistics
more generally.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
18.
Kuwait’s economy had yet another strong performance in 2007, with prudent
macroeconomic management supporting high growth in the non-oil economy.
Maintaining this performance over the medium term and creating jobs for Kuwaitis in the
private sector would require further structural reforms that promote a dynamic private sector
driven economy, with public spending focused primarily on infrastructure and education. In
the short-run, the main challenge will be to contain inflation, although temporarily higher
inflation may be an inevitable part of fiscal spending to increase absorptive capacity.
19.
Kuwait continues to play a constructive role in the global oil market, and
implementation of its ambitious plan to expand production and refining capacity will
sustain Kuwait’s favorable economic outlook and support global oil market stability.
Enhancing the scope for involving foreign technical know-how in the development of
Kuwait’s northern oil fields will be critical to achieve the plan’s production targets and
maximize the recovery rate from the new northern fields and currently producing fields.
20.
Reducing inflationary pressures requires enhancing the supply response in the
nontradable sector, a strong fiscal policy framework, and containing credit growth.
While the move to an undisclosed basket peg might help to contain imported inflation,
enhancing the supply of nontradables, especially housing and land, will be more important in
controlling inflationary pressures. Fiscal expenditure will have to strike a delicate balance
between addressing supply bottlenecks (especially in infrastructure and education) while

18
avoiding excessive demand pressures. Containing the strong growth in credit to the private
sector would help to restrain demand pressures, but the use of interest rates in this regard
would involve a trade-off with the need to contain speculative inflows and is in any case
constrained by the basket peg.
21.
The government’s fiscal strategy is key for sustaining high job-creating growth
and reducing dependence on oil income over the long run, while preserving domestic
and external stability. Staff urges the authorities to resist populist pressures to push up
current expenditures by raises in salaries and benefits that are not closely tied to performance
and merit. Rather than expanding an inefficient subsidies system, subsidies should be better
targeted. The main element of the fiscal strategy should be centered around higher
investments in infrastructure, better education and public services, and accumulating
additional resources to insure intergenerational equity and reduce dependence on oil. Greater
transparency regarding the balance sheets, income, as well as contingent liabilities of KIA
and KPISS, should support the fiscal strategy.
22.
Staff encourages the authorities to strengthen the fiscal framework further by
(a) complementing plans to close the remaining KPISS actuarial deficit by reforming the
contribution and benefits rules so as to ensure viability of the system; (b) better anchoring of
one-year budgets in rolling medium-term fiscal frameworks; (c) introducing GFSM 2001
accounting; and (d) furthering the ongoing coordination with other GCC countries toward the
introduction of a value-added tax (VAT) and harmonization of tax laws.
23.
Staff considers the pegged exchange rate regime an appropriate choice given
Kuwait’s openness, structure of financial markets, and the plans for regional monetary
union. In the context of the pegged exchange regime and an easing monetary stance in the
U.S., the authorities will need to use available prudential tools and fiscal and structural
policies to help contain inflation and credit growth, and limit financial system vulnerabilities.
The large growth in the investment companies sector calls for continued vigilance and
regular stress testing for the sector. To address weaknesses in financial sector supervision and
regulation identified in the FSAP, establishment of a unified and independent capital market
regulator applying best practices will be particularly important.
24.
Staff views the current and planned policy mix as contributing to external and
domestic stability. Fiscal policy is key to ensure domestic and external stability, as the role
of the real exchange rate in determining the current account is limited. Staff analysis points to
a moderate undervaluation of the KD up to around 2006–07. However, it also suggests that
the ongoing appreciation of the KD in real effective terms, set to accelerate due to relatively
higher inflation in 2008, and the expansionary fiscal stance over the medium term, would
bring the exchange rate in line with fundamentals over the course of 2008.
25.
Staff urges the authorities to expedite structural reforms aimed at promoting the
role of the private sector. Building on recent progress, staff encourages the authorities to

19
swiftly bring capital market, companies, competition, public-private partnership and
privatization laws in line with best international practice, and to further streamline business
registration procedures and reduce administrative barriers to investment. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ intention to improve public sector statistics and encourages them to develop a
program aimed at subscribing to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination System (SDDS).
26.
Staff commends the authorities for substantial assistance extended to countries in and
outside the region, active support for the HIPC initiative, and for considering ways to extend
HIPC debt relief to claims held by KIA.
27.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Ongoing Activities—FY 2008/09

•

Vision and Long-term Development Options Planning: The Government of
Kuwait is attempting to reorganize its planning process based on determination of a
vision for Kuwait, development of a long-term strategy based on the vision, and
preparation of a five year development plan within the framework of the strategy. The
Government requested the Bank’s assistance with regard to the first two stages of the
process. The vision and long-term strategy document will be prepared based on the
extensive consultations and interviews that are currently underway in the country; the
document is planned to be submitted to the Planning Committee for review in early
February 2008.
Civil Service Council: Review of the Civil Service Remuneration and Benefits
System. In September 2007, the Government held discussions with the Bank to
explore how the Civil Service Commission (CSC) can revise the structure of salary
and benefits offered to government employees. The scope and the detailed TOR for
the review have been agreed upon, and the task implementation is underway.
Country Procurement Assessment (CPAR): The Government of Kuwait is
exploring the possibility of joining WTO; as a part of this process, the Bank was
asked to assist in the preparation of a Country Procurement Assessment Review
(CPAR) and also in drafting new and modernized public procurement law and
regulations. The Bank will analyze the current public procurement system including
its policies, organization, procedures and practices and help develop/improve the
ability to plan, manage and monitor the procurement process effectively. The task is
scheduled to be competed in FY08.
Governance and Anti-corruption Project: An agreement for this project is
currently under discussion with the Deputy Prime Minister. The scope of the project
will involve assistance in development of anti-corruption regulations, establishment
of an agency in charge of enforcement of these policies, and cooperation with the
civil society.
Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC): Support to KPC’s privatization program
continues in FY2007 and involves technical assistance on corporate governance,
labor policies, internal communication, capacity building, and assessment of the
completed privatization results as well as new opportunities for privatizing
non-essential services.
Offset Program: The offset program was established to encourage domestic private
investment, by providing venture capital and project management. Based on the
recommendations of the review of the offset program conducted by the Bank staff in

5

•

•

•

•

2005, the Government established a National Offset Company (NOC). Currently the
Bank is assisting NOC in developing its business plan.
Economic Zones Development. The World Bank is assisting the Foreign Direct
Investment Bureau and the Public Authorities for Industry in conducting assessment
of the development opportunities for several economic and industrial zones in
Kuwait. The Bank has procured consulting services for this purpose and is
supervising consultants’ work. The project is planned for completion at the end of
FY2007.
Public Authority for Industries (PAI). In addition to the feasibility study on an
industrial zone development (see above), the PAI requested the Bank’s technical
assistance on the industrial city planning; the Bank and PAI are developing the
process of utilizing the creative energy of the private sector with regard to city
planning and creating and economically successful and environmentally sound habitat
that would allow to decrease a population pressure on the capital city.
Redesigning Business Registration Processes: Following up on a previous study on
administrative barriers to investment, the World Bank was asked to streamline
business registration processes. An action plan has been developed, and now the
scope of implementation is under review.
Education Indicators and Assessment Project: Following the completion of the
“Education Expenditure Analysis” study, the Bank continues to provide assistance in
implementing the recommendations. This is a six-year program, and outcomes of the
2007–08 work plan include the publication of the annual Kuwait Education Indicators
report, capacity building in policy relevant data analysis, implementation of the
TIMSS and PIRLS, and possible preparation of an education sector review.

APPENDIX III: KUWAIT—STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 13, 2008)
Macroeconomic data are adequate for surveillance, but there is scope for improved
compilation of the national accounts and balance of payments statistics through better
coordination among statistical agencies.
National Accounts and Production
Recent improvements of national accounts include: change of the base year for the constant
price data to 2000 and the estimates of value added for subsidized goods and services of the
public utilities sector through the use of input costs (the household expenditure survey was
used previously). Starting from the final 2002 data, further improvements are planned for
national accounts reflecting the adoption of the 1993 SNA, a sampling frame based on the
establishment survey (2002), and the expansion of the coverage of questionnaires. Continued
progress, especially in the estimation of value added for the oil sector, requires the dedication
of adequate resources and improved coordination between the Ministries of Planning, Oil,
and Finance. STA has provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Planning to improve
national accounts and price data. It would be useful if the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK)
would publish oil sector information in the Quarterly Statistical Bulletin pertaining to output,
refining, domestic consumption, export price for crude and refined products and the domestic
price of petroleum products. These data are available from the Ministry of Oil.
Price Statistics
CPI weights are based on the 1999-2000 household expenditure survey and were introduced
into the index for a reference year of 2002. An improved monthly CPI based on a revised
basket has been published in monthly CPI bulletins with about one-month lag. The wholesale
price index (WPI) needs to be developed into a producer price index (PPI) which is
consistent with the national accounts and includes all domestically produced goods, exfactory, for the export and the domestic market. Timely and comprehensive labor force data
are not available.
Government Finance Statistics
Annual GFS data are reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(GFSY). The major components of its extrabudgetary revenues (investment income and
transfers of profits of public institutions), extrabudgetary expenditures (interest on foreign
debt and treasury paper), and financing operations conducted by two reserve funds are not
reported. Data on investment income, and on interest on foreign debt and treasury paper,
however, are usually provided to Article IV consultation missions. The authorities have made
some progress in fiscal data presentation, but the lack of a suitable classification of data on
the execution of the budget remains a constraint on monitoring effectively fiscal
developments during the year. Moreover, data on the operations of the Public Institute for
Social Security are not made available. Sharing of information between various government
agencies could be improved. STA has indicated to the authorities that operations of the two
reserve funds should be classified as part of government, as they perform activities for public

7
policy purposes (management of debt and assets, and financing of the budget). To this end,
reporting subannual GFS in the form of the Statement of Sources and Uses of Cash for the
consolidated central government could be encouraged. The authorities have also been
briefed on the IMF’s ongoing work to enhance the transparency of fiscal accounts and
presentations detailed in the “Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency” and were
encouraged to adopt some of the practices recommended in the Code. The Public
Expenditure Management (PEM) system could usefully be strengthened.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
The CBK reports monetary data to STA on a regular and timely basis. Monetary and
financial statistics based on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) have been finalized and
will be published in the April 2008 issue of the International Financial Statistics Supplement.
CBK needs to work further to distinguish a number of investment companies that accept
deposits from other investment companies that do not accept deposits. Investment companies
that accept deposits should appropriately be classified as part of the depository corporations
sector. In the current SRFs, all investment companies (including those that accept deposits)
are classified as other financial corporations. However, the amount of deposits accepted by
investment companies are considered as not significant. CBK staff attended a workshop on
harmonizing monetary and financial statistics in the GCC region that was conducted by STA
staff in Riyadh in July 2006
Balance of Payments Statistics
The CBK compiles and disseminates detailed annual data in accordance with the
methodology of the BPM5—quarterly data are provided to Article IV consultation missions.
However, data on capital flows of the nonfinancial private sector are limited, which has
likely contributed to the “errors and omissions” item. To improve coverage for inward
foreign direct investment, the CBK is making efforts to obtain more data by surveying direct
investment enterprises identified by the Ministry of Finance. Enhancements have been made
in the estimation of travel services and communication services, but further improvements
are needed in compilation practices and in the estimation of data on several service items and
private transfers.
A major step forward in 2007 was the dissemination of IIP data for 2001-2006 in STA
publications. However, IIP data exclude the external assets held by the general government
due to legal constraints on dissemination (however, loans granted by the Kuwaiti Fund for
Arab Economic Development and general government trade credits are included).
The CBK also participated in 2007 in the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS)
with data reported for 2003-2006. These data are for the financial sector acting as
end-investors or as intermediaries on behalf of residents and do not include holdings of
foreign securities held by government agencies, which comprise the bulk of Kuwait’s
cross-border holdings.

8
Data dissemination
Kuwait is one of the first GDDS participants. However, most of its metadata, with the
exception of the real sector and socio-demographic metadata, have not been updated since
October 2002. The CBK maintains its own webpage where it provides the following data to
the public: money and banking statistics; balance of payments statistics; trade balance
statistics; exchange rate; GDP by sector and expenditure at current and constant prices;
public finance statistics; CPI and WPI; and security market indicators. Similarly, the Ministry
of Planning has a webpage where the CSO publishes data on national accounts, prices, and
other related statistics. The Ministry of Finance webpage includes detailed data for actual and
estimated budget operations. In addition, the Kuwait Stock Exchange webpage provides data
on stock market indices, volume and value of securities traded, as well as privatization
schedules and other related information.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representatives
April 18, 2008
1.
This statement summarizes information that has become available since the staff
report on Kuwait was circulated to the Executive Board on April 3, 2008. The new
information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Kuwait’s Government resigned on March 17, partly reflecting difficulties in reaching
consensus with parliament on public expenditures. Subsequently, Emir Sheikh Sabah
Al-Ahmad dissolved the parliament and set new elections for May 17, 2008. The previous
government remains in office as caretaker.
3.
The state budget for 2008/09 that had been approved by the Council of Ministers and
submitted to parliament in January 2008 has already taken effect. It will be formally issued
by Amiri decree to become law. The parliament elected in May will have the right to review
all decrees issued in the absence of parliament and may approve them with or without
amendment.
4.
Inflationary pressures continued. Inflation declined somewhat to 6.7 percent (y/y) in
November, but subsequently rose to 7.5 percent (y/y) in December 2007. In addition to the
global increase in commodity and food prices, inflation was fuelled by a 12.6 percent
increase in rents. As of end-March 2008, the Kuwaiti Dinar/U.S. dollar exchange rate had
appreciated by 8.2 percent since the move to a basket peg in May 2007. In January 2008, the
Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) cut the REPO rate by 50 basis points to 3.5 percent and the
discount rate from 6.25 to 5.75 percent.
5.
On March 24, 2008, the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) took several measures, with a
view to contain consumer credit growth, in part by making bank lending less attractive.
These measures include: (a) reducing the maximum monthly installment than can be charged
under consumer and installment loans from 50 to 40 percent of clients’ net salary or monthly
income, and to 30 percent for pensioners; (b) reducing the maximum interest rate on such
loans from 4 to 3 percent above the discount rate; (c) fixing the interest rate on this type of
loans for five years instead of allowing it to change with changes in the discount rate; and
(d) prohibiting banks from charging interest on this type of loans upfront. The CBK has also
intensified efforts through moral suasion to ensure bank lending remains prudent.
6.
Kuwait’s stock market index gained 14 percent during the first quarter of 2008,
following its 24 percent gain in 2007.
7.
Recent data indicate that imports in 2007 were higher by $3 billion than estimated in
the staff report; exports were broadly in line with estimates.
8.
The Kuwait planning council has recently released an ambitious five-year plan
(2009–14) that envisages significant reforms to boost the non-oil economy and attract more

2
foreign investment to improve Kuwait’s competitiveness as a financial hub in the region.
The plan proposes speeding up of privatization, including reducing the government share in
land ownership from the present 90 percent. At the same time, the plan calls for large
investments in infrastructure. Rationalization of the welfare system is also envisaged.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 12, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Kuwait
On April 18, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Kuwait. 1
Background
Kuwait’s macroeconomic performance has been strong in 2007 with prudent
macroeconomic management supporting high growth especially in the non-oil economy.
The large increase in oil revenue generated substantial fiscal and external current
account surpluses, enabling the country to build up its foreign assets. Structural reforms
continued, aimed at promoting a dynamic private sector driven economy and enhance
incentives for bringing in foreign know-how. Inflation has been gradually picking up,
reaching 7.3 percent year-on-year in October 2007, driven both by domestic demand
pressures (especially rents) and higher import prices (mostly food).
Real GDP growth in 2007 is estimated at 4.6 percent. Kuwait’s oil production has
declined by 2.6 percent in 2007, in line with the OPEC decisions, while non-oil activity—
particularly in financial, transportation, and communication services—grew by almost
9 percent per annum, benefiting from a surge in investment and expansionary
macroeconomic policies.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive
Board as expressed during the April 2008 Executive Board discussion based on the staff
report.

2
The fiscal surplus is estimated to have increased to 40 percent of GDP in FY2007/08
(ended March 31), but is projected to narrow in FY2008/09 due to a large transfer to the
Kuwait Public Institution for Social Security (KPISS) to strengthen the financial position
of the public pension system, and large increases in public wages, transfers and
subsidies, and capital expenditure.
Kuwait abandoned the peg to the U.S. dollar in May 2007, and has since pegged the
Kuwaiti dinar (KD) to an undisclosed basket of currencies in order to dampen imported
inflation related to rising world food prices and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar. The
real effective exchange rate (REER) of the Kuwaiti dinar appreciated by about 2 percent
in 2007, largely due to a 6 percent appreciation against the U.S. dollar and relatively
higher inflation.
Broad money and credit to the private sector expanded rapidly in 2007. Within the
constraints of the peg, the central bank of Kuwait sought to contain the expansion of
monetary aggregates by tightening the loan-to-deposit ceiling, and to dampen capital
inflows by driving down the KD interbank rate (KIBOR) below LIBOR. After a moderate
correction in 2006 (12 percent), the Kuwait stock exchange (KSE) recovered strongly in
2007 with the KSE index gaining 25 percent; it fell again in early 2008 as global
turbulences intensified.
Structural reforms to promote a dynamic private sector driven open economy gained
momentum. The profit tax on foreign investors has been reduced from 55 percent to
15 percent and capital gains from stock investment have become exempt from tax,
removing an important obstacle for the flow of foreign investment into the country. The
national assembly also approved the Sale of State Properties Law. The law sets
guidelines for the government to provide state land to local or foreign investors, and
provides a legal basis for projects based on public-private partnerships. Parliament also
approved a bill authorizing the privatization of Kuwait Airways, the first major
privatization in Kuwait. The government granted licenses to three private airlines and
four new private universities, and privatized a number of gas stations. Budget
preparation (including the wage bill and the capital budget) has been consolidated in the
ministry of finance, strengthening further the fiscal framework.
Kuwait’s macroeconomic vulnerabilities remain low. As a large international creditor,
Kuwait is not vulnerable to capital flow reversals, and could maintain macro-stability
even if faced with a sizable drop in oil prices. To date Kuwait’s financial system has
weathered the recent turbulences in global financial markets rather well. Kuwait banking
system is sound and available financial soundness indicators through September 2007
point to strong capitalization, asset quality, and profitability.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Kuwaiti authorities’ prudent macroeconomic
policies and structural reform efforts which, in combination with higher oil prices, have
contributed to strong growth, especially in the labor-intensive non-oil sector. Directors

3
agreed that dealing with inflation pressures will be a priority for the near term. Vigorous
implementation of the government’s reform plans should help support the favorable
medium-term growth prospects for both the oil and non-oil sectors.
Directors commended the Kuwaiti authorities’ intention to continue to play a constructive
role in the global oil market. They welcomed plans to increase oil production and
refinery capacity, which would help support global oil market stability.
Directors highlighted Kuwait’s strong fiscal position, which enhances the economy’s
resilience against shocks. Going forward, they agreed that fiscal policies must strike a
delicate balance between moderating demand pressures, addressing domestic supply
bottlenecks, and building up financial assets for future generations and to reduce
dependence on volatile oil revenue. The wage bill and subsidies should be contained
through merit-based wage increases and better-targeted social spending. Directors
welcomed plans to close the actuarial deficit of the Pension Fund and recommended to
build on recent improvements in budget planning and execution by adopting a mediumterm budget preparation framework.
Directors welcomed the stabilizing role being played by the Kuwait Investment Authority
(KIA), both domestically and in global financial markets. Some Directors saw scope for
greater transparency regarding the KIA’s financial position. They also encouraged the
authorities to participate in the initiative to formulate a set of best practices for sovereign
wealth funds. A few other Directors, however, shared the authorities’ reservations
regarding participation in the development of such best practices.
Most Directors agreed that the pegged exchange rate regime remains appropriate for
Kuwait, and that the recent move to a basket peg may have been helpful in containing
imported inflation. However, the peg limits the active use of interest rate policy, and
some Directors suggested that there may be a case for reviewing the nature of the
exchange rate arrangement. Directors considered that, to counter rising domestic
inflationary pressures, the supply response in the nontradables sector—in particular in
housing and land—will need to be enhanced, in the context of maintaining fiscal policy
prudence. Containing domestic credit growth through continued supervisory vigilance
will also be needed.
Regarding the real exchange rate of the Kuwaiti dinar, most Directors concurred that,
while the surge in oil prices in recent years may have contributed to some
undervaluation, the recent moderate currency appreciation and rising inflation are
moving the real exchange rate closer to its equilibrium level. At the same time, Directors
recognized the methodological difficulties surrounding the assessment of exchange rate
equilibrium for oil exporting countries, and looked forward to further work on these
issues.
Directors welcomed Kuwait’s commitment to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) monetary
union, but noted that its implementation by 2010 will require speeding up the building of
an appropriate institutional framework. In line with the GCC common market agreement,
they encouraged the authorities to work toward removing remaining obstacles to the
flow of labor and capital among GCC countries. Several Directors looked forward to the

4
forthcoming staff paper on the options for the exchange rate arrangement under the
planned monetary union.
Directors noted the sound position of the banking sector, while cautioning that the rapid
growth of financial investment companies calls for continued vigilance. They
encouraged the authorities to complete the implementation of outstanding Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations, including establishing a unified
and independent capital market regulatory authority applying best international
practices, and to continue and broaden regular stress testing of the overall financial
sector.
Directors stressed that further structural reforms will be critical to sustain growth over the
medium term, and welcomed in this context the authorities’ ongoing efforts to promote
private sector growth and improve the investment climate. Focusing public expenditure
primarily on infrastructure and education, rather than on subsidies and transfers, would
help develop human capital and create private sector employment opportunities for
Kuwaiti nationals. The establishment of a strong capital market regulator, along with
legal reforms to encourage competition and facilitate doing business, will help promote
the private sector as the main engine of growth and employment.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to improve economic statistics, and
encouraged them to adopt a program aimed at subscribing to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
Directors commended the authorities for their substantial development assistance and
their active support for the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. They
encouraged the authorities to extend HIPC debt relief to claims held by the Kuwait
Investment Authority.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.

Statement by A. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Kuwait
April 18, 2008
1.
On behalf of the Kuwaiti authorities, I thank staff for their continued engagement
with Kuwait and a helpful and constructive Article IV consultation report. The Kuwaiti
authorities attach particular importance to the views of the Executive Board, Management,
and the staff regarding the economic policies and prospects of Kuwait.
Recent Developments
2.
Underpinned by sustained prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, a
pick-up in investment, as well as higher oil prices, Kuwait’s macroeconomic performance
strengthened further in 2007. This is reflected in buoyant growth in the non-oil economy,
increasing private sector employment for Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti nationals, and substantial
fiscal and external current account surpluses. Price pressures has however picked up
somewhat, driven by domestic demand pressures and higher import prices, notably food.
This appears to be a general worldwide phenomenon.
3.
These developments were accompanied by a continuation of fiscal reforms and
measures aimed at enhancing the environment for private sector activity. A schedule to close
the actuarial deficit of the Kuwait Public Institute for Social Security (KPISS) by 2009 was
announced. The fiscal framework was further strengthened by consolidating the budget
preparation process in the Ministry of Finance. Moreover, measures to facilitate the flow of
foreign investment into the country, including reducing taxes on foreign investors, were
introduced. The national assembly approved the Sale of State Properties Law, enabling the
government to provide state land to local or foreign investors, and providing a legal basis for
projects based on public-private partnerships. It also expanded the privatization program.
These efforts to further diversify the economy, together with increased spending on
infrastructure, education and public services, as well as plans to expand oil production and
refining capacity, bode well for sustainable high growth over the medium term.
4.
Kuwait is fully aware of its responsibilities as a major oil producer, and remains
committed to supporting global oil market stability. To this end, it has launched an ambitious
$50 billion investment program to expand both its upstream and downstream production
capacity. The plan aims at raising production capacity to 4 million barrels per day (mbpd)
by 2020 and doubling refining capacity to about 1.4 mbpd by 2012–13. It would be
essentially financed by the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation’s own resources, with strong
private participation in the downstream sector.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
5.
Higher oil revenues have contributed to a significant improvement in the fiscal
position last year, with the overall fiscal surplus estimated at about 40 percent of GDP in
FY2007/08, despite a substantial increase in capital spending. In spite of increasing pressure
on the budget engendered by the favorable fiscal position, the authorities remain committed
to fiscal prudence. In addition to containing recurrent spending by limiting increases in

2
public sector salaries and benefits, the authorities are cognizant that further increases in
subsidies will add to price distortions and the misallocation of resources.
6.
The focus on enhancing the structure of public finances will be maintained. To this
end, the authorities plan sizable transfers from the budget to close the remaining KPISS
actuarial deficit over the next two years and are considering reforming the contribution and
benefits rules to ensure the viability of the system. In addition to progress achieved in the
consolidation of the budgetary process, future reforms include better anchoring of one-year
budgets in rolling medium-term fiscal frameworks and introducing GFSM 2001 accounting.
Efforts are also ongoing to coordinate with other GCC members the introduction of a valueadded tax and the harmonization of tax laws.
7.
The authorities however remain unconvinced that greater transparency in the financial
operations of the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) and KPISS would support their fiscal
strategy or help avert protectionist measures in countries where the growing role of sovereign
wealth funds (SWFs) has raised concerns. They wish to emphasize that KIA currently
manages two highly efficient saving funds. Adequate safeguard arrangements are in place
with regard to the management of these resources, which are overseen by the KIA Board of
Directors, internal and external auditors and the Public Audit Office. Moreover, rigorous
biannual parliament oversight ensures proper accountability. Furthermore, although legal
constraints prohibit the publication of KIA’s balance sheet and income statements, the data is
widely reported in the media as noted by staff.
8.
The authorities share staff’s assessment in the April 2008 Global Financial Stability
Report regarding the stabilizing role of SWFs in global financial markets, particularly in
strengthening bank balance sheets through sizable injections of capital. They wish to
emphasize that KIA’s investment policy is purely commercially driven and respects
regulations in the financial markets it invests in. While the authorities hope that the Fund
would play a constructive role in ensuring a positive dialogue between SWFs and recipient
countries, they remain to be convinced of the need for a code of “best practices.” In the
authorities’ view, this would risk disrupting the flow of sizeable long-term capital from
SWFs to institutions in the U.S. and elsewhere that face both liquidity and capital needs.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
9.
In the context of the pegged exchange regime, and against the background of demand
and import-driven inflationary pressures, the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) aimed at
dampening capital inflows by reducing the Kuwaiti dinar interbank rate below LIBOR, while
relying on prudential measures to contain the expansion of private credit. In the period ahead,
the authorities recognize the importance of pursuing efforts to enhance the supply response in
the nontradable sector, further strengthening the fiscal policy framework, and containing
credit growth, to reduce inflationary pressures.
10.
The authorities share staff’s assessment regarding the adequacy of the pegged
exchange rate regime, given Kuwait’s openness, structure of financial markets, and the plans
for regional monetary union. The recent move to a basket peg should, in their view, create
some room for maneuver in relation to U.S. monetary policy, in view of the differences in the

3
two countries’ cyclical positions, while better aligning the peg with Kuwait’s trading and
investment patterns. The authorities reiterate their intention to join the planned GCC
monetary union by 2010.
External Developments and Policies
11.
The authorities consider that the current and planned policy mix will lead to domestic
and external stability over the medium term. Indeed, while substantial external account
surpluses have been recorded over the past years due to higher oil prices, surpluses are
expected to decline over the medium term as domestic demand and imports rise further. It
should also be stressed that surpluses in oil-exporting countries are different in nature from
those of other countries as they are a result of exports of non-renewable resources to meet
global demand. It is therefore critical to use these surpluses effectively to (i) raise the growth
potential of the economy through high levels of public investments in infrastructure and
social areas; and (ii) accumulate savings through large fiscal and current account surpluses to
help ensure intergenerational equity, reduce dependence on oil revenues, and smooth out
fluctuations in revenue in the coming years. All these factors should be reflected in
equilibrium exchange rate calculations, which currently present serious methodological
weaknesses. These are further compounded in the case of oil-exporting countries by the high
degree of volatility in oil prices. Moreover, the standard notion of currency undervaluation
should not apply since Kuwait is not gaining market share at the expense of other countries.
Finally, current account balances are determined mostly by fiscal policy with little role for
the exchange rate. Accordingly, reducing Kuwait’s current account surplus would involve
either greater fiscal expansion at the risk of creating higher inflation, or reduced oil
production, which is not a desirable solution for both oil producers and consumers.
Financial Sector Issues
12.
Benefiting from the rapid expansion in the economy, Kuwait’s banking sector
continues to enjoy comfortable levels of profits and capitalization. It remains well supervised
and appears to be weathering the current financial turmoil well. Good progress has been
made in implementing the 2003 FSAP recommendations, as all measures pertaining to the
central bank have been implemented, except for the removal of the ceiling on lending rates
which would require parliamentary approval. Further refinement in the periodic stress-testing
of banks attests to the commitment to strengthen the banking sector’s resilience to the rapid
increase in credit and the direct and indirect exposure to domestic and international stock and
real estate markets. The authorities appreciate the focus in Box 2 on investment companies
whose number, size, and activities have significantly grown over the last few years, making
that sector systemically important. While the CBK is comfortable with the overall current
regulatory framework, which covers disclosure, credit concentration and provisioning, antimoney laundering, and consumer/installment loans limits, it will continue to carefully watch
individual banks’ exposures to investment companies.
Statistical and Other Issues

Notwithstanding progress achieved in improving the quality and dissemination of
economic data, the Kuwaiti authorities remain strongly committed to further improvements.

They fully recognize the need to improve the production of the CPI, especially given the
importance of current inflationary developments for economic policy.

Kuwait continues to provide substantial assistance to developing countries. Its
development assistance, estimated at about 2 percent of GDP on average over the
past 20 years, significantly exceeds the U.N. target. Kuwait is a strong supporter of the HIPC
Initiative and is currently considering ways to extend HIPC debt relief to claims held by KIA.
