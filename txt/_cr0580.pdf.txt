-3EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Macroeconomic performance over the past decade has been strong and steady, owing much to
structural reforms and improvements in policies and policy frameworks. Over the past year,
growth moderated, reflecting in part the tightening of monetary policy, and appears to be settling
at potential. Wage growth stabilized and inflation remained subdued. The fiscal deficit, which
deteriorated sharply between 2000 and 2003, stayed at about 3 percent of GDP. House price
appreciation slowed, but house prices are widely seen as overvalued.
Key policy issues
Outlook: Most interlocutors agreed that the economy was operating in the vicinity of full
capacity and that growth would remain at about 2½ percent. However, the Treasury saw a stillsizable output gap and expected quarterly growth to increase, supported by stronger external
demand and government spending. Views differed on the economic impact of a possible decline
in house prices. Another risk was a disorderly resolution of global imbalances. The widening
trade deficit and higher oil prices were not seen as major concerns.
Monetary policy: The BOE and staff thought that monetary policy had been appropriate over
the past several years. With the policy interest rate now in the neighborhood of the neutral rate
and given the important uncertainties to the outlook, the next move in interest rates could be up
or down. Monetary policy was well-positioned to respond to shocks. Staff welcomed the
increased emphasis on inflation projections based on market expectations of future interest rates
and the extension of the projection horizon from two to three years. Staff suggested that the BOE
publish numerical projections for a broader range of key variables.
Fiscal policy: The Treasury expected that slower spending growth and a rebound in revenues
would reverse the past fiscal deterioration and ensure that the fiscal rules were respected. While
accepting the direction of future changes in spending and revenue growth, staff were less
sanguine about the strength of structural revenues and the buoyancy of financial sector taxes
over the medium term. Therefore, staff called for an early start to smooth fiscal adjustment,
amounting to about 1 percent of GDP over the next five years. Staff also recommended further
enhancing the transparency and credibility of the fiscal projections.
Structural issues: The Interim Report of the Pensions Commission found that many people were
not saving enough for retirement. While there was agreement on some aspects of the solution to
this problem, views differed widely on the appropriate role of government in ensuring adequate
private saving. Staff welcomed the narrowing of the U.K.’s productivity gap and encouraged the
systematic evaluation of government initiatives to boost productivity. Staff urged the
implementation of recommendations to reduce house price volatility.
Financial sector stability: Indicators of banking system soundness remained favorable and the
health of the insurance sector improved over the past year. The BOE is planning to introduce a
voluntary reserve system, which will reduce volatility in overnight money markets and lower
intraday credit exposures in the payments system. The AML/CFT regime was strengthened, and
the authorities are stepping up their oversight to ensure compliance.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Macroeconomic performance in the United Kingdom during the past decade has
been strong and steady. Standing out among G7 countries, the United Kingdom has enjoyed
relatively rapid and stable per capita growth. Unemployment has fallen to one of the lowest
rates in the industrial world, while inflation has been subdued and current account deficits
moderate. This impressive record owes much to improvements in institutions and policies
during the past two decades. Structural reforms initiated during the 1980s produced relatively
flexible factor and product markets that facilitated responses to technology changes and a
shift to a more services-oriented structure of demand. During the 1990s, a series of changes

in macroeconomic policy institutions—the introduction of inflation targeting, Bank of
England independence, and, alongside a large fiscal adjustment, fiscal rules—reinforced the
benefits of the structural reforms by anchoring expectations and creating scope for a strong
countercyclical response to the growth slowdown between mid-2000 and mid-2003. At the
same time, the economy benefited from other favorable developments: rising house prices,
improving terms of trade, and prospects for less adverse demographics than in other

industrial countries. However, a 30 percent real appreciation of sterling in 1996–97
contributed to a deterioration in the trade balance.

2.
Not surprisingly, the economic cycle beginning in 1999 has seen relatively steady
growth supported by domestic demand. The slowdown of domestic demand between mid2000 and mid-2003 prompted a sizable cut in policy interest rates and fortuitously coincided
with a large increase in government spending. Full operation of fiscal stabilizers further
supported demand. With this stimulus, alongside a spurt in property prices, both consumption
and investment picked up momentum from mid-2003. Concerns about future overheating,
especially given developments in the property market, emerged in the second half of 2003,
prompting a gradual increase in the policy interest rate from 3½ percent in November 2003
to 4¾ percent in August 2004. Fiscal policy, however, has been steadily stimulative: the
public sector balance deteriorated from a surplus of 1¾ percent of GDP in FY1999/2000 to a
deficit of 3¼ percent of GDP in FY2003/04.1 This policy mix kept the value of sterling
strong, and net exports remained a drag on growth.

Growth moderated over the past year—reflecting in part the tightening of
monetary policy—and appears to be settling at trend. Real GDP growth eased by end2004 to its estimated potential rate of about 2½ percent. Household consumption growth
slowed, reflecting rising debt service (given the prevalence of variable-rate mortgages) and a
sharp diminution in house price appreciation. Supported by strong corporate profitability,
business fixed investment growth held up. However, export volume growth disappointed,
especially given strong global growth, and the trade deficit widened to 3½ percent of GDP.

Although increasing productivity growth and limited wage pressures even at the lowest
unemployment rate in about 30 years could indicate a shift outward in supply constraints,
most observers believe the economy is operating in the neighborhood of full capacity. Core
CPI inflation (excluding food, beverages, tobacco, and energy) stayed subdued at about
1¼ percent although CPI inflation edged up to about 1½ percent at end-2004. Most policies
remained in line with Fund advice (Box 1).
Box 1. Policy Recommendations and Implementation
The fiscal and monetary policy frameworks remain at the forefront of international best
practice and continue to evolve along the lines suggested during consultations. The gradual
tightening of monetary policy was consistent with last year’s Fund advice to contain strong
growth of domestic demand, especially in the face of rapidly rising house prices. Fiscal
outturns, however, have remained weaker than budget forecasts, and the authorities have not
taken measures to narrow the fiscal deficit, as recommended by staff and many Directors.

II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
4.
The continuing success of the U.K. economy reinforces the staff’s long-held view
of the powerful effects of good institutions and policy frameworks. Indeed, the economy
remains enviably well-positioned to sustain steady and strong economic growth over the
medium term. But staff and the authorities acknowledged that even state-of-the-art policy
frameworks constrain but do not eliminate discretion; that the frontiers of best practice are
continuously moving outward; and that turbulence from various disturbances is always a
risk. The discussions focused on attuning policies to each of these demands.
5.
The most immediate risks to continued strong economic performance stem from
fragilities born of the recent economic success and longer-term challenges.
•

•

Signs of overheating are scarce, but the
sustained strength of the economy makes it
difficult to read capacity constraints. One
obvious cause for concern is the sharp rise in
house prices over the past cycle—both a sign of
confidence in economic developments and
reminiscent of past booms. And while rapidly
rising property prices are a feature of some
other industrial countries, the estimated
overvaluation in the United Kingdom is
relatively large.
The past five years have seen a sizable
deterioration in the fiscal position as spending
responded to the perceived demand for better
public services while equity bubble revenues

subsided. Although the overall deficit is not large by current industrial country
standards and the debt burden is low, a persistent deficit at recent levels would
challenge the credibility of the government’s fiscal rules—a key underpinning of the
economy’s strength.

A. Economic Outlook
6.
Views on the short-term outlook were sanguine. BOE officials, the private
consensus, and staff expected output growth to settle at about 2½ percent. Private
consumption growth should be underpinned by continued solid earnings growth, largely
offsetting the lagged effects of last year’s interest rate increases and a projected modest drop
in house prices. Business investment was projected to accelerate somewhat, with support
from robust corporate profitability more than offsetting the drag from high leverage. Export
growth was expected to pick up, although remain below import growth. Treasury officials,
who saw coincident indicators as suggesting that output was still about 1 percent below

-9-

potential, expected quarterly growth to increase, supported by stronger external demand and
government spending. They projected output growth in 2005 at 3¼ percent.

The fundamental question differentiating these projections was where the
economy is relative to capacity constraints. In the Treasury’s view, a key indicator of
excess capacity was the decline in average hours worked per week over the past three years.
Staff, however, viewed the drop in hours worked as more a secular than cyclical
development—especially because the recent change is largely accounted for by an increase
in part-time employment, which surveys suggest has been voluntary. Staff argued that the
historically low unemployment rate and rising survey measures of capacity utilization, as
well as its production-function-based estimate of the output gap, suggested that the economy

- 10 -

was operating in the neighborhood of full capacity, in line with the BOE’s view and the
private consensus view. Nevertheless, staff acknowledged important uncertainties about
supply potential, given the continued edging down of the unemployment rate, a recent pickup in productivity growth, and problems with measures of spare capacity.

Perhaps the greatest near-term risk to the outlook was the possibility of a
sharper-than-expected drop in house prices, though the extent of the risk was
debatable. BOE officials argued that the sensitivity of consumption to house prices had
declined in recent years: despite the sharp increase in house prices since 2002, real household
consumption growth had remained stable, as increasing mortgage debt had been largely
offset by home improvement and financial asset accumulation. Staff responded that, even
though the correlation between changes in house prices and changes in consumption may
have weakened since 2002, the ratio of consumption to disposable income had risen over the
past decade alongside increasing housing wealth. Moreover, the effect of a drop in house
prices could be asymmetric if it led banks to tighten lending criteria, constraining some
households from borrowing to smooth consumption.

Staff asked whether the weakness of exports raised concerns about
competitiveness. Officials said that industrial countries generally had been losing export
share, probably reflecting the increasing integration of emerging market countries in the
global economy; relative to G7 countries, the

officials that—consistent with the latest CGER

major overvaluation.

Higher oil prices were also not a
major concern. The United Kingdom is a
small net oil exporter, and the oil intensity of
output is the lowest among G7 countries.
Officials and staff agreed that higher oil prices
could dampen economic activity in the short
term, but less so than in other G7 countries.
Also, higher oil prices would likely have only
a small direct impact on inflation, as energy
accounts for only about 5 percent of the CPI
basket. Firmly-entrenched inflation
expectations and the flexible labor market
would likely limit second-round effects.

Officials saw global imbalances as a risk to the outlook. Officials and staff agreed
that a disorderly resolution of global imbalances could result in slower global growth, which
would hurt U.K. growth. Regarding the possibility of further U.S. dollar depreciation, BOE
officials did not see a reason to expect a divergence from recent developments, in which
sterling appreciation against the U.S. dollar had been largely offset by depreciation against
the euro, implying little change to the effective exchange rate.
B. Monetary Policy
12.
BOE officials felt that monetary policy had been appropriate over the past
several years. They noted that between 1997 and end-2003 (when the inflation target
variable was changed from RPIX to CPI), average RPIX inflation had been almost identical

- 12 -

to the 2½ percent target.2 Low goods price inflation—reflecting falling import prices as well
as declining margins and accelerating productivity in the distribution sector—had been offset
by high housing depreciation (reflecting booming house prices). Over the past year, the rise
in interest rates had helped dampen domestic demand and house price appreciation and
thereby contain incipient inflation. The change in

Staff asked whether, nonetheless, the current level of interest rates might be seen
as too high. Specifically, did CPI inflation at the bottom of the target range in the past year
risk entrenching below-target inflation expectations? Were projections of a return of inflation
to target based on truly central assumptions? And why were interest rates higher than in other
higher-inflation G7 countries? On the first question, BOE officials noted that the spread

between nominal and RPI-indexed bond yields was consistent with the new CPI target. On
the projections, the BOE assumed that the economy would remain at potential and that unit
wage costs would continue to grow modestly, but that increasing import prices would push
inflation to target (Box 2). They acknowledged that, like staff, they had been wrong about the
strength of import prices in the past, but pointed to current projections for import prices
similar to those in the WEO. BOE officials saw the higher level of the policy interest rate in
the United Kingdom as mainly reflecting cyclical differences; they noted that implied shortterm interest rates 5–10 years out were lower in the United Kingdom than in the United
States or the euro area. They acknowledged that recent large fiscal deficits had probably put
some upward pressure on interest rates, but would be a major complicating factor only if they
persisted.
Box 2. Why Has Inflation Been Low?
Staff analysis suggests that low inflation in recent years can be explained reasonably well by a
combination of downward pressure from external shocks and inflation persistence.1 Specifically, an
estimated expectations-augmented Philips curve shows that declining import prices and increased
competitive pressures, proxied by sterling’s real appreciation, were the main factors behind low
inflation. An important degree of persistence in inflation, in turn, helped to spread the effects of the
external shocks over time.
Based on this inflation equation, staff forecast that
CPI inflation will rise gradually toward the 2 percent
target over the next 2–3 years (see figure). The upper
and lower bounds in the figure represent the
projected mean squared error of the forecast. Three
factors will work to push inflation higher: rising
import prices, the closing of the small negative
output gap, and well-anchored inflation expectations.
The significant persistence in inflation is expected to
slow the rise in inflation.

BOE officials said the direction of the next move in the policy interest rate would
depend on changes in economic prospects. With nominal GDP growth in 2005–06
projected to be about 5 percent, the policy interest rate of 4¾ percent was now in the vicinity
of the neutral rate. Given the important uncertainties to the outlook—including the degree of
spare capacity and the impact of weakening house prices on consumption—the next move in
interest rates could be up or down, depending on how the economy evolves relative to
baseline projections.
15.
BOE officials saw monetary policy as well-positioned to respond to shocks.
Should house prices fall by more than currently expected, the monetary policy response
would depend on the magnitude of the fall and the sensitivity of household consumption.

- 14 -

BOE and Treasury officials concurred with the results of a staff study suggesting that
monetary (and not fiscal) policy should bear the burden of the response to a house price
shock, especially given the current fiscal position (Box 3). Equally, the monetary policy
response to a large change in the exchange rate (as part of an unwinding of global
imbalances) would depend on its inflationary impact. With the policy rate at 4¾ percent and
inflation expected to rise only gradually to target, BOE officials and staff agreed that there
was ample room to tighten or loosen monetary policy.

Box 3. Policy Response to a Sharp Decline in House Prices
Staff analysis suggests that monetary policy is well-positioned to address the potential adverse
macroeconomic impact of a sharp decline in house prices.1 While staff and most observers expect
house prices to decline modestly in 2005, there is a risk that house prices could decline sharply, so
staff consider the impact of a range of potential declines in house prices relative to baseline in a
simulation model of the United Kingdom. The analysis shows that, even if the shock is quite large
(30 percent decline and consumption sensitivity in line with historical experience), large interest
rate cuts could limit the negative impact on real GDP (solid line in figure). Further, even if
monetary policy easing led unexpectedly to a burst in inflation, the risk of inflation rising more
than 1 percentage point above target is extremely low because inflation is currently below target.
The analysis further suggests that, with inflation below target but fiscal deficits still quite large, it
would be prudent to rely exclusively on monetary policy. Allowing automatic stabilizers to operate
fully would of course mitigate the decline in output and increase fiscal deficits (solid line in
figure). However, if fiscal policy provided a temporary stimulus, to which monetary policy
responded endogenously, the impact on output would be very small, but the deterioration in the
fiscal position could be considerable (dashed line in figure).

16.
On the whole satisfied with the transparency of the inflation targeting regime,
the BOE has continued to experiment with improvements. Staff welcomed the increased
emphasis on inflation projections using market expectations of future interest rates and the
extension of the projection horizon from two to three years. To further help financial markets
better understand the conduct of monetary policy, staff suggested that the BOE publish
numerical projections not just for real GDP and CPI but also for other key macroeconomic
variables. BOE officials noted that, as their forecast represented the collective judgment of
MPC members, securing agreement on quantitative projections (and error bands) for a wider
range of variables would be excessively time consuming. Staff and BOE also discussed the
pros and cons of publishing an illustrative path for interest rates consistent with the inflation
target. This would represent the actual process of monetary policy making, in which the
inflation target was given and interest rates were adjusted to achieve it. As such, it could help
guide market expectations more smoothly, a view underlying New Zealand’s successful
experience with publishing interest rate forecasts. BOE officials had two objections: they
noted that it would be inordinately time consuming for MPC members to agree on the path;
and they feared that the announcement of an illustrative path could be disruptively
misinterpreted as a BOE commitment to follow the path, rather than a view about a path
conditional on the information available at a given time.
C. Fiscal Policy
17.
The authorities emphasized that fiscal policy was rooted in medium-term
considerations. Fiscal rules introduced in 1998—a golden rule requiring the public sector’s
current balance to be non-negative on average over the business cycle and a sustainable
investment rule requiring net public sector debt to be kept at a stable and prudent level
(which the Treasury regards as below 40 percent of GDP)—were part of a framework
assuring fiscal solvency and scope for automatic stabilizers to respond to fluctuations in
demand. Discretion focused on decisions about the role of the government in the economy
and taxation required to meet that role. In this context, the government had initiated in 2000 a
multi-year increase in spending on health, education, transportation, and law and order. This
coincided with a drop in revenues relative to GDP as the equity price boom unwound. Thus,
the current balance had shifted over the current cycle—which in the Treasury’s view began
as GDP crossed trend in FY1999/2000 and should end in FY2005/06—from an initial surplus
of 2 percent of GDP to a deficit of 2 percent of GDP in FY2003/04. The authorities expected
several developments—a tapering off of spending growth and a rebound in the revenue ratio
(owing to higher corporate taxes and the closing of a still-substantial output gap)—to
partially reverse this deterioration and ensure that the fiscal rules were respected. At this
stage, therefore, they saw no need and had no plans for discretionary action. However, clear
evidence that projected improvements in the fiscal accounts were in doubt would prompt
immediate action.

Staff saw considerably greater risks from unchanged policies. The cumulative
current balance in this cycle is still in small surplus, so the golden rule is likely to be met or
missed by an insignificant amount. Net public debt is projected to be well below 40 percent
of GDP in FY 2004/05. Staff, however, argued that the next cycle—regardless of when it

begins—would start with a sizable current deficit, in contrast to the present cycle’s initial
surplus. Staff accepted that spending growth would taper off as planned and that the revenueto-GDP ratio would rise over the medium term owing to fiscal drag (about 0.1 percent per
year) and anti-fraud measures. But staff were less sanguine about the level of potential GDP
(and therefore the strength of structural revenues) and the buoyancy of financial sector taxes
over the medium term. As a result, without discretionary measures, staff projected an
improvement in the overall balance relative to GDP between FY2004/05 and FY2009/10 of
½ percentage point, compared to the Treasury’s 1½ percentage point. On staff’s projection,
the golden rule would not be met in the next cycle and the sustainable investment (debt) rule
would be broken eventually.3
19.
In this context, Treasury and staff views diverged on the appropriateness of the
fiscal stance in FY2004/05. Notwithstanding higher-than-budgeted current spending and
lower-than-budgeted revenue in the first nine months of the fiscal year, staff’s projections
assume that spending will be in line with the budget and that revenue will rebound due to the
acceleration in corporate income and personal bonuses and windfall oil receipts (close to
¼ percent of GDP). Although the cyclically-adjusted current balance relative to GDP is
expected to improve by ½ percentage point, the increase in investment implies a roughly
unchanged overall balance and a small overall fiscal stimulus. Staff observed that the
strengthening economy provided an opportunity for securing an adjustment in the overall
fiscal balance, as had been recommended last year. In the authorities’ view, however, the
critical adjustment was in the current balance where the improvement was indeed substantial.
20.
Treasury officials and staff also differed on whether the overall deficit would
narrow in FY2005/06 as projected in the December 2004 Pre-Budget Report (PBR).
Treasury officials explained that these projections were based on the standard assumptions of
no further tax changes and spending within the medium term plan updated in the July 2004
biennial Spending Review. On the assumption that growth would be faster than trend and tax
buoyancy would improve, revenues would rise relative to GDP by more than spending: the
current deficit was projected to fall to about ½ percent of GDP. Staff took the position that
the underpinnings of the projected revenue increase—a sharp increase in corporate revenues
alongside a sizable pick-up in income growth during 2005—were overly optimistic.
21.
Given these misgivings, staff argued for near-term adjustment measures.
Immediate action would allow smoother adjustment, lower the risk of an eventual procyclical
adjustment, protect against any slippage in the credibility of the fiscal rules, and help build a
buffer for future shocks. Ideally, in staff’s view, adjustment would focus on containing the
growth of current spending. Existing plans already incorporate slower current expenditure
growth over the coming three fiscal years than in the previous three years, but current
spending is still projected to rise by about ½ percentage point of GDP by FY2007/08. Staff
noted that an earlier slowing would help guard against risks of inefficiency, inherent in
recent rapid increases in spending.

Public debt sustainability analysis has not changed significantly from last year.

22.
Treasury officials noted that the program to increase spending on public
services would need to be seen through to completion. They argued that the framework to
monitor and improve the delivery of public services had already achieved considerable
success. Staff, however, observed that progress had not been uniform (Box 4). Treasury
officials emphasized that a new framework to monitor the efficiency of spending was being
established and that detailed plans for achieving 1½ percent of GDP of savings by
FY2007/08 already existed. Staff acknowledged the scope for efficiency gains, including
through improved procurement practices and relocating parts of the civil service to lowercost areas, but argued that the continued rapid growth of spending would make achieving
these gains more difficult. Also, because the government’s plan is to plough back any
efficiency gains into spending, such gains would not help reduce the fiscal deficit.
Box 4. Public Service Agreements—Are They A Magic Bullet?
Public Service Agreements (PSAs) aim to improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of public
services by using specific, quantitative performance targets at the departmental level. The
rationale behind setting targets is to communicate the government’s objectives in each area of
public services and provide a basis for monitoring progress, thereby ensuring accountability. The
PSAs of all departments are made public at the time of the biennial Spending Reviews. PSA
targets (about 130 at present) are monitored with quantitative indicators, available on the
Treasury’s website. Government ministers are responsible for achieving the targets.
Progress in attaining the current PSA targets has been mixed, and the PSA framework has
evolved in response to the experience gained during its implementation. For instance, the target
of the Department of Health to reduce waiting times by end-2005 is on track to be achieved. By
contrast, the outlook for the achievement of the Department of Education’s targets to improve
student attainment is more mixed. Most value-for-money targets have turned out to be more
difficult to measure than originally anticipated. In response, the framework has been changed to
reduce the number of PSA targets, increase the share of outcome-based targets, increase
flexibility in delivery at the local level, and eliminate Service Delivery Agreements, which
included lower-level input milestones underpinning the delivery of PSA targets.
Nonetheless, problems remain. First, some targets are still difficult to monitor due to
measurement problems, particularly for those involving efficiency or quality improvements.
Second, designing and implementing incentives to motivate service providers to deliver higher
quality services has often been difficult. Third, some targets—such as raising U.K. productivity
growth—are broad and subject to factors beyond the control of a given department or even the
government as a whole. Finally, as the focus on certain targets leads to a shift in resources toward
the government’s priorities, other areas of public service delivery can be affected.

23.
Staff emphasized that adjustment from revenue increases would need to avoid
increasing disincentives to work or other distortions. Wider application of user fees on
public services would be an efficiency enhancing option. Treasury officials noted that they
were studying the feasibility of national road use fees, but reported no plans to further
expand user fees in education or extend user fees to health services. On other revenue

- 19 -

adjustments, staff argued that the emphasis should be on broadening the tax base, for
example by eliminating VAT zero-rating, rather than raising tax rates. Treasury officials
responded that the government’s 2001 election manifesto explicitly ruled out raising VAT
rates. Staff argued against raising labor taxes, such as income taxes or National Insurance
Contribution rates, because of the adverse effects on labor supply. Staff noted that the
planned integration of Inland Revenue and Customs will improve tax collection, but is not
expected to have a significant impact on revenue.
24.
Staff discussed ways to further enhance the transparency and credibility of the
fiscal projections. Regarding transparency, staff noted that, given the asymmetry of the
golden rule (current balance or better over the cycle) and the inevitability of economic
shocks, ensuring that the rule would be met in any circumstances would be costly in terms of
requiring a sizable average current surplus target (Box 5). Therefore, staff recommended that
Box 5. The Golden Rule—How Much Safety Margin Does It Need?
Given that the golden rule is asymmetric (current balance or better over the cycle) and that shocks are
inevitable, the government would need to target a large current surplus if it wanted the probability of
meeting the rule to be large. Using a reduced-form stochastic model of the current balance based on
the output and asset price shocks experienced by the U.K. economy over the past four decades, staff
analysis explores the relationship between the probability of meeting the golden rule and the targeted
average current surplus.1 The analysis incorporates exogenous shocks to discretionary fiscal policy
but assumes no endogenous discretionary fiscal policy response to economic shocks over the cycle.
The results show that increasing the desired probability of meeting the rule has a large impact on the
implied target for the average current surplus (see table). The safety margin needed to meet the golden
rule with a 75 percent chance is ½ percent of GDP; increasing this probability to 99 percent requires a
safety margin of 2¼ percent of GDP. In other words, attempting to drive the risk of breaching the rule
to close to zero is very costly from macroeconomic and intergenerational perspectives. Thus, it is
important to be explicit about both the desired probability of meeting the rule and the associated target
for the average current surplus.

the Treasury be explicit about the probability of meeting the rule and about the implied target
for the average current surplus over the cycle. Fiscal projections based on central (not

- 20 -

“cautious”) assumptions and uncertainty around them should be shown in fan charts.
Treasury officials responded that the visible buffer created by using central assumptions
could produce additional spending pressures. Regarding credibility, staff noted that the
National Audit Office—which is independent of the government and reports directly to
Parliament—currently audits eleven assumptions used in the revenue projections, but
recommended that the reach of independent assessment of assumptions underlying the fiscal
projections, including the timing of the economic cycle, be broadened. Treasury officials felt
that the fiscal projections already received extensive and adequate outside scrutiny, including
from research institutes that provide testimony to Parliament.
D. Structural Issues
25.
The mission found that the challenges of population aging, though less severe
than in most other industrial countries, had moved to the forefront of public debate.
Just prior to the mission, a government-appointed independent Pensions Commission,
charged with studying the adequacy of the pension system and private saving to meet
retirement needs over the long term, had published its interim report. Laying out the key
issues and likely scenarios, the study concludes that, based on a variety of assumptions
(including about desired replacement ratios), some 9½ million people (almost half of the
working age population over 35) have inadequate saving to meet their likely expectations
about retirement incomes. The saving gap reflects several factors: the difficulty that most
people face in making rational decisions about long-term saving; the complexity of the
existing pension system; the high cost of selling and administering private pension products;
and the lack of trust in the retail financial industry following a series of mis-selling scandals.
The Commission has opened a year-long public debate and will make concrete proposals in
late 2005.
26.
Staff probed the robustness of the conclusions on the saving gap. A member of
the Commission explained that even though the central projection had enormous error
bands—reflecting uncertainties about issues ranging from demographics, to life-cycle
spending patterns, to activity rates of old people, and to rates of return on investment—he
was confident that a substantial saving gap existed. He added that the key issue was the
middle class, as the poor were covered by means tested supplements to standard state
pension benefits, and the rich generally save enough. Asked about the exclusion of housing
from the calculation of the saving gap, the Commission member explained that, with sharply
higher house prices, people can only afford to buy houses later in life, future house values are
highly uncertain particularly insofar as they may be affected by demographics themselves,
and pension gaps are not necessarily matched by housing assets across individuals. Treasury
officials welcomed the Report and the public debate it has generated. They noted that its
conclusions were similar to those of the 2002 Green Paper on Pensions, which had found that
3 million people were seriously undersaving and an additional 5–10 million would have to
save more or work longer. Staff agreed that there was strong evidence that many people were
not saving enough to meet their likely expectations of retirement income.
27.
Views on the solution to the saving gap covered a wide spectrum. Most
interlocutors, except the trade unions, agreed that an increase in the pensionable age (in

- 21 -

addition to the extension to 65 years currently scheduled to be phased in for women between
2010 and 2020) and greater flexibility for people to trade off working longer for higher
pensions would be essential parts. Staff also supported the development of deeper markets
for long-term, fixed-income and longevity-linked financial instruments. Beyond that,
however, views differed widely on the appropriate role of government in promoting private
saving. Treasury officials tended toward the view that results of existing measures to
encourage private saving, including the effort to improve the financial education of
households (which is at the forefront of international practice), simplification of the taxation
of pensions, the creation of a Pension Protection Fund to protect occupational pension
schemes, and the reform of stakeholder products (simple pension-saving vehicles for
individuals), needed to be assessed before new schemes were introduced. The Commission
member, however, cautioned that it would take too long to see whether encouragement is
enough to ensure adequate saving. One view was that a more proactive approach would be
needed to strike the right balance between the risk of having too many disappointed
pensioners and the risk of motivating or forcing people to save more than they need. The
debate, he expected, would come down to expanding the state pension system (currently the
U.K. system is one of the least generous among industrial countries), increasing compulsion
beyond that which already exists, or strengthening voluntary saving (for example by
introducing automatic enrolment, using the tax system to reduce collection costs, or having
the government negotiate on behalf of savers to lower mutual fund fees).
28.
Officials and staff welcomed the narrowing of the gap between productivity in
the United Kingdom and the average in other G7 countries, but were unsure how much
further this would go. Officials attributed the more rapid productivity growth in the United
Kingdom since the early 1990s to structural reforms and macroeconomic stability. They had
difficulty, however, identifying the precise reasons for the remaining productivity shortfall of
about 10 percent. Consequently, they had adopted a multi-pronged approach to eliminating
it. As previous staff work had found that this gap is due to a variety of factors, staff
concurred. Beyond this broad approach, officials were systematically monitoring and

evaluating the government’s various initiatives, modifying (such as the small-firm loan

firms) them as indicated. Officials were also considering how to streamline business
regulation, as surveys show that firms are concerned about regulatory burden (even though
work by the OECD suggests that regulation in the United Kingdom is light compared with
other industrial countries).
29.
Staff asked about efforts to help the
large number of incapacity benefit (IB)
recipients move into work. Officials noted that,
following reforms in 1995 to eliminate the
earnings-related component of the benefit and
tighten qualifying conditions, the flows into IB
had slowed. In recent years, the focus has been on
using active labor market policies to help IB
recipients move into work. Over the past year, a
pilot program (“Pathways to Work”) introduced a
range of interventions at job centers, such as
work-focused interviews for IB recipients. Staff
welcomed the apparent early success of this
program and its planned extension to about onethird of the country.

Another ongoing structural concern—rigidities on both the demand and supply
side of the housing market—had been the subject of two government-sponsored reports
in the past year. The Barker Report, addressing supply side problems, had recommended
increasing the price sensitivity of housing supply and reducing delays in the planning
process. Treasury officials said that the government had accepted the Report’s
recommendations and was working on reforming complicated housing market regulations.
Public consultation was planned for mid-2005. On the demand side, the Miles Report had
suggested promoting long-term, fixed-rate mortgages by increasing the transparency of
mortgage pricing and improving funding options for lenders. With the FSA having taken on
mortgage regulation in 2004, some changes to improve information available to households
on mortgages had already been made. The FSA will consider other Miles recommendations
in its forthcoming review of mortgage regulation. Potential funding barriers were also being
addressed: legislation now before Parliament would remove a constraint on the future ability
of building societies to own securitized assets, and the government planned to review
minimum funding limits for building societies.
31.
Some observers have speculated that the structure of property taxation has
contributed to house price volatility. With the long interval between property assessments
for the Council Tax, effective property tax rates have fallen by the largest amounts for houses
whose prices have risen the most. Staff empirical work on the effect of lower user costs on
house price appreciation, however, showed that the tax impact was small (Box 6). Also, staff

review will make recommendations on how
best to reform the Council Tax, taking into
account the forthcoming property
revaluation.

noted that attempts to mitigate this effect (for example through more frequent assessments of
property values) would contribute to unwelcome volatility in local tax revenues. Officials
said that a review, currently underway, of the entire structure of local government finance
would examine these issues.
E. Financial Sector Stability
32.
The authorities observed that virtually all indicators suggested that the banking
system remained sound and risks were low. Profitability, capitalization, and credit quality
were strong: the median return on large banks’ equity rose from 24 percent in 2003 to
27 percent in the first half of 2004; total and tier-I capital ratios remained well above
regulatory minima; and mortgage arrears and corporate insolvencies continued to fall.
Although weakening house prices would likely reduce credit growth and thus dampen bank

- 24 -

profitability, officials and private analysts said that mortgage lending did not constitute an
important risk to financial stability: not only were household debt service ratios low, but also
average loan-to-value ratios had declined to

40–50 percent. However, the rapid growth of

vulnerability was that the search for yield
posed challenges for risk management, not
least because it may have led some financial institutions to build up positions in what could
prove to be relatively illiquid assets.
33.
The BOE is planning to introduce a voluntary reserve system as part of a wider
reform of the sterling money markets, the core objectives of which are to reduce
volatility in overnight money markets and improve banks’ liquidity management. The
reform may also encourage more banks to join the real time gross settlement system, which
would lower intraday credit exposures between banks in the payments system, consistent
with FSAP recommendations. In response to staff’s question about the reaction of financial
market participants, BOE officials said that early feedback suggested that the proposal was
welcome and that participation in the system would be more than sufficient to achieve the
BOE’s objectives. BOE officials added that they would publish in early 2005 a new
Payments Systems Oversight Report, in line with FSAP recommendations.
34.
The authorities highlighted improvement in the health of the insurance sector
over the past year. Among life insurers, solvency margins had increased as equity prices
rose. Among nonlife insurers, profitability had increased, reflecting improving claims
experience, firm premium rates, and better investment returns. Officials and private analysts
added that risk management was improving, owing in part to the introduction in 2004 of a
new risk-based capital adequacy regime that went beyond the EU Solvency I framework. The
FSA was to start to regulate brokers in 2005 and expected that improvements in risk
management, which had lagged, would accelerate.
35.
The authorities noted that the AML/CFT regime had been strengthened in line
with FSAP recommendations. Officials observed that the regime’s coverage was extensive,
given that it included, beyond the financial sector, lawyers and accountants and that all
suspicious transactions must be reported. The authorities were stepping up their oversight to
ensure compliance with the legal and regulatory requirements, and are keeping the regime
under review in order to make it more effective. This was illustrated in a recent report, which
showed that the authorities’ efforts to sensitize senior financial sector managers to money
laundering were producing results. Officials also noted that they had implemented the EU

- 25 -

second AML directive and were reviewing regulations to ensure full compliance with the
updated FATF recommendations.
F. Other Issues
36.
Regarding euro adoption, the authorities said that the government remained in
principle in favor of joining the single currency. In practice, the economic conditions
needed to be right. Staff concurred, noting that the float was now satisfactory and that—
given the irreversibility of euro entry—the authorities needed to feel confident that the case
for entry had been established with a sufficient degree of certainty. The authorities said that
progress on the reform agenda set out in the 2003 assessment of the five tests for euro
adoption had been reviewed in the 2004 Budget and would be reviewed again in the
forthcoming Budget. The authorities hoped that convergence would occur in both directions,
for example the German mortgage market would be liberalized as long-term, fixed-rate
mortgages were promoted in the United Kingdom. Staff asked about the authorities’ view on
the growing empirical evidence of the favorable effect of euro adoption on cross-border
trade. The authorities noted the large range of estimates and inter-country differences. Staff
agreed and said that further research was needed to pinpoint the reasons for the differences.
37.
Staff praised the government’s consistent support for trade liberalization within
the European Union. Officials welcomed the July 2004 framework agreements for the Doha
Round, especially their detail on domestic support and export subsidies, and regretted that
the agricultural market access pillar is the least detailed. Officials advocated elimination of
trade-distorting effects of the Common Agricultural Policy and said that the EU can and
should push ahead with agricultural reform so that border protection is substantially reduced,
export subsidies are no longer an issue for world trade by 2010, and all agricultural tariff
peaks are reduced towards the maximum level for non-agricultural products. The United
Kingdom has consistently supported in the WTO and the EU the liberalization of services
trade and sees itself benefiting from a less restrictive environment.
38.
Staff welcomed the increase in the U.K. ODA. Even before recent commitments in
response to the tsunami, officials said that the 2004 Spending Review foresaw a further
increase in ODA to 0.47 percent of GNI by FY2007/08, with the goal of reaching the United
Nations target of 0.7 percent of GNI by 2013. Officials said that, with the United Kingdom’s

III. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Economic performance in the United Kingdom remains impressive. Now in the
sixth year of a cycle that has seen shallow fluctuations in output growth and a robust
expansion, the economy continues to be supported by resilient domestic demand. At the same
time unemployment has fallen to historic lows without signs of wage pressures. This success
owes much to strong institutions underpinned by clear and well-designed policy frameworks
that have helped sustain stability and anchor expectations through a global economic and
equity cycle, a sizeable countercyclical policy stimulus, and a sharp increase in housing
prices. The challenge ahead is to ensure that the institutions are sustained and supported by
the right policy decisions.
40.
The economic environment for these decisions is likely to be benign, but
macroeconomic policies will need to be attuned to important uncertainties. With
earnings growth and corporate profitability likely to remain strong, domestic demand should
keep real GDP growth at about 2½ percent through 2006, while inflation moves toward the
target of 2 percent. However, uncertainties surrounding these projections are large. In the
short term, three stand out: how quickly the widely perceived overvaluation of house prices
is resolved and how private consumption will be affected; how and when global imbalances
will be unwound and with what effects on the external sector and value of sterling; and how
to gauge the economy’s resource constraints when traditional yardsticks may be breaking
down. Over the medium term, uncertainties are structural in nature: will fiscal revenues
regain turn-of-the-century peaks and is private saving adequate to support the aging
population.
41.
Amidst these uncertainties, monetary policy is well-positioned to maintain the
credibility of low inflation. Increases in interest rates since late 2003 appear to have been
effective in preempting the emergence of excess demand and, in so doing, helping to cool the
housing market. More recently, with interest rates in a broadly neutral range, easing demand
growth, and the sharp slowdown in house price appreciation, interest rates have been
appropriately held constant. Larger, unexpected changes in house prices in either direction,
however, could have significant effects on activity and future inflation, and would thus
warrant decisive policy action. Another challenge for monetary policy will be judging
incipient resource constraints. Although a sharp drop in unemployment would point to the
need to tighten, a gradual edging down would be more difficult to interpret. At a time when
years of structural and macroeconomic policy improvements may boost the sustainable level
of output, it will be important to probe limits, but to do so cautiously: missing warning signs
could be costly.
42.
The recent success of monetary policy stems in no small part from a strong
policy and institutional framework. Credibility is underpinned by the success in achieving
low and stable inflation and is reflected in well-anchored expectations. Commendably, the
implementation of monetary policy within the framework continues to evolve, and changes

- 27 -

over the past year in BOE communications to markets are welcome. For the future, it would
be worthwhile for the BOE to consider expanding the number of key macroeconomic
variables for which quantified projections are published.
43.
Fiscal policy decisions pose more of a challenge. The deterioration in the fiscal
position since FY2000/01 raises questions about how and when the necessary correction will
take place. At stake is not meeting the fiscal rules in the current cycle, when the sizable
initial current and overall surpluses virtually ensure that the rules will be met or missed by an
insignificant margin. Rather, an early correction is needed to position the public finances to
meet the rules in the next cycle. In staff’s view, the authorities’ projection of a substantial,
autonomous rise in revenues relative to GDP and shift of the current balance to surplus over
the next few years is too sanguine. More realistic projections of the level of potential output
and of the scope for higher corporate tax revenues point to the need for a fiscal adjustment
relative to GDP of about 1 percentage point. This would both reinforce the government’s
commitment to its fiscal rules and build in a buffer to meet the rules even in the face of
plausible future adverse shocks. Undertaking this mild fiscal adjustment expeditiously would
allow the consolidation to be spread over time, starting in strong economic conditions.
44.
Adjustment measures should be designed to minimize any adverse effects on
efficiency, work effort, and growth. This argues for current spending restraint—both to
reduce the risks of running into limits on absorptive capacity and to allow more time to
assess value for money. Wider application of user fees, which would raise efficiency and
revenue, is another good option. If more reliance on revenue measures were desired,
broadening the tax base would be preferable to raising tax rates, given potential adverse
effects on supply.
45.
Keeping the fiscal policy framework at the forefront of international best
practice will require constant self-appraisal. A review of the framework as the cycle
closes would be timely. The experience over this cycle suggests three questions for
consideration. First, how transparently should budgets incorporate prudence? At present,
fiscal projections do not link the desired probability of meeting the golden rule with the
targeted current surplus. To increase transparency, this link could be made explicit by basing
fiscal projections on central assumptions and mapping uncertainty in fan charts. A second
question concerns the optimal reach of independent assessment of assumptions in the budget.
Independent assessment of key variables beyond the eleven now audited by the National
Audit Office could enhance credibility. A third question concerns how to ensure the
efficiency of spending, particularly given the rapid increase in recent years. Quantitative
targets to help monitor public services and recently established efficiency targets to improve
procurement and increase the flexibility of work practices are welcome. But how well these
procedures meet the inherent challenges in measuring outputs and their quality, linking
policies to targets, and avoiding resource diversion remains a question.
46.
A critical debate about the government’s role in ensuring adequate retirement
income over the long term is underway. The Interim Report of the Pensions Commission
provides strong evidence that a sizable swath of the middle-class is not saving enough to
ensure retirement income that will meet their aspirations. How to address this problem raises

- 28 -

difficult questions. Certainly simplifying the now-complex pension system and promoting
longer active participation in the work force make sense. But beyond this, the costs of
motivating or forcing higher private saving must be weighed against risks of future demands
by pensioners on public resources.
47.
The recent sharp slowing of the housing market underlines the importance of
reducing house price volatility by implementing the recommendations of the Miles and
Barker Reviews. Specifically, it is important that the FSA incorporate the Miles
recommendations in its forthcoming review of the statutory regime for mortgage lending.
Equally, it is important that the Barker Review’s general recommendations regarding the role
of price signals and delays in the planning process be formulated into concrete legislative
proposals.
48.
Despite relatively rapid growth over the past decade, labor productivity below
the average in other G7 countries represents a challenge. As the gap is due to a variety of
factors, the relative importance of which is unclear, the government’s multi-pronged strategy
is appropriate. The systematic monitoring and evaluation of ongoing programs is essential
and will be served by the recent introduction of specific performance indicators.
49.
Indicators of the health of the financial sector remain favorable. Bank
capitalization, credit quality, and profitability continue to be strong. However, slower credit
growth will likely dampen profitability and there are some downside risks, including from
unsecured lending to households, lending related to commercial property, and the ongoing
search for yield. The health of the life insurance sector has improved substantially over the
past year, partly reflecting increases in equity prices. The resilience of the financial sector is
being enhanced by the FSA’s introduction of risk-based capital measures in insurance firms
and of broker regulation in the nonlife insurance sector, and the BOE’s strengthening of the
supervisory and institutional aspects of payments and settlement systems.
50.
The United Kingdom continues to play a leadership role in trade and aid. Its
strong stand in favor of trade liberalization, especially of agricultural trade, is commendable.
The recent and planned increases in ODA are welcome.
51.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

APPENDIX III

United Kingdom: Statistical Information
The United Kingdom maintains high standards of economic data provision. The authorities
publish a full range of economic and financial data that is available electronically and have
subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). The UK shifted to ESA95 in
September 1997. While most of the changes related to the introduction of ESA95 have been
implemented, the timetable for the implementation of the reminder of ESA95 extends to
2005. In recent years, the authorities implemented a number of important methodological
changes to the national accounts dataset, most of which were related to the adoption of
ESA95. In 2003 the authorities introduced further revisions reflecting a shift to annual chainlinking, corrections for import fraud, and revisions in some volatile construction data.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
March 2, 2005
1.
This note reports on recent developments since the staff report was issued. These
developments do not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Economic growth increased somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2004, as
envisaged in the staff report. Data on expenditure components indicate that, relative to
projections, household consumption growth was slightly weaker than expected, while
government expenditure growth was a little stronger than expected. Coincident and leading
indicators continue to suggest that growth will settle at about 2½ percent in 2005–06, in line
with potential growth:
•

Recent housing market indicators have been at least as strong as expected at the time
of the staff report, though a sharp decline in house prices remains the key near-term
risk to the outlook. House prices rose a little in January, raising the three-month on
three-month rate of change to about 3 percent. BOE data on mortgage approvals
increased a little in December after six months of declines.

•

Real retail sales growth rebounded in January, following the significant easing in the
fourth quarter of 2004. However, this series is volatile and on average monthly
growth has slowed substantially since mid-2004.

•

The composite output PMI remained close to its ten-year average in January,
suggesting continued trend growth in the near term. A fall in the manufacturing PMI
was offset by a rise in the services PMI.

3.
CPI inflation remained at 1.6 percent in January. Core CPI inflation (excluding
food, beverages, tobacco, and energy) stayed subdued at around 1¼ percent. Growth in
private sector earnings excluding bonuses continued to be stable at about 4½ percent.
4.
The Bank of England left its policy interest rate unchanged at 4¾ percent in
early February. The MPC lifted a little its forecasts for CPI inflation in the February
Inflation Report (compared to the November report), reflecting the somewhat higher level of
current CPI inflation and slightly higher-than-expected producer and import price inflation.
Under the MPC’s central projection, inflation will rise gradually to about 2 percent over the
next two years. However, risks to the central projection continue to be skewed somewhat to
the downside.
5.
Fiscal data for January were in line with the Pre-Budget Report and staff’s
projections for FY2004/05. Over the first ten months of the fiscal year, the growth rate of
central government current receipts (including corporation and personal income tax receipts)
was in line with PBR and staff projections for the year as a whole. On the expenditure side,
central government current spending was a little higher than expected while net investment

-2-

spending was slightly lower than projected. The Budget for FY2005/06 is scheduled to be
released on March 16.
6.
The government announced in early February a strategy to boost labor
participation of older workers, people with temporary disabilities, and single parents.
To encourage working past the state pension age of 59/64, a more generous and flexible
option for deferring state pension will become available in April 2005. For people with
disabilities, a new benefit system will be in place for new claimants by 2008. In the new
system, benefits will depend on whether a person is assessed to have a manageable or severe
condition, and there will be financial incentives for those with manageable conditions to
attend work-focused interviews. For single parents, a new pilot program will be introduced to
provide additional support and financial incentives to move back into work. These initiatives
are consistent with the staff’s recommendations.
7.
The Bank of England issued its first Payment Systems Oversight Report, as
anticipated in the staff report. The report clarifies the rationale and objectives of the BOE’s
oversight, gives an account of the BOE’s activities during 2004, and identifies priorities for
2005. While the U.K. payment systems exhibits a high level of robustness by international
standards, the BOE continued to address systemic risks linked to tiering and worked toward
improving liquidity funding and collateralization agreements. Progress was also made on
implementing FSAP recommendations. A priority for 2005 is to strengthen arrangements for
cooperative oversight of cross-border infrastructures. The Report appears to extend
international best practice with respect to transparency about payment systems oversight and
assessment.

Statement by Tom Scholar, Executive Director for the United Kingdom
March 2, 2005

My authorities are most grateful to staff for their work and will take careful note of their
comments. There is a broad measure of agreement between staff and the authorities on most
aspects of economic policy.
Economic prospects
The economic fundamentals in the UK remain sound: 50 consecutive quarters of growth, the
longest unbroken expansion on record; growth in 2004 of 3.1 percent; CPI inflation currently
at 1.6 percent, short term interest rates at 4.75 percent, and employment at record levels of
75 percent. Growth is forecast (in the 2004 Pre-Budget Report) to remain at 3 percent to
3½ percent in 2005, before returning to trend (2.5 percent to 3 percent) in 2006; with
inflation at or close to target. As staff note, there are risks: my authorities remain vigilant to
these and agree with staff on the need for cautious macroeconomic polices, to which they are
fully committed.
Monetary and fiscal policy
My authorities will continue to set policy on the basis of the policy framework established in
1997, and based on the principles of transparency, responsibility and accountability:
•

Fiscal policy set according to two fiscal rules:
o the Golden Rule—over the cycle, the Government will borrow only to invest;
o the Sustainable Investment Rule—over the cycle, public sector net debt will be held
at a stable and prudent level, defined as 40 percent or less;

•

Monetary policy set by the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to
meet a symmetric inflation target.

My authorities agree with staff that the fiscal and monetary policy frameworks have served
the UK well, anchoring expectations and sustaining stability. The fiscal framework is based
on strict rules backed by cautious, audited assumptions. These rules are set over the cycle to
allow the automatic stabilisers to operate freely and fully and fiscal policy to support
monetary policy when the economy is below trend. My authorities feel that the current fiscal
stance remains consistent with these rules and appropriate for this point in the economic
cycle.
Fiscal policy will, as usual, be set in the Budget. The latest available projections (in the PreBudget Report) show a gradual reduction in the deficit to 1½ percent of GDP; with an
average annual surplus on the current budget of 0.1 percent in this cycle, and ¼ percent from

-22005-06 to 2009-10; and net debt stabilising at 37 percent of GDP. My authorities are thus on
course to meet the fiscal rules in this cycle and the next.
Staff see downside risks to the revenue projections. My authorities are confident about these
projections and note that they are based on deliberately cautious assumptions (e.g. growth at
the lower end of the forecast range, and trend growth 0.25 percent below the neutral view).
Data released since the IMF mission supports the view that there remains a significant output
gap, and that above trend growth is continuing, with rising real incomes and a sizeable pickup in tax revenues including in corporation tax. They therefore do not agree with staff that
there is a need for ‘an early correction’ and believe that the latest data confirms this view.
They have noted staff’s suggestions for minor modifications to the fiscal and monetary
framework. They welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues with staff, but are not
attracted to these specific proposals. In particular, they see considerable costs in the
publication by the MPC of quantitative projections (and error bands) for a further set of
variables; they doubt whether a probabilistic approach to fiscal policy would improve public
understanding or confidence in the framework; and they regard the use of cautious (rather
than central) assumptions as key to the prudent conduct of fiscal policy. They agree on the
importance of external scrutiny of macroeconomic policy, a central objective of the policy
framework, and believe this is achieved through independent auditing of key economic
assumptions, high level of transparency in the fiscal framework through publications like the
End of Year Fiscal Report and Long-term Public Finances Report, and the continuous and
vibrant public debate around economic policy that this transparency engenders, including
contributions from expert commentators such as the IMF.
Structural issues
Staff have rightly noted the legacy of under-investment in public services. Public sector net
investment fell by 15 percent annually in real terms between 1991-92 and 1996-97 leaving
the UK with the lowest level of public investment of any large EU country. To address this,
and recognising the importance of public sector infrastructure for private sector productivity,
my authorities aim to raise public sector net investment to 2¼ percent of GDP by 2007-08.
My authorities agree with staff on the need to ensure efficiency and value for money, and
have set out a broad agenda for reform with a clear focus on outcomes, extra investment
linked to reforms, civil service reform, and stretching efficiency targets. Improvements in
central government procurement, for example, have delivered £2 billion of savings in 200304 alone; and my authorities have published plans to achieve £20 billion of efficiency gains
(or 1½ percent of GDP) by 2007-08.
My authorities agree with staff on the central importance of raising productivity, and have set
out a comprehensive programme of microeconomic reform to remove the barriers that
prevent markets from functioning efficiently. These measures aim to improve competition,
promote enterprise, support science and innovation, raise skills and encourage investment;
and they are regularly monitored and assessed. A major review of regulation is underway,
and the Budget will set out proposals to remove barriers that are not justified.

-3-

My authorities’ policy on membership of the single currency remains unchanged. The June
2003 assessment set out a reform agenda to promote convergence and flexibility, and
progress on this will be reviewed in the Budget.
My authorities agree with staff on the importance of the work of the Pensions Commission;
on the need to address housing market reform through implementation of the Miles and
Barker Reviews; and on their overall assessment on the UK financial system.
Other issues
My authorities will continue to support trade liberalization, a successful completion of the
Doha Round, and common agricultural policy (CAP) reform. They will increase ODA to
0.47 percent of GNI in 2007-08, with a timetable to reach 0.7 percent of GNI by 2013. They
are seeking international agreement on a doubling of global aid flows through their proposal
for an International Finance Facility; and greater debt relief for the poorest countries, with
multilateral debt cancellation of up to 100 percent.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the
United Kingdom
On March 2, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United Kingdom.1
Background
Macroeconomic performance over the past decade has been strong and steady, owing much to
structural reforms and improvements in macroeconomic policies and policy frameworks. Having
slowed gradually over the past year, as higher mortgage interest rates and weaker house price
appreciation dampened household consumption, real GDP growth is estimated at about
3 percent in 2004 and is expected to stay stable at about 2½ percent in 2005–06, in line with
potential growth. Domestic demand remains the key driver of growth, underpinned by continued
strong earnings growth and robust corporate profitability. Even though the unemployment rate
fell to a 30-year low, wage growth stabilized and inflation remained subdued. Notwithstanding
the recent cooling of the housing market, house prices are widely seen as overvalued.
The policy interest rate has been stable since August 2004, when it was raised to 4¾ percent,
which is generally viewed as in a neutral range. Although headline CPI inflation edged up to
1½ percent at end-2004, core inflation remained subdued at 1¼ percent. The economy is widely

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2seen as operating in the neighborhood of full capacity and, given the outlook for growth, is
expected to remain so. The spread between nominal and inflation-indexed bonds suggests that
inflation expectations remain well-anchored. Rising import prices are expected to push inflation
toward the 2 percent target over the coming 2–3 years.
The fiscal position deteriorated sharply over the past five years, although the overall deficit is
not large compared to other major industrial countries and the debt burden is relatively low.
The widening of the deficit reflected an increase in government spending in response to the
perceived demand for better public services and a decline in equity-bubble-related revenues.
The December 2004 Pre-Budget Report projects that slower spending growth and a rebound in
revenues will reverse this deterioration and ensure that the fiscal rules are respected now and in
the future. However, there are questions about how much revenues will rebound in the absence
of further policy measures.
The October 2004 Interim Report of the Pensions Commission suggested that many people are
not saving enough for retirement. Based on a variety of assumptions, the Report found that
some 9½ million people (about half of the working-age population over 35) have inadequate
saving to meet their likely expectations about retirement incomes. The saving gap reflects
several factors: the difficulty that most people face in making rational decisions about long-term
saving; the complexity of the existing pension system; the high cost of selling and administering
private pension products; and the lack of trust in the retail financial industry following a series of
mis-selling scandals.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the United Kingdom authorities for their skillful macroeconomic
management and flexibility in responding to changing economic circumstances, and welcomed
the continued robust performance of the economy. Economic growth has been relatively rapid
and stable, unemployment has fallen to one of the lowest rates among industrial countries, and
inflation has been subdued. Directors noted that underlying this impressive performance have
been clear and “state-of-the-art” policy frameworks underpinned by strong institutions, as well
as a sizable countercyclical policy stimulus and a sharp increase in house prices. Looking
ahead, Directors considered that the key challenge will be to ensure that the strong policy
frameworks are sustained and supported by the right policy decisions.
The economic environment in the period ahead is expected to be benign, with strong growth
supported by resilient domestic demand, and inflation moving toward the target of 2 percent.
Directors noted, however, that this outlook is subject to significant short-term uncertainties.
These include, first, how quickly the widely perceived overvaluation of house prices will be
resolved and its effect on private consumption; second, how and when global imbalances will be
unwound and their impact on the external sector and the value of sterling; and third, how to
assess the economy’s resource constraints, when standard yardsticks may be breaking down.
Directors also acknowledged important uncertainties in the medium term about whether fiscal
revenues will recover to their turn-of-the-century peaks, and whether private saving will be
adequate to support the aging population in retirement.

-3-

Directors agreed that monetary policy is well positioned to maintain low and stable inflation and
to respond to unexpected developments. They observed that the early but gradual strategy of
increasing interest rates since late 2003 appears to have preempted the emergence of excess
demand and helped cool the housing market. Directors also noted that, in response to easing
demand growth and slowing house price growth, interest rates have been held constant
recently, and appropriately so. With interest rates in a broadly neutral range and important but
balanced uncertainties in the outlook, Directors noted that the next move in interest rates could
be in either direction. They considered that the key challenges for monetary policy will be to
judge incipient resource constraints, and to respond promptly to unexpected changes in
aggregate demand in either direction.
Recognizing that the success of monetary policy stems in no small part from a strong policy and
institutional framework, Directors welcomed the increased emphasis on inflation projections
based on market expectations of future interest rates, and the extension of the projection
horizon from two to three years. Directors considered the suggestion that the Bank of England
publish numerical projections not just for real GDP and CPI but also for other key
macroeconomic variables. Many Directors expressed reservations, noting the considerable
costs this would involve. Directors also considered the pros and cons of publishing an
illustrative path for interest rates consistent with the inflation target. Many Directors considered
that this would be risky, as such forecasts could be misinterpreted as a policy commitment.
Directors agreed that the rules-based fiscal framework has served the United Kingdom well by
underpinning fiscal discipline and assuring scope for automatic stabilizers to operate freely.
They noted that the fiscal support provided to growth has contributed to a weakening in the
fiscal position over the past four years, but that, in the current cycle, the sizable initial current
and overall surpluses virtually ensure that the rules will be met, or will be missed by an
insignificant margin. Looking ahead to the next cycle, Directors took note of the authorities’ view
that slower spending growth and a rebound in revenues would reverse the past fiscal
weakening and ensure that the fiscal rules were respected, and welcomed their intention to take
remedial measures if the envisaged improvement did not materialize. However, many Directors
viewed the authorities’ projections, based on a substantial rise in revenues relative to GDP, to
be somewhat more optimistic than warranted. They considered that more realistic projections of
the level of potential output and of the scope for higher corporate tax revenues would point to a
need for fiscal adjustment if the United Kingdom were to continue to meet the fiscal rules.
On the appropriate policy response, Directors noted the authorities’ commitment to take
measures should they prove necessary. However, many Directors recommended that a mild
fiscal adjustment be started expeditiously, in the current favorable economic conditions, to allow
the consolidation to be spread over time.
Directors considered that fiscal adjustment measures should be designed to minimize any
adverse effects on efficiency, work effort, and growth. With this in view, they suggested restraint
in current spending, in order to reduce the risks of running into limits on absorptive capacity and
to allow more time to assess value for money. Several Directors also favored the wider
application of user fees as another good way of raising efficiency and revenue. Directors

-4concurred that, if more reliance on revenue measures were desired, broadening the tax base
would be preferable to raising tax rates, given potential adverse effects on supply.
Directors considered some suggestions on possible ways to modify the authorities’ fiscal
framework as the economic cycle comes to a close. First, Directors discussed the pros and
cons of publishing fiscal projections based on central (rather than cautious) assumptions, with
an explicit margin for adverse developments through the cycle or with a fan chart of fiscal
outcomes. Many Directors doubted whether a probabilistic approach to fiscal policy would
improve public understanding or confidence in the framework. Second, while recognizing that
fiscal projections already receive extensive scrutiny and that U.K. economic policy more
generally is subject to vibrant public debate, a few Directors saw merit in the suggestion that
consideration be given to broadening the scope of independent assessment of the fiscal
projections by the National Audit Office. Finally, Directors welcomed the recently established
efficiency targets at the departmental level. In this regard, they underlined the inherent
challenges in ensuring the efficiency of public spending, especially given the rapid increase in
recent years.
Directors noted that the challenges of population aging, although less severe than in most other
industrial countries, were moving to the forefront of public debate in the United Kingdom.
They welcomed the current debate about the government’s role in ensuring adequate retirement
income, including the Interim Report of the Pensions Commission, which provides strong
evidence that a sizable swathe of the middle-class is not saving enough to ensure retirement
income that will meet their aspirations. Directors acknowledged that addressing the problem of
under-saving raises difficult questions, and concurred that simplifying the now-complex pension
system and encouraging longer active participation in the work force make sense. Directors
stressed that, in general, the costs of motivating or forcing higher private saving must be
weighed against risks of future demands by pensioners on public resources.
Directors supported the authorities’ multi-pronged strategy for raising productivity. At the same
time, Directors emphasized the importance of systematic monitoring and evaluation of ongoing
programs, including through the recent introduction of specific performance indicators. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ intention to address structural rigidities in the housing market by
making further progress in implementing the recommendations of the Miles and Barker reviews.
Directors concurred that indicators of the health of the financial sector remain quite favorable.
Noting that capitalization, credit quality, and profitability in the banking sector continue to be
strong, Directors nevertheless cautioned that slower credit growth will likely dampen profitability
and that there are downside risks stemming from unsecured lending to households, lending
related to commercial property, and the ongoing search for yield. Directors welcomed the signs
of improved health of the life insurance sector over the past year, and the introduction of riskbased capital measures in insurance firms and of broker regulation in the non-life insurance
sector. They also noted the strengthening of the supervisory and institutional aspects of
payment and settlement systems. Finally, Directors welcomed the strengthening of the
Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime in line with
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations.

-5-

Directors praised the United Kingdom for its leadership role in promoting trade liberalization,
especially with respect to agricultural trade, and looked forward to further progress in this area.
They commended the United Kingdom’s commitment to increasing aid flows and welcomed the
increases in official development assistance, aimed at reaching the goal of 0.7 percent of GNI
by 2013.
