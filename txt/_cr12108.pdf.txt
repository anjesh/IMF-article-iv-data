STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: The economy is struggling to recover from a long recession, while
undergoing a fundamental adjustment of the country’s business model. Risks to the
outlook are mostly on the downside, as San Marino is facing serious economic and
financial headwinds, not least because of the permanent shock to output from the loss
of the tax haven business. Normalizing economic and financial relations with Italy will
be vital to facilitate a successful repositioning of the economy.
Financial Sector: The banking sector is shrinking, while facing rising vulnerabilities, due
to marked declines in liquidity, asset quality and profitability. Consequently, capital
buffers have eroded, necessitating recapitalization of the largest bank.
Fiscal Policy: A sizeable permanent decline in tax revenues, mostly related to the
downsizing of the financial sector, has weakened the fiscal position. Financing the fiscal
deficit is becoming increasingly challenging. A comprehensive medium-term fiscal
consolidation is needed to ensure debt sustainability.
Structural Issues: Restoring competitiveness and developing a platform for sustainable
growth is a long-term challenge. Recent reform efforts to reduce structural
impediments in product and labor markets are an important step, but more needs to
be done in these areas to further enhance the economy’s flexibility.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

MACROECONOMIC SETTING
A. Fundamental Challenges
1.
The Sammarinese economy is
undergoing a fundamental adjustment. For
years, the economy benefited from its tax
haven status. Banks were able to attract
substantial deposits from Italy and elsewhere,
helping to boost financial system assets to
around 950 percent of GDP in the pre-crisis
period. However, the global financial crisis has
had a far-reaching impact on the economy. In
addition to facing sharply reduced demand for
its exports, San Marino has been forced to
embrace greater transparency and rethink its
bank secrecy status. In particular, Italy’s 2009–
10 tax amnesty resulted in significant outflows
of bank deposits from San Marino, and Italy’s
inclusion of San Marino on a ‘blacklist’ of tax
haven countries in 2010 further strained
relations between the two countries and
hampered Sammarinese growth prospects.
2.
A protracted recession has led to a
permanent loss of output (Figure 1).
Between 2008 and 2011, the economy
contracted by about 22 percent, of which
around three-quarters is estimated to be
permanent, mainly due to a significant
compression of financial institutions’ balance
sheets as well as a sharp decline in the
manufacturing base. Banks have witnessed
large-scale non-resident deposit outflows,
while nonbank financial companies have lost
almost all their fiduciary business. At the same
time, manufacturing activity fell by 30 percent,
of which two-thirds could be permanent as a
number of Sammarinese firms that have

3.
The authorities have recognized the
need to adjust their economic model and
explore new sources of growth. There has
been broad support across the political
spectrum for efforts to enhance transparency
and comply with international standards, which
are viewed as critical for normalizing relations
with Italy. In particular, the authorities have
amended laws and regulations and stepped up
enforcement in response to critical reports by
MONEYVAL on money laundering and the
OECD on tax transparency. While developing
new sources of growth is a key long-term goal,
both the authorities and the private sector are
pinning their hopes on a speedy removal from
the Italian ‘blacklist’ to help turn the economy
around.

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

B. Recent Developments
4.
The economy remains very weak.
After four years of GDP contraction, largely
manifested in a sharp fall in exports and
investment, the economy remains fragile, with
recent activity indicators pointing to limited
signs of recovery. Rising unemployment,
stagnant wage growth, and lower confidence
have all contributed to falling private
consumption and low inflation. Meanwhile, the
financial sector is vulnerable, due to a sharp
deterioration in liquidity and profitability, the
unresolved recapitalization of the largest bank,
Cassa di Risparmio della Repubblica di San
Marino (CRSM), and recent difficulties at some
smaller banks.
5.
As of end-2011, activities in most
sectors are well below their pre-crisis levels,
with the exception of tourism (Figure 2).
The manufacturing sector, which is tightly
integrated with Italy’s production chains, now
faces weak demand prospects owing to the
euro area slowdown. The financial sector is
also adjusting, with the system continuing to
endure a compression of balance sheets driven
by a steady decline in deposits. Moreover,
construction activity remains markedly below
pre-crisis level, while companies in the
commercial and non-financial services sectors
continue to shut down businesses. In contrast,

tourism is the only sector where growth has
been robust, albeit its share of GDP is small.
6.
Employment continues to fall, with
rising unemployment and increasing claims
on the benefits provided by the wagesupplemental system (Figure 3). Following
strong employment growth during the precrisis period, employment has been on the
decline over the past three years. Meanwhile,
the unemployment rate has trended higher
from a low of around 2½ percent in mid-2008
to almost 7 percent recently. Claims on
benefits under the wage-supplemental system
remain elevated, mitigating a much higher
unemployment rate.

C. Outlook and Risks
7.
The recession is expected to linger
through 2012, with modest recovery over
the medium term, in line with output
developments in Italy. Under the baseline
scenario, staff projects that real GDP will
decline by 2 percent this year, mainly due to
weakening demand for exports and structural

difficulties in the financial sector, which is
struggling to adopt a new business model.
Moreover, investment activity and durable
consumption will likely be constrained by the
continued decline in private sector credit, as
banks face funding outflows and rising
nonperforming loans (NPLs). Given the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

subdued economic outlook for Italy, which
accounts for 90 percent of Sammarinese
exports (Figure 4), staff projects a very gradual
recovery in 2013 with growth hovering around
1½ percent over the medium term.
8.
Risks to the outlook are mostly on
the downside. San Marino is facing serious
economic and financial headwinds, not least
because of the permanent shock to output
from the loss of the tax haven business. Key
downside risks to the baseline outlook include
a deeper than expected recession in Italy and
rising strain in the financial sector. On the
upside, normalizing relations with Italy could
provide a boost to confidence. In particular,
the ratification of the double taxation treaty
with Italy, which is a precondition for the
implementation of key economic and financial

cooperation agreements between the two
countries, could promote cross-border activity.
9.
Uncertainty about Italy’s economic
and financial situation underscores the
potential for a protracted recession and
heightened stress in the financial sector.
Besides the trade channel, the banking system
exposure to Italy is substantial, at around
€1.4 billion, or close to 100 percent of San
Marino’s GDP. Under an adverse scenario,
which envisages worsening developments of
the euro area debt crisis, and larger than
expected output contraction in Italy
(3.5 percent vs. 1.9 percent under the
baseline), real GDP would decline by around 4
percent in 2012 (see Annex I for a Risk
Assessment Matrix).

previous episodes in which the funding
outflows were later reversed, Italian customers
are not returning, which may reflect a
realization that San Marino cannot sustain the
bank secrecy advantage that underpinned its
banking system for so long. In fact, bank
balance sheets continue to contract, primarily
driven by a steady decline in deposits (mostly

nonresident). More recently, five banks are
being merged or closed, in part through
actions of the central bank (CBSM) in response
to irregularities and weak financial position,
with the number of banks expected to decline
from twelve to seven this year. Separately, as
of end-2011, there was only one Sammarinese
bank that is part of a foreign banking group. 1
11.
Banks are increasingly vulnerable to
liquidity risks (Figure 6). In the past,
Sammarinese banks held a substantial amount
of liquid assets, mostly in the form of securities
issued by Italian banks, as the amount of
deposits they could raise far exceeded the
amount of loans they could extend locally.
However, the large deposit outflow triggered
by the tax amnesty caused liquidity to
deteriorate significantly, with the ratio of liquid
assets to short-term liabilities falling sharply.

pressure. Notwithstanding the progress made
by the CBSM to ensure adequate liquidity in
the banking system, including a facility to
share liquidity 2 and monitoring banks’ liquidity
position on a weekly basis, the CBSM does not
have the capacity to act as a lender of last
resort due to its inability to create money.
Meanwhile, Sammarinese banks do not have
access to the ECB window, leaving liquidity
pressures very difficult to manage. 3 A deposit
insurance scheme has recently been
established by the CBSM, with coverage of
€50,000 per account. CBSM’s attempt to
secure contingent credit lines with other
central banks has not been successful.
13.
Banks’ profitability and capital
weakened significantly, mainly due to
steadily rising NPLs (Figure 6). In the first
half of 2011, six banks registered losses
totaling €55 million (more than half
attributable to CRSM). NPLs, mainly
concentrated among corporates (e.g., the
construction sector), have doubled over the
past year, to almost 10½ percent of total
loans, and are expected to continue to
increase on the back of the very weak
economic outlook. As sizeable provisions for
potential loan losses are needed, banks’ profits
have been squeezed and banks’ capital has
eroded.

14.
The recapitalization of CRSM is a key
priority, which requires a balance sheet
restructuring and a sustainable business
model. CRSM has made substantial losses in
the past three years, largely as a result of its
decade-long involvement with the Italian Delta
group. The losses from the resolution of
Delta’s collapse will leave CRSM needing more
capital and with a balance sheet dominated by
Delta-related assets. The government is

contemplating participating in a proposed
€150 million recapitalization plan (see Box 1).
15.
Stress tests of Sammarinese banks
reveal that the banking system is highly
vulnerable to credit and liquidity risks, with
potential bank recapitalization needs being
substantial. Illustrative stress tests conducted
by staff based on bank-level data (as of June
2011) suggest that the banking system is
vulnerable to three key risks: (i) rising NPLs on
the back of continued economic weakness, (ii)
losses related to impaired assets associated
with European peripheral countries, and (iii)
potential funding outflows in the face of
banks’ relatively weak liquidity position. Even
under a reasonably benign scenario in which,
for example, NPLs increase only slightly from
present levels, the estimated bank
recapitalization needs is sizable (over 10
percent of GDP), mostly attributable to CRSM.
Under an adverse scenario, where external
conditions significantly deteriorate, systemwide recapitalization needs could be more
than twice as high.

B. Structural Issues for the Financial Sector
16.
Further progress has been made on
meeting the 2009 FSAP recommendations.
Over the past year, action has been taken to
clarify and strengthen the powers of the CBSM
to cooperate with foreign supervisors and
enable the latter to undertake onsite
supervisions of subsidiaries of banks for whose
consolidated supervision they would be
responsible. In addition, new regulations on
financial companies and tough enforcement
action are now in line with the FSAP
recommendations. The authorities are
committed to meeting EU Directives on bank

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

supervision as a consequence of signing the
monetary agreement with the EU in March
2012. However, further action is still
outstanding on some of the FSAP
recommendations, including with respect to
enhancing CBSM and Financial Intelligence
Agency (FIA) resources and inter-agency
cooperation (see Annex II).
17.
The authorities’ efforts to enhance
transparency have been recognized by
OECD and MONEYVAL. The authorities in the
past few years have introduced new

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. CRSM and the Recapitalization Plan
The resolution of Delta is almost complete and
has left CRSM in need of recapitalization and
with a balance sheet dominated by Delta-related
assets. As San Marino’s largest bank, with 35 percent
of the country’s deposits, CRSM became involved
with the Italian Delta group some ten years ago,
through an equity stake, loans and other complex
arrangements involving third parties. The Italian
authorities placed the Delta group under special
administration in 2009, initially because of AML
irregularities. Since then, special Commissioners
have been winding down the Delta group.
Agreement has been reached with most participants
but final resolution awaits a decision on an appeal
by certain creditors. The resolution, which involves
partial repayment to creditors and a substantial
reduction in Delta’s equity, will result in considerable
losses to CRSM, for which CRSM has been preparing
by making provisions. The final effect of the
resolution on CRSM is not clear and has been
subject to different estimates. However, it is clear
that the bank will need a capital injection and CRSM
has announced a €150 million recapitalization plan.
The government is considering participating in
the recapitalization, but the plan has not been
finalized. CRSM’s recapitalization plan seeks €20
million from its existing shareholders (Foundations),

regulations that improve economic and
financial transparency. The supplementary
report by OECD’s Global Forum on
Transparency and Exchange of Information
published in October 2011 (under Phase One
evaluation) indicated that San Marino has put
in place all necessary legal and regulatory
frameworks that were pointed out as
shortcomings in the previous report (January
2011), with a recommendation that San Marino
can be now reviewed under Phase Two
(effective implementation of the frameworks in
place). The MONEYVAL AML/CFT mutual
evaluation report of September 2011 also

€60 million from the government, and €70 million in
subordinated debt to be held by its customers. The
bank has indicated that it would wish to make a
subordinated debt offer to its retail customers.
However, such an offer would not normally be
regarded as appropriate for retail customers, even
with full disclosure of the risks, and hence should be
geared toward institutional investors.
Any government participation in the
recapitalization plan should be subject to clear
and strict conditionality. First, the existing
shareholders should subscribe new capital at the
level indicated. Second, CRSM should submit a
sustainable business plan which focuses on its
traditional business within San Marino and the
surrounding areas. The business plan should also
aim to reduce the size of the balance sheet and
hence the systemic risk posed by the bank. Third,
CRSM should prepare a contingency plan against
additional losses. Moreover, as supervisor, the CBSM
should insist that CRSM embarks on a credible plan
to unwind its exposure to Delta-related assets, so
that it meets the prudential requirements on
concentration risk.

pointed to significant progress, noting
however that deficiencies remain in some
areas, such as AML/CFT supervision and
customer due diligence. 4

understand well that the former business
model that led to a rapid expansion of the
financial sector on the basis of bank secrecy
and weak regulations is no longer viable.
Regulations at international standards, the
opening of channels of cooperation, and
action to respond to recommendations of
MONEYVAL with respect to AML/CFT and the
OECD in respect of transparency on tax

matters will inhibit a return to the old business
model. The building of a base of effectively
enforced regulations and the normalization of
relations with Italy are necessary conditions for
the financial sector to survive. However, they
are not sufficient. Given that the previous
business model is untenable, the financial
sector needs to find a new, alternative, more
sustainable competitive edge.5

C. Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities agreed with staff’s
assessment on the financial sector
vulnerabilities. In particular, they shared the
concern about rising liquidity pressures,
further increasing NPLs and the weak outlook
for bank profits. The authorities appreciated
staff’s bank stress tests results, and are
considering completing their own stress tests.
The authorities also shared the concern about
the limited tools available to the CBSM to
provide adequate liquidity support to the
banking system.
20.
The authorities are considering the
appropriate conditionality for government
participation in the recapitalization of
CRSM, but have emphasized that it is for the
bank’s management to determine the future
path. The authorities have accepted the need
to limit systemic risks from CRSM and to push

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

the bank towards developing a prudent
business plan. They pointed out that there is
no completely objective basis for determining
the likely scale of losses on Delta and hence
the scale of write-downs and the level of
capital that may be required. They agreed,
however, on the need for a contingency plan.
21.
The authorities consider that the
private sector should take the lead in
developing a new business model. The
authorities pointed to the action they have
taken in developing new laws and regulations
as a platform for the financial sector and in
taking steps towards normalizing relations
with Italy. They agreed that it is up to the
private sector to develop a new business
model and invest in the appropriate training
and capacity building.

FISCAL POLICY ISSUES

22.
The fiscal position has weakened,
mainly due to a sizeable decline in tax
revenues (Figure 7). Tax receipts, in real
terms, are estimated to have fallen by more
than 30 percent over the past four years,
largely due to the recession and lower
revenues from the financial sector. Over the

11/79).

same period, expenditures fell by half as much.
Consequently, fiscal surpluses have turned into
deficits. Staff projects a fiscal deficit of close to
3¼ percent of GDP this year, primarily on
account of lower revenue projections. In
addition, the structural deficit has been
widening in recent years and is expected to
remain at about 2 percent of GDP on average
over the medium term, pointing to sustained
deterioration of the fiscal position under
current policies.
23.
Financing the fiscal deficit is
becoming increasingly challenging. In 2010–
11, the government financed its deficits mainly
by drawing down its deposits at the central
bank, currently valued at around €150 million
(11 percent of GDP). However, over this period,
the government has also supported the
banking system (principally CRSM) with loan
guarantees currently equivalent to €90 million
(6 percent of GDP), effectively constraining any
additional drawdown on deposits. 6 Moreover,
the government has never issued debt
securities on capital markets. Under the
baseline scenario, gross government financing
requirements in 2012 are estimated at around
15 percent of GDP (if bank recapitalization is
included), but could rise to 29 percent of GDP
under an adverse scenario.

debt, at 18 percent of GDP, is primarily
composed of net accounts payable, amounting
to about €215 million (15 percent of GDP),

(see Annex III). Under the assumption that the
government would not draw further on its
deposits, government debt is expected to rise
to 21 percent of GDP in 2012.

B. Fiscal Consolidation Strategy
25.
The government has taken initial
steps to reduce the fiscal deficit. In its latest
budget, the government extended the
temporary surtax on income tax paid in the
previous year, introduced a special tax on
property, and imposed a minimum corporate
income tax applied to all companies. Together,
these measures are expected to yield
additional revenues of about 1 percent of GDP
this year. Expenditure is projected to remain
constant in real terms in 2012, though
expected to rise slightly as a percent of GDP,
while the public sector wage bill will be
contained by a freeze on nominal wages (in
place since 2011).

2017. 7 In addition, the parliament passed two
pension reform laws in 2011. The first law,
aimed at enhancing the sustainability of the
first pillar pension system, introduced
measures such as higher contribution rates
and lower replacement rates. The second law
established a second pillar system, with
compulsory participation and shared
contributions from employers and employees.
Finally, the public utilities company, in an effort
to reduce its operating losses, has been
increasingly active in the Italian energy
exchange. The authorities understand the need
to closely monitor these activities so as to
minimize the risks to public finances.

26.
The authorities are also in the
process of implementing structural fiscal
reforms. The government plans to introduce a
broader tax reform, aimed at improving the
equity and efficiency of the income tax system.
The current system is rather complex for a
small country, and the tax reform should
provide a welcome simplification by unifying
tax rates and cutting some tax allowances and
credits (see Annex IV). Public administration
reforms already underway encompass an
organizational restructuring and improved
control of public finances, including a
reduction in posts due to outsourcing of
activities and natural attrition. Staff’s estimates
suggest that the proposed tax and public
administration reforms together would yield
savings equal to about 1 percent of GDP by

27.
A more ambitious medium-term
consolidation strategy is needed. Given that
revenues are likely to be permanently
depressed by the financial sector downsizing,
contingent liabilities from the financial sector
are likely very high, and the government lacks
access to a diversified investor base, the
government needs to embark on more
ambitious durable reforms to secure an
effective medium-term consolidation strategy
and debt sustainability. On current policies,
government debt is projected to rise from 18
percent of GDP today to 28 percent of GDP by
2017. However, in the event that the

value-added tax (VAT), to replace the current tax on
imports.

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

government needs to issue debt for bank
recapitalization, debt could reach close to 40
percent of GDP, while spillover risks from rising
sovereign-bank linkages could be significant.
28.
Staff recommended permanent
consolidation measures of about 2½
percent of GDP, primarily on the revenue
side, starting in 2013 when the economy is
expected to emerge from recession. Given
that tax revenues, as a share of GDP, are very

low by international standards, the
consolidation plan should focus on increasing
tax revenues, primarily through reducing
income tax allowances and credits beyond
income tax allowances and credits beyond
current plans and broadening the application
of indirect taxes. For example, the authorities
should aim to increase the effective tax rate on
personal income, currently at a low 4½ percent
(or about one third the average EU level).
Moreover, expanding the tax base could
include extending and possibly raising the rate
of the current tax on domestically produced
services and the extension of the special tax on
property. Staff also sees scope to introduce
some expenditure-control measures, for
example, by further containing the growth in
the public sector wage bill. Altogether, these
permanent measures could yield savings of 2½
percent of GDP and help lower government
debt to around 16 percent of GDP over the
medium term (see Annex IV).

C. Authorities’ Views
29.
The authorities broadly shared the
staff’s assessment of the fiscal position.
They concurred with staff that various options
for financing the deficit need to be examined
as a matter of urgency, and noted that they
had made initial contact with an investment
bank and another ratings agency (in addition
to Fitch) to explore access to international
capital markets.

30.
The authorities also agreed on the
need for further consolidation. They remain
cognizant of the need for additional fiscal
tightening and are moving ahead with a
number of reforms to achieve savings. The
government welcomed staff’s
recommendations and is examining specific
measures with the social partners.

STRUCTURAL AND OTHER POLICY ISSUES
A. Product and Labor Markets
31.
Notwithstanding recent efforts to
reduce rigidities in product markets, further
reforms are needed to enhance the
economy’s competitiveness. The government
has taken steps toward liberalizing product
markets, but some bureaucratic processes are
cumbersome and barriers to entry in certain
non-tradable sectors remain. For example,
while there are no outright restrictions on
foreign ownership of property (albeit foreign
ownership of certain commercial activity is
restricted), an authorization is required.
Moreover, complicated regulations can
significantly deter foreign investors. Currently,
the government is considering a reform that
further streamlines the business licensing
process.
32.
The centralized employment system
has been relaxed, but various labor market
distortions remain and need to be further
eased. Although a recent government decree
enables firms to freely conduct a search for
candidates, obstacles to hiring highly skilled
nonresident workers linger. In addition,
regulations related to cutting redundancy and

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

the role the public sector plays as a major
employer hinder market-driven private sector
employment. Indeed, labor market practices
largely operate under a 1961 law, which
renders the regulatory framework outdated.
33.
Developing a basis for sustainable
growth is a long-term challenge. Since 2005,
San Marino has been losing its competitive
position vis-à-vis Italy, with increasing relative
unit labor costs (Figure 8). 8 The severe
recession has also led to a significant decline
in productivity on the back of a sharp output
contraction, most of which is permanent.
Furthermore, the future of both financial
services and manufacturing is highly uncertain,
given that the financial sector needs to find a
new business model and the manufacturing
sector faces weak demand prospects and
stiffer competition (Box 2).

8

See also “Assessing San Marino’s Competitiveness”
(IMF, Country Report No. 11/79).

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. In Pursuit of a New Growth Model
San Marino faces dim growth prospects. San
Marino’s potential GDP is estimated to have declined
in recent years by 16 percent, largely due to the
significant compression of the financial sector and
the sharp reduction in the manufacturing base.
Moreover, the financial sector will likely continue to
contract if new businesses that do not rely on bank
secrecy are not found. Meanwhile, the
manufacturing sector, which has lost its competitive
position in recent years, faces growing uncertainty
given weak demand prospects from Italy and stiffer
long-term competition from countries with lower
labor costs. As these two sectors account for slightly
more than half of San Marino’s GDP, securing
sustainable long-term growth in a new environment
of enhanced transparency is very challenging.
Limited action has been taken in the financial
sector towards adoption of a new business
model, as no new products and services have
been identified and developed, despite
regulatory reforms. Indeed, most banks are
focusing on providing local and regional traditional
banking services. One or two institutions are
developing niche products to sell to professional
Italian (and other foreign) investors. However, the
financial sector has not collectively determined on a
niche business that might constitute a new
Sammarinese brand. Instead, most of the remaining
seven banks are aiming to offer traditional banking

B.

services to retail and corporate customers in San
Marino and the surrounding regions. However, most
agree that the market is unlikely to sustain more
than a few Sammarinese banks offering such services
(which would be in competition with existing Italian
regional banks). Unless action is taken to find a
unique competitive edge, the prospect is for further
decline in the number and size of financial
institutions. This would mitigate contingent liability
risks to the government but would also reduce tax
revenues and employment opportunities.
Further structural reforms are essential for
achieving sustainable growth. Given diminished
growth prospects, greater attention is needed to
exploring avenues for sustainable growth. This may
involve promoting tourism and other selective
economic sectors where San Marino may have an
advantage. Moreover, given lingering structural
impediments to growth, additional reforms are
necessary to enable product and labor markets to
function more flexibly to meet new business needs.
In particular, measures to (i) promote foreign
investment that improves entrepreneurial knowhow, and (ii) reduce firms’ obstacles in hiring highly
skilled nonresident workers should be undertaken as
a priority to facilitate the economy’s adjustment to a
new growth model.

Statistical System

34.
The availability of macroeconomic
statistics is limited. Notwithstanding
important progress on compilation and
dissemination of monetary and financial sector
data, national account (NA) statistics and fiscal
data do not have the frequency and detail
required by international standards and are
only available with a considerable lag. In
addition, the authorities do not prepare
standard macroeconomic projections. A

September 2011 STA mission provided
technical assistance (TA) on NA statistics, but
further work is needed to fully revise the NA
data (see Annex V). A recent STA mission on
fiscal statistics helped identify and clarify
anomalies concerning government accounts
receivable and payable. Limited staff is a major
obstacle to improved macroeconomic
statistics.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

C. Authorities Views
35.
The authorities welcomed the staff’s
assessment of recent labor and product
market reforms, which they see as a signal
that they are moving in the right direction. At
the same time, they noted the need to balance
growth concerns with social ones and pointed
out that labor market rigidities in San Marino
are less severe than in other European
countries.
36.
On the growth model, the
authorities’ aim is to promote a diversified
economy while exploring niche sectors where

San Marino could have a competitive
advantage. They highlighted the planned
Science and Technology Park, a joint project
with Italy, as an example of this. However, they
stressed that removal from the Italian blacklist
is key to reviving manufacturing activity.
37.
On macroeconomic statistics, the
authorities stated that they are committed
to devoting additional human capital to this
area, and expressed interest in continued Fund
TA.

STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
The economic recession continues,
while uncertainty looms large. After four
years of GDP contraction, primarily driven by
external factors and largely manifested in a
sharp fall in investment and manufacturing
activity, the economy remains weak, with rising
unemployment and construction activity well
below its pre-crisis levels. Growing uncertainty
about the external environment and the future
role of the Sammarinese financial sector
underscore the potential for a protracted
recession and increasing vulnerability of the
financial system. In this context, normalizing
relations with Italy will be vital to facilitate a
sustainable recovery and successful
repositioning of the economy.
39.
The financial sector is vulnerable,
due to marked declines in liquidity, asset
quality and profitability. The banking system
was able to withstand the large deposit
outflow during 2009-10, largely because of the
previous substantial holdings of, mainly
foreign, liquid assets. Since then, banks’

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

balance sheets have continued to decline on
the back of steady deposit outflows,
contributing to the deterioration of liquidity.
As a consequence of the prolonged recession,
NPLs have doubled over the past year and
bank profits have turned into losses, putting
pressure on capital buffers.
40.
The recapitalization of CRSM is a
priority, which requires a balance sheet
restructuring and a sustainable business
model. CRSM has made substantial losses in
recent years. The authorities are rightly
insisting that CRSM should raise new capital
and restructure its balance sheet. The
government should make participation in the
recapitalization strictly conditional on the
existing shareholders meeting their
commitment to add new capital and on the
bank adopting a sustainable and sound
business plan. Given its systemic risks, CRSM
should develop a contingency plan for future
losses, ensure its compliance with prudential
norms, and build a sustainable business model.

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

41.
The authorities continue to make
progress on meeting the FSAP
recommendations. Further measures have
been taken to strengthen the supervisory
functions and independence of the CBSM and
lower barriers to international regulatory
cooperation. Remaining FSAP
recommendations, particularly on CBSM and
FIA resources, and inter-agency cooperation
should be further considered. Progress on
broader transparency initiatives has been
recognized by both the OECD and MONEYVAL,
and early action should be taken to address
remaining recommendations, with particular
attention on implementing the regulatory
frameworks already in place. Indeed, creating a
track record of effective implementation of
measures and international cooperation is
important to further rebuilding of confidence.
42.
The financial sector should adapt to
the new domestic and international
environment in which it operates. In
practice, international pressure and tougher
new domestic regulation have already reduced
the size of banks’ balance sheets. Some in the
private sector are looking creatively for niche
products to sell on the international market,
but most are seeking to provide traditional
banking services to San Marino and the
surrounding regions. Practical action needs to
be taken by the financial sector to identify a
competitive advantage, if it exists, and to
prepare for a smaller financial sector, if it does
not.
43.
Measures taken to contain the fiscal
deficit are important, but the consolidation
strategy needs to be strengthened. In
particular, a comprehensive medium-term
consolidation plan, largely focused on
permanent measures to increase the revenue
base, is needed. At the same time, the

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

authorities should develop a plan for deficit
financing, including by seeking to issue debt
instruments on capital markets. In addition,
while the passage of fiscal reforms is a step in
the right direction, implementation is key. In
particular, the authorities should implement
the public administration reform so as to
further contain the growth in the public sector
wage bill.
44.
Restoring competitiveness and
developing a sustainable growth model is a
long-term challenge. Structural impediments
to growth need to be eased. In particular,
alleviating rigidities in product and labor
markets, including by promoting foreign
investment and relaxing obstacles in hiring
highly skilled nonresident workers, will be vital
to boost competitiveness and create the basis
for new viable businesses. It is also imperative
that the government and the private sector
explore avenues for sustainable growth.
45.
Meeting international standards on
macroeconomic statistics is vital. The lack of
balance of payments (BoP) data hampers a
fuller analysis of macroeconomic linkages. The
availability of reliable statistics on current
economic conditions and transparent
government accounts is crucial to designing
appropriate economic policies and preparing
realistic budgets, and will support San Marino’s
increased engagement with the international
business and financial community. San
Marino’s ability to absorb TA in this area is
inhibited by insufficient personnel. Hence, the
authorities need to devote additional
resources to meet international standards for
national accounts and government finance
statistics.
46.
It is recommended that the next Article
IV consultation with San Marino be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ANNEX I. RISK ASSESSMENT MATRIX1
Overall Level of Concern
Nature/Source of
Main Threats

1. Intensification of
the euro area debt
crisis and global
double-dip
recession

Likelihood of Severe Realization of
Threat in the Next 1-3 Years
(high, medium, or low)
Medium
The euro area debt crisis remains a key
global risk, and its intensification could
worsen economic and financial
developments in Italy.

Expected Impact if Threat is Realized
(high, medium, or low)
Medium
In 2012, San Marino's real GDP
contraction could worsen to 4.2 percent.
Significant erosion in bank capital is likely
on the back of rapidly rising NPLs and
sharply worsening quality of assets with
exposure to Italy.
Budget deficits will be larger, with limited
financing options.

2. Heightened stress
in a systemically
important financial
institution

3. Continuing
strained relations
with Italy

4. Failure to adopt a
new growth model

Medium
CRSM needs to be recapitalized following
substantial losses associated with its
investment in the Delta group. The bank
could become under-capitalized if losses
are larger than expected or the existing
recapitalization plan fails.

High
CRSM is a systemic institution and affects
confidence in the banking system as a
whole.

Low
Although the Italian government recently
signaled its willingness to reengage, the
time frame for ratifying of the double tax
treaty, a key prerequisite for
implementing cooperation agreements
and normalizing relations, remains
unclear.

Medium
Much of the impact of the strained
relations has been felt. San Marino's
growth prospects will be further
hampered.

Medium
Potential GDP is estimated to have
contracted by 16 percent in recent years,
primarily due to the significant
compression of financial institutions’
balance sheets as well as a sharp decline
in the manufacturing base.

Medium
San Marino's long-term growth prospects
will be significantly dimmer.

Government financing is challenging,
especially if the government needs to
provide support to the financial sector, as
it has no experience in accessing capital
markets.

The lack of cooperation agreements also
undermines the ability of the economy to
adapt towards a new growth model.

The fiscal position will be weaker as tax
revenues will be permanently lower.

There is no clear progress made by the
financial sector to adopt a new business
model, while the manufacturing sector will
face stiffer competition from countries
with lower labor costs.

ANNEX II. ACTIONS TAKEN TO MEET THE FSAP RECOMMANDATIONS 1
Recommendation

Actions Taken

Secure contingent emergency lines of
credit with other central banks.

As yet no other central bank has agreed to provide such credit.

Recapitalize banks that do not meet
prudential requirements.

Four banks were below capital requirements in June 2011. Three were placed in
special administration for various reasons and then either forced to close or be
acquired by other banks. One of the four has been recapitalized and has itself
acquired another bank.

Strengthen supervision, particularly full
on-site inspections.

Total staff in supervision department of CBSM were 29 in February 2012, with
three further staff approved by management. Staff resources would be
adequate for supervision of the banks and (much reduced) fiduciary and finance
companies) except for the diversion of CBSM supervision resources to
undertake investigations for the judicial authority (80 percent of supervision staff
were required for this purpose in the first two months of 2012).
Recruitment of staff from outside San Marino continues to be constrained by the
labor law and Labor Office, although labor market reform should ease the
problem.
Total number of inspections remained constant (24) but more focus was placed
on banks.
The closure of banks and financial companies was due in part to regulatory
breaches discovered through on site supervision.

1

Facilitate cross-border flows of
information and allow foreign supervisors
to make on-site visits to foreign banks in
San Marino.

Further amendments made to Article 36 of Law 165 to clarify that subsidiaries
may pass information to parent banks for risk management by bank parent.
Article 36 also amended to allow on-site inspections by foreign supervisors
where an agreement exists between the CBSM and the foreign supervisor.

Ensure that financial institutions,
particularly fiduciary firms, are properly
and effectively implementing the
customer due diligence (CDD)
requirements.

On-site inspections by CBSM concerning AML/CFT issues increased from four in
2009 to 13 in 2010. Ten inspections were conducted in 2011, despite the
reduced number of companies.

Introduce a new governance model for
the CBSM.

Some changes made to Governance:
• CBSM Governing Council (GC) given greater responsibility for actions of CBSM;
• Role of State Congress in special administration removed;
• Unanimous vote of GC now required to remove Director General;
• Role of State Congress and Committee for Savings and Credit removed from
appointment of GC and members of parliament may now nominate candidates
for approval by the parliament;
• Additional list of positions incompatible with membership of GC.
However:
• No change to State Congress ability to refuse a license approved by CBSM
and no criteria exist for such decisions;
• Law does not specify limited grounds for dismissal of DG;
• No change in transparency of appointment procedure of GC members.

Recommendation

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Actions Taken

Introduce prudential measures that
contain banks’ liquidity risks (such as
minimum liquidity ratios with the CBSM).

Reserve requirement of 8 percent of total deposits, waived for banks that
provide liquidity to other banks.
Voluntary scheme for depositing excess liquidity with CBSM.
New Decree-Law enacted to permit CBSM to act as lender of last resort.

Upgrade financial regulation, preferably
in line with the EU framework.

Prudential rules for finance and fiduciary companies have been introduced in
line with those for banks (and their enforcement has prompted many firms to
exit the business). The monetary agreement with the EU, signed in March 2012,
commits the CBSM to bringing supervision into line with EU directives within six
years.

Take all possible steps to accelerate the
transition period to full compliance with
the regulations on loan concentration.

No change to transitional measures. However, four of the banks with weak
capital have been closed or merged and the transitional measures will, in any
case, end by January 2014.

Increase staff of the Financial Intelligence
Agency (FIA), the CBSM supervision units
and the Judiciary responsible for
AML/CFT.

In April 2010, FIA requested increased staff. The request was partially granted
but only in 2012.

Introduce measures to facilitate selfinsurance among banks.

See description of liquidity measures above. Some banks have secured lines of
credit with foreign banks

Finalize supervision manuals.

On-site supervision manual finalized. Off-site supervision manual is being
prepared. Risk assessment of liquidity and capital risk is formalized in a weekly
and quarterly review process.

Seek to obtain access to the EU payment
system, and ECB refinancing facilities.

Access sought but not yet achieved.

Undertake reform of fiduciary companies
in order to strengthen transparency in
corporate ownership and clarify the
scope of activities in which these
companies can engage.

Bearer shares prohibited, corporate liability of legal persons has been
introduced.
Regulation of fiduciary companies, in line with prudential regulations for banks
was introduced in 2011.
Number of financial companies decreased from 59 in 2008 to 25 in 2012. Assets
under management by fiduciary companies reduced from €3.3 billion in June
2009 to €790 million in June 2011.

Enhance collaboration between the FIA
and the CBSM in the area of financial
sector AML/CFT supervision.

Some increased coordination between FIA and CBSM:
• Agreed risk assessment undertaken of institutions in respect of AML/CFT;
• Exchange of information on all AML/CFT matters found in inspections,
including reporting findings during inspections;
• Review meetings held to reassess risk of institutions.
However, joint inspections remain rare.

Reconsider some of the FIA's non-core
financial intelligence unit’s (FIU)
responsibilities (such as the power to act
as judicial police on delegation from the
judicial authority) in the light of the FIA's
limited human resources.

No change to responsibilities.

1.
San Marino’s government debt level
has risen significantly over the last year,
primarily due to the reclassification of net
accounts payable (NAP) as debt (Figure
IV.1). 1Over the years, due to the lack of
access to capital markets, the government has
borrowed largely in the form of secured loans
primarily from domestic banks. These loans
amounted to 3½ percent of GDP at end-2011. 2
At the same time, the government has
accumulated substantial accounts receivable
(AR) and accounts payable (AP), with the
amount of the NAP totaling 14½ percent of
GDP. Staff, with the help of an STA expert who
joined the Article IV mission, considers that the
NAP should be classified as part of
government debt. Hence, the debt level was
revalued at 18 percent of GDP at end-2011.
2.
The stocks of both AR and AP are
substantial. At end-2010, the level of AR was
around 35 percent of GDP, while the level of
AP was 49½ percent of GDP. The AP mainly
consist of tax refunds (47 percent of total AP),
transfers to other public entities (26 percent),
and provisions made against potentially
uncollectable AR (18 percent), while deferred
payments to suppliers are relatively small (up
to 10 percent). Meanwhile, tax receipts account
for 85 percent of AR. In particular, the import
tax system is the main source of AR and AP,

de Lucio.

Relative to GDP, the level of these loans is lower
than that in the previous staff report, mainly due to an
upward revision of nominal GDP. Changes in the
nominal value of these loans only resulted from a
small amortization.

accounting for about 65 percent of AR and AP
during 2004–10, mainly because net import tax
payments are usually settled with very long
lags.
3.
Both AR and AP were subject to
adjustment by staff, so as to properly
account for government’s liabilities.
Outstanding AP and AR are composed of both
newly accrued as well as carry-over items.
While AR and AP tend to be short-term items
(i.e. being cleared within few months), in San
Marino a large portion of carry-over items
have been neither collected nor paid. During
the 2002-10 period, carry-over items from
previous years accounted for 28 percent of AR,
and 40 percent of AP. Some of these have
stayed on the accounts for more than ten
years. This feature partly results from the
authorities’ practice that uncollectable AR are
not written off until a judiciary process is
finalized, although provisions have been made
fully against them. The provisions against
theses uncollectable AR are included in AP.
Hence, the official figures of AR and AP are
somewhat overstated and staff had to adjust
them to properly account for the new debt
level.
4.
Debt sustainability analysis points to
an upward trend in the debt over the
medium term (Figure IV.2). Government
debt has been on an upward trajectory in
recent years, largely due to an increase in NAP.
Government debt is projected to rise from 18
percent of GDP in 2011 to 28 percent of GDP
in 2017, as the budget is expected to remain in
deficits over the medium term. The baseline
scenario is constructed on the following
assumptions: (i) a slow increase in tax revenues
on the back of the weak economic outlook

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

over the medium term; (ii) an increase in real
expenditure of about 0.3 percent annually on
average after 2013 to reflect the government’s
attempt to control expenditure; (iii) no
financing in the form of accumulation in NAP
and withdrawal of deposits from 2012; and (iv)
no government participation in bank
recapitalization. The debt dynamics appears to
be most sensitive to a shock to the assumed
fiscal adjustment effort and the contingent
liability shock, but are less sensitive to an
interest rate shock.
5.
Potential needs to recapitalize banks
could push the level of government debt
significantly higher in the medium term.
Government debt could reach 40 percent of
GDP by 2017 in the event that the government
needs to partake in bank recapitalization, with
100 percent of bank recapitalization (indicated
by stress tests) being financed by the
government (net of €20 million committed by
CRSM’s existing shareholders). Under an
adverse scenario, government debt could
reach 59 percent of GDP. 3

ANNEX IV. A FISCAL CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY1
1.
In the absence of fiscal
consolidation, San Marino is projected to
run large deficits over the medium term.
There has been a marked drop in revenues
since the onset of the recession, and some of
this decline is expected to be permanent,
notably with respect to revenues from the
financial sector (estimated at about 2 percent
of GDP). Government debt, while still low, is on
an upward trajectory and, on announced
policies, is projected to reach 28 percent of
GDP by 2017. Moreover, large contingent
liabilities from the banking sector and
uncertain prospects for financing the deficit
are important concerns. The past two budgets
have made use of ad hoc, temporary measures
to cover revenue shortfalls. A more
comprehensive medium-term strategy,
however, would lend credibility to public
finances and provide greater predictability to
the economic environment. This note discusses
possible options for a fiscal consolidation
strategy, and provides information on the
authorities’ planned fiscal reforms.

2.
The tax system is in need of reform.
San Marino has historically been a low tax
jurisdiction and has relied on this aspect to
maintain a competitive advantage over
surrounding Italian regions. Tax revenues as a
percentage of GDP are very low by
international standards. Moreover, San
Marino’s income tax system is relatively
complex for a small country. For example, the
taxation of natural persons is different for
employees, self-employed workers, and sole
proprietors. Employees may file jointly with
their spouses or separately, and there is an
extensive range of tax allowances and credits. 2
This means that, although marginal tax rates
range from 12 percent to 50 percent, the
effective tax rate on personal income is much
lower than in comparator countries, at around

The system of tax allowances and credits tends to
benefit higher income earners in particular, since the
most significant of these are calculated as a
percentage of gross income. The system has also
created controversy due to certain tax credits being
available only to Sammarinese workers and not to the
6,000 or so cross-border workers who live in Italy but
work in San Marino.

4½ percent of gross income, or one-third of
the average for EU countries. Tax revenues
from individuals’ income amounts to 2½
percent of GDP, versus an average of 9 to 11
percent for advanced countries. 3
3.
There is no explicit consumption tax
in San Marino. Most goods consumed in San
Marino are imported, and therefore subject to
the monofase tax, currently set at 17 percent.
Domestically produced goods and services, as
well as some imported services, escape
taxation. A 3 percent sales tax on certain
domestically produced services, such as hotel
services, was recently introduced. An informal
agreement with Italy stipulates that there
should be no more than 5 percentage points
difference between the monofase rate and the
Italian VAT rate.
4.
The public administration sector is
large relative to the size the economy. The
public administration employs 11 percent of
workers, compared with an average of 7½
percent for EU countries. Public administration
employment is also higher than in other small
European economies, such as Malta, Iceland
and Cyprus. Moreover, the average wage is
higher in the public sector relative to the
private sector. Indications are, therefore, that
there is some scope to reduce the public
sector wage bill, which would also reduce the
public sector’s dominant position in the labor
market.

Staff’s proposals
5.
Permanent consolidation measures
of about 2½ percent of GDP should begin
in 2013 and focus on revenue measures
(Figure V.1). Staff suggests beginning with a
3

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

comprehensive consolidation strategy in 2013,
when the economy is likely to emerge from
recession. Given the low tax revenue to GDP
ratio, staff sees greater potential in focusing
measures on the revenue side rather than the
expenditure side, which is more in line with
European averages. Moreover, the fiscal
multiplier is relatively low in San Marino, given
the high marginal propensity to import. A low
fiscal multiplier implies that higher tax revenue
collection should not have a significant impact
on GDP, since a relatively small proportion of
the reduction in disposable income would
have been spent on domestically produced
goods and services.

Increasing the Revenue Base
6.
Staff sees two areas in particular
where revenue gains could be easily
realized. These are (i) raising the effective tax
rate on personal income of employees, selfemployed workers and sole proprietors and (ii)
increasing indirect tax revenues. Staff has
calculated that an increase in the effective rate
of personal income tax (PIT) from 4½ percent
to 9 percent combined with an increase of
around 10 percent in indirect tax revenues
could form the backbone of a prudent
consolidation strategy.
7.
Raising the effective rate of PIT
could be achieved through reducing tax
allowances and credits. The relatively small
suggested increase in the effective rate would
yield additional revenue on the order of 1½
percent of GDP annually. Such an increase
could easily be achieved without raising
marginal tax rates. In fact, a reduction in tax
allowances and credits could possibly be
combined with a lowering of the top marginal
rates, as the authorities envisage in their
proposed tax reform.

REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO

8.
There are several ways in which an
increase in indirect tax revenues could be
achieved. As noted above, the monofase is
not applied to all goods and services
consumed domestically and so broadening the
tax base could yield higher revenues. Options
could include extending and possibly raising
the rate of the current tax on domestically
produced services, and the extension of the
special tax on property. Alternatively, the
monofase rate could be increased. In fact, if the
Italian VAT rate is raised later in 2012 to 23
percent, as has been suggested, San Marino
will need to increase its monofase rate to 18
percent to maintain the 5 percent differential.
An increase in the monofase rate to 19 percent
would mostly cover the suggested 10 percent
increase in indirect tax revenues.
9.
The authorities’ proposed tax
reform goes in the right direction. A reform
strategy for the income tax system is currently
under consideration by Parliament. The
authorities’ proposals rightly focus on
reforming the PIT system. The reform proposes
reducing tax allowances and credits, and
introducing a new system of tax credits aimed
at incentivizing the purchase of goods and
services produced in San Marino. Moreover,
the tax reform unifies rates for various groups
and flattens the rate structure for PIT. This is
expected to enhance the transparency of the
system and encourage compliance. Corporate
taxation will remain largely unchanged, except
for the introduction of some incentives for
large employers. The tax reform also proposes
to tax dividends, capital gains, and foreign
income for the first time.
10.
Staff’s preliminary assessment of the
PIT reform suggests savings of around
0.8 percent of GDP. This is lower than the 1½
percent of GDP savings in staff’s proposed

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

consolidation strategy, and would result in an
increase in the effective rate of taxation for
individuals to 6 percent of gross income. This
is still low by international standards and, in
staff’s view, the authorities could aim for a
higher rate, perhaps through a less drastic
reduction in marginal tax rates or through a
further reduction in tax allowances and credits.
In particular, it is not clear that the new tax
allowance system is the best way to encourage
domestic consumption, since it implies high
administrative costs, as the Tax Office will have
to process and verify a large number of
invoices.
11.
The authorities have also been
considering the introduction of a VAT to
replace the monofase. A feasibility study is
scheduled to be discussed in Parliament in the
coming months. In staff’s view, however, the
authorities’ fiscal consolidation strategy should
not rely on the proposed VAT to raise
additional revenues. While a VAT will broaden
the tax base, it may not necessarily raise more
revenues than the monofase. Much will depend
on the rate applied, whether there are

exemptions, and the extent of taxpayer
compliance. Staff’s preliminary calculations,
using the average C-effciency ratio 4 for highincome countries and applying a rate of 17
percent, suggest that the VAT will yield slightly
less revenues than the monofase. This
highlights the importance of implementing a
broad-based VAT with few exemptions, and
the need for adequate administrative capacity
in the Tax Office. A further reason for not
relying on the VAT to meet current
consolidation needs is that the VAT system will
take time to implement fully, and revenues
may be lower than expected initially.

Containing Expenditure Growth
12.
Efforts to contain the public sector
wage bill should continue. A wage freeze
and 10 percent reduction in compensation are
in effect in 2011-12. Over the long term, the
authorities aim to better align public and
private sector wages, by reducing new public
sector employees’ salaries by 10 percent.

A public administration reform
should yield important savings over the
medium term. Various laws approving a
reorganization of the public administration
have been passed by Parliament in recent
years, although most have yet to be
implemented. Savings are expected to be
realized from a downsizing of the public
administration through natural attrition—a
4 percent reduction in public administration
employment is planned over three years. The
government does not expect this to have a
significant impact on service provision.
Furthermore, the government intends to
outsource a number of activities, which should
result in a further reduction in the size of the
public sector.
14.
In conclusion, the authorities’
reform plans go in the right direction but
implementation will be key. Thus far, reforms
have focused mainly on the expenditure side,
with revenue measures being of the ad hoc
variety. Staff welcomes the authorities’ tax
reform, although more could be done to raise
the effective rate of PIT. The authorities also
need to explore ways of raising indirect tax
revenues, beyond the introduction of a VAT.
Finally, the full and timely implementation of
the public administration reforms is
encouraged, including efforts to contain the
growth of the public sector wage bill.

September 2011 STA mission found that the

change in real GDP of the new statistics
during 2008–10 is broadly in line with that of
the old statistics. In addition, the mission
pointed out a key challenge for implementing

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 27, 2012)
Data Provision
Progress has been made since San Marino’s
participation in the IMF’s General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) on May 16, 2008
but important weaknesses in the statistical
database remain mainly due to resource
constraints. In January 2007, in view of their
intention to participate in the GDDS, the
authorities named two national GDDS
coordinators and announced their objective to
increase the frequency of website updates in
order to improve data dissemination. As of
March 2012, national and fiscal accounts, as
well as monetary and financial sector data are
compiled according to international standards
but some key statistics (such as real and fiscal
data) are available only with delay and, in
many cases, are at a lower than standard
frequency and detail.
Real Sector Statistics
National accounts data for 1995 onward have
been calculated in accordance with ESA95 and
data are compiled annually based on the
income approach with about ten months
delay. The authorities have also calculated
sectoral contribution. However, as part of
ongoing STA technical assistance on national
accounts statistics, the production and
expenditure approaches are adopted instead.
Consumer prices and employment data are
available monthly with short delay. An
industrial production index based on electricity
consumption, launched in 2000, became
available monthly in 2009. Consumption and
business sentiment indexes have been
compiled starting 2007 based on annual
household and business surveys.

Government Finance Statistics
The authorities have provided data for the
central government, state owned enterprises,
and social security fund for 2004-11, as well as
the budget for 2012-14. However, the data
have not been compiled in accordance with
IMF standards. The central government budget
is still written so as to close at par, which
implies that standard financing items, such as
amortization, are included as expenditures
while “borrowing requirement” is included
among the revenues.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Since 1997, the authorities have provided
balance sheet data on the commercial banks
and the monetary authorities to STA database.
These data are provided on a quarterly basis,
with approximately a six-week reporting lag.
The authorities have introduced laws and took
some measures to improve coverage and
timeliness of banks’ reporting. The CBSM has
improved sectorization and expanded data
collection to cover the offshore asset
management activities of banks. The
breakdown of deposits (and other assets and
liabilities) between residents and nonresidents
and the breakdown of short-term credit by
public and private sector components are also
available. However, there is no broad money
survey. Data on non-bank financial
intermediaries are also lacking.
External Sector Statistics
San Marino does not compile balance of
payments accounts. Given the currency union
with Italy and the subsequent introduction of
the euro, the authorities have not considered
this a high priority and have, therefore, not
committed the necessary resources. Starting
2008, trade statistics are released quarterly
with a lag of about six months.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of San Marino
On April 27, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of San Marino. 1
Background
After four years of GDP contraction, largely manifested in a sharp fall in exports and
investment, the economy remains fragile, with recent activity indicators pointing to limited
signs of recovery. Rising unemployment, stagnant wage growth, and lower confidence have
all contributed to falling private consumption and low inflation. Real GDP is estimated to
have declined by 2.6 percent in 2011. The recession is expected to linger this year, in line
with output developments in Italy, which accounts for 90 percent of Sammarinese exports.
Financial sector balance sheets continued to compress on the back of steady outflows of
deposits, while banks’ profitability and capital have weakened significantly, mainly due to
rising nonperforming loans. The planned recapitalization of the largest bank, Cassa di
Risparmio della Repubblica di San Marino (CRSM) remained elusive, but has gained
traction in recent months. Further progress has been made on meeting the Financial Sector
Assessment Program’s (FSAP) recommendations, including strengthening the supervisory
functions and independence of the central bank and lowering barriers to international

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

regulatory cooperation, as well as on broader transparency initiatives. The development of a
sustainable business model for the financial sector remains a long-term challenge.
The fiscal position has weakened, mainly due to a sizeable decline in tax revenues. Tax
receipts, in real terms, are estimated to have fallen by more than 15 percent over the past
two years, largely due to the recession and lower revenues from the financial sector. The
fiscal deficit is estimated to have widened from about 2 percent of GDP in 2010 to around
3 percent of GDP in 2011.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors considered that growing uncertainty about the external environment and
the future role of the Sammarinese financial sector weigh on the near-term outlook, raising
the risk of a protracted recession and greater financial sector vulnerability. In this context,
normalizing relations with Italy and pursuing the unfinished reform agenda would facilitate
fundamental structural changes and strengthen medium-term prospects.
Directors noted the marked declines in financial sector liquidity, asset quality, and
profitability. In particular, they urged a prompt recapitalization of the largest bank, with
government involvement conditional on a new business model and the participation of
existing shareholders. More broadly, Directors underlined that the financial sector needs to
adapt to the changed domestic and international environment, including by searching for
new areas of competitive advantage.
Directors acknowledged the continued progress made on the recommendations of the 2009
FSAP, particularly in strengthening the central bank’s supervisory functions and
independence, but considered that more remains to be done. They also commended the
steps taken on broader transparency initiatives and looked forward to early action to
address remaining deficiencies in the regime to combat money laundering and the financing
of terrorism.
Directors welcomed the measures taken to contain the 2012 budget deficit but called for a
comprehensive medium-term consolidation plan, given growing fiscal risks. They agreed
that permanent measures to increase the revenue base should be the focus of such a plan,
with additional savings arising from further public administration reform. Directors also
stressed the need for a deficit financing plan, which could involve issuing debt instruments
on capital markets.
Directors underscored the importance of restoring competitiveness and developing a
sustainable growth model. They agreed that structural impediments to growth need to be
eased, including by promoting foreign investment and relaxing obstacles in hiring skilled
nonresident workers.

3
Directors reiterated their concerns about shortcomings in economic statistics which hamper
policy design and evaluation. In particular, they encouraged the authorities to produce
balance of payments data and devote additional resources to meeting international
standards for national accounts and government finance statistics.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for the Republic of San Marino
and Francesco Spadafora, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
April 27, 2012
The Sammarinese economy is undergoing a fundamental adjustment in the face of the
global financial crisis as well as of the global quest for strict compliance with
international transparency standards. Between 2008 and 2011, the economy contracted by
over 20 percent, mainly due to a significant compression of financial institutions’ balance
sheets as well as a sharp fall in exports and investment; the manufacturing base declined
by 30 percent. The unemployment rate has trended higher from a low of around 2½
percent in mid-2008 to almost 7 percent recently, with increasing claims on the benefits
provided by the wage-supplemental system.
The recession is expected to linger through 2012. Under the baseline scenario, staff
projects that real GDP will decline by 2 percent this year. Given expected output
developments in Italy, which accounts for 90 percent of Sammarinese exports, staff
projects a very gradual recovery in 2013, with growth hovering around 1½ percent over
the medium term. Key downside risks to the baseline outlook include a deeper-thanexpected recession in Italy and rising strain in the financial sector.
Facing serious economic and financial headwinds and structural challenges, the
authorities have recognized the need to adjust their economic model and to explore new
sources of growth. There has been broad support across the political spectrum for efforts
to enhance transparency and comply with international standards, which are viewed as
critical for normalizing relations with Italy. In particular, the authorities have amended
laws and regulations, and stepped up enforcement to comply with MONEYVAL
standards on money laundering and OECD standards on tax transparency. While
developing new sources of growth is a key long-term goal, both the authorities and the
private sector are hoping for a normalization of relations with Italy to help turn the
economy around.
Financial Sector
The Sammarinese authorities concur with the staff’s views on the risks to, and
vulnerabilities of, the financial sector. As far as the recapitalization plan for the Cassa di
Risparmio della Repubblica di San Marino (CRSM) is concerned, the authorities are
considering participating in it. They are also working on the appropriate conditionality
for their participation with a view to limiting systemic risk from CSRM, while pushing
the bank toward developing a prudent business plan. At the same time, they stressed that,
at the current stage, there is no completely objective basis to identifying the possible
scale of write-downs and the attendant recapitalization needs. In this respect, they concur
with staff on the need for a contingency plan.
Progresses have been made in implementing the 2009 FSAP recommendations, with
particular regard to clarifying and strengthening the powers of the Central Bank of San
Marino (CBSM) to cooperate with foreign supervisors. New regulations on financial

companies and the attendant enforcement actions are now in line with the FSAP
recommendations. A monetary agreement with the European Union was signed off on
last March, and the authorities are committed to meeting the EU directive on banking
supervision.
As a result of the efforts toward enhancing transparency, both the OECD’s Global Forum
on Transparency and Exchange of Information of October 2011, and the MONEYVAL
AML/CFT mutual evaluation report of September 2011 pointed out the progresses
achieved.
On the structural issues of the financial sector, the Sammarinese authorities are cognizant
that the main characteristics of the former bank business model are no longer viable.
They stress that many measures have been and are being implemented in order to align
banking regulations to international standards, while enhancing cooperation on crossborder bank supervision, strengthening the AML/CFT framework, and reinforcing
transparency on tax matters. At the same time, they believe that such measures can only
set the stage for the financial sector to resume growth, but it is the private sector that
needs to develop a new business model capable of matching the new regulatory and
supervisory environment, by investing in the appropriate training and capacity building.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities acknowledge the challenges associated with the deteriorated fiscal
position and are determined to consolidate public finances. In the last fiscal budget, a
number of consolidation measures have been introduced, including tax increases
expected to yield additional revenues of about 1 percent of GDP in 2012. On the
expenditure side, the freeze on public sector nominal wages, introduced in 2011, will
remain in place this year.
The authorities also intend to make progress with structural fiscal reforms. The
authorities plan to introduce a broader tax reform in 2013 aimed at simplifying the
current system through the unification of tax rates and the cut of some tax allowances and
credits. The possibility of a value-added tax (VAT), to replace the current tax on imports,
is also under consideration. The public administration reform already underway will also
bring an improved control of public finances, including through a reduction in posts due
to outsourcing of activities and natural attrition.
In an effort to enhance long-term fiscal sustainability, the parliament has recently
approved two pension reform laws aimed at enhancing the sustainability of the first pillar
pension system and at establishing a second pillar system with compulsory participation.
The authorities recognize that financing the fiscal deficit has become a growing
challenge, and are considering possible options. Initial contacts with an investment bank
and a rating agency have been made to explore access to international capital markets.
Structural and Other Policy Issues
The Sammarinese authorities welcome the staff’s assessment of the reforms in the labor
and product markets, and agree that some processes are to be simplified. In this regard,

the authorities aim to further streamline the business licensing process. The authorities
believe that the labor market reforms need to strike a balance between growth and social
concerns, taking also into account that the Sammarinese labor market rigidities are less
acute than in other European countries.
The authorities intend to promote a better-diversified economy in order to buttress a
sustainable growth model. However, they underscored that in order to revitalize the
manufacturing sector, normalization of relations with Italy is critical. Finally, the
Sammarinese authorities remain committed to devoting additional human capital to
further develop macroeconomic statistics and they are interested in continued Fund
Technical Assistance.
