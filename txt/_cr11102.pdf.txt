STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 22, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Context: New Zealand’s recovery has stalled since mid-2010, reflecting soft domestic
demand and the adverse impact of two large earthquakes.
Growth prospects: In the near term, the earthquakes will slow activity, with real GDP
growth projected at 1 percent in 2011. However, growth is forecast to rise to 4 percent in
2012, led by reconstruction. Risks are tilted to the downside, including a faltering of
emerging Asia’s rapidly growing demand for commodities and a possible rise in long-term
interest rates.
Focus: The discussions centered on securing a sustainable and balanced recovery,
safeguarding financial sector stability, and reducing external vulnerabilities.
Sustainable and balanced recovery: To contain inflationary pressure, monetary policy,
which was eased in response to the earthquakes, will need to be tightened once it
becomes clear that the recovery is underway. Staff recommended a return to fiscal
surpluses by 2014/15 or earlier if feasible, despite the near-term cost of the earthquakes.
In a downside scenario, there is scope to loosen monetary policy further, but limited space
to delay the exit from budget deficits.
Financial stability: Banks’ key vulnerabilities are their exposure to highly indebted
households and farmers together with their sizable short-term offshore borrowing. The
authorities should continue to strengthen their stress testing of banks and consider the
merits of gradually raising bank capital to levels well above the Basel III requirements.
External vulnerability: Prudential measures and market pressures have led to a
reduction in banks’ sizable short-term wholesale borrowing. To further strengthen the
resilience of the economy, the authorities could take additional measures aimed at
encouraging banks to lengthen the maturity of borrowing further and increasing national
saving, including through higher public saving and tax reform.

Box 1

The Economic Impact of the Canterbury Earthquakes

The Canterbury region, accounting for about
15 percent of New Zealand’s economy, was
struck by severe earthquakes in September
2010 and February 2011. About 180 lives were
lost and residential and commercial buildings in
Christchurch, New Zealand’s second largest city,
suffered extensive damage. Infrastructure and
tourism assets were also damaged, but most of the
manufacturing and agriculture sectors were largely
unaffected. Estimates of the damage are still
subject to considerable uncertainty, and staff
assume the cost of reconstruction to be
$NZ 15 billion or about 7½ percent of 2011 GDP,
comprising residential buildings ($NZ 9 billion),
commercial buildings ($NZ 3 billion), and
infrastructure ($NZ 3 billion).
The cost of reconstruction is larger relative to
GDP than for major earthquakes elsewhere.
The 2010 earthquake in Chile and the 1995
earthquake in Kobe, Japan, inflicted damage of
about 6½ percent and 2 percent of GDP,
respectively. While the scale of damage from the
recent Japan earthquake is still uncertain, it is likely
to be less than the Canterbury earthquakes as a
percent of GDP.
The Canterbury earthquakes have disrupted
economic activity, reduced wealth, and
weakened confidence. Staff marked down the
growth projection for 2011 to about 1 percent

Over the medium term, reconstruction is
expected to boost investment and aggregate
demand. Aftershocks, demolition and land
stabilization work suggest that reconstruction will
not start until late 2011 or early 2012. Staff
assumes that four-fifths of residential and
infrastructure rebuilding will be completed by 2016,
while commercial rebuilding continues beyond this.

The earthquakes also had an impact on the
financial sector. One insurance company, AMI
Insurance, is facing significant financial uncertainty
because it has ⅓ of the residential insurance market
in Canterbury and has a concentration of risk in the
region. The government has subscribed for called
but unpaid preference shares in AMI of up to
$NZ 500 million (¼ percent of GDP) to ensure that
claims for damage are paid out in case AMI cannot,
and to maintain confidence in the insurance sector.
The authorities believe that the insurance sector in
general is sound and has adequate resources,
including offshore reinsurance arrangements, and
that the impact of the earthquakes on the banking
system is limited.

from 3 percent projected in the WEO forecast of

Box 2

Are House Prices Overvalued?

Real house prices rose by 150 percent in the
fifteen years to 2007, one of the strongest
increases among advanced countries. Real house
prices have since fallen by more than 10 percent.

House Price to Income Ratio
(1990 = 100)

200

House prices appear overvalued by about 15–
25 percent, using a combination of simple metrics
and models. However, some of these measures
have weaknesses which add to the uncertainty of
the estimate.

180

The OECD’s house price-to-income ratio in
September 2010 suggests an overvaluation of
about 15 percent when compared with the
average of the past twenty years. However, the
income measure used by the OECD does not take
account of Statistics New Zealand’s recent upward
revision to household income.

House Price to Rent Ratio
(1990 = 100)

The OECD’s price-to-rent ratio shows a much
higher overvaluation relative to the past
twenty years of 43 percent. However, the
measure includes government subsidized rents
which has pushed up the ratio over time as
subsidized rents decreased, most noticeably in
2001. An alternative measure excluding subsidized
housing suggests an overvaluation of 15–
27 percent when compared with historical
averages.

Model based estimates that take account of
income, demographics and interest rates
suggest an overvaluation of 15–25 percent. A
model developed by Igan and Loungani (see
forthcoming IMF working paper) shows an
overvaluation in September 2010 of 20–25 percent.
An alternative model that includes demographics,
mortgage interest rates, and the terms of trade as a
proxy for future income indicates that house prices
are overvalued by about 15–20 percent, from a
medium term perspective (based on Tumbarello
and Wang, IMF WP/10/291).1 The model, however,
is sensitive to assumptions about the terms of trade
(a proxy for future income) and interest rates. The
models suggest that a 10 percent fall in the terms
of trade could result in an 8 percent fall in house
prices over the medium run.

Staff also noted that a shift toward floating rate
mortgages in recent years and high household debt
means that consumer demand is more sensitive to
interest rate hikes. Therefore, the effect of
monetary stimulus could be removed relatively
quickly. Higher marginal bank funding costs relative

They noted that the recent policy rate cut should be
seen as an insurance measure designed to offset
the negative economic effects of the earthquake
until such time as rebuilding—and a recovery in the
broader economy—act to draw on the economy’s
surplus resources. The mobilization of resources
required to rebuild could have a persistent inflation
impact which would likely require a material
increase in the policy rate.

Box 3

Equilibrium Real Effective Exchange Rate

Staff estimates show an overvaluation of the
New Zealand dollar of 5–20 percent, but the
estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, as
indicated by the wide range of the confidence
intervals. The estimates are based on the
macroeconomic balance (MB) approach, the
equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach, and
the external sustainability (ES) approach.
The MB approach estimates the current account
deficit norm at 4¼ percent of GDP, based on a
model including population growth, old-age
dependency rates, income growth, the fiscal balance,
and oil balance. New Zealand’s relatively high
population growth contributes about 1½ percent of
GDP to the deficit norm. The projected current
account deficit is above this norm, implying an
overvaluation of about 14 percent.
The ERER estimates suggest a smaller
overvaluation. The model explains the real effective
exchange rate (REER) on the basis of the terms of
trade, relative productivity, and relative government
consumption. It suggests an overvaluation of about
5 percent, assuming that the terms of trade will
remain well above the average of the past two
decades over the medium term.

1/ The large net errors and omissions in 2008 and 2009 mainly reflect financial account data issues, as extreme volatility in exchange
rates and market prices during that period made it difficult to separate out valuation effects from financial account transaction.
A project is underway to investigate how balance of payments statistics can better capture transactions in financial derivatives.
2/ IIP balance sheet positions arise from transactions and valuation changes. The large net errors and omissions in 2008-09 do
not lead to large under-estimation of net foreign liabilities.

New Liquidity Rules: Will It Work as a Macroprudential Policy Tool?

The global financial crisis highlighted the need for
banks to have adequate liquidity to safeguard financial
stability and the Basel Committee proposed new
liquidity standards in December 2009. Given New
Zealand banks’ dependence on short-term offshore
funding, the authorities moved ahead of other
countries to implement new liquidity rules from April
2010.

Sources of New Zealand Bank Funding
(In percent)

70

70

60

50

40

The new quantitative requirements have two
components—liquidity mismatch ratios and a core
funding ratio (CFR)—which have considerable
similarities to the Basel Committee’s proposed liquidity
standards—the liquidity coverage ratio and net stable
funding ratio. The liquidity mismatch ratios compare a
bank’s likely cash inflows with its likely cash outflows.
The CFR aims to ensure that banks hold sufficient
retail and longer-dated wholesale funding. The
minimum CFR has been set at 65 percent of total
loans and advances from April 2010.
Since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008,
New Zealand banks have improved their funding
structures. They have significantly increased their retail
and long-term wholesale funding so banks’ reliance
on short-term wholesale funding declined from
53 percent of total funding in 2007 to 42 percent in
late 2010. The four major banks’ CFR is currently high
at above 75 percent.

40
Retail funding ratio

30

Short-term wholesale funding ratio

20

The impact of New Zealand’s new liquidity policy may
be stronger during cyclical upturns, when banks tend
to resort to short-term offshore funding markets to
support credit expansion. To satisfy growing credit
demand, banks will need to find funding mostly from
customer deposits and longer-term markets. Aside
from ensuring that credit growth is funded from more
stable sources, this may put some upward pressure on
bank funding costs, potentially reducing to some
extent the need for the RBNZ to raise the policy rate.
Through this channel, the CFR has the potential to
play a role in assisting monetary policy.

The shift to more stable funding in New Zealand has
increased bank funding costs. Both the experience of
the crisis and the introduction of the liquidity rules in
New Zealand have made banks willing to pay more to
attract retail deposits. In addition, a widening in
funding spreads since the crisis along with greater use
of long-term wholesale funding has seen bank
funding costs relative to the policy rate have increased
substantially, which is equivalent to tightening of
policy rates of about 100–150 basis points.

Appendix 2

Main Recommendations of the 2010 Article IV Consultation

Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions

Fiscal policy: Staff advised returning the
budget to surplus by 2014, two years earlier
than planned. Faster fiscal consolidation would
take pressure off monetary policy and thereby
the exchange rate, and limit the increase in the
current account deficit. Staff recommended
that concrete measures to control spending be
introduced and that any positive revenue
surprises be saved.

The 2010/11 budget called for a return to a
small budget surplus by 2016, but early this
year the Prime Minister announced the
intention to return to a small surplus by
2014/15.

Monetary policy: Staff supported the current
accommodative monetary policy stance and
advised that the RBNZ gradually return to a
neutral stance once the recovery is well
established.

Following signs of recovery, the RBNZ lifted
its policy rate in two steps from a record low
of 2.5 percent to 3 percent in mid-2010. The
RBNZ then reduced the policy rate to
2.5 percent following the February
earthquake.

Financial sector policy: Staff supported the
planned introduction of a prudential liquidity
policy for banks, including a core funding ratio,
and advised that banks’ capital and
provisioning be strengthened if stress tests
suggest the need for additional buffers.

The authorities introduced a core funding
ratio for banks in April 2010, which reduced
banks’ reliance on short-term funding and
may help constrain excessive credit growth
during upswings. Joint stress-testing with the
Australian authorities was conducted in 2010
and the test results suggest banks’ resilience
to sizable but plausible shocks. The RBNZ
recently reviewed capital adequacy associated
with agricultural loans, which will require
banks to set aside more capital for such
lending.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
New Zealand
On May 9, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with New Zealand.1
Background
New Zealand’s recovery has stalled since mid-2010, reflecting soft domestic demand and the
adverse impact of two large earthquakes. Domestic demand has remained soft, as cautious
households and businesses look to strengthen their balance sheets by slowing debt
accumulation amid a weak housing market and an uncertain outlook. Moreover, the
earthquakes have caused substantial damage and hurt confidence. Spare capacity has helped
contain inflation. The unemployment rate hovered between 6–7 percent over the past year,
limiting labor cost growth.
Following signs of recovery, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) lifted its policy rate from
a record low of 2.5 percent to 3 percent in mid-2010. As the recovery softened, the policy rate

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
was kept on hold in late 2010 and early 2011. In mid-March 2011, the RBNZ reduced the policy
rate by 50 basis points to limit downside risks as a result of the February earthquake.
Permanent income tax cuts and spending increases that were announced before the global
crisis and introduced in late 2008 provided a stimulus, but worsened the fiscal outlook. The
fiscal deficit is projected to increase sharply to about 8 percent of GDP in 2010/11, reflecting the
impact of the earthquakes and slower-than-expected economic recovery.
Banks remain profitable and capital adequacy has improved. Nonperforming loans have
increased to 2 percent of total loans, still low by advanced country standards, and sound
regulation and supervision helped maintain stability. Prudential measures and market pressures
have led to a reduction in banks’ sizable short-term wholesale borrowing.
The current account deficit narrowed to 2¼ percent of GDP in 2010, well below the levels of
about 8 percent of GDP in 2005–08. This reflects weak domestic demand, terms of trade gains,
and reinsurance inflows, following the first earthquake. Net foreign liabilities have declined since
2008 but remained high at 82 percent of GDP at end-2010. The trade-weighted exchange rate
appreciated by about 30 percent from the trough in early 2009 to April 2011, driven by higher
commodity prices.
Large uncertainty surrounds the economic outlook, particularly related to the size and timing of
reconstruction from the earthquakes. In the near term, the earthquakes will slow activity, with
real GDP growth projected at 1 percent in 2011. For 2012, growth is projected to rise to 4
percent, led by reconstruction. Risks are tilted to the downside, including a faltering of emerging
Asia’s rapidly growing demand for commodities and a possible rise in long-term interest rates.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors expressed sympathy for the loss of life and extensive damage inflicted by
two recent earthquakes. Despite the near-term disruption from the earthquakes, New Zealand’s
increasing ties with fast growing Asian economies and sound macroeconomic framework bode
well for its economic prospects. Directors noted that continued policy efforts are needed to
achieve sustained growth rates and reduce the vulnerabilities associated with low national
saving and large net foreign liabilities.
Directors considered the current accommodative monetary policy stance appropriate. The cut in
the policy interest rate in March 2011 has helped limit the negative economic impact of the
second earthquake. Directors agreed that the RBNZ will have to balance the need to support
the recovery with that of keeping medium-term inflation expectations well anchored. Directors
concurred that, in case of a delayed recovery, the RBNZ would have room to cut the policy rate.

3
Although fiscal policy should remain supportive of growth and reconstruction efforts in the near
term, Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to return to fiscal surpluses as soon as
possible. Fiscal consolidation would build a buffer against future shocks, relieve pressure on
monetary policy and the exchange rate, and contain the rise of the current account deficit.
Directors encouraged the authorities to take concrete measures to strengthen the credibility of
their fiscal plans. In particular, they saw scope to trim transfers to middle-income households,
rationalize capital spending, and improve the efficiency of public service provision.
Directors observed that banks remain profitable and have strengthened their capital buffers, but
are exposed to highly indebted households and farmers as well as rollover risks stemming from
sizeable short-term offshore borrowing. They welcomed the adoption of a core funding ratio that
has contributed to a substantial reduction in banks’ short-term offshore borrowing and enhanced
stability of the banking system. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to be vigilant to
financial sector risks, including through strengthening bank stress testing, and welcomed the
continued collaboration with the Australian authorities. Most Directors encouraged the
authorities to consider the merits of gradually raising bank capital to levels well above the Basel
III requirements.
Directors noted the vulnerabilities arising from New Zealand’s large net foreign liabilities and
sizeable short-term external debt. They stressed the importance of policy measures to lift
national saving and improve productivity, including through fiscal consolidation, tax and welfare
reform, and streamlining regulation. Directors welcomed the RBNZ’s continued work on macroprudential measures.
Directors noted the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate is moderately overvalued, while
recognizing the uncertainty around those estimates. They concurred that the free-floating
exchange rate has served New Zealand well by providing an effective buffer against shocks.

Statement by Christopher Y. Legg, Executive Director for New Zealand; Mario Guiuseppe
Di Maio, Senior Advisor; and Willy Chetwin, Advisor
May 9, 2011
Economic policies are focused on achieving higher, more sustainable growth. The Government
is committed to returning to fiscal surplus as soon as possible and to restoring the pre-crisis
strength of the government’s balance sheet. The forthcoming Budget will outline a clear path for
achieving this, notwithstanding the very substantial costs associated with recent devastating
earthquakes.
Households and businesses remained very cautious through 2010, increasing their saving,
resulting in weak growth in household demand and business investment, despite strong gains in
the terms of trade. There were signs of a pick-up in growth in 2011 just prior to the second
earthquake that hit Christchurch on 22 February 2011. The earthquakes caused widespread
damage currently estimated at around NZD15 billion (8 percent of GDP; 2.5 per cent of the
capital stock). The impact on the national balance sheet will be much more muted due to foreign
reinsurance flows of around NZD10 billion. As a result, the economy and financial system has
remained resilient.
Business and consumer confidence declined sharply following the earthquake, and in
Canterbury consumer spending and tourism activity were badly affected. Confidence has since
rebounded from post-quake lows and the disruption of economic activity is confined to the
Canterbury region. At this stage, the disruption to the economy is expected to ease progressively
over the next six months. Growth is expected to accelerate to more than 4 percent in 2012 as
rebuilding takes place against the backdrop of strong commodity prices and robust tradingpartner growth.
Monetary policy was eased in March as an insurance measure to limit the adverse impact of the
earthquakes. The additional strengthening in activity expected from mid-2010, when monetary
policy was tightened, failed to materialize. The negative output gap remains sizable and, outside
of the direct effects of higher consumption taxes and increased oil prices, inflation outcomes are
comfortably inside the 1 to 3 percent target range. Inflation expectations are similarly relatively
well anchored. While current monetary settings are likely to remain appropriate for some time,
the Reserve Bank expects to raise rates as the slack in the economy diminishes. Effective
interest rates can be increased more quickly than in the past––with the average time to repricing
of mortgage debt falling to around 7 months from a high of 20 months in the middle of 2007.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

NEW ZEALAND

New Zealand’s relative resilience to the shocks of the past few years highlights the high quality
of its macroeconomic institutions. Nevertheless, the authorities recognize that high levels of
external and private domestic debt leave New Zealand exposed to adverse changes in financial
markets. The domestic demand that gave rise to those debt levels may also be increasing the cost
of capital, which in turn probably inhibits desirable capital deepening.
Policies are being adapted to address these imbalances and manage the associated risks.
Fiscal consolidation will be brought forward. The Government has indicated it will reduce its
future spending plans, meeting spending in priority areas by making savings elsewhere.
Concrete measures will be announced in the 2011 Budget on 19 May. Despite the significant
estimated NZD8.5 billion fiscal cost of earthquake-related rebuilding, the adjustment will see
net debt peak only slightly above the figure of 28 percent of GDP forecast prior to the
earthquakes. Including the financial assets of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, the level
of net debt is even lower at around 20 percent of GDP, making New Zealand’s government
balance sheet one of the strongest among advanced economies.


The fiscal adjustment plan will support rebalancing, rebuild fiscal buffers, and lift
national saving. The Budget will build on the tax changes announced in 2010 that
increased consumption taxes and reduced taxes on investment and savings. As the
economy recovers, a tighter fiscal stance will take the pressure off domestic resources,
allow monetary policy to remain supportive for longer, and take some pressure off an
exchange rate that appears overvalued. Eliminating the structural deficit and returning to
surplus implies a structural improvement in the fiscal balance of around 5 percent of
GDP. This will help raise national saving over the medium-term, perhaps by as much as
3¾ percent of GDP according to staff estimates.



Ministers are considering further changes that would lift national savings. While
there are theoretical benefits of fully indexing the tax system to adjust for inflation, the
practical challenges are material – as suggested by the fact that no OECD country has
such a system. There would also be a fiscal cost that would undermine fiscal
consolidation objectives. A further increase in GST rates is not being considered given
the rate was last increased by 2.5 percent only in October 2010. It might also prove
undesirable if it reduces tax collection efficiency and support for the current broad GST
tax base.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



A further strengthening of financial stability is underway. The cautious approach to
banking sector regulation served New Zealand well through the crisis. Capital is already
at the levels envisaged under Basel III and the authorities expect to adopt many of the
Basel III improvements, tailored to New Zealand circumstances, ahead of the formal
timetable. Domestic experience suggests that some proposals, for example a leverage
ratio, may be counter-productive if they undermine a risk-based approach. Early
introduction of liquidity regulations in New Zealand has led to a material lengthening of
the maturity of bank funding. The appropriate future level of the Core Funding Ratio will
depend on experience gained in New Zealand and the application of the Net Stable
Funding Ratio to Australian banks.



A strong banking system is critical to intermediating significant foreign financing.
One approach, suggested by Fund staff, is to build additional capital buffers over and
above international standards. The strategy to date in New Zealand has been to take a
conservative approach to the quality of capital and risk weightings that reflect a genuine
through-the-cycle philosophy towards the calibration of bank capital. For example,
minimum loss-given default rates for mortgages are almost twice those of some
comparator countries. Similarly, the Reserve Bank is currently finalizing its requirements
for prudent minimum loss-given default rates for agriculture and the removal of the
Basel II concessional SME treatment of risk weighting for agricultural loans.

In conclusion, the New Zealand economy has weathered a series of large shocks reasonably
well. Strong regional growth, a rising terms of trade, sizable initial fiscal buffers, the sound
banking system, the floating exchange rate, and a relatively flexible economy underpinned this
resilience. However, the sustainable growth rate, currently estimated to be around 2 to
2½ percent, is lower than desired. High levels of private debt and domestic asset prices continue
to pose questions about the evolution of the economy over the next few years. While the path of
the needed macroeconomic adjustment is clear, a higher level of sustainable growth will depend
on a wide range of better microeconomic policies. No “silver bullet” has been identified; rather
progress across a broad front is required. In some aspects, such as a tax system that supports
savings and investment, there has been progress. However, further improvements are needed in
the regulatory environment and infrastructure to help deepen capital investment; create a more
efficient public sector, including consideration of reducing state holdings in selected stateowned enterprises; and provide a better environment for investment in human capital and
innovation.
