IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Malaysia
On April 22, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Malaysia.
Malaysia’s highly open and diversified economy was hit by a number of external and domestic
shocks since late 2014, including sharply lower energy prices, spillovers from China, capital
outflows and domestic political controversy. The economy has remained resilient, although
growth moderated to 5 percent in 2015 from 6 percent in 2014, led by domestic demand in the
face of weak external demand. Inflation remained subdued, close to 2 percent, despite the
significant depreciation of the ringgit against the U.S. dollar and the implementation of the GST.
The current account surplus narrowed to about 3 percent of GDP.
The authorities have responded to the multiple shocks in a timely and decisive fashion and their
policy agenda remains on track. Fiscal consolidation, including the introduction of GST in
April 2015 and removal of costly and untargeted fuel and other subsidies starting in late 2014,
have been effective in shielding the fiscal position from the effects of lower oil-related revenues
and in diversifying the revenue base, with appropriate compensatory measures put in place to
help offset the impact of fiscal consolidation on lower and middle income households. The
medium-term fiscal strategy calls for further consolidation, balancing the budget and materially
lowering the federal debt by 2020 while taking into account the economy’s cyclical condition.
Limited pass through of exchange rate changes to domestic prices and low prices of imports have
helped to contain inflation closer to BNM’s comfort range. Monetary policy remains
accomodative, with cuts in the reserve requirements supporting domestic liquidity and growth.
The authorities allowed the exchange rate to depreciate substantially, by about 25 percent against
the U.S. dollar between July 2014 and December 2015, and also deployed US$36.5 billion of
reserves over the same period, including reserves accumulated during the post-GFC inflow
period, to cushion the effect of capital outflows on the economy and maintain orderly market

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually

the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

conditions. A series of well-targeted macroprudential policies remain in place and have helped
build financial sector resilience as the financial cycle turns.
Staff expects economic growth to ease to a still robust 4.4 percent in 2016. Activity should
continue to be underpinned by healthy, albeit moderating, domestic demand but constrained by
weak external demand. Inflation will rise temporarily but remain close to 3 percent as the impact
of lower oil prices wanes and a more depreciated exchange rate passes through to prices. The
authorities’ structural agenda includes continued focus on improving Malaysia’s physical
infrastructure and human capital endowment and pursuing economic reforms on a wide front in
the context of their 11th Malaysia Plan, 2016–2020. Malaysia has ratified the Trans-Pacific
Partnership and is an active participant in the ASEAN Economic Community which came into
force in January 2016.
Executive Board Assessment2
Strong fundamentals, ample buffers, a robust financial system, and timely policy responses have
enabled the Malaysian economy to weather external shocks, including from lower commodity
prices and spillovers from trading partners. While the outlook for the economy is good, Directors
agreed that the increasingly challenging environment requires continued implementation of
sound macroeconomic policy. Pushing ahead with structural reforms will also be important to
raise growth potential over the medium term.
Directors endorsed the current settings for fiscal policy, noting the authorities’ continued
commitment to fiscal consolidation as evidenced by the 2016 budget. They commended the
authorities for the timely elimination of fuel price subsidies, and the implementation of GST,
which has significantly diversified the revenue base away from reliance on oil and contributed to
fiscal sustainability. Directors underscored that protecting and strengthening the fiscal position
should continue to be a top priority, including by adhering to the federal budget deficit target for
2016 and by balancing the budget by 2020. Directors noted that automatic fiscal stabilizers
should be allowed to operate to support the economy, and if needed, any additional fiscal
stimulus should be targeted, temporary and consistent with the medium-term consolidation plan.
Directors concurred that the current accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate in an
environment of moderating growth and low inflation. Noting that exchange rate flexibility,
combined with the use of reserves, had helped insulate domestic financial conditions from global
cycles, Directors called for continued exchange rate flexibility, while maintaining an adequate
level of reserves. Some Directors noted that the use of reserve adequacy metrics should be
supplemented with a broader assessment of the country’s economic and financial development.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors noted that Malaysia’s banking sector is well capitalized and resilient and that tighter
financial conditions and macroprudential policies have resulted in a slowdown in credit growth.
They noted the risks from the relatively high household and corporate debt, but agreed that
further macroprudential policies are not needed at this time. They encouraged the authorities to
closely monitor risks from rising NPLs as the financial cycle turns.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ broad structural reform agenda, including the 11th Malaysia
Plan, unveiled in May 2015. These reforms, along with recent international agreements,
including the ASEAN Economic Community and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, should help
boost productivity and enhance regional integration. In addition, Directors noted that improving
the quality of education will be critical in achieving higher-income status. They also underscored
the importance of high standards of governance of public enterprises and a clear communication
of government-linked companies’ investment and financing plans. Malaysia could also benefit
from a Public Investment Management Assessment.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
March 30, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Adjusting to shocks. The Malaysian economy has faced a sequence of shocks since
mid-2014, including declines in commodity prices, spillovers from China, volatility of
capital flows, and domestic political controversy. The economy’s adjustment is aided by
its diversified production and export bases, deep financial markets, strong regulatory
framework, strong external position, flexible exchange rates, and responsive fiscal policy
and reforms.
Outlook. The outlook for 2016 is shrouded in uncertainties, owing to a confluence of
factors that include the global and regional trade slowdowns; China spillovers; the
normalization path of U.S. interest rates; and the uneven strength of activity in Malaysia’s
other major trading partners. Nevertheless, growth should remain healthy at 4.4 percent.
Fiscal policy. The 2016 Budget, including the January recalibration, reaffirms the
government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation. Key reforms have been undertaken,
including elimination of fuel price subsidies, expenditure rationalization, and GST
implementation, which will contribute to fiscal sustainability over the medium term.
Monetary policy. The current accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate in
an environment of moderating growth and low inflation. Despite outflows, domestic
liquidity remains adequate and monetary conditions are supportive of real activity.
Exchange rate flexibility. Facing sizeable capital outflows and a sharp fall in oil and
commodity prices, the exchange rate depreciated substantially and BNM deployed
reserves and there were only modest effects on domestic interest rates. Going forward,
exchange rate flexibility should be the first line of defense to global financial volatility
and external shocks. Reserves should be gradually rebuilt.
Financial cycle. The financial cycle is turning. However, Malaysia’s banking sector is
well-capitalized and is expected to be resilient through the cycle. Credit growth has
moderated, a welcome development following several years of double digit growth. The
authorities should monitor risks from rising NPLs as the financial cycle turns.
Structural policies. The 11th Malaysia Plan, unveiled in May 2015, aims to boost
competitiveness and productivity by improving human capital and infrastructure.
Together with enhanced trade agreements, including the ASEAN Economic Community
and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, these efforts should anchor reforms that help boost
productivity and enhance regional integration. Improving the quality of educational
attainment will be critical in achieving high income status.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
1.
Recent developments. Malaysia’s highly open and diversified economy was in a
favorable position in mid-2014, with strong economic growth, a large current account surplus
and substantial reserves. But the effects of multiple external shocks from lower commodity
prices, capital outflows, slowdown in external demand, and China-related financial volatility, have
been large and growth is slowing down. The ringgit depreciated by 25.5 percent against the
U.S. dollar between July 2014 and December 2015, while US$36.5 billion of reserves were
deployed to cushion the capital outflows and maintain orderly market conditions (Figures 1–2).
2.
Economic performance. Real GDP grew by 5 percent in 2015, down from 6 percent
in 2014; and the positive output gap has narrowed. Private sector domestic demand was the
main driver of growth. Exports picked up in the second half of the year on stronger external
demand and a depreciated currency, and the current account remained in surplus. Investment
has been resilient owing to the continued implementation of long-gestation projects in
infrastructure and industry. The manufacturing and services sectors have also been resilient.
Inflation has remained subdued as weaker demand and lower oil prices offset the impact of GST
and currency depreciation. Credit growth is slowing to a more moderate pace.

3.
Policy adjustments. The authorities’ responses to shocks have been timely and their
policy agenda remains on track and is in line with Fund policy advice (Appendix I). Fiscal
consolidation is aimed at offsetting lower oil and

4.
Outlook. Staff expects economic growth to ease to 4.4 percent in 2016 and the
economic environment has become more challenging. Activity should continue to be
underpinned by healthy, albeit moderating, domestic demand but constrained by weak external
demand. Credit growth is expected to slow down, dampening the accumulation of debt.
Nevertheless, financial conditions are expected to remain accommodative of growth.
Consumption growth will be supported by a temporary reduction in mandatory Employee
Provident Fund (EPF) contribution rates, tax relief for middle and lower income taxpayers and
expanded federal transfers to lower-income groups, lower fuel prices, and by high rates of
household formation and strong employment. Private investment growth is projected to
decelerate to about 5 percent. Inflation will rise temporarily in early 2016 as the impact of lower

oil prices wanes and a more depreciated exchange rate passes through to prices.1 Over the
medium term, potential growth will remain close to 5 percent but is likely to be slightly lower
than previously projected owing to lower commodity prices, slower potential growth in China
and other emerging markets, and lower potential growth in advanced economies. Despite the
large negative terms of trade shock, the current account is projected to stay in surplus.
5.
Risks. The outlook for 2016 is uncertain owing, inter alia, to the global and regional trade
slowdowns, China-related volatility and spillovers and the normalization path of U.S. interest
rates; (Appendix II).


External risks. Despite significant capital outflows during 2015, foreign investors still hold
sizeable positions in Malaysian Government Securities (MGS) and Malaysia remains
vulnerable to further outflows, especially during periods of heightened global financial stress.
Other risks include a sharper-than-expected slowdown in China in 2016–17; structurally weak
growth in advanced and emerging market economies; and a further decline in energy and
commodity prices.



Domestic risks. These are related to a sharp rise in domestic debt in the post-GFC period:
federal debt and contingent liabilities are relatively high, as is external and household debt.
Realization of contingent liabilities would likely
contribute to financial market volatility and

6.
Authorities’ views. The authorities were in broad agreement with staff’s assessment.
Malaysia’s diversified economy and strong macroeconomic fundamentals have blunted the
impact of lower commodity prices. Nevertheless, growth has moderated and is expected to be
between 4.0–4.5 percent for 2016, led by domestic demand. Consumption growth will remain
healthy but at a slower pace. Private investment growth is also expected to moderate but will be
sustained by the pipeline of strategic infrastructure projects. Manufacturing exports are expected
to benefit from the depreciation of the ringgit. The authorities agree that externally driven
volatility is likely to persist. They emphasized the low probability of fiscal contingent liabilities
materializing. BNM assesses the probability of a sharp turn in the financial cycle as low and views
the risks as manageable.

1
Staff estimates suggest that exchange rate pass-through has historically been weak in Malaysia; however, given
the large depreciation exchange rate pass-through could be stronger than in the past. Imported goods, not
including oil, are 6.9 percent of the CPI basket. Using a common factor model, a near zero loading coefficient on
the U.S. nominal effective exchange rate was found for inflation in Malaysia (see IMF (2015) Regional Economic
Outlook: Asia and Pacific).

ADJUSTING TO EXTERNAL SHOCKS
7.
Lower commodities prices. Malaysia’s
exports are diversified but oil and gas related
commodities are important, accounting for
about 10 percent of exports. The large fall in
commodity prices has led to a significant
narrowing of the current account surplus, to
2.9 percent of GDP in 2015, as weak commodity
exports are only partially offset by a pickup in
manufacturing exports (Appendix III). The decline
in the current account surplus was reflected in
lower corporate saving in the first instance. The
deficit of the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS), which includes important government-linked
companies (GLCs) such as PETRONAS, the

recovers over time. While the investment ratio is
still projected to rise over time, its trajectory will
be more modest. The current account is expected to narrow further, to about 1.6 percent of GDP
over the medium term. Expenditure switching associated with a more competitive exchange rate
should help boost exports but this will be offset by large import needs. Malaysia’s prior
experience with adjusting to lower commodities prices highlights the positive impact of fiscal
reforms on growth (Appendix V).

Spillovers from China. China is Malaysia’s largest trading partner and spillovers through
the trade and commodity channels are relatively important. Malaysia’s exports to China comprise
manufactures which are part of the regional supply chain as well as palm oil and other non-oil
commodities. However, the direct spillover effects of developments in China on Malaysia’s
exports have been small thus far as confirmed from detailed goods exports data, decomposed by
commodities and non-commodities and by country of destination. Much of the negative effect
on the trade balance is from the impact of lower international prices of products Malaysia
exports outside of China, for example, LNG exports to Japan and Korea. In addition, there may be

second round effects on exports, as other countries are negatively impacted, decreasing overall
external demand for Malaysia.
9.
Exchange Market Pressure (EMP). The extent to which Malaysia’s FX market was
affected by global shocks during 2015 in relation to its peer Emerging Market Economies (EMEs)
can be gauged by a simple EMP index
(Appendix VI).4 Malaysia’s EMP showed a
sizeable depreciation pressure and was higher
than, for example, some Latin American EMEs.
Malaysia’s EMP was broadly in line with that
predicted by cross-country regression analysis,
with export exposure to China and to mineral
fuels largely explaining it. In terms of
composition of EMP, data analsysis shows that
changes in reserves contributed more in
Malaysia than in most EMEs. This largely reflects
a reduction in foreign holdings of the short-term BNM bills, which were used to sterilize and
smoothen the impact of the global capital flow cycles on the domestic financial markets (see
paragraph 12).
10.
Authorities’ views. The adjustment to lower commodity prices is ongoing, supported by
Malaysia’s diversified economy and government revenue sources. Furthermore, exchange rate
depreciation is supporting manufacturing exports and is helping to partially offset the
commodities price shock. The authorities remain committed to balancing the budget by 2020.
Medium-term fiscal consolidation will be achieved primarily through expenditure rationalization
and restraint. The authorities concur that spillovers from rebalancing of the Chinese economy
could reduce growth and increase volatility; however, the Malaysian economy’s enhanced trade
linkages with other economies creates additional growth opportunities.

CAPITAL OUTFLOWS: STRESS TESTING RESILIENCE
11.
Capital inflows and reversals. Malaysia has relied both on foreign reserves and the
exchange rate to cushion the impact on the economy of shocks to capital flows and its terms of
trade. Capital inflows in the post-GFC era were sizable, with cumulative portfolio inflows
amounting to US$81billion (26 percent of GDP) between early 2009 and their peak in mid-2013.
During this period, Malaysian institutional investors, including the Employees Provident Fund
(EPF), were also diversifying their portfolio by investing abroad, easing demand for domestic

4

assets and reducing net inflows. BNM sterilized inflows by issuing bills, and changes in foreign
holdings of BNM bills were matched by similarly sized changes in reserves. Reserves accumulated
during inflow surges were used to cushion the impact of capital outflows during 2013–2015.
12.
Recent volatility. Capital outflows were particularly high during 2015. In late 2014–
early 2015 outflows were primarily from the equity market and were primarily in response to
declining commodity prices and weak external demand. For the rest of the year, outflows were
primarily from BNM bills largely reflecting the unwinding of the carry trades, and by June 2015,
foreign holdings of BNM bills had shrunk to near zero. In contrast, foreign holdings of MGS have
been relatively stable. These episodes were similar to earlier bouts of capital flow volatility and
BNM used its reserves and the exchange rate to smooth the adjustment and maintain orderly
market conditions. Reflecting the depth of Malaysia’s financial markets, the effects on domestic
interest rates and the real economy were small.
13.
Assessing vulnerabilities. Malaysia’s vulnerabilities arise mainly from high foreign
holdings of MGS and equities, high short-term debt of the banking system, and high household
and corporate sector debt. However, deep-pocketed domestic institutional investors and sizeable
bank liquidity with BNM contribute to continued resilience (Appendix VII).

The MGS market is deep and liquid and MGS
yields are less volatile than government bond
yields in other EMEs. Domestic institutional
investors, with ample liquidity, tend to buy
opportunistically when foreign investors exit
and there is upward pressure on yields. Staff
analysis suggests that these investors have
balance sheet capacity to absorb additional
MGS holdings of at least 5 percent of GDP,
which would help stabilize the market.

2009Q1



Sources: CEIC Data Co. Ltd; IMF staff calculations

Short-term external debt of the banking
system has increased to almost 23 percent of GDP by end-September 2015. This debt
comprises short-term offshore borrowing and non-resident deposits. The rise in short-term
offshore debt appears to be primarily related to centralization of overseas treasury
operations of foreign branches of Malaysian banks and has been accompanied by an
increase in short-term banking sector assets. Non-resident deposits amounting to
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAYSIA

7.2 percent of GDP, of which two thirds comprise business deposits, have been stable so far.
However, in a stress scenario, withdrawal of non-resident deposits could pose a vulnerability.


Outstanding liquidity placed with BNM amounted was approximately RM 220 billion at end
December 2015, of which approximately RM 50 billion represents statutory reserves, down
from RM 320 billion in August 2014. BNM can release part of this liquidity to the banks in a
stress scenario and offset the impact of outflows on their balance sheets.

14.
Stress tests. Malaysia’s external debt has increased from about 54 percent of GDP
in 2009 to 65.6 percent at end-2015, of which one quarter comprises foreign holdings of local
currency debt. A severe stress test that simulates a further outflow of foreign capital (similar in
magnitude to that observed during the GFC) reaffirms that risks to Malaysia from capital
outflows remain contained (Appendix VII). A substantial part of Malaysia’s external debt, about
36 percent, is in its own currency and its exchange rate is flexible, allowing for more risk sharing
with foreign investors: when shocks lead to outflows and currency depreciation, foreign holders
experience valuation losses, reducing the drain on reserves and incentives to exit.
15.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agree that Malaysia’s open economy and large
financial sector expose the economy to capital flow volatility. Accumulation of reserves during
post-GFC inflow surges helped limit the appreciation of the exchange rate and reduce excess
liquidity in the banking system, thereby maintaining stable monetary conditions. Subsequently
when flows reversed, the use of reserves and release of liquidity into the banking system
insulated the impact on monetary conditions and the economy. In addition, exchange rate
flexibility played a key role in the adjustment to lower commodity prices. The authorities noted
that Malaysia’s resilience to capital flow volatility is strong as demonstrated by the modest
impact on the real economy during capital outflow episodes. They agreed with staff’s assessment
that the Malaysian economy can be resilient to a stress scenario due to its solid fundamentals
and macroeconomic policies, including diversified sources of growth, current account surpluses
and FDI inflows, manageable level of external debt, liberal capital accounts as well as a deep and
diversified financial system.

POLICIES FOR RESILIENCE
16.
Response to shocks. Uncertainty about external conditions requires continued fiscal
prudence and flexibility in setting fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies. With receding risks
to price stability, monetary policy has more room to focus on domestic growth. Fiscal policy
should persevere with growth-friendly consolidation over the medium term. While fiscal space is
limited, temporary and targeted measures anchored in a medium-term consolidation plan can
support aggregate demand. Exchange rate flexibility should continue to be the first line of
defense to external shocks and reserves deployed to ensure smooth functioning of markets. Over
the medium term, reserves can be gradually and opportunistically rebuilt. Staff supports the
authorities’ declaration to abstain from using capital controls on outflows.

A. Monetary Policy
17.
Appropriate stance. The current environment of moderating growth, low inflation and
tightening credit conditions calls for accommodative monetary policies. BNM has kept its policy
rate unchanged since July 2014, resulting in low real interest rates that are supportive of
domestic demand. Capital outflows and implementation of liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)
requirements led to a tightening of domestic liquidity conditions. Meanwhile, the recent 50 basis
point reduction in the statutory reserve requirement ratio should help prevent an over-tightening
of credit conditions. Inflation will peak in the first quarter due to the waning impact of earlier
declines in oil prices but is expected to remain moderate during 2016 on modest exchange rate
pass through.
18.
Outlook and managing risks. No change in the policy rate is anticipated during 2016, in
line with projections from an estimated Taylor rule (Appendix VIII). A reduction in the policy rate
to aid growth in the near term would risk re-igniting strong credit growth. A tightening of
interest rates should be considered if signs emerge of second round inflation pressures from the
large exchange rate depreciation. In a risk scenario where prolonged capital outflows result in a
significant tightening of domestic liquidity conditions, BNM could provide liquidity through open
market operations and/or further lower the statutory reserve requirement. Going forward, given
the lower level of reserves, greater reliance on exchange rate flexibility is recommended.
19.
Authorities’ views. The current stance of monetary policy is supportive of activity. Growth
is expected to moderate while inflationary pressures are expected to remain subdued. Recent
external and domestic developments have weakened the exchange rate, with capital outflows
contributing to lower domestic liquidity. BNM will continue to ensure sufficient liquidity to
maintain orderly markets and support growth. The authorities agreed with staff on the importance
of exchange rate flexibility and on the need to rebuild reserves over the medium term. However,
they would not rule out using reserves to buffer short-term capital flows as in the past.

B. Fiscal Policy
20.
Background. Fiscal policies in recent
years have strived to balance near-term support
for growth with medium-term fiscal
sustainability. The 2015 deficit target of
3.2 percent of GDP was achieved through
introduction of the GST, subsidy reform, restraint
in recurrent spending, and lagged adjustment in
the PETRONAS dividend. These reforms will also
help sustain the fiscal consolidation effort going
forward although, in staff’s view, balancing the
budget by 2020 could require additional
measures up to 1.2 percent of GDP.
21.
2016 Budget. The 2016 Budget, including the January recalibration, targets a deficit of
3.1 percent of GDP. Faced with further declines in oil and gas related revenues, the authorities
cut spending on supplies and services and grants and refocused development expenditure on
high impact projects with low import content. The measures adopted strove to mitigate the
impact on the domestic economy and the fiscal

22.
Policy response to shocks. If the economy is weaker than envisaged under the baseline,
staff advises that the automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate and the federal deficit
could be allowed to rise slightly while maintaining commitment to the medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan. Should the growth outlook deteriorate significantly, relatively high fiscal
deficit and public debt afford limited space for a sustained countercyclical fiscal response. Any
fiscal stimulus should be temporary, targeted and anchored in a medium-term fiscal
consolidation program.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23.
GST. The GST has played a critical role in
the adjustment to lower oil prices. Its effectiveness
could be enhanced by narrowing the list of
exempt and zero-rated items. At 6 percent, the
GST rate is low relative to other countries and
could be increased to help achieve medium-term
fiscal objectives.
24.
Federal debt and contingent liabilities.
Federal debt is expected to remain below the
55 percent of GDP ceiling in the short-and
medium-term (Appendix IX). Contingent liabilities (in excess of 15 percent of GDP) require
continuous monitoring. Staff recommends that a statement on fiscal risks be published annually
to inform policy. Staff notes that a new statutory body, Public Sector Housing Financing Board,
has been created which will manage housing loans to civil servants starting in January 2016.
Associated assets and a portion of associated liabilities have been transferred to the new body,
reducing federal debt by 2 percent of GDP but leaving general government debt unchanged.
Although the default risk is low given at-source deductions from payroll, this requires transparent
treatment in a fiscal risks statement.
25.
Fiscal institutions and framework. Staff welcomes the adoption of a medium-term
fiscal framework and the inclusion of three-year projections in the 2016 budget. Looking ahead,
staff encourages additional information in future budgets, including annual projections of
revenue and expenditure and an explicit link with 11th Malaysia Plan. Staff welcomes
implementation of accrual accounting and outcome-based budgeting. Malaysia has made
important strides in the provision of public infrastructure (Appendix X). Under the 10th Malaysia
plan, the ratio of public capital stock to GDP has increased. Malaysia also fares well in surveys of
infrastructure quality and access. Malaysia, as other countries, would benefit from a Public
Investment Management Assessment (PIMA).
26.
Nonfinancial public enterprises. The NFPS deficit is estimated to have increased from
5.9 percent of GDP in 2014 to 8.9 percent in 2015. This stemmed mostly from the fall in global oil
prices, which lowered GLCs’ operating surpluses, and continued implementation of GLC
investment, which provided support to the economy. GLCs finance capital expenditure from
retained earnings and the issuance of debt and equity. Clear communication of GLC investment
and financing plans will be important to ensure markets are appropriately informed.
27.
Authorities’ views. The authorities reiterated their commitment to fiscal sustainability
and achieving a budget that is broadly balanced in the medium term. For the 2016 Budget, the
authorities noted the significant contribution from GST revenues and emphasized that
expenditure restraint measures will focus on areas with low impact on aggregate demand.
Although contingent liabilities are sizable, government loan guarantees have a low probability of
being called as they are granted strategically to nonfinancial entities with healthy balance sheets.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAYSIA

THE FINANCIAL CYCLE AND LEVERAGE
28.
Background. The financial cycle is
turning and loan growth continues to ease,
reflecting macroprudential policies and
macroeconomic factors. The turn in the credit
cycle is lagging the turn in the economic cycle
and, as a result, the ratio of credit to GDP has
increased, widening the credit gap. However this
is expected to reverse as nominal GDP growth
picks up and outpaces more moderate credit
growth. While credit markets are expected to
remain supportive of growth, tighter credit
conditions and high debt levels will weigh on domestic demand (Figure 7).
29.
Banks. Banks’ strong liquidity position with BNM has helped to cushion the impact of
capital outflows. Real interest rates on deposits remain low contributing to sluggish deposit
growth which, along with banks’ adjustment to
LCR requirements, has resulted in intensified
competition for deposits. Banks’ capital position
strengthened in 2015, but profitability weakened
slightly. Loan quality remains good although the
NPL ratio was unchanged, consistent with slower
economic growth (Figure 10). Banks’ short-term
FX debt has increased and although matched by
an increase in FX assets, warrants careful
monitoring. Malaysian banks are well placed to
meet the Basel III capital and phased-in liquidity
requirements. Significant progress has also been made in implementing key FSAP
recommendations (Appendix XI).
30.
Non-banks. Non-bank credit
intermediaries contributed significantly to the
build-up of household debt but growth in nonbank lending and the stock of debt to
households have declined following
implementation of macroprudential measures
in 2013. Direct linkages between banks and nonbanks are limited and covered by BNM’s
regulation on single counterparty exposures
(Appendix 8, 2014 Malaysia Article IV
Consultation).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

MALAYSIA

31.
Household debt and macroprudential policies. Household debt has increased by
15 percentage points of GDP since end-2009 but growth has begun to moderate as of late
(Figure 8). Close to 50 percent of the debt is owed on residential property and about 60 percent
are variable rate loans. Macroprudential measures have helped to curb household borrowing
(Table 8). The impact of measures continues to be felt and the reduced loan applications and
approvals reflect in part an enhanced framework for risk-based pricing of loans. Risks from high
household debt are mitigated by strong household financial assets (including EPF savings and
banking system deposits) and low unemployment. NPLs are likely to increase as the financial
cycle turns but any increase is likely to be small. House prices are still growing but prices of highend properties in Kuala Lumpur have declined slightly. Given the slowdown in loan growth and in
housing, no further measures are recommended. LTV caps on second and first mortgages should
be considered if rapid house price and credit growth were to reignite.
32.
Corporate sector debt. Corporate sector debt, at 96 percent of GDP, is relatively high
but its growth has moderated since the GFC (Appendix XII). Corporate debt risks in terms of
maturity, currency, and exposure to commodities appear contained. Bank loans, representing
about half of total corporate debt, are well diversified and predominantly medium term. Less
than 26 percent of total debt is foreign-currency denominated and well below the emerging
market average of close to 35 percent. BNM’s approval regime for external borrowing ensures
that corporates’ foreign currency debt is either naturally hedged or is hedged using derivatives.
Commodities account for less than 20 percent of listed corporate sector debt. Stress testing
results imply that Malaysian corporates are resilient to declines in income, depreciation of the
exchange rate, and increases in interest rates.
33.
Authorities’ views. The authorities concurred that the financial cycle is turning.
Nevertheless, due to macroprudential policies and risk-based supervision, banks are expected to
remain resilient. High underwriting standards imply that only a modest and manageable increase
in NPLs is anticipated. Additional macroprudential measures are not needed at this time and
there are no plans to wind down existing measures, given their prudential nature. Risks from
non-financial corporate sector debt remain manageable, supported by generally healthy balance
sheets and financial positions. Close to 73 percent of external borrowings were of longer
maturities, exceeding one year, further reducing short-term risks. Outstanding non-financial
corporate external debt is borne by domestic conglomerates and local outfits of multinational
corporations (mainly in the form of inter-company loans). As part of BNM’s approval
consideration for external borrowings equivalent to RM 100 million and above, the borrowings
should be adequately hedged or supported by foreign currency receivables.

EXTERNAL SECTOR ASSESSMENT
34.
External sector assessment. Malaysia’s 2015 external position was stronger than
warranted by fundamentals and desirable policies (Appendices XIII–XIV). The 2015 External
Balance Assessment (EBA) estimates the cyclically-adjusted current account (CA) surplus to be
4.6 percent of GDP, with the CA norm at 0.5 percent of GDP. However, staff’s estimate of the
current account norm is 1.8 percent of GDP, which implies a CA gap of 2.8 percent of GDP, with
the policy gap contributing –0.1 percent of GDP. The CA gap reflects structural factors, viz. low

gap. Reserves were above 100 percent of the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric prior to the onset of
the large shocks in 2014–15. The use of reserves to cushion capital outflows has resulted in a
decline to 80 percent of the metric for 2015, which is below the suggest adequacy range of 100–
150 percent. Going forward, staff recommends greater reliance on the exchange rate flexibility
and that reserves be increased as opportunities present themselves. Malaysia’s net international

investment position is 8.4 percent of GDP at end-2015, a significant improvement over 2014 that
is attributed to capital outflows and valuation effects.
35.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agree with staff’s assessment. Exchange rate
adjustments continued to perform a critical role in absorbing external shocks. Exchange rate
flexibility was complemented by foreign exchange intervention, utilizing reserve buffers in times
of heightened volatility when market participants were prone to herd-like behavior. Despite the
decline, Malaysia’s international reserves remain ample. Reserves constitute only one-fourth of
Malaysia’s total external assets and other external assets also provide a cushion, if needed,
against short-term claims. The authorities also note that the Fund’s reserve adequacy metric uses
an unfavorable binary classification under which Malaysia’s exchange rate regime is classified as
“other fixed” instead of “free floating.” They emphasize the importance of judgment in making
assessments and the need to avoid a rigid interpretation of any metric. The authorities expect the
current account to remain in surplus over the medium term.

staunch support of free trade, despite domestic opposition.6 Viewed in their totality, better

Boosting human capital and home grown innovation. Improvements in workforce
skills, more home-grown innovation and more intensive technology adoption will also be
necessary if Malaysia is to avoid the middle income trap and become more inclusive. Staff
encourages steadfast implementation of the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2013–25, which aims
to boost student educational attainment and raise scores to the upper third of international
comparisons. Malaysia’s education system needs continued transformation, with industry-led
cooperative arrangements with universities and technical vocational institutes, as well as a
sharpening of incentives in the allocation of research budgets and greater focus on
commercialization of knowledge obtained from research and development.

Strengthening institutions. Recent events surrounding a government-owned strategic
investment fund that is embroiled in scandal underscore the need to uphold high standards of
governance and communication in public financial management. Transparency International’s
Corruption Perceptions Index for Malaysia declined from 52 to 50 in 2015 and the ranking fell
from 50th to 54th. Malaysia continues to score well on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business
Index, ranking 18th in 2016. Staff welcomes steps currently under consideration to strengthen the
Malaysia Anti-Corruption Commission and Malaysia’s engagement with its Financial Action Task
Force peers to strengthen the domestic framework and implementation of laws relating to AntiMoney Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML-CFT). Staff also encourages
the authorities to enhance the asset declaration system and strengthen law enforcement
agencies’ capacity to conduct financial investigations.
40.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed with the broad thrust of staff’s assessment.
They reiterated their commitment to fiscal prudence and to fiscal and structural reforms to raise
the efficiency and fairness of fiscal policy and to improve the quality of education and strengthen
their investments in research and development. They also reiterated their commitment to trade
integration and economic openness which will provide an anchor for reforms and help improve
living standards for all Malaysians. They are confident that implementation of their wide ranging
reform agenda will help Malaysia achieve high income status by 2020.

According to recent estimates (Petri and Plummer 2016), Malaysia’s gains from the TPP will amount to 5 percent
of its GDP by 2025. See Peter A. Petri and Michael G. Plummer: The Economic Effects of the Trans-Pacific
Partnership: New Estimates, Working Paper Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington DC.

STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Outlook. Malaysia’s highly open economy remains resilient despite being buffeted by
multiple shocks since late 2014. However, growth is slowing down, the economic environment
has become more challenging, and downside risks have risen. On-going re-balancing in China
could imply additional spillovers in the near term. Uncertainty about the external environment,
including the likelihood of persistently low commodity prices and more capital outflows, require
continued prudence in selecting policy settings.
42.
Fiscal policy. The authorities have broadened revenue bases and diversified them away
from oil and gas related revenues in a timely manner. The NFPS deficit has risen as commodity
prices declined, but this is expected to reverse in the medium term. Protecting and strengthening
the fiscal position should continue to be the authorities’ top priority, by adhering to the federal
budget deficit target for 2016 and by balancing the budget by 2020. While automatic fiscal
stabilizers should be allowed to operate if the economy is much weaker than envisaged, there is
relatively little room for countercyclical fiscal policies. Given the relatively high federal debt and
contingent liabilities, any fiscal stimulus should be targeted, temporary and consistent with the
medium-term fiscal consolidation plan.
43.
Monetary policy. In response to external shocks and capital outflows, BNM has allowed
the ringgit to depreciate and deployed reserves to smooth the capital flow cycle and ensure
orderly conditions in foreign exchange and financial markets. Going forward, BNM should rely
more on exchange rate flexibility and intervene judiciously and gradually rebuild its stock of
international reserves. While headline inflation is expected to rise temporarily in 2016, core
inflation is well anchored, and BNM’s current monetary policy setting is appropriate. However,
the authorities should continue to monitor risks to inflation from stronger than expected
exchange rate pass-through and a tightening of interest rates could be considered if signs of
second-round effects emerge.
44.
Financial sector. Macroprudential policies and tighter financial conditions have resulted
in lower credit growth, a welcome development following years of strong growth. Nevertheless,
household and corporate sector debt remains elevated. Additional macroprudential policies are
not currently recommended. Liquidity remains adequate and supportive of growth. Malaysian
banks are well capitalized and are expected to remain strong as the financial cycle turns but the
authorities should monitor risks from rising NPLs.
45.
Structural policies. Implementation of reforms envisaged in the 11th Malaysia Plan and
commitment to freer trade policies should all help anchor structural reforms and raise Malaysia’s
potential growth over the medium term. Further raising the skills of Malaysia’s labor force,
through steadfast implementation of education policies, will be critical in the nation’s drive to
become a high income nation. Recent events underscore the need to uphold high standards of
governance and communication in public financial management.
46.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Figure 1. Malaysia: Growth and Exports
Malaysia’s growth has weakened but remains resilient…

… supported by still robust domestic demand, despite a
drag on private consumption from GST implementation.

Global oil prices have fallen dramatically and the
exchange rate has helped absorb the shock...

… but the current account surplus has declined.

There have been very large declines in exports, measured
in U.S. dollars in all sectors…

…however, a weaker exchange rate helped boost
manufacturing sector volumes until recently.

GST implementation in April 2015 increased core inflation.

The labor market remains tight although the

Policy rates are well calibrated to current conditions.

Broad money growth has declined…

In the post GFC-era, portfolio inflows and outflows have

Foreign holdings of debt securities rose steadily until mid2014 and then declined with outflows from BNM bills and
notes, although foreign holdings of MGS are less affected.

The stock market has declined on equity outflows.

BNM has intervened to cushion the impact of outflows...

Sources: Data provided by the Malaysian authorities; and Fund staff estimates.
1/ Authorities' measure of the overall fiscal balance and the IMF's measure of fiscal balance (net lending/borrowing) are different due to differences in methodology/basis of recording
(GFSM2001 versus authorities' modified-cash based accounting) and differences in the treatment of certain items.
2/ General government includes federal government, state and local governments and statutory bodies. Public sector includes general government and NFPEs.

Appendix I. Malaysia—Staff Policy Advice from the 2013 and 2014 Article IV Consultations
Staff Advice

Policy Actions
Fiscal Policy

Protect the fiscal position in the face of sharply lower oil and gas
prices through gradual, growth-friendly multi-year fiscal adjustment
(2014).

The authorities promptly revised the 2015 and 2016 federal budgets (January
2015 and January 2016 respectively) in response to sharp declines in oil and
gas prices. These timely actions have maintained the federal budget deficit
ceiling close to original targets and were well received by markets and analysts.

Broaden tax bases by implementing a GST and rationalizing tax
incentives (2014, 2013).

The authorities introduced the GST in April 2015. They are undertaking a study
on the effectiveness and costs of tax incentives.

Phase out expensive and poorly targeted fuel subsidies and continue
gradual adjustment of administered prices for electricity and other
services (tolls, utilities). Pass on to consumers changes in fuel prices
with the objective of depoliticizing energy pricing (2014, 2013).

Fuel and other subsidies were removed starting in December 2014. The
authorities have maintained their mechanism of monthly adjustment of fuel
prices ever since. The issue has been depoliticized. Adjustments of toll,
electricity and other utility tariffs are ongoing.

Expand cash transfers to lower income groups as integral component
of fiscal reforms eliminating fuel subsidies and introducing GST (2014,
2013).

Cash transfers to lower income groups have been expanded starting with the
2015 budget. The 2014 Budget announced the creation of a comprehensive
database on welfare recipients which could facilitate better targeting of
transfers.

Gradually bring down federal debt to sustainable levels and balance
the federal budget by 2020. Articulate credible revenue and spending
measures to achieve that target. Introduce a medium-term fiscal
framework (2014, 2013).

The authorities have announced their intention to gradually balance the federal
deficit by 2020, which will result in a substantial decline in the federal debt to
GDP ratio. They still need to identify concrete fiscal consolidation actions to
achieve this. They have developed and published a medium-term fiscal
framework which has been endorsed by the Fiscal Policy Committee.

Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Policies
Move from the current accommodative monetary policy stance
toward a neutral stance consistent with the need to maintain price
stability and curb financial imbalances once the uncertainty
surrounding the global outlook dissipates (2014).

The authorities raised their policy interest rate in mid-2014 but have stayed pat
since in view of continued heightened uncertainty surrounding the external and
global outlooks in key emerging and advanced economies.

Maintain a flexible exchange rate as a shock absorber and a first line
of defense against commodity price and capital flow shocks while
using reserves and intervention to ensure orderly market conditions
and avoid exchange rate overshooting (2014).

The authorities allowed the exchange rate to depreciate substantially in the
face of multiple external shocks while also deploying some of their substantial
reserves buffer to help the economy adjust to lower commodity prices and
capital outflows. Going forward, they agree with staff that reserves will need to
gradually be rebuilt and that they will rely even more on greater exchange rate
flexibility in response to shocks.

Continue to employ macroprudential policies to dampen financial
risks and monitor the increase in leverage throughout the economy,
including in household and corporate debt (2014, 2013).

The authorities maintain macroprudential measures to curb household
indebtedness and an enhanced framework for risk-based pricing to deal with
rising household indebtedness. BNM is collecting granular data on household
debt. These efforts have reduced risk from credit growth and also increased the
resilience of banks. Corporate borrowing in foreign currency is closely
monitored to ensure borrowers are naturally or otherwise hedged.

Structural Policies
Boost growth and productivity through steady implementation of
structural reforms, including reforms to government­linked
companies; liberalization of labor and product markets; and enhanced
education and training.

Many recommendations from previous Article IV reports also form part of the
authorities’ Economic Transformation Program and the Government
Transformation Program. Some progress has been made on the strategic
reform initiatives and the authorities' further plans to boost growth are
discussed in this staff report.

In order to achieve high income status and avoid the middle income
trap, continue to: (i) prioritize infrastructure investment; (ii) further
improve public financial management; (iii) boost spending on
Research and Development to promote home-grown innovation; and
(iv) improve the quality of education with a view to reducing skills
mismatches in the labor force and raising productivity (2014, 2013).

In May 2015 the authorities unveiled their 11th Malaysia Plan, spanning 2016–
2020. The Plan continues the authorities’ efforts to boost public capital through
major infrastructure projects and also emphasizes home grown innovation and
creating the foundations for a knowledge-based society through increased
cooperation between government, education and industry in harnessing
research and development and raising the quality of human capital.

Maintain an economic system that is highly open to trade and
investment. Deepen regional economic integration and the pursuit of
high-quality trade agreements that will gradually lower non-tariff
trade barriers, improve services delivery, anchor growth-friendly
reforms and bring large benefits for Malaysia and its trading partners
(2014).

Malaysia has joined the TPP; the ASEAN Economic Community came into being
in early 2016 following efforts of Malaysia during its ASEAN chair in 2015.

along with a high share of foreign holdings of
MGS and equities makes these markets
vulnerable to risk-on, risk off cycles. This risk is
ameliorated by domestic institutional investors,
who can provide offsetting demand during
risk-off cycles, and the substantial share of
debt denominated in local currency. Recent
and earlier outflow episodes have had limited
impact on credit or the real economy.
Low
As above.
Low/Medium
Weaker external demand would likely dampen
domestic demand, lowering growth and
increasing unemployment.

The exchange rate can provide the first line
of defense. Fiscal reforms to further reduce
the reliance on oil revenues, such as
increasing the GST rate and reducing
exemptions, are critical. Investment in
infrastructure and other productivityboosting structural reforms could reduce
reliance on the energy sector.
The exchange rate should be allowed to
continue to act as a shock absorber,
intervening only to smooth excessive
volatility. Liquidity support (including in
FX) could be provided. If capital outflows
threaten domestic activity, reserve
requirements could be relaxed (as during
the GFC). Given limited fiscal space, any

Low to Medium
Household debt is high at 89.1 percent of GDP
and one half of this is mortgages. Offsetting
this are high household financial assets.
Existing macroprudential policies and
improvements in underwriting standards in
recent years should help curb any increase in
NPLs and ensure the banking system remains
resilient.

Medium
Prolonged weakness in external demand would
likely dampen domestic demand, lowering
growth, increasing unemployment, dampening
housing and asset prices, weakening bank,
corporate, and sovereign balance sheets, in a
negative feedback loop.

As above.
The exchange rate should be allowed to
act as a shock absorber, intervening only
to smooth excessive volatility. A more
accommodative monetary policy stance
could be appropriate, if risks of fueling
further financial imbalances are low. Any
fiscal expansion should be temporary, welltargeted, and anchored in a credible
medium-term consolidation plan.
The ability of policy to provide a long-lived
cushion against a protracted slump is
limited. Policymakers would need to adjust
to slower medium-term growth although
carefully selected infrastructure projects
and structural reforms could increase
productivity.
The authorities’ ability to mount
countercyclical responses would be limited
and policy procyclicality would be
heightened. Continued progress in
reforming fiscal institutions can mitigate
the impact, including adopting a fiscal risks
management framework and publication
of an annual fiscal risks statement, along
with increased transparency of GLC
operations.
Monetary policy easing, exchange rate
flexibility, along with a temporary fiscal
stimulus anchored in a credible mediumterm fiscal sustainability framework, could
help support growth.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in
the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is
meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of
30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the
authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix III. Malaysia—Malaysia’s Trade: The Role of Commodities and China1

A.

Background

Malaysia’s diversified economy. Malaysia has a highly open and diversified economy, with services
accounting for 53.5 percent of GDP. Its exports are likewise diverse, although commodities account
for about 19.2 percent. This appendix examines the effects on Malaysia’s trade of the sharp drop in
commodities prices and the shift in China’s growth model. It also studies the sensitivity of the
current account surplus to lower-for-longer oil and gas prices.

B.

The Role of Commodities and China

Distinct but related phenomena. Although the commodities collapse and China’s rebalancing from
investment to consumption are related, they are distinct phenomena:


The rout in international oil prices is explained mostly by growing global excess supply and by
changes in the structure of oil markets, in particular the resilience of large scale shale oil
production in the United States; decisions by large producers (Saudi Arabia, Russia) to maintain
output in the face of declining prices; the lifting of sanctions on Iran; and continued high levels
of output from, inter alia, Iraq and Libya.



China plays more of a major role in the recent broad-based decline in non-energy commodity
prices, especially of metals where it accounts for about 50 percent of global demand. The
rebalancing of the Chinese economy has led to sharp declines in these prices for two reasons.



Consumption and services use less capital and are less import-intensive in commodities,
especially metals, than investment.
Commodities markets are forward-looking and expectations of slowing growth in China
have also affected prices.



Global financial market volatility also spiked after August 2015, following changes in China’s its
exchange rate policy and sharp stock market decline.



Malaysia is also affected by the slowdown in global and regional trade more generally, which is
driven by technological change, has led to shorter regional and global supply chains, and also
dampened global growth.

C.

Exports and Imports in 2015

Developments in 2015. Malaysia experienced a broad-based decline in the prices of its exports
in 2015. In U.S. dollar terms, export prices fell by about 20 percent. While oil and gas prices declined
by nearly 50 percent, the unit price of palm oil exports fell by about 23 percent. The direct income
loss resulting from lower prices of oil and other commodities at constant 2014 volumes is estimated
1

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

MALAYSIA

at 5.25 percent of GDP. However, depreciation of the ringgit in 2015 boosted export volumes,
including in commodities, thereby mitigating the impact of this steep fall in prices. All in all, exports
declined by 14.6 percent (in U.S. dollar terms) and commodity exports by about 28 percent.2
However, the overall trade balance still remained in surplus, though smaller than in 2014, as imports
also declined in 2015 by about 15.8 percent (in U.S. dollar terms). The decline in the trade balance in
2015 was driven by that in oil and gas trade.

Malaysia’s Trade with China

A view from detailed trade data. Malaysia’s
detailed exports data, decomposed by commodities
and non-commodities and destinations, shed
further light. As discussed above, commodity
exports suffered a sharp decline and much of this
was due to lower prices and to destinations other
than China. For example, Malaysia exports of LNG to
Japan and Korea (two major destinations) declined
significantly. Turning to trade with China, exports to
China averaged 13 percent of total exports during
2011–15. They comprised mostly manufactures,
including intermediate inputs and capital goods
(electrical goods and electronics and other
machinery), all part of the regional supply chain, as
well as non-energy commodities such as palm oil.
Exports to China fell by about 8 percent in 2015 (in
U.S. dollar terms), driven by a fall in machinery and
transport equipment exports (about 50 percent of
total exports to China), while exports of
commodities broadly remained resilient. Despite
this significant drop, data show that China’s imports
from Malaysia were relatively less affected than that
from most of the other countries in the region.

The Current Account: Malaysia is Not Headed for a Twin Deficit

Background. Malaysia’s current account surplus fell from 4.3 percent of GDP in 2014 to 2.9 percent
in 2015 as the oil and gas trade surplus shrank by 1.2 percentage points of GDP driven by the
negative impact of lower mineral fuel prices. The non-oil and gas trade deficit (around 2 percent of
GDP) and services and income account balances were largely unchanged from 2014.

In ringgit terms, exports were up by nearly 2 percent in 2015, while commodity exports were down by close to
14 percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAYSIA

The impact of lower-for-longer oil on the current account. In light of the importance of “twin
deficits” as signals of countries’ external and fiscal vulnerabilities, it is useful to ask whether
Malaysia’s current account could turn negative if oil prices collapsed further and remained
depressed over the medium term. This is an extreme scenario in which oil prices decline to around
$10–15 per barrel over the medium term—that is lower by close to 60 percent over the medium
term over the baseline. The conclusion is that Malaysia’s overall CA balance is unlikely to go into
deficit just because oil price fall to $10–15 per barrel level over the medium term. This extreme oil
price shock alone is not as severe as the CA shock scenario in the external DSA. The following
considerations are relevant:


Oil: the effect of a permanent oil shock. The medium-term impact on Malaysia’s external
position of an extremely large permanent shock to oil prices can be ascertained by
examining the effect of changes in oil prices on the ratio of the current account (CA) balance
in relation to GDP (CA/GDP). Under the same volumes as in the baseline, we assume oil
prices are permanently in the range of $10–15 barrel. Moreover, we take into account the
impact on nonoil export prices using the same elasticity to oil price change as in the baseline
but applied to the above oil price path. Under these assumptions, the CA balance drops to
0.7 percent of GDP over 2016-21, as compared to a baseline of 1.8 percent of GDP.



CA elasticities. Between 2006 and 2015, the average elasticity of the ratio of the current
account balance in relation to GDP (CA/GDP) to oil price changes was -0.4, although this
reflects a trend fall in the nonoil-and-gas CA balance. The oil and LNG trade balance has
been fairly stable around 6 percent of GDP since 2006 (2015: 5 percent of GDP). Only 2009
and 2015 saw bigger swings in this balance, with 2009 witnessing a 2.3 percentage points of
GDP drop from the peak of 7.5 percent of GDP in 2008 (2015 change was –1.2 percentage
points of GDP). So, the true elasticity of CA/GDP to oil price changes would be lower.



Robustness checks. While oil prices do not have much impact on imports as oil and gas
imports are small, if the further drop in oil prices assumed above is related to global demand
factors, import deflator should also fall, leading to a lower import for the same volume. Also,
given that this is a large shock, there could be import compression from slower domestic
demand and/or impact of exchange rate depreciation that might ensue, which is abstracted
from here. As a result, changes in imports may offset the 1.1 percentage drop in CA balance
mentioned above. In fact, adjusting the non-oil import deflator the same way as the non-oil
export deflator above, the deterioration in CA balance is very small.3

GVAR analysis. Using a dynamic multi-country approach for the analysis of international
transmission of shocks4, it is shown that a 1 percent permanent negative GDP shock in China could
have significant effects on ASEAN-5 countries through trade and commodity price channels. The
shock reduces growth in Malaysia by 0.3 percentage points following a 1 percent one-off shock to
3
The elasticity of nonoil deflator to changes in oil deflator is higher in the case of imports, likely reflecting the
demand side impact.

GDP growth in China. Malaysia is the second country most affected, after Singapore. Furthermore, if
China’s growth slowdown coincides with global financial market volatility, it has the potential to
create even larger spillovers to Malaysia, reaching 0.5 percentage points after one year.
Conclusion. China is Malaysia’s largest trading partner and spillovers through the trade and
commodity channels are relatively important. Malaysia’s exports to China comprise mostly
manufactures which are part of the regional supply chain. Malaysia is also a major exporter of palm
oil and other non-oil commodities to China. Quantitatively, developments in China have had a
significant impact on Malaysia thus far. Moreover, Malaysia’s CA balance is unlikely to go into deficit
in an extreme lower-for-longer oil scenario. Going forward, lower imports by China of manufactures
and higher imports of services and consumption goods are likely to hurt commodities exporters but
could benefit exporters of consumer services, like tourism, health and other services. Malaysia has a
comparative advantage in some of these areas and could be a beneficiary. Malaysia could also stand
to benefit from Chinese direct investment as Chinese producers relocate some of their production

financed by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank based in Beijing.

Appendix IV. Malaysia—Malaysia’s Government-Linked Companies: An Update1
Overview. Malaysia’s Federal Government owns (partially or wholly) a wide range of companies.
These entities are strategic investors and companies, created with the aim of fostering national
development while remaining competitive and delivering strong financial performance. Their savings
and investment and response to large shocks, including the sharp drop in energy and commodity
prices and large ringgit depreciation in 2014–15, are also macroeconomically and fiscally important.
We can identify three groups:
1. Government-Linked Investment Companies (GLICs). There are five GLICs namely:
Employees Provident Fund (EPF), Khazanah Nasional Berhad (Khazanah), Lembaga Tabung
Angkatan Tentera (LTAT), Lembaga Tabung Haji (LTH) and Permodalan Nasional Berhad
(PNB).
2. Government-Linked Companies (GLCs). These companies have a primary commercial
objective and are under the control of a GLIC. A GLIC has control over a GLC when it is the
majority shareholder or single largest shareholder and when it has the ability to exercise and
influence major decisions such as appointment of board members and senior management,
award of tenders and contracts and so on.
3. G20. This is a selection of large GLCs controlled by GLICs and is used as a proxy for
performance of the GLCs. This list originally comprised of 20 GLCs but currently totals 17
due to various mergers, demergers and other corporate exercises over the years.
Scope. GLCs and GLICs encompass a broad spectrum and operate in almost all of sectors of the
economy: banking and insurance, airlines and airports, transportation, water, energy,
telecommunications, automotive, chemical and petrochemical, construction and infrastructure,
media and communications, etc. PETRONAS, the national oil company, is a Fortune 500 company.
Maybank, with presence in twenty countries, is now the fourth largest banking group by assets in
ASEAN, and its Islamic banking division is the third largest Islamic bank in the world. CIMB, with
operations in 17 countries, is now the fifth largest banking group in South East Asia. Axiata is one
the largest telecommunication players in the region by market capitalization and revenue, with over
260 million customers across eight countries. Sime Darby has grown to become the world’s largest
listed oil palm plantation company and is a leader in the production of certified sustainable palm oil.
Governance. GLCs were created with the aim of fostering national development. They operate
within a clear governance structure and are expected to deliver financial performance, catalyze
nation building and serve stakeholder interests. The authorities are committed to excellence in GLC
management and encourage a culture of high performance in these companies. The Putrajaya
Committee on GLC High Performance coordinates the initiatives and is chaired by the Prime
Minister.
Financial metrics. GLCs employ more than 270,000 people and their operations are international in
scope. About 35 percent of GLC employees are foreigners and more than one third are in overseas
operations. The market capitalization of the G20 was about 35 percent of GDP in 2014. Net profits
were 2.5 percent of GDP. The average ROE was 11 percent per annum in the last decade. Their
revenue amounted to 21 percent of GDP in 2014, with a quarter of it being bank revenue. Among

non-banking revenue, a quarter comes from the power sector, 17 percent from telecommunications,
17 percent automotive, 11 percent trading, 10 percent air transportation and 7 percent plantations.
GLC Transformation Program. The strengthening of GLC financial performance follows a 10-year
GLC transformation program May 2004–July 2015. This program focused on enhancing GLC financial
performance, institutionalizing good corporate governance, and contributing to national
development as enshrined in the New Economic Model (NEM), Government Transformation
Program (GTP) and Economic Transformation Program (ETP).2 During this period, in addition to the
growth in GLC capitalization and increase in profits and shareholder returns, GLCs and GLICs
became stronger and expanded regionally and internationally. The G20 have revenue-generating
operations in 42 countries and draw 34 percent of total revenue from abroad (2004: 28 percent) with
an overseas asset base of 26 percent (2004: 11 percent). Following graduation from the GLC
Transformation Program, a GLIC and GLC club aims to uphold the principles of the GLC
Transformation Program. The aim is for GLCs and GLICs to contribute to national development goals
as enshrined in the 11th Malaysia Plan.
PETRONAS is Malaysia’s national oil company. Its macroeconomic importance is sufficient to merit
in depth discussion. It is fully integrated in oil and gas and it is ranked among the largest
corporations on FORTUNE Global 500. It has about 40,000 employees. Operating its core business in
the upstream and downstream sectors, it has a presence in more than 50 countries since it was first
incorporated in 1974. Among the oil and gas companies in Asia, it is the top five in terms of
production and is the most profitable of all.
At the end of 2015, PETRONAS registered total assets of 51 percent of GDP; current assets are
16.2 percent of GDP; total debt is 15.2 percent of GDP; revenue was 22.8 percent of GDP in 2015,
down from 30 percent in 2014 reflecting the decline in oil prices; and the profits before taxation
were 3.2 percent of GDP in 2015, down from 7 percent in 2014. In 2015, earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization were 6.5 percent of GDP, similar to the cash flow from operating
activities, which was 6 percent, and to the capital expenditures, which were 5.6 percent.
The company is profitable and financially sound; however, revenue and profits fell markedly with oil
prices starting in late 2014. PETRONAS has announced large expenditure cuts, most notably a
50 billion ringgit (4.5 percent of GDP) reduction in capital expenditure over the next four years,
affecting mostly its foreign operations. The company is expected to remain profitable as it is
assessed to be a low cost producer.
Macroeconomic relevance. GLCs’ size and response to shocks are macroeconomically important.
GLCs are significant drivers of corporate profits and savings and their investment projects form an
important part of the five year national development plan. GLCs are profitable, subject to market
discipline, and their investment is financed in part out of earnings and issuance of debt and equity.
Starting in late 2014, lower commodity prices were reflected in lower corporate earnings and GLC
savings. PETRONAS and other GLCs adjusted their dividend payments to the federal budget with a
one year lag.3 GLCs also continued implementing domestic investment programs even as they cut
2

See Appendix 9 in IMF Country Report 14/80.

PETRONAS profits for 2015 declined to RM 21 billion from RM 48 billion in 2014. The PETRONAS dividend paid in
2015 was RM 26 billion, down from RM 29 billion in 2014. In 2016, the budget anticipates a lower dividend of
RM 16 billion.

back international capital expenditure plans. Together, these responses by the GLC permitted
national investment to remain resilient while allowing breathing room for offsetting federal budget
measures to kick in, thus providing a two-pronged help to the adjustment process. Looking ahead,
GLC deficits are expected to gradually decline as cost cutting measures as well as exchange rate
depreciation help to boost competitiveness and profitability and investment plans are adjusted in
light with the new lower-for-longer prices for oil and other commodities.
PETRONAS is the largest corporation in the non-financial public sector and has a large impact in
the consolidated fiscal accounts. The overall deficit of the non-financial public corporations (NFPCs)
in 2015 is estimated to rise by RM 30.9 billion or 82 percent, to RM 68.4 billion (Table IV.1). The
increase in the deficit is due to the decline in revenue by RM 70.7 billion to RM 400.7 billion. Current
NFPC expenditure declined by RM 45.4 billion to RM 357.8 billion. The decline in revenue by
15 percent was partly offset by lower current expenditure (a decline of 11.3 percent), resulting in a
decline of the current NFPC balance by RM 25.2 billion to RM 42.9 billion. In addition, the estimated
increase in the NFPC deficit is also due to increase in capital expenditure by RM 7.7 billion to
RM 113.4 billion.
PETRONAS alone is estimated to experience a drop in cash revenue of RM 75.5 billion to
RM 261.9 billion and a decrease in operating cash expenditure of RM 53.5 billion to RM 236.4 billion.
The decrease in revenue was partly mitigated by the decline in operating expenditure, resulting in a
decline in the current balance by RM 25.2 billion in 2015. Of the RM 7.7 billion increase in capital
expenditure, RM 5.6 billion was contributed by PETRONAS while Prasarana Sdn Bhd is estimated to
account for RM 3.2 billion.

Appendix V. Malaysia—Fiscal Reforms and Growth During an Earlier Oil Price
Slump1
Background. Malaysia is an upper middle income country whose diversified and highly open
economy has been being buffeted by multiple shocks recently, including sharply lower oil and gas
prices for its energy exports and repercussions from China’s growth slowdown and economic policy
rebalancing. The authorities’ fiscal policy responses from 2014 to the present have been timely,
decisive and consistent. They include large cuts in poorly targeted fuel subsidies and other nonpriority spending and the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST) in April 2015, which
helped to broaden Malaysia’s revenue base and diversified it away from volatile oil and gas related
revenues.
Lessons from 1986. Fiscal reforms from an earlier era of Malaysia’s recent economic history—those
unleashed after the collapse in oil prices in 1986—contain useful lessons for policymakers in
Malaysia and elsewhere. This appendix summarizes Malaysia’s fiscal policy and, in particular, its
public investments in physical infrastructure and human capital and finds that these investments
have made important contributions to economic growth. The appendix also outlines challenges
facing Malaysia’s fiscal policy going forward, which include the need to improve the quality of
education and the efficiency of spending.
Fiscal policy and endogenous growth. Endogenous growth theory provides the analytical
framework for studying the effects of fiscal policy on long-term growth. Fiscal policy can impact
growth through several channels: public investments in infrastructure and in research and
development ameliorate market failures and negative externalities. Infrastructure helps to raise the
supply of local, regional and global public goods, broadly construed to include soft capital (law and
order and secure property rights) as well as hard infrastructure (roads and networks). Public
spending on research and development helps to increase the stock of productive knowledge
available to private firms and households.2,3,4 Public investments in health and education also help
augment human capital and avoid inefficient under-investments, which are common among
children from poor families given imperfections in markets for student loans. Public investments in
education help to lift worker productivity and allow families to escape poverty traps, thereby
lowering income inequality and promoting inclusion. There are also strong arguments5 that there
are positive external effects on economic growth emanating from human capital investments.
Calibrating an endogenous growth model. The dividend from growth-friendly fiscal reforms can
be assessed using an endogenous growth model along the lines described in the recent IMF Board
Paper.6 In the model, long run growth is possible because accumulation of public and human capital

offset diminishing returns to physical capital accumulation. Fiscal policy can increase growth
through a variety of channels: capital and labor tax cuts raise post-tax return on investment in
physical and human capital, and higher public investment raises total factor productivity and growth
by increasing the ratio of public to private capital stocks. A budget-balance neutral simulation of the
model where capital and labor taxes are reduced by 5 percentage points and offset by higher
consumption taxes increase the long run growth rate by close to one half of 1 percent relative to the
initial steady state. Similarly, when public

reforms lasted until 1990 and provide
lessons for the future given the similar situation now with the recent collapse in oil prices. Malaysia’s
reforms at the time amounted to a large expenditure-based adjustment, featuring large cuts in
current spending. The economy was deregulated and the tax system was reformed. Crucially, public
enterprises (the government-linked companies or GLCs) were rehabilitated and privatized, resulting
in a smaller public sector and less crowding out of private investment. Altogether this package of
reforms helped to spur private investment and FDI inflows. In order to assess the potential impact of
these reforms on Malaysia’s growth, a novel approach—the synthetic control method—was used to
create a counterfactual version of Malaysia’s growth path in the absence of fiscal reforms.7 Using this
method, the estimated growth dividend of fiscal and economic reforms was substantial, close to
2.25 percent. Growth averaged about 7 percent in the decade preceding reform (1976–1985), in line
with peers, and about 7.25 percent in the following decade (1991–2000), compared to about
5 percent in the synthetic control group. In addition to the growth enhancing effects Malaysia’s
reforms were also associated with substantial declines in income inequality. The Gini coefficient after
taxes and transfers declined by about 5 points.

Improving the quality of education.8 Malaysia has also made important strides to improve access
to education. Enrollment rates for secondary education are rising and Malaysia has done better than
some of its peers. In addition, the gap with

and educational attainment—what students actually
learn as opposed to input—based measures like money spent on education or years of schooling.
This research underscores that improving Malaysia’s educational attainment in absolute terms and
among its peers in the region would create substantial growth dividends.
Cognizant of the stakes involved, the Malaysian authorities have devised an ambitious plan that
aims to raise the percentage of highly educated workforce to 33 percent by 2020 and to increase
productivity by creating skilled and human capital. The objective is to create a workforce that can
utilize knowledge creatively and that possesses flexible and adaptable skills and the ability to
enhance knowledge through lifelong learning. Similarly, one of the six strategic thrusts of the 11th
Malaysia Plan is to accelerate human capital development and provide students a with “21st century
education.” Steadfast implementation of the education blueprint and of the 11th Malaysia Plan’s
human capital development objectives will be needed to meet these goals.
Recent fiscal reforms have helped to improve the composition of government spending, which has
historically been skewed toward social benefits and subsidies. Starting in late 2014, poorly targeted

and costly fuel and other subsidies have been eliminated, with appropriate compensatory measures
to offset the impact on lower income households. On net, recent data show that the share of social
benefits and subsidies has declined. Another noteworthy feature is the high level government
investment, whose share in Malaysia exceeds the average for all emerging market economies.
Conclusions. The conclusions in the FAD board paper are worth reiterating. Fiscal reforms make a
difference for long-term growth: the evidence shows that growth increased by 0.75 percentage
points in advanced economies and by even more in developing economies. Malaysia’s experience
underlines that reforms should be tailored to country-specific conditions and that their design
matters: they are more effective when they are mutually reinforcing and when they are
complemented by structural and macroeconomic policies. Lastly, when reforms are large and
complex, reforms must contain measures to avoid equity-efficiency trade-offs in order to gain
broad-based support.

Appendix VI. Malaysia—Exchange Market Pressure1
Several global events during 2015—a sharp decline in the global oil prices, financial market volatility
related to the developments in China, and the expectation of monetary policy normalization in the
U.S.—impacted emerging market economy (EME) currencies. Malaysia was no exception and the
exchange market pressure (EMP) was significant, higher than that in the median EME (Figure VI.1)2.
The ringgit depreciated by about 19 percent against the U.S. dollar, while the Bank Negara Malaysia
deployed about 18 percent of its foreign exchange (FX) reserves to cushion the capital outflows.
However, the impact on Malaysia’s domestic financial markets was relatively muted (Figure VI.1).
Among the EMEs, Malaysia’s goods exports has a relatively high exposure to China, although lower
than some of the Latin American countries, while its exposure to commodity exports (defined as
SITC 0-4 categories together) in total exports is similar to the median EMEs (Figure V.1). On the
financial flows, Malaysia received relatively large inflows and its outstanding non-FDI liabilities were
about 80 percent of GDP in 2014 (median for the EME: 49 percent of GDP).
Staff analysis, similar in spirit to Aizenman and Hutchison, finds that the country’s characteristics as
of end-2014 (i.e. the initial conditions) in terms of export exposures to mineral fuel, China, and
Russia; change in credit-to-GDP ratio and change in the real effective exchange rate (REER) in the
preceding 2-3 years; and the share of FX denominated debt in nonfinancial corporate and
household debt helped explain the variation in EMP in 2015 across the sample3. Regression models
with several other indicators of initial conditions did not perform well. These additional indicators
included expected growth and inflation differentials vis-à-vis the U.S.; trade openness; current
account balance and it is expected change in 2015; non-FDI external liabilities; monetary policy
framework; FX reserve cover; and banks’ loan-to-deposit ratio.
Based on the results from the better-fitted models (Table VI.2), it appears that Malaysia’s EMP, and
the associated depreciation of ringgit against the U.S. dollar, were broadly in line with that predicted
by the cross-country experience. Export exposure to China and exports of mineral fuels had nearly
equal importance in explaining Malaysia’s EMP in 2015 (models A3 and A6), but the former seems to
have played a greater role in explaining the behavior of ringgit against the U.S. dollar (model B5).
However, caution should be exercised in interpreting these results as the regression models do not
fit well for all the countries, given the small sample size and the likelihood of omitted variable bias.

2 The sample of EMEs is drawn from the Fund’s Vulnerability Exercise for the EMs, excluding mainly those belonging
to a common currency area and/or those who availed themselves of financial support from the Fund in 2015. In this
analysis, EMP is defined as the sum of the percentage changes in the bilateral exchange rate against the U.S. dollar
and in the central bank’s FX reserves. Alternative measures of EMP, for example, change in FX reserves relative to the
base money or FX market interventions through other than the central bank, were not used due to data limitations.
However, country rankings with respect to different measures of EMPs are expected to be highly correlated.

Appendix VII. Malaysia—Stress Testing Resilience to Capital Outflows1
A. Background
1.
Past resilience. Malaysia’s highly open economy has demonstrated substantial resilience to
capital flow shocks and exchange market pressure since the GFC. Growth has averaged about
5.7 percent per annum since 2009, amid conditions of low inflation, full employment and low real
interest rates. And while the external surplus has declined, it remains comfortably positive. Skillful
macroeconomic management, including a flexible exchange rate and well timed counter cyclical
fiscal policies, have played an important role in achieving resilience. Active forex intervention to
cushion the impact of capital flows volatility on the economy was also an important component of
the strategy. It helped to avoid exchange rate overshooting, ensured orderly market conditions, and
stable monetary conditions at home in the face of large and volatile capital flows. And, as elaborated
below, financial cushions other than reserves were also important in the strategy to deal with
reversals in capital flows, including during the taper tantrum, decline in oil prices and heightened
concerns about spillovers from China. Malaysia has important structural strengths: it continues to run
current account surpluses, an important feature that separates Malaysia from twin-deficit economies.
A decade of large current account surpluses, strong capital inflows, and a high savings rate have
created “a structural liquidity surplus”, reflected in the accumulation of sizeable foreign currency
reserves. In addition, there are several large institutional investors, such as the pension funds, the
sovereign wealth fund (Khazanah Nasional) and the national oil company (PETRONAS), that can
provide a cushion in turbulent times. Since the Asian financial crisis, a key policy priority has been to
develop deep financial markets, and in particular, local currency bond markets; and Malaysia’s bond
markets are now the third largest in Asia.
2.
New vulnerabilities. Although Malaysia has dealt successfully with outflow episodes since
the GFC, the current environment presents new vulnerabilities. Malaysia’s current account surplus has
declined significantly to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2015

government (text table). External debt has increased
from 55 percent of GDP at end-2010 to 65.6 percent at end-2015, with the increase primarily driven
by capital inflows into local currency debt securities. However, local currency-denominated debt is
36 percent of total external debt, implying that “original sin” is less of an issue.
3.
Outline. There are two parts to this appendix. Section B provides a detailed discussion of the
components of Malaysia’s external debt, identifying the potential vulnerabilities associated with each

type of debt. A key finding is that not all components of external debt present the same risk and
significant buffers should be taken into account in assessing Malaysia’s external debt. The final
section illustrates a tail-risk severe stress scenario—not unlike the GFC—where Malaysia faces a
sharp slowdown in global growth and large capital outflows triggering currency depreciation and a
further narrowing of the current account surplus. In this modified sudden stop scenario, the flexible
exchange rate, forex intervention, and the response of domestic institutional investors all play an
important role in mitigating the impact of the capital flow reversal and helping buffer the shock to
the Malaysian economy. Nevertheless, such a scenario would lead to a further significant decline in
reserves. Reduced fiscal space compared with during the GFC limits the scope for counter-cyclical
fiscal policy.

B. External Debt: Composition, Risks and Buffers
4.
Composition of external debt. Several trends have driven the increase in external debt
since end-2010, most significantly the increase in foreign holdings of local currency debt securities,
both short-term and medium- and long-term. The text figure shows a decomposition of Malaysia’s
external debt by currency and maturity. The largest increases took place in short-term and mediumand long-term local currency denominated debt, reflecting the increase in foreign holdings of both
Malaysian Government Securities (MGS) and BNM bills and notes. Foreign holdings of MGS
increased from 9.1 percent of GDP (at end-2010) to 14.0 percent of GDP at end 2015. Short-term
local currency external debt includes both non-resident deposits and foreign holdings of BNM bills
and notes. The latter had also increased significantly, reaching 7.5 percent of GDP at end-2013 but
has since declined to near zero as capital flows reversed. Short-term banking sector FX debt has also
increased, from 8.2 percent of GDP at end-2010 to 15.2 percent by end 2015. Finally, exchange rate
depreciation since mid-2014, along with US$5billion bond issuance by PETRONAS in March 2015, has
increased medium-term FX denominated debt to 27 percent of GDP at end-2015 (up from
21 percent of GDP at end-2014).

sheet and wound down during outflows, helping to insulate the economy from swings in capital
flows. Outstanding issuance of BNM bills and notes peaked at end-2012 at just over US$50 billion, of
which half were held by foreigners (see text chart). Foreign holdings were broadly unchanged in
U.S. dollar terms until end-2014, although their share increased above 55 percent. Since then
portfolio rebalancing along with the decline in oil prices has contributed to non-resident selling and
liquidation on maturity. As a result, foreign holdings declined to less than US$6 billion. Throughout
the post-GFC period, changes in foreign holdings of BNM bills and notes and changes in reserves
have tended to move together, although as the market shrank during 2015, the co-movement
declined. The decline in foreign holdings of BNM bills and notes represented about one-third of the
US$36.5 billion decline in reserves between July 2014 and end-2015.

6.
The Malaysian Government securities (MGS) market. The MGS market is deep and liquid,
due in part to the role of several large domestic institutional investors, including the pension funds
and insurance companies. Federal government debt in Malaysia amounted to 54.5 percent of GDP at
end 2015 and comprised MGS, sukuk bonds referred to as Government Investment Issues (GII),
external debt, Treasury bills and others. Outstanding MGS and GII are about 29.5 and 17.8 percent of
GDP, respectively, and for many domestic investors, MGS and GII are close substitutes. By contrast,
foreign investors distinguish between these securities; foreign participation in the GII market is
significantly lower, at just 4 percent of the market compared with 45 percent of the MGS market
(amounting to 13.3 percent of GDP). The second largest holder of MGS is the EPF whose holdings
amount to 20 percent of outstanding MGS. The share of MGS in EPFs portfolio declined as the EPF
increased overseas investments partially offsetting the impact of increased foreign participation in
the MGS market.
7.
The role of domestic institutional investors. Malaysia’s deep-pocketed institutional
investors play an important role in providing depth and stabilizing its financial markets. During times
of stress, market-based and opportunistic purchases by domestic investors offset pressures in the
MGS market when foreigners exit, for example during the Taper Tantrum in 2013 and other outflow
episodes.2 As a result MGS yields tend to be much less volatile compared to yields in other EM
counties. In addition, yields are less influenced by common global factors; analysis in the GFSR (2015)
shows that the correlation between MGS yields and the common factor in emerging market bond
2

For example, EPF’s holdings of MGS increased by RM 9.4 billion between end-June 2014 and end-September 2015.

56

yields is lower than for other countries with similar levels of foreign ownership. This behavior by the
domestic investors helps prevent sharp increases in MGS yields and in turn protects the real
economy. This financial adjustment to shocks has contributed significantly to Malaysia’s resilience in
recent years (for further discussion, see Appendix 8, 2013 Article IV consultation for Malaysia). The
large insurance companies can also play a role in stabilizing the MGS market; this would occur
mostly through portfolio reallocations along the yield curve (rather than through increased holdings).
8.
Balance sheet analysis. Whether domestic investors can continue to support the MGS
market will depend on the strength of their balance sheets and capacity to reallocate the portfolios.
Using balance sheet information for Malaysia’s largest institutional investors, staff’s analysis suggests
that domestic investors have the capacity to purchase an additional 5 percent of GDP of domestic
securities (table VII.1). The illustrative calculations are based on third quarter data for 2015 and rely
on assumptions regarding the current allocation of assets into MGS compared with an estimated
target allocation (based on the investors’ strategic investment plans). This represents the capacity
under the ‘stock’ heading and is estimated to be about 0.5 percent of GDP. In addition, there is a
flow component based on new contributions in the case of the EPF and on maturing assets for banks
and other investors. This calculation assumes the target allocation is maintained. Furthermore, the
EPF has significant overseas assets that could be repatriated if Malaysia experienced significant
capital outflows leading to a depreciated exchange rate which implies that the share of assets
invested overseas moves above the strategic asset allocation. It is assumes that about 20 percent of
overseas assets could be readily liquidated and repatriated, although this is a somewhat conservative
assumption.

Short-term debt of the banking system. The short-term debt of the banking system has
increased from just under 15 percent of GDP in early 2009 to 22.9 at end-2015. Broadly speaking this
debt is comprised of short-term offshore debt and non-resident deposits (see text chart). Off-shore
borrowing appears to be primarily related to centralization of treasury operations in Malaysia of the
overseas subsidiaries of the local banks. This debt is matched—in terms of size—by liquid assets. The
text chart shows the external assets and liabilities of the banks, which together amount to about
10 percent of GDP. In a stress scenario, to the extent that this portion of bank balance sheets is
unwound smoothly, there would be no call on reserves. On the other hand, non-resident deposits
could represent a vulnerability during a capital flight episode.

Medium- and long-term debt. Foreign-currency denominated medium- and long-term
debt amounts to 26.9 percent of GDP and is primarily related to the public enterprises (8.4 percent of
GDP) and the private non-bank sector (8.4 percent of GDP). As discussed in Appendix X on corporate
sector debt, foreign currency denominated corporate sector in Malaysia is predominantly hedged,
either naturally or through financial instruments, reducing balance sheet risks associated with FX
denominated debt. Stress testing indicates that Malaysia’s corporates can be resilient to declines in
income, depreciation of the exchange rate, and increases in interest rates.

C. A Stress Scenario
11.
A stress scenario. This extreme stress scenario assumes an external shock of similar scope
and magnitude to the GFC, assumed to be a rare event. In this tail-risk scenario, Malaysia is assumed
to face a sharp contraction in external demand along with a sharp reversal of capital flows. As a
result, the current account surplus shrinks amid outflows from the domestic debt securities and
equity markets. In this context, the exchange rate is assumed to depreciate by 25 percent, bond
yields increase by 200 basis points, and the stock market decline by 30 percent.3
12.
Baseline. Malaysia has significant external
financing needs, reflecting short-term debt and
amortization of medium- and long-term debt
amounting to 38 percent of GDP. In the baseline
scenario, the external financing needs are largely
met by debt and net equity inflows, offsetting net
FDI outflow.
13.
Stress scenario assumptions. The following
assumptions are made with regard to capital
outflows. (Table VII.2)

Foreign holdings of MGS. These are assumed to fall by half in ringgit terms, calibrated based on
outflows during the GFC when holdings declined by 50 percent. However, the stock of MGS held
by foreigners is much larger, both relative to GDP and market share, so the magnitude of the
shock is now much greater than during the GFC. Therefore, it is assumed that MGS yields
increase by 200 basis points4 which in turn causes domestic institutional investors to
opportunistically reallocate their on-shore and off-shore asset holdings into the MGS market. An
increase of 200bps in bond yields implies a reduction in bond prices of 8.5 percent (based on the
assumption of a 5-year bond currently trading at par). Therefore, foreign investors seeking to
reduce holdings of MGS would face losses on two fronts: capital losses from the sale of bonds
and valuation loss from the depreciation of the exchange rate. Given initial holdings of

3

Bond yields are assumed to increase reflecting tighter liquidity in the bond market; however, it is assumed that BNM
would not increase policy rates in an attempt to reduce capital outflows.

4

By contrast during the GFC yields initially increased by up to 100 bps during early 2008 but subsequently declined as
central banks around the world loosened their monetary stance. As a result average yields during 2008 were slightly
lower than in 2007. The assumed increase in yields is significantly larger than during the Taper Tantrum episode when
yields increased temporarily by about 70 basis points between May and end-July.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

MALAYSIA

US$37.8billion, a reduction in foreign holdings by 50 percent, taking into account capital and
exchange rate losses, would imply an outflow of US$14.5billion.


Rollover rate for short-term debt. It is assumed that the rollover rate for banks’ short-term
debt declines to 70 percent, based on the decline in short-term debt between September 2009
and March 2010. This assumption is applied only to that portion of debt estimated to be
unrelated to banks’ treasury operations; any drawdown of short-term debt related to liquidity
management is offset by an equal decline in short-term assets and therefore would not create a
call on reserves. Such a reduction in the rollover rate would create an outflow of US$5.2billion.



Non-resident deposits. An outflow of non-resident deposits of 30 percent is assumed,
calibrated based on the reduction in short-term debt. It is assumed that non-resident deposits
are primarily denominated in local currency and, as a result, this creates an outflow of
US$4.8billion.



Foreign-holdings of equities. These are assumed to fall by 20 percent in ringgit terms, implying
a fall in the foreign participation rate from 21.6 percent to 17.3 percent. This is significantly larger
than the decline during the GFC when the foreign participation rate declined from 22 percent
in 2008 to 21 percent in 2009. Outflows are sizeable at US$10billion but are mitigated by a
decline in the stock prices of 30 percent (assumed to be smaller than the 45 percent during the
GFC) and the 25 percent depreciation of the exchange rate.



Current account balance. In the baseline, Malaysia’s external financing needs are offset by a
sizeable current account surplus. It is assumed that the current account balance shrinks to zero
but will not fall into deficit. In the stress scenario, the exchange rate depreciation would help
offset the impact of the large external demand shock through expenditure switching.



Net FDI flows. Malaysia has sizeable inward and outward FDI flows which are about 3.2 percent
of GDP each in 2015. In the stress scenario, Malaysian companies are likely to scale back outward
FDI investment. However, inward FDI could also be reduced due to the shock, and therefore no
change in net FDI flows is assumed in this scenario.



Repatriation by domestic investors. The balance sheet analysis of Malaysia’s institutional
investors highlighted the sizeable overseas assets of Malaysia’s institutional investors. These were
conservatively estimated at 3.3 percent of GDP, equivalent to US$9.3billion, and create a new
inflow in the stress scenario. In the absence of these inflows, the increase in MGS yields would
likely be greater, increasing the capital losses for fleeing foreign investors.

Conclusions. We considered a modified sudden stop scenario which resulted in a sizable
external financing gap, a sharp depreciation of the exchange rate and a spike in bond yields. The
weak currency and low asset prices triggered a repatriation of foreign assets, along with reduced
outward FDI flows, would help close the gap. Reserves would be deployed to help smooth market
volatility and maintain orderly market conditions during the outflows; as a result, reserves are
projected to decline by US$25.2billion. The composition of the adjustment assumed in this scenario
is in line with other recent outflow episodes where the adjustment was shared by reductions in
reserves and changes in the exchange rate.

Mandate. BNM has a dual monetary policy mandate, “to maintain price stability while giving
due regard to the developments in the economy,” which in recent years has meant maintaining a low
inflation of about 3 percent and positive and low real interest rates conducive to sustainable growth
of the Malaysian economy. In addition, BNM is tasked with ensuring financial stability through its
regulation and supervision of financial institutions under its jurisdiction, and with promoting a sound
and inclusive financial system. In discharging its financial stability mandate, BNM works closely with
Malaysia’s Securities Commission and other financial regulators in the Financial Stability Committee.
The emphasis on sustainable growth over the medium-term distinguishes BNM’s mandate from
inflation targeting and other regimes.
2.
Instruments. BNM’s principal policy instrument is the overnight policy rate (OPR) although it
also uses other tools at times, including the exchange rate and reserve requirements, to deliver
monetary and financial stability. BNM has been successful in promoting monetary stability and
Malaysia’s inflation has been relatively stable.

Philippines, and Indonesia) which, unlike Malaysia,
employ an inflation targeting framework. The estimated coefficient on the lagged policy rate is large
implying a high degree of interest rate smoothing. Estimates of Taylor rules for BNM suggest that its
monetary policy rule is more gradualist than typical. Compared with other ASEAN countries the
estimated inflation reaction coefficient is lower and generally insignificant for Malaysia, with the
empirical results suggesting greater relevance for inflation expectations than either headline or core
inflation. By contrast, the output gap reaction coefficient is positive and significant for Malaysia
whereas for the other ASEAN countries it is insignificant, reflecting Malaysia’s dual mandate. The
results suggest little role for the changes in the exchange rate in influencing policy rate decisions.
Higher global uncertainty (captured with either a global financial crisis dummy or the VIX) tended to
lower policy rates in Malaysia; U.S. interest rates have a positive impact on domestic policy rates in
Malaysia but the estimated size of the impact is small.

4.
Managing the capital flow cycle. In recent years BNM has relied on both foreign reserves
and the exchange rate to cushion the impact on the economy of swings in capital flows,
commodities prices, and other external shocks. When capital inflows to EMEs surged following the
GFC, BNM partly sterilized the liquidity impact of inflows through the issuance of bills which were
purchased both by domestic residents, primarily banks, and also by foreigners. Increases in foreign
holdings of BNM bills were matched by similarly sized changes in reserves. This helped limit
appreciation of the ringgit and kept domestic real and nominal interest rates from falling as much as
they would otherwise have. When the capital flow cycle turned, starting in mid-2013, and especially
following the collapse in energy and other commodity prices starting in late 2014, reserves
accumulated during inflow surges along with substantial ringgit depreciation were used to cushion
the impact of outflows. Again, the impact on domestic interest rates was modest, shielding
Malaysia’s real economy from interest rate volatility typical in other EMEs.
5.
Sustaining financial stability. BNM use of macroprudential policies has complemented
monetary policy since the GFC. There have been several rounds of macroprudential policies (see
table 8). Macroprudential policies have been enacted using a gradual, passed approach and have
been targeted at speculation in the property market and at curbing the growth in personal
unsecured lending. In July 2014, as inflation increased and real rates turned negative, BNM increased
the OPR amid concerns about financial stability.

Appendix IX. Malaysia—Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
Background. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) framework for market access countries is
used to assess Malaysia’s debt sustainability and other risks related to its funding and debt structure.
The framework uses a risk-based approach and includes: (i) an assessment of the realism of baseline
assumptions and the projected fiscal adjustment; (ii) an analysis of risks associated with the debt
profile; (iii) macro-fiscal risks; (iv) a stochastic debt projection taking into account past macro-fiscal
volatility; and (v) a standardized summary of risks in a heat map.
2.
Macro-fiscal assumptions. Growth is projected at 4.4 percent in 2016, recovering to
4.8 percent in 2017 and 5 percent in the medium term. The federal government’s deficit has been on
a declining trend in recent years, reflecting the authorities’ efforts to broaden and diversify revenue
bases and reign in costly subsidies and rationalize spending. In staff’s baseline projections, the
federal government’s deficit is reduced in the near term from 3.2 percent of GDP in 2015 to
1.3 percent in 2021. The projected fiscal consolidation is consistent with the authorities’ targets and
is supported by fiscal and structural reforms announced in recent budgets.
3.
Data coverage. Consistent with the data on government debt reported by the authorities,
this DSA covers the federal government budget. Local and state governments and statutory bodies
that typically borrow from the federal government or receive explicit government guarantees are
excluded. The liabilities of these entities are therefore captured in federal government’ gross debt
and stock of loan guarantees1. Borrowing by state owned enterprises, which are in some cases under
federal government guarantees, has increased in recent years, reflecting the increase in the NFPS
deficit following the decline in oil prices. The NFPS and borrowing by GLCs are projected to decline
over the medium term.2
4.
Choice of framework. The levels of government debt and gross financing requirement in
Malaysia exceed the thresholds for using the higher scrutiny framework. Federal gross debt increased
sharply in 2009, reflecting sizable discretionary fiscal stimulus, declining real and nominal growth and
a large fall in oil prices. Although growth has recovered since, primary deficits have pushed the debt
to GDP ratio to about the authorities self-imposed debt ceiling of 55 percent. Gross financing needs
(GFN) peaked at 10.2 percent of GDP in 2013 and are expected to fall and remain at less than
8 percent in the medium term.
5.
Realism of baseline assumptions. The median forecast error for real GDP growth
during 2007–2015 is zero, suggesting no systemic projection bias that could undermine the
assessment. The median forecast error for the GDP deflator is 2.3 percent, suggesting that staff
forecasts have been conservative. The median forecast error for the primary balance suggests that

It would be desirable to cast a broader perimeter of fiscal analysis, including government-linked companies. Staff
has begun to assemble the sectoral balance sheets needed for a balance sheet analysis (BSA) of Malaysia’s economy.
During the last Article IV mission, the authorities discussed the role of BSA, including in tracing the response through
various sectors of commodities or other shocks. They agreed to work with staff on this project.

64

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALAYSIA

staff projections have been slightly pessimistic (a forecast bias of –0.25 percent of GDP), but the
forecast bias has improved in the later years.
6.
Cross-country experience suggests that the projected fiscal adjustment is feasible. The
maximum 3 year adjustment in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance (CAPB) over the projection
period (1.6 percent of GDP) is ambitious but is premised upon concrete measures endorsed by the
government. Finally, the maximum level of the primary balance (0.8 percent of GDP) that is assumed
in the projections is reasonable when compared to the experience in other market-access countries.
7.
The DSA framework suggests that Malaysia’s government debt-to-GDP ratio remains
below 65 percent, and its gross financing needs remain below 12 percent of GDP under
different macroeconomic and fiscal shocks.


Under the baseline, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decrease to below 45 percent by 2021,
but if the projected consolidation does not take place, captured under the constant primary
balance simulation, it remains about constant before declining to 50 percent in the medium
term. Under most macro-fiscal stress tests, the debt-to-GDP ratio continues to decline, although
a one standard deviation shock to real GDP growth would raise the debt-to-GDP ratio initially to
above 55 percent by 2018 before it declined in the following years. Something similar happens in
a combined macro-fiscal shock that includes higher interest rates and a lower primary balance.



A permanent oil price shock implies a flat debt-to-GDP profile in the medium term. The oil price
shock assumed in the analysis is very large and amounts to a permanent reduction in the oil
income of 1 percent of GDP. Such a shock would be commensurate with a 33 percent decline in
oil price, with an amplifying effect that reduces oil companies’ profits by 66 percent.



A contingent liability shock, whereby the government would have to absorb all of the
government guaranteed loans, totaling 15 percent of GDP, over two years, would increase risks
significantly. It would be accompanied by a persistent negative shock to growth and interest
rates increase. In this scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to a little above 65 percent of
GDP. Although this is a low probability scenario, the simulations underscore the vulnerability
posed by contingent liabilities.



Gross financing needs under all scenarios remain at below 10 percent, except for the contingent
liabilities scenario in which it peaks at 16 percent before declining later to below 12 percent by
the end of the projection horizon.



Stochastic simulations based on historical volatilities in Malaysia’s macroeconomic variables also
show that the 90th percentile of debt-to-GDP ratio simulations is below 65 percent.

8.
Heat map. Malaysia faces risks arising from its large external financing requirement and
large share of public debt held by foreigners. At 47 percent, the external financing requirement is
above the upper threshold of early warning benchmarks, while the share of debt held by foreigners is
relatively high at about 30 percent of total. As discussed earlier, the existence of large domestic
institutional investors who tend to make opportunistic investments is a mitigating factor of this risk.

Appendix X. Malaysia—Public Infrastructure: Trends and Quality1
Background. Infrastructure gaps are large in Asia, with the Asian Development Bank estimating
infrastructure needs of US$8 trillion over 10 years. Malaysian policy makers have recognized the
importance of infrastructure in their quest to turn Malaysia into a high income nation by 2020 and
have made important strides in raising the quantity and quality of the country’s infrastructure in
recent years. A scaling up of public investment in the 10th Malaysia Plan, financed through
budgetary resources and via increased use of public-private partnerships (PPPs) has resulted in an
increase in Malaysia’s public capital stock, as a share of GDP, while this ratio has declined in other
Asia economies (Figure X.1). The increased use of PPPs in Malaysia mirrors the trend observed
elsewhere in developing and emerging market economies.
The record. Malaysia fares well in surveys of infrastructure quality and access. While there are
significant disparities in perception of infrastructure quality and measures of infrastructure access
within Asia, Malaysia scores at the high end of the range, similar to advanced Asian countries
(Figure X.1). Malaysia also ranks close to advanced Asian countries in terms of access to treated
water and public education, which bodes well for inclusion and intergenerational income mobility,
although it still lags behind in terms of roads, electricity production and public health infrastructure
(Figure X.1). And while inefficiencies in public investment are sizable in developing and emerging
markets in Asia and elsewhere, with the average country being 27 percent below the efficiency
frontier, Malaysia’s public investment efficiency gap is significantly lower, close to 11 percent similar
to the gap in advanced economies (Figure X.1).
Public Investment Management. Judging from the survey results and available measures of public
capital stocks, Malaysia’s public investment management performance is good by international
standards. Total investment has been at sustainable levels, allocations of investment between
sectors have been stable and multi-year budgeting has been introduced. However, as with all
countries, there is room to strengthen public investment efficiency further and some of the methods
identified by the IMF2 could be helpful in this regard. Specifically, a new diagnostic tool—the Public
Investment Management Assessment (PIMA)—evaluates key public institutions in the planning,
allocation and implementation phases of public investment projects. PIMA can help identify the
institutions and specific public investment management areas that need improvement with the aim
of supporting the infrastructure development pillar in the APEC Cebu Action Plan. FAD has also
created a new tool, the PPP Fiscal Risks Management Model (PFRAM) that can assess the potential
fiscal costs and risks arising from PPP projects – a tool that could be particularly relevant given
Malaysia’s relatively high public debt level and significant contingent liabilities. Examples in some
advanced countries suggest that the risks posed by PPPs can be significant and, if not quantified,
monitored and reported transparently, could contribute to a substantial weakening of public
finances. In this context, publication of an annual fiscal risks statement in Malaysia would be
extremely helpful.

Conclusion. Malaysia has made important gains in scaling up its infrastructure in recent years and
progress is likely to continue during 2016–2020. Despite the headwinds facing emerging market
economies, the 11th Malaysia Plan envisages major projects such as completion of the KL metro, the
Singapore-KL high speed rail and the Pan-Borneo highway. Empirical evidence suggests that public
investment can have a positive impact on growth directly3 or indirectly by crowding in private
foreign direct investment.4 High-quality infrastructure is also correlated with declines in income
inequality.5

Appendix XI. Malaysia—High Priority FSAP Recommendations
Strengthening Financial Sector Oversight
Implement proposed new Financial Services Act (FSA) at an early date; and strengthen legal and regulatory
requirements for Islamic banks.
The FSA and related Islamic Financial Services Act (IFSA) were implemented on June 30, 2013. The IFSA
strengthens legal and regulatory requirements for Islamic banks including those for capital, financial
reporting, and audit. BNM has re-issued some polices and regulations under the new legislation, covering for
example, powers relating to external auditors, financial reporting for Islamic banks, financial reporting for
takaful operator, and streamlining capital funds for Islamic banks.
Strengthen framework for consolidated supervision of financial holding companies (FHC) including capital
standards and risk management.
BNM has extended its legal powers over FHC with the adoption of FSA and IFSA in June 2013. BNM is at the
advanced stage of assessing the appropriate holding companies to be designated as FHC (for financial
groups which have not been identified under the previous legislation, BAFIA 1989), as provided under the
legislations. BNM has issued a strategy paper on the Bank's plan with regard to regulation and supervision of
financial groups; issued final regulatory expectations extending to FHC the application of the standards on
External Auditors, Financial Reporting, Capital Adequacy and Compliance. During 2016, BNM intends to
issue concept paper on Corporate Governance, applicable to financial institutions and FHCs.
Ground the operational independence of the Securities Commission (SC) by changing the legal provisions
on removal of Commission members and protections given to Commission members and its staff.
Related amendments to the Securities Commission Act were passed by Parliament and came into effect on
15 Sept. 2015.
Strengthen the definition of connected lending.
BNM issued a revised policy to strengthen the definition of connected lending that includes definition of
influential shareholders as persons that are considered as connected to the banking institutions. This was
added in the ‘Guidelines on credit transactions and exposures with connected parties’ in July 2014.

Labuan International Business and Finance Center
Impose prudential and regulatory requirements on Labuan financial institutions in line with international
standards and best practice.
-During 2014, Labuan FSA has completed the harmonisation of financial reporting standards to complement
capital requirements and the enhancement to the fit and proper person requirements. During 2015, Labuan
FSA has issued guidelines on the valuation of insurance liabilities which forms the initial part of the capital
adequacy framework for (re)insurers and consultation paper on the proposed banking capital adequacy
standards which adopt higher Basel requirements. The efforts to enhance the capital adequacy requirements
for both (re)insurance the (re)takaful sector will continue to be pursued in 2016 and 2017. In addition,
amendments to Labuan’s legislations are currently being pursued to provide explicit enabling provisions for
prudential requirements, including capital adequacy rules.
Undertake more proactive engagement and effective communication of LFSA with home supervisors and
external auditors.
Labuan FSA continues to sign new MoUs with home supervisors of Labuan entities, with 6 more MoUs added
during the period from 2013 to 2015 covering areas of exchange of supervisory information and
collaboration in enforcement. In 2013, Labuan FSA has also written to the home regulators of Labuan
licensed entities to seek their confirmation that the coverage of their consolidated supervision includes
Labuan entities and had obtained some responses.
Labuan FSA is also working on strengthening the role of external auditors by requiring Labuan banking
institutions and (re)insurers to appoint external auditors who are affiliated with the registered member of the
Malaysia’s Audit Oversight Board (AOB). This is to ensure sufficient quality and professional audit services are
rendered to these financial institutions as a quality assurance measure. In 2016, Labuan FSA plans to develop
a set of external audit requirements that will further enhance Labuan FSA’s supervisory engagement of
external auditors.

Appendix XI. Malaysia—High-Priority FSAP Recommendations (concluded)
Systemic Risk Management
Formalize a high­level committee involving BNM, SC, PIDM and the fiscal authority with the
responsibility for ongoing systemic risk monitoring, information sharing and crisis action.
The Financial Stability Executive Committee (FSEC) formed in 2010 now also includes, the Chairman of
the Securities Commission as a permanent member of the Executive Committee (since 2012) along with
the BNM, PIDM and MoF.

Macro-Financial Risks
Enhance data capture for household sector to facilitate a more robust and granular monitoring and
assessment of household sector leverage and issues especially in accordance to income category; and
review effectiveness of macroprudential measures.
Enhancements to the data capture for households are undertaken in phases. The first phase involves the
matching of credit and income data from the tax authority. This is completed and ready for analysis after
the final data quality check in 2016:Q1.
Adopt multiyear top-down and bottom-up macroeconomic stress testing, and introduce more
conservative credit loss parameters in bottom up exercise.
The Bank has implemented a top-down multi-year macro stress test framework in 2013, with a number
of enhancements to the framework made in 2014 which include enhanced satellite models for multi-year
income/expenses shocks and projections by detailed income segments (net interest income, net trading
and investment income, fee income and staff costs/overheads); quantitative models to project multi-year
balance sheet growth (credit, market, operational risk-weighted assets); and simulated multi-year Basel
III phase-out of capital instruments.
This is complemented with enhanced calibration methods (multivariate regressions) using a wider range
of data inputs to derive better estimates of conservative sectoral credit risk shocks (probability of default,
loss given default)
The application of the multi-year stress test for bottom-up stress test has also been rolled out in 2014.

Assumptions. The stress test uses annual firm-level balance sheet information from
Orbis data and includes 2,974 firms for Malaysia with total assets of US$913billion. Orbis
provides data on corporate balance sheet and income statement, e.g. asset, liability, revenues,
interest expenses, corporate profits and loss accounts, etc. However, FX borrowings and hedging

This is a large shock relative to the historical experience for Malaysia where the largest changes in the overnight
policy rate in consecutive periods are -150 bps and +75 bps. However, corporates could face a large increase in

at the firm level is not available through Orbis and therefore the following aggregate level
assumptions are made:




26 percent of total debt is in foreign currency.
10 percent of total revenues are in foreign currency (assumed).
20 percent of FX debt hedged with financial instruments (assumed).

8.
Results. The charts on the next page present the results of these stress test scenarios. In
all scenarios there is a decline in the interest coverage ratio and the debt-to-earnings ratio
declines. Much of the impact is due to the assumed drop in earnings, along with the increase in
the interest rate. The differences across the scenarios are not large, illustrating the limited
vulnerability to exchange rate shocks. Debt-at-risk, that is with an interest coverage ratio below
1.5, increases from 20 percent of total debt, affecting 26 percent of firms, to 50 percent of total
debt and 42 percent of firms in the most severe scenario.
9.
Conclusions. Although high at 96 percent of GDP, non-financial corporate sector debt in
Malaysia does not appear to represent a significant vulnerability. Debt is mostly long term, in
local currency, and is reasonably well-diversified. Stress testing indicates that Malaysian
corporates are resilient to declines in income and exchange rates, and increases in interest rates.

Appendix XIII. Malaysia—External Sector Assessment, 2015
A. External Sector Developments
Current account (CA). Malaysia’s CA surplus has declined by 8 percentage points since 2011 to
2.9 percent of GDP in 2015, following emergence of a deficit in the nonoil-and-gas trade balance
on the back of a rise in investment, which bodes well for medium-term growth, and a decline in
gross national saving during this period.
Malaysia’s exports are diversified, but the decline in the CA surplus in 2015 by 1.4 percentage
points of GDP was driven by the negative price impact from the lower mineral fuel prices: the
trade surplus on account of crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas was lower by 1.2 percentage
points of GDP, with the adverse impact from lower prices (about 2.5 percentage points of GDP,
estimated at constant 2014 volumes) partly offset by higher exports volume. Depreciation of the
ringgit in 2015 also boosted manufacturing exports volume, but prices in U.S. dollars declined.
The CA surplus is projected to decline to 2.3 percent of GDP in 2016 primarily reflecting a further
weakening in the oil-and-gas trade balance, while the nonoil-and-gas balance is expected to
improve on the back of a softening in domestic demand.
Real exchange rate. The average real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated by 8 percent
(y/y) in 2015 and the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) by 9 percent (y/y).1 The
depreciation in the REER helped boost export volumes, but the negative price effect resulted in a
drop in exports in U.S. dollar terms. Between December 2015 and February 2016 both the REER
and the NEER appreciated slightly.
Capital and financial accounts. Malaysia has typically recorded net capital outflows. Although
net foreign direct investment (FDI) flows are generally small, gross FDI flows are large, reflecting
the growing importance of Malaysia as a direct investor abroad. However, the pace of FDI
investment abroad has slowed down in the last few years. In 2015, FDI abroad was about
3.25 percent of GDP (down from 6.1 percent of GDP in 2011), nearly matching the FDI inflows.
Net total outflows under the financial account were 4.6 percent of GDP in 2015, lower than that
in 2014, amidst global uncertainty and domestic political concerns. Over the medium term,
Malaysia is expected to receive net inflows, supported in part by further slowdown in outbound
FDI.
Foreign reserves and international investment position. In 2015 Malaysia’s exchange rate
exhibited substantial variability against the US$ and Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) intervened to
avoid ringgit overshooting and maintain orderly market conditions. Reserves accumulated during
the capital inflow surges over 2010–13 were deployed to smooth out the impact of capital
outflows on the ringgit, leading to a decline in the official reserves by nearly US$37 billion (about

Since 2000, movements in the REER have been driven almost entirely by the nominal exchange rate rather than
inflation differentials.

28 percent) between August 2014 and December 2015.2 As of February 2016, FX reserves were
slightly up from their December 2015 level.
The international investment position (NIIP) recorded a net asset position of about 8.5 percent of
GDP (in U.S. dollar terms) as of end-2015, improving for two consecutive years from a net liability
position of about 4.5 percent of GDP in 2013 owing to capital outflows and valuation effects. 3
Assets were at about 131 percent of GDP, of which two fifths were in the form of direct
investments abroad and another one quarter in official reserve assets. Portfolio investments
accounted for about two fifths of the gross liabilities (122½ percent of GDP) and about
60 percent of those investments were in debt instruments (including both ringgit- and foreign
currency-denominated liabilities). Total external debt rose to 65.6 percent of GDP in 2015 (in U.S.
dollar terms; 2014: 63.1 percent of GDP), of which 64 percent were in foreign currency. Shortterm debt accounted for 42 percent of the total external debt, a decline from 2011–14 average of
48.3 percent, as nonresident holdings of BNM bills and notes declined since late 2014.

B. Standard Benchmarks
Current account. The External Balance Assessment (EBA) CA regression approach estimates that
the cyclically-adjusted CA is stronger (by about 4 percent of GDP) than consistent with
fundamentals and desirable policies (Table XIII.1). The estimated policy gap is about zero, similar
to that in 2014, implying that nearly the entire gap was accounted for by a regression residual
requiring interpretation. The relative contributions of various policy measures to the total policy
gap remained broadly unchanged from 2014, while the change in the regression residual
reflected a fall in the actual CA surplus, partly offset by cyclical factors arising from lower oil
prices. However, in the EBA CA regression, Malaysia’s CA is consistently underestimated across
time, reflecting country-specific structural factors that are not well captured: for example,
insufficient social safety nets (not fully captured by public health spending variable used in the
regression) and structurally low investment since the Asian financial crisis, both of which push up
the CA balance. Private investment has increased since 2011, but still remains relatively low at
about 17 percent of GDP. It is difficult to separate the above factors into slow-moving structural
ones (that are given in the short run and add to the gap) and controllable policy variables that
explain the gap. Taking these factors and the uncertainty surrounding the updated model

During the global financial crisis foreign reserves fell by about 28 percent between August 2008 and
March 2009, but then registered a strong increase in early 2011; a decline was again recorded in August–
September 2011. Gradual increases continued until mid-2013, when reserves declined. Between August 2014 and
December 2015 reserves fell by nearly 28 percent.

The ratios to GDP are based on staff estimates at U.S. dollar values and may vary from the authorities’ data
mainly due to different exchange rate assumptions for converting nominal GDP in U.S. dollar terms. Ringgitdenominated debt held by nonresidents, including Malaysian government securities and BNM bills and notes,
increased rapidly in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, but since August 2014 has declined as foreign
investors largely reduced their exposures to BNM bills and notes. Short-term foreign-currency denominated
external debt has risen in the last few years, largely due to banking sector activity, matched by an increase in
short-term external assets.

estimates into account, staff assesses the norm to be 1.8 percent of GDP and the CA gap to be
2.8 percent of GDP (plus or minus 1 percent of GDP) in 2015.
Real exchange rate. The EBA REER index regression estimates Malaysia’s REER to be
30.5 percent below levels warranted by fundamentals and desirable policies, though most of the
gap is an unexplained residual. The analysis of the level REER provides an estimate of 24 percent
undervaluation. Based on staff’s assessment of the CA gap and the semi-elasticity of the current
account with respect to the REER, the REER gap for 2015 is estimated to be 9.7 percent (plus or
minus 5 percent)4.

Foreign reserves. As of end-2015 official reserves stood at 80 percent (2013: 98 percent) of the
IMF’s composite reserve adequacy metric (RAM), and covered 75 percent and 24 percent of
short-term external debt by remaining maturity (staff estimate) and broad money, respectively.5
The RAM is below the suggested adequacy range of 100-150 percent. The decline in the RAM
reflects BNM’s significant interventions in response to capital outflows in 2014–15. To raise
reserves to a level adequate for precautionary saving, the authorities should gradually
accumulate more reserves so that the RAM is closer to 100 percent.
Overall assessment. The external position in 2015 was stronger than that which is consistent
with fundamentals and desirable policy settings, albeit less so than in 2014. An adverse terms-oftrade effect contributed to this softening of the external position. The depreciation of the
currency boosted export volumes in 2015, partially offsetting the negative terms-of-trade shock.

C. Potential Policy Response
Over the past few years Malaysia’s growth model has shifted more to domestic demand and
both the current account surplus and the current account gap have narrowed. Looking ahead,
over the medium term, increased public sector saving, as the Federal government consolidates
its budget, will be offset by sustained private consumption and investment and is expected to
result in a current account surplus in the range of 1.5–2 percent of GDP, further narrowing the
gap with the norm. Staff views policy gaps as reflecting high precautionary saving and further
need for investment facilitation (notwithstanding recent increases in the investment ratio). It
would be useful to continue to improve social protection and social insurance institutions,
including the introduction of an unemployment insurance system, ; increase private investment,
including in physical infrastructure; and address labor-force skill mismatches and rigidities in the
labor market. Consistent with the authorities’ intentions, stronger social safety nets and efforts to
further boost private investment would help to further moderate the current account surplus.

investment is expected to slow down. Finally, external debt service payments are updated in line
with the new definition of external debt and revised assumptions on the global interest rates.
3.
Over the medium term, Malaysia’s external debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to
remain on a steady downward path, falling to 49.5 percent by 2021. Under staff’s baseline,
this decline mostly reflects sustained current account surplus, averaging at about 1.8 percent of
GDP. Share of short-term debt, by original maturity, is expected to gradually decline to about
one-third of total external debt by the end of the medium term.
4.
Standard stress tests under the external DSA indicate that external debt would
remain manageable under a variety of shocks, including weaker GDP growth, a lower current
account balance, and a one-time 30 percent depreciation of the ringgit. Under most of these
scenarios, the external debt-to-GDP ratio rises above the baseline over the projection period by
only modest margins. However, in the case of the exchange rate depreciation scenario, the debt
ratio would rise sharply to 84 percent of GDP on impact, but would subsequently fall to about
70 percent of GDP by 2021. If the current account (CA) balance (excluding interest payments) is
permanently lower or the economy is impacted by a combined interest rate, growth, and the CA
shock, the external debt-to-GDP ratio will remain close to 60 percent over the medium term.

Exchange Arrangement:
On July 21, 2005, Bank Negara Malaysia announced the adoption of a managed float with the
exchange rate of the ringgit to be monitored against an undisclosed trade˗weighted basket of
currencies. Based on information on the exchange rate behavior, the de facto exchange rate regime
is classified as “other managed.”
Malaysia maintains bilateral payments arrangements with 23 countries. The authorities have
indicated that these arrangements do not have restrictive features.
Capital control measures imposed in early 1994 and in 1998 in the wake of the Asian crisis have
mostly been lifted, except for the internationalization of the ringgit. In particular, since May 2001,
nonresident portfolio investors are freely allowed to repatriate their principal sums and profits out of
the country at any time. Malaysia further liberalized exchange control regulations during 2002–13.
The main measures were a relaxation of regulations on investment abroad by domestic institutions,
an easing of regulations on ringgit borrowing obtained by nonresidents from residents for use in
Malaysia, ringgit and foreign currency borrowing obtained by residents from non-residents,
abolition of overnight limits on all foreign currency accounts maintained by residents and of the net
open position limit imposed on licensed onshore banks, allowing residents to open and maintain
foreign currency accounts for any purpose, abolition of several reporting requirements, and a
relaxation of the conditions on residents and nonresidents to enter into foreign exchange forward
contracts to hedge current and capital account transactions with licensed onshore banks.
The Malaysian authorities view remaining exchange control regulations as prudential in nature and
necessary to ensure the availability of adequate information on the settlement of payments and

receipts as part of the monitoring mechanism on capital flows. These controls do not contravene
Malaysia’s obligations under Article VIII.
Malaysia, in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions, maintains restrictions on payments
and transfers for current international transactions with respect to some designated individuals and
entities. These measures are maintained for the reasons of national and international security and
have been notified to the Fund pursuant to the IMF Executive Board Decision No. 144 (52/51).
Malaysia also restricts current international transactions between Malaysian residents and Israeli
companies and individuals; however, since these restrictions affect the underlying transactions
themselves, they are not subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Section 2(b).
Article IV Consultation:
Malaysia is on the standard 12˗month consultation cycle. Discussions for the 2014 Article IV
consultation took place during November 13–24, 2014 (IMF Country Report No. 15/18). Staff
discussions for the 2016 Article IV consultation were conducted on a mission to Kuala Lumpur
during January 11–22, 2016. In addition, a staff visit took place during July 25–31, 2015.
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Participation:
Malaysia conducted its first FSAP in 2012 (IMF Country Report Nos. 13/52, 13/53, and 13/56−13/60).
Technical Assistance:
Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD): A fiscal ROSC mission was fielded in May–June 2011. A mission
on fiscal risks took place in January 2013. A mission to assist with implementation of the Goods and
Services Tax was conducted in March 2014. Several missions on Public Financial Management were
fielded in 2014.
Legal Department (LEG): Missions were fielded in May and September 2011 to help draft a
Centralized Asset Management Corporations Bill, in the context of a three-year project to assist
Malaysia in implementing an asset forfeiture regime. Technical Assistance
Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM): Mission in October 2009 on macrofinancial
risk analysis and vulnerability analysis for corporate and financial institutions. Workshop in May 2010
on monitoring financial risks. Technical assistance missions on stress testing capital markets was
conducted in 2013.
Statistics Department (STA): A mission to assist with implementing the sixth edition of the Balance

Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT):
In November 2014, Malaysia’s AML/CFT regime was subject of an on-site assessment by the Asia
Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) under the new methodology of the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF), the global standard setter for AML/CFT. The Mutual Evaluation Report was published
in September 2015. It concluded that overall Malaysia has a broadly robust legal AML/CFT
framework with generally well-developed and implemented policies, but with a moderate level of
effectiveness. The country developed an action plan to address the key deficiencies identified in the
report. In February 2016, the FAFT granted full membership to Malaysia based on its commitments
to continue improving its AML/CFT regime. The FAFT will continue to monitor the country’s progress

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, further efforts to improve statistics
for the consolidated general government and public sector are necessary.
National accounts: Currently, the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) compiles and publishes
annual and quarterly estimates of GDP by activity and by expenditure at current and constant prices, and
annual estimates for gross disposable income, saving, and net lending for the economy based on
the 1993 SNA. The quarterly data are released about two months after the reference quarter.
Price statistics: The CPI and the PPI are available on a timely and comprehensive basis. A revised CPI was
introduced in January 2011; it covers all 14 states and features a more disaggregated measure of the
consumption basket and updated expenditure weights based on a 2009/10 comprehensive household
income and expenditure survey.
Government finance statistics: There is a need to improve the timeliness, detail, and availability of data
on NFPEs and the state and local governments. Dissemination of more detailed data on nonlisted NFPEs’
assets and liabilities and domestic and foreign financing by type of debt instrument and holder would be
desirable; efforts in this direction will require continued close collaboration among the Economic Planning
Unit (EPU), the Treasury, and Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM). There is also a need to disseminate more
information on public private partnerships.
Monetary statistics: The monetary and financial statistics (MFS) are reported on a timely and regular basis
and are broadly in conformity with the Fund’s data needs. There is a need to improve the institutional
coverage of the financial corporations, sectorization of the domestic economy, and classification and
valuation of financial instruments to ensure full adherence to the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. In addition, due to the growing importance of insurance corporations, pension funds, and other
financial intermediaries in Malaysia, coverage of MFS should be expanded to include these institutions. The
MFS missions of January 2004 and 2005 developed an integrated monetary database to be used for
publication and operational needs of the BNM, STA, and APD. The Bank Negara Malaysia reports data in
STA’s standardized report forms (SRFs) which provide more detailed classification of certain items, fuller
sectoral and instrument breakdown, and currency aggregation. MFS based on the SRFs are published in
the quarterly IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics.
Balance of payments: Department of Statistics Malaysia compiles and publishes quarterly balance of
payments estimates in accordance with the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual and the SDDS.
The quarterly data are released three months after the reference quarter. No data are shown for the capital
transfers or acquisition/sale of nonproduced nonfinancial assets, and transactions in reserve assets are
computed as differences in amounts outstanding and thus include valuation changes. The international
investment position data on other investment—assets and liabilities—are reported only in an aggregate
form.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Malaysia subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). It is using a timeliness flexibility
option for general government operations (within six quarter lags after the end of reference year).

Statement by Marzunisham Omar, Executive Director for Malaysia and
Nooraihan Mohd Radzuan, Advisor to the Executive Director
April 22, 2016
Amidst a challenging external environment, the Malaysian economy remains resilient,
registering a strong growth of 5% in 2015. Strong fundamentals, ample buffers, a robust
financial system and timely policy responses have enabled the Malaysian economy to weather
multiple external shocks. In an environment of heightened uncertainty and downside risks in the
global economy, the Malaysian economy will continue to benefit from having diversified sources
of growth, economic flexibility, low unemployment, a strong external position, large buffers, a
strong financial system and robust policy frameworks that have been built over the years. The
authorities remain vigilant and focused on strengthening future resilience and accelerating
Malaysia’s transition into a higher value-added and high-income economy. Beyond the short
term, measures include structural reforms to raise productivity and labor participation,
strengthening institutions and physical infrastructure, and further advancing regional and global
integration. Focus will continue to be accorded towards ensuring sustainable and inclusive
growth, which includes uplifting the lower income groups and promoting balanced development.
1. On behalf of the Malaysian authorities, we thank the IMF team for the constructive and
comprehensive discussions on macroeconomic developments and policy issues in Malaysia. We
appreciate the frank and open discussions with the mission team. Our authorities broadly concur
with the major policy recommendations put forth in the report. We are further encouraged by the
assessment that the current policy stance is appropriately calibrated to the outlook and risks
facing the economy and that Malaysia is resilient to capital outflows.
Economic Developments and Outlook
2. Despite the more challenging global environment, the Malaysian economy registered a strong
growth of 5% in 2015 (2014: 6%), driven by private consumption and investment. Inflation
remained low (2.1%) as lower global energy and commodity prices more than offset the effects
from the weaker ringgit exchange rate, the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST)
and several upward adjustments in administered prices. Unemployment was low at 3.1% of the
labor force and the current account balance remained in surplus (2.9% of GDP). After
depreciating by 18.6% in 2015, the Malaysian ringgit has appreciated by around 9.5% against the
US dollar, while the Kuala Lumpur Composite Index has increased by 1.5% amid resumption of
capital inflows in 2016.
3. The strong growth performance amid multiple external shocks – sharp decline in oil prices,
sizable shifts in capital flows and slowdown in external demand – is underpinned by the highly
diversified structure of the Malaysian economy and sound financial system. While the
commodity sector plays an important role, enabling Malaysia to benefit from the commodity
super cycle, the commodities sector accounts for 18% of GDP and 19.2% of exports. This is a
relatively small share compared to the services and manufacturing sectors (54% and 23% share

of GDP, respectively). Furthermore, about 80% of Malaysia’s exports are manufactured goods,
where electrical and electronics make up 36% of total exports. There is also significant diversity
in terms of export markets, with the US, the European Union and Japan accounting for 29% of
exports while China accounts for 13% of exports. Additionally, growth has become more
balanced, anchored by sustained private sector-led domestic demand (69% share of GDP). The
well-developed financial system, together with the high level of reserves, more flexible exchange
rate and manageable level of external debt, have strengthened the capacity of the economy to
cope with external shocks.
4. The Malaysian economy is expected to expand within the range of 4.0-4.5% in 2016, in line
with staff estimates. Growth will be driven mainly by domestic demand, particularly from the
private sector, with some support from external demand. While private consumption has
moderated as households adjust to the higher cost of living, household spending is being
supported by continued growth in income and employment. Investment activity is projected
to remain broad-based, as capital spending by both the private and public sectors is expected
to cushion the lower investments in the oil and gas sector. On the external front, manufactured
and services exports are expected to improve, benefiting from the gradual improvement in US
and euro area growth, and continued growth in the regional economies. Authorities view that the
impact of China’s gradual economic rebalancing on Malaysia’s growth (which staff’s sensitivity
analysis implies could reduce Malaysia’s growth by 0.12 percentage points in 2016) as
manageable. As illustrated in staff’s scenario analysis, Malaysia’s overall current account
balance is expected to remain in surplus, albeit by a smaller amount, even under an extreme oil
price shock scenario. Headline inflation is expected to be moderately higher in the range of 2.53.5% in 2016, given the recent adjustments in administrative prices and the weaker ringgit
exchange rate.
5. The authorities concur with staff that there are a number of downside risks and uncertainties to
the economic outlook. Nevertheless, the authorities also see potential for upside risks. While
China’s rebalancing poses some uncertainties in the near term, the shifting patterns of
consumption and trade that the transition is expected to entail will present significant
opportunities for the Malaysian economy over the medium term, with the healthcare, education
and tourism sectors likely to benefit. The ongoing recovery in advanced economies and
continued healthy growth in most regional economies also pose upside risks.
Adjusting to Multiple External Shocks
6. Despite the multiple external shocks since late 2014, the current account continues to be in
surplus, domestic financial markets remain orderly with no interruption to financial
intermediation, and fiscal consolidation remains on-track. As a small open economy, with a
financial system that is integrated with the international financial system, Malaysia will remain
exposed to developments in the global financial markets and to volatile capital flows.

7. The combination of exchange rate flexibility and judicious use of international reserves have
played an effective role in facilitating the economy’s adjustment to the terms of trade shock and
capital outflows. The ringgit depreciated by 27.7% against the US dollar between July 2014 and
mid-January 2016, while reserves declined by USD36.7 billion during the same period. The
authorities maintain the view that reserves, which were built during the period of inflows, are to
be used during periods of heightened outflows in order to smooth excessive exchange rate
volatility. Despite the volatility in capital flows, the deep financial market and sound financial
system have ensured that financial intermediation remained uninterrupted and supported
economic activity. The diversified structure of the Malaysian economy has also mitigated the
spillovers from external developments.
8. On the issue of foreign exchange reserves adequacy, the authorities caution against a rigid
interpretation of any metric, but rather, emphasize that an assessment of the adequacy of reserves
should be undertaken with a broader assessment of Malaysia’s economic and financial
developments. Malaysia’s reserves of USD97 billion are adequate to facilitate international
transactions without disruptions and are sufficient to finance 8 months of retained imports and
are 1.1 times the short-term external debt, higher than the international prudential benchmarks of
3 months and 1 time, respectively. Furthermore, the progressive liberalization of foreign
exchange administration rules has resulted in a greater decentralization of reserves, as reflected
in the increasing acquisition of assets abroad by resident banks and corporates. In particular,
banks and corporates accounted for 75% of Malaysia’s total external assets as at end-2015. This
means that the Central Bank’s reserves are only a quarter of the actual total reserves of the
country. The availability of these external assets enables these entities to meet their external debt
obligations without creating a claim on the Central Bank’s reserves.
9. The authorities welcome staff’s findings that even under a severe stress capital outflow
scenario (including under more severe assumptions than the Global Financial Crisis), Malaysia’s
external sector and domestic financial sector are expected to remain resilient. Moving forward,
continued exchange rate flexibility, a healthy level of reserves, and the availability of a wide
range of monetary instruments will continue to accord authorities with the policy flexibility to
manage external shocks. Authorities will remain focused on maintaining orderly financial market
conditions and to undertake appropriate foreign exchange policy as necessary, including building
up foreign exchange reserves buffers, which is consistent with the staff’s recommendations.
Monetary Policy
10. Consistent with price stability, monetary policy stance remains accommodative and
supportive of economic activity. The current level of the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) is
assessed to be appropriate given the balance of risks to the outlook for domestic inflation and
growth, taking into consideration the greater downside risks emanating from the external
environment and the higher headline inflation rate. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of
Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) is closely monitoring the heightened external risks and assessing
their implications on macroeconomic stability and the prospects for the Malaysian economy. In

addition, given the expectation of continued volatility in capital flows, BNM’s monetary
operations will be directed towards ensuring that liquidity will continue to be sufficient to
support the orderly functioning of the domestic financial markets.
Fiscal Policy
11. The authorities have remained steadfast in their commitment towards fiscal consolidation and
have consistently achieved its fiscal deficit reduction targets. Alongside cuts in recurrent
spending, fiscal consolidation has been led by increased revenue generation from more diverse
sources as well as enhanced tax efficiency and compliance – a strategy which will further ensure
fiscal sustainability. These include the implementation of the GST, removal of fuel subsidies and
enhancing efficiency of public service delivery. As a result of these measures, the share of
operating expenditure as a percentage of GDP is expected to decline to about 17% in 2016 from
18.8% in 2015 while the share of oil related revenue to total Federal Government revenue has
fallen from around 30% in 2014 to 21.5% in 2015 and is expected to decline further to 13-14%
in 2016. Protecting the most vulnerable segments of the population is a vital element in the
authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts. In this regard, in addition to increasing the quality of key
public services and making cash transfers to low income households, the authorities continue to
view the list of exempt and zero-rated items as important in the current environment to mitigate
the impact of the GST on vulnerable groups.
12. The 2016 Budget, tabled in October 2015, was subsequently recalibrated in January 2016 to
reflect expectations of lower oil prices (January 2016 assumption: USD 30-35 per barrel;
October 2015: USD 48 per barrel). The pre-emptive recalibration entailed both compositional
adjustments in Government spending and measures to broaden revenue sources (e.g. bidding of
telecommunication spectrum and streamlining of the foreign worker levy system). As a result of
these measures, the fiscal deficit is expected to continue to decline from 3.2% of GDP in 2015 to
3.1% of GDP in 2016, the seventh consecutive year of a decrease in the fiscal deficit to GDP
ratio. The course of fiscal consolidation remains intact and will be underpinned by further
reforms to broaden the Government’s revenue base, rationalize subsidies and better optimize
supplies and services expenditure. These measures will also help to contain the Federal
Government debt-to-GDP ratio within 55%.
13. The authorities concur with staff that the risk of contingent liabilities materializing is low.
Growth in contingent liabilities has been on a declining trend, with guarantees extended
primarily for productive and strategic investments. These include guarantees to the National
Higher Education Fund Corporation (19.8% share of total Government guarantees) and
guarantees to DanaInfra and Prasarana (11.6% and 9.9% share, respectively) which fund
Malaysia’s public transport infrastructure projects. The other portion of guarantees is for
Government-linked companies or statutory bodies with sound financial performance,
minimizing the probability of contingency risks materializing. While Federal Government
debt to GDP has risen since the GFC, refinancing and currency depreciation risks are mitigated
by the favorable debt composition. About 70% of debt are expected to mature in more than 3

years while a large share of debt is denominated in domestic currency (97% share of outstanding
debt).
14. Going forward, the conduct of fiscal policy will continue to be centered on ensuring sound
public finances while remaining supportive of policies for sustainable and balanced economic
growth. In particular, measures to improve the quality and efficiency of public service delivery
will be complemented by socio-economic support to vulnerable households. The recently
introduced Medium-Term Fiscal Framework will be an important anchor in supporting
authorities’ efforts to meet budgetary targets, improve expenditure prioritization, and foster
improved government performance. This is also in line with the 11th Malaysia Plan, which aims
to invigorate high value-added investments, intensify human capital development and enhance
public sector delivery in a constrained fiscal space. Authorities welcome staff’s in-depth analysis
of Malaysia’s structural fiscal reforms and have found the Fund’s technical assistance to be
highly practical. In this regard, the authorities look forward to further in-depth discussions on the
recommendations put forth.
Financial Sector
15. Domestic financial stability continued to be preserved in 2015, supported by sound financial
institutions and orderly financial market conditions. Stress tests undertaken by the authorities and
staff have demonstrated the resilience of the banking system to major economic and financial
market shocks. Of significance, as in previous episodes of heightened volatility and large capital
flows, deep domestic financial markets (Malaysia’s bond market is the third largest in Asia) and
the presence of well-diversified domestic institutional investors continued to support orderly
financial market conditions and sustained financial intermediation. Businesses, including small
and medium enterprises, continue to have access to financing. While funding conditions were
occasionally tighter amid the large volume of portfolio outflows, banking system liquidity has
remained ample. BNM’s monetary operations and the use of several policy instruments also
ensured the availability of sufficient liquidity to support the orderly functioning of the money
and foreign exchange markets.
16. Risks to domestic financial stability arising from household indebtedness and the property
market continued to moderate, supported by strong overall household financial capacity as well
as continued improvement in the quality of new household debt. Growth in household debt has
moderated since its peak in 2010 to 7.3% as at end-2015, underpinned by the moderation in
personal financing. About half of new loans approved were to borrowers with an aggregate debt
service ratio not exceeding 40%, with the average debt service ratio for all new household
borrowings remaining below 60%. At the aggregate level, household financial assets remained
healthy at above 2 times household debt. The likelihood of a material impact on the stability of
the financial system arising from exposures to the household sector remains low, given the
strong capitalization and financial strength of financial institutions.

17. In the property market, growth in aggregate house prices appears to have stabilized as house
buyers and developers continued to adjust to macroprudential and fiscal measures aimed at
curbing excessive speculation and risk-taking. The growth of the Malaysian House Price Index
has gradually slowed from 9.6% registered for the period 2010-2014 to around 8% registered
over five consecutive quarters since 2Q 2014. Slower housing transactions mainly in the higherpriced segments, combined with continued strong demand for affordable houses, have
encouraged a rebalancing of housing supply. Given the prevailing acute demand-supply gap in
affordable housing, the risk of a more generalized correction in house prices is assessed to be
low. An increase in the supply of affordable housing remains key to bringing about a further
easing of upward pressures on house prices.
18. The authorities welcome staff’s in-depth assessment of non-financial corporate sector debt
and note staff’s findings that corporate sector debt does not appear to present a significant
vulnerability to the economy. Staff’s stress testing, which indicates that Malaysian corporates are
resilient to declines in income and exchange rates and increases in interest rates are also in line
with authorities’ own stress test results. As highlighted by staff, debt is mostly long term, in local
currency, and is reasonably well-diversified. Corporate debt at risk, measured as the share of
debt borne by firm with an ICR of less than 1.5 times, remains low and stable at 8.9% of total
corporate debt. The debt servicing capacity of businesses is also supported by sound liquidity
positions, with the median ratio of cash-to-short-term debt at 1.2 times. About three quarters of
outstanding corporate debt continued to be funded domestically.
19. Despite the sharp depreciation of the ringgit exchange rate, risks from non-financial
corporate external debt remain low. In addition to the mitigating factors outlined in the staff
report - favorable maturity profile with limited short-term foreign currency borrowing, low
currency risk as corporate sector debt is predominately in local currency and low exposure to
the commodity sector - risks are further mitigated by the following factors:


Trade credits and non-resident holdings of ringgit-denominated bonds, which pose
limited currency risk, account for about 22% of total corporate external debt.



Inter-company obligations account for about 43% of total corporate external debt,
reducing funding and liquidity risks.

The authorities remain vigilant and continue to monitor developments in the household, property
and business sectors closely. In this regard, they look forward to staff’s further work on balance
sheet analysis for Malaysia.
20. Efforts to strengthen safeguards against threats of money laundering and terrorism financing
(ML/TF) continue to be a key priority for authorities. The September 2015 Financial Action
Task Force (FATF)’s Mutual Evaluation Report on Malaysia’s AML/CFT framework
acknowledged Malaysia’s well-developed legal and regulatory arrangements, and strong interagency coordination for the supervision of ML/TF. Drawing in part on the recommendations of
the Report, the National Coordination Committee to Counter Money Laundering has formulated

a five-year National AML/CFT Strategic Plan to promote and protect the integrity of Malaysia’s
financial system and contribute towards mitigating criminal activity in the country. Based on the
commitment demonstrated by Malaysia’s action plan and the continuing progress in efforts to
improve its AML/CFT program, Malaysia was granted full membership of the FATF in February
2016.
Regional initiatives
21. Malaysia remains committed to advance regional and global integration. Through collective
efforts during Malaysia’s Chairmanship of ASEAN in 2015, a number of key milestones were
achieved in regional trade and financial integration, including the finalization and launch of the
ASEAN Banking Integration Framework to provide greater market access and operational
flexibility for Qualified ASEAN Banks. Malaysia will also continue to pursue initiatives to
promote increased integration through mechanisms such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the
Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
Reforms to enhance growth potential
22. Under the 5-year 11th Malaysia Plan (2016-2020), reforms to accelerate Malaysia’s
transformation into a high-income economy by 2020 will continue, underpinned by measures to
reduce income inequality, raise productivity and promote environmental sustainability. Of
importance, Malaysia has made important strides in reducing poverty and inequality over the
past decade with a combination of anti-poverty and rural development programs focusing on
promoting inclusion, livelihood and employment. In recent times, the gradual removal of blanket
consumer subsidies has enabled a shift towards more targeted income support measures for the
low- and middle-income segments. More broadly, affordable housing schemes, the introduction
of minimum wage policy since 2013 and continued promotion of financial inclusion have been
the authorities’ focus in ensuring inclusive growth. Moving forward, to raise productivity and
improve income distribution, authorities remain focused on education reforms, particularly on
industry-driven technical education and vocational training.
23. The Government will further pursue policies to improve the business environment. This
includes modernizing corporate insolvency law and the implementation of measures to improve
logistics and enhance trade facilitation. Measures to enhance competitiveness will also be
complemented with efforts to ensure equitable growth and environmental sustainability. As part
of the agreement reached under the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 21), Malaysia has
submitted a target to reduce the emission intensity of GDP.
Final remarks
24. The authorities remain vigilant that the global economy is facing important economic
realignments with considerable uncertainty on global growth prospects and increasing risk of
international financial market and capital flow volatility. While Malaysia’s diversified economy,

sound fundamentals, strong financial system and external position, and credible policy
framework, have considerably strengthened the economy’s resilience, the authorities remain
committed to further strengthening policy buffers and reducing vulnerabilities. Over the medium
term, the authorities will continue with the structural reform agenda as outlined in the 11th
Malaysia Plan to transform Malaysia into a high income economy by 2020.
