SIERRA LEONE
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation, the Fifth Review Under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, and Requests for Waiver of
Performance Criteria and Extension of Arrangement
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with the External Relations, Finance, Fiscal Affairs, Legal, Monetary
and Financial Systems, Policy Development and Review, and Statistics Departments)
Approved by Siddharth Tiwari and Anthony R. Boote
October 28, 2004
• Sierra Leone is on a 24 month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation with Sierra
Leone was concluded in March 2002. At the time, Executive Directors emphasized that the
authorities needed to strengthen fiscal discipline and expedite the pace of structural reforms.
• Sierra Leone has a three-year PRGF arrangement with the Fund, which was approved on
September 26, 2001 in an amount of SDR 130.84 million (126 percent of quota). The fourth
review under the PRGF arrangement was completed on February 23, 2004 (www.imf.org,
Country report No. 04/49). Executive Directors endorsed the macroeconomic objectives of the
program for 2004, and underscored the need to solidify economic gains and maintain peace, and
to develop a realistic and ambitious medium-term framework to guide economic policy-making.
Directors also suggested that enough resources be allocated to the preparation of a full Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). In the context of the review, the program was extended to
March 26, 2005, and the test date for the fifth review under the program was rephased from endDecember 2003 to end-March 2004. The completion of the fifth review will entitle Sierra Leone
to a disbursement of SDR 14 million.
• Discussions on the 2004 Article IV consultation and the fifth review under the three-year
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement took place in Freetown during June
22–July 5, 2004. Further discussions on Article IV issues were held during October 2–5, 2004,
when the authorities were in Washington to attend the Annual Meetings. The staff team
comprised Messrs. Rwegasira (head), Kovanen, and Köhler (all AFR), Mr. Gottschalk (PDR),
and Mr. Gulati (Administrative Assistant—AFR). The mission met with the Minister of Finance,
Mr. Joseph B. Dauda, the Minister of Presidential Affairs, Dr. Sheku Sesay, the Minister of
Education, Science, and Technology, Dr. Alpha T. Wurie, the Minister of Agriculture and Food
Security, Dr. Sama Sahr Monde, the Deputy Defence Minister, Mr. Joe C. Blell, the Minister of
Energy and Power, Mr. Emmanuel Grant, the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sierra Leone,
Mr. Fofana, other senior government officials, as well as representatives of the private sector and
the donor community.

Executive Summary
•

The economy enjoyed a robust recovery in 2003, but inflation accelerated. Real
growth reflected robust activity in agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and services.

•

Growth prospects in the medium term are encouraging, largely based on some
mining projects coming to fruition, agricultural expansion, and service-related
activities. Real growth is projected in the range of between 6-7 percent in 2005-07
(with higher growth in 2005 led by mineral exports), reflecting these activities in the
country’s post-conflict phase. Inflation is expected to revert to low single digits, while
the current account deficits would narrow, aided by growth in mineral exports. The
projected strong growth will, however, still leave Sierra Leone, the lowest ranking
country on UNDP’s index of Human Development Indicators, far short of the MDGs.

•

Performance as at end-March 2004 under the PRGF arrangement was mixed.
While progress was made in implementing program structural measures, fiscal and
monetary policies were weaker than envisaged. Shortfalls in external program support
in the first quarter of 2004 were not adequately compensated for by fiscal tightening.
The government has taken steps to bring year-end domestic financing of the budget
closer to program targets.

•

During the remainder of 2004, macroeconomic policies will need to focus on
bringing inflation down for the year as a whole while supporting a continued
high level of activity. Domestic expenditures should be tailored closely to projected
domestic revenues and external budgetary support, while protecting poverty-related
spending. Non-interest current spending should be reduced below the program level.
The overall fiscal deficit (including grants) is projected to rise above the 2003 level,
while the domestic primary deficit should narrow by a large margin. The domestic
financing of the budget should be contained to about 1½ percent of GDP, which is
above the program level of nearly 1 percent, because of large domestic borrowing
(reflecting delays in external assistance) and high interest rates.

•

Monetary policy in 2004 should complement fiscal policy to reduce inflation. To
assist in containing money growth and mopping up excess liquidity, the Bank of
Sierra Leone intends shortly to raise the statutory reserve requirement ratio. Reserve
money is projected to grow at 6½ percent in 2004.

•

With respect to structural reforms, the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data, is
to be undertaken with Fund technical assistance, in October 2004. The issuance of
new personnel management regulations will constitute a prior action to be completed
before Board consideration of the fifth review under the PRGF arrangement. The rest
of structural reforms for the remainder of the year aim at reinforcing the budgetary
process and its transparency; enhancing civil service reforms; and further
strengthening the management of the school system.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Discussions on the 2004 Article IV consultation and the fifth review under the
three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement took place in
Freetown during June 22-July 5, 2004. The Article IV discussions focused on the mediumterm strategy, including the policies needed to support key growth and poverty reduction
objectives. The discussions on the fifth review concentrated on recent economic
developments and macroeconomic policies for the remainder of 2004. The completion of the
2004 Article IV consultation discussions was delayed beyond the required 24-month
consultation cycle owing to delays in completing the fourth and fifth reviews of the PRGF
arrangement. Staff had to await confirmation of EU program support for Sierra Leone before
finalization of discussions and program papers for the fifth review.
2.
The 2001 Article IV consultations with Sierra Leone was concluded in March 2002.
At the time, Directors emphasized the need to strengthen fiscal discipline and expedite the
pace of structural reforms to enhance budget implementation and service delivery, streamline
tax administration, and improve the efficiency of the tax system. Directors also urged the
authorities to expedite civil service reforms and the privatization of public enterprises. They
noted Sierra Leone’s weak statistical base and the need to strengthen capacity in that area.
3.
Further progress was made in 2003 towards completing Sierra Leone’s postconflict transition. The government concluded the disarmament, demobilization, and
reintegration (DDR) exercise for over 72,000 former combatants in February 2004. In light
of the need to provide additional time for the government to train and equip its police and
military forces, the United Nations have decided to maintain a reduced presence in Sierra
Leone at least until mid-2005 (originally the UNAMSIL forces were to be withdrawn by end2004). Security in neighboring Liberia has improved and will enhance stability in Sierra
Leone.
II. OVERVIEW OF KEY ISSUES AND MEDIUM-TERM CHALLENGES
4.
As a post-conflict country, Sierra Leone’s development needs are immense.
Institutions and infrastructure were damaged during the protracted civil war of the 1990s, and
economic confidence declined together with domestic savings investment. With the onset of
peace since 2000, the authorities have been pursuing prudent macroeconomic policies and
implementing wide-ranging structural reforms. In contrast to a cumulative decline of
22 percent in real GDP between 1996-2000, output has expanded rapidly in 2001-03
(Table 1), reflecting the resettlement of population and increased activities in agriculture,
mining, manufacturing, and services. Inflation has on the whole remained moderate, but risen
to double digits more recently due to a combination of higher fuel costs, expansionary
monetary policy, and a depreciation of the currency.
5.
The authorities’ overall medium-term strategy for sustaining high growth and
reducing poverty focuses on six key areas: continued strengthening of state security to
assure investors and other economic agents; aiming at a more sustainable fiscal position that

-6-

is key to maintaining macroeconomic stability; raising savings and investment necessary for
sustained high growth; strengthening of infrastructure to integrate the economy and reduce
transaction costs; agricultural and rural development to foster pro-poor growth; and the
promotion of the private sector to spearhead the development of productive activities.
6.
Considerable resources and strong policies will be needed to advance the
strategy. The authorities should aim at reaching the country’s full tax potential, including
through tapping mineral revenues. Expenditures would need to be better prioritized, in the
context of a PRSP, and gradually reoriented to finance investment. Better coordination with
donors will also be important for efficient fiscal management and the mobilization of
increased resources for poverty reduction programs. With respect to private sector resources,
the main policy challenges are the enhancement of the investment climate, the strengthening
of governance and transparency, and the development of the financial sector.
III. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
A. Recent Economic Developments
7.
The economy enjoyed a robust recovery in 2001-03, but inflation accelerated in
2003 (Table 1).1 Strong output growth in 2001-03 reflects robust operations in agriculture,
mining, and manufacturing.2 The rise in prices in 2003 resulted initially from higher fuel
costs but expansionary monetary policy and a depreciation of the currency towards the end of
the year also fueled inflation. Annual average inflation at end-June 2004 reached 12 percent.

Fiscal performance in 2003 was somewhat weaker than envisioned, largely due
to domestic expenditure overruns (Table 2). Domestic revenue collection was stronger and

elaboration on macroeconomic trends during 2002-03.
2

Gross domestic product has been revised upwards beginning with 2001, with STA technical
assistance. This in part reflects the post-conflict recovery and the extension of coverage to
the service sector and related informal activities. As a result, real growth rates during
2001-03 period have been revised from 5.4, 6.3, and 6.5 percent for these years, respectively,
to 17.9, 27.5, and 9.3 percent. The increases in coverage of national accounts are not directly
reflected in higher reported growth figures.

-7-

current expenditures were lower than programmed. External program support, at 5.5 percent
of GDP in the original program, only materialized at slightly over 3 percent of GDP.3 This
led to much larger than programmed domestic financing of the budget, especially from the
banking system. Project grants and loans were also below the program levels by a wide
margin, while poverty-related outlays exceeded the program target.

Fiscal pressures continued in the first quarter of 2004. Although the government
scaled down its outlays, this was insufficient in light of the large shortfall in external nonHIPC grants and program loans.4 Project grants and loans materialized slightly above the
program levels. Larger than programmed fiscal expenditures, notably as a result of higher
domestic interest outlays, resulted in a significant rise in domestic financing of the budget,
particularly from the banking system. Noninterest current expenditures were below the
programmed level, including social and poverty-related outlays (the disbursements were
slowed down by new procurement procedures).5

3

HIPC grants are excluded from external program support (see the Technical Memorandum
of Understanding).

4

The shortfalls occurred because of delays in completing an audit that constituted part of EU
grant conditionality and due to administrative delays with the disbursement of the AfDB
loan.

5

For example, a government audit of the Ministry of Health and the ongoing procurement
reform have slowed goods and services outlays. Some catch-up in spending is likely in the
second quarter.

-8-

10.
Monetary policy in 2003 was loose, as it accommodated the expansionary fiscal
policy (Table 3). The Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) also allowed private sector credit to
continue growing at a fast pace. The rapid build up of domestic public debt since late 2003,
resulting from the large domestic financing of the budget, led to sharply higher nominal
Treasury bill rates (Figure 1). Broad and reserve money growth rates were higher than
programmed for the year as a whole.

The external current account weakened further in 2003 compared to the 2002
outcome (Table 4). While export performance during the year improved, particularly for
diamonds, imports remained high due to continued expansion in reconstruction activities and
the higher cost of fuel. Gross official reserves fell to 1.5 months of imports, well below the
program level. The real effective exchange rate depreciated by 17 percent in 2003 (Figure 2),
partly reflecting the high foreign-exchange demand to finance private sector imports.

The government missed a number of indicative performance targets at end-2003
(Appendix I, Table 1). Owing to fiscal slippages and the delays in external budget support
during 2003, the government missed at end-December the indicative ceilings on net domestic
bank credit to the government, net domestic assets of the BSL, and the government’s wage

-9-

bill, and the floor on domestic primary budget balance. All other indicative program targets
were met, including the floors on government domestic revenues and poverty-related outlays.
B. Performance Under the Program at end-March 2004
13.
Performance under the program was mixed during the first quarter of this year
(Appendix I, Table 2). All quantitative performance criteria at end-March 2004 were met,
except for the ceiling on net bank credit to the government, which was exceeded by Le 13.3
billion (equivalent of 6 percent of reserve money), after adjusting for the shortfall in external
program support and for the issuance of treasury bills to the nonbank private sector.6 The
adjustment in government outlays was inadequate in light of the non-disbursement of nonHIPC program financing (totaling 2.9 percent of GDP), related to the African Development
Bank (AfDB) loan (US$14.5 million received in April 2004), and the European Union grant
(programmed at €12 million).
14.
There was uneven progress in implementing program structural measures
in 2004 (Appendix I, Table 3). Two structural performance criteria subject to the fifth
review under the program were met: one pertaining to the issuance of identification cards for
the remaining 20 percent of all verified teachers, and the other, to the issuance of guidelines
requiring double signatures in operating school bank accounts. However, the structural
performance criterion on the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data for 2000-02 was not
completed by the end-May 2004 deadline, as the provision of Fund technical assistance was
not forthcoming as projected (now taking place in October; para. 51) due to unforeseen staff
constraints in STA. Moreover, new personnel management regulations for the civil service
were not introduced by end-May 2004 as envisaged, pending the finalization of a new
employment scheme for senior civil servants (the senior executive service); this measure is to
be implemented as a prior action for completion of the fifth review. Progress has been made
in completing the structural benchmarks under the program (see Box 1).7

6

Under the program the government was expected to adjust spending to compensate for half
of the shortfall (corresponding to about 1.5 percent of GDP).

For details, see section II of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies.

Box 1. Sierra Leone: Structural Conditionality
Coverage of structural conditionality under the PRGF arrangement
The structural conditionality under the current program (Table 4 of Appendix I) will focus on
strengthening budgetary discipline and transparency, and advancing civil service reforms. For the sixth
review, there will be one performance criterion related to the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data
for earlier program years; this will be completed by end-November 2004, following the provision of
technical assistance from the Fund. With regard to structural benchmarks, two new measures have been
included in the program: the government will take steps to ensure that by end-2004 at least 60 percent of
teachers are paid through school bank accounts; and employment ceilings for individual schools will be
published in the government gazette at the beginning of each school year.
Status of structural conditionality
During the period October 2003 – June 2004 (see Table 2 of Appendix I), further progress was achieved
in implementing structural performance criteria and benchmarks. The structural performance criterion
related to the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data was not observed due to a delay in the provision
of advice from the Fund. The structural performance criterion related to the issuance of new personnel
management regulations for the civil service was not completed; it awaited the incorporation of the
proposed new structure for senior civil servants. This measure is a prior action for the fifth review under
the PRGF arrangement, to be completed by mid-October 2004. Progress regarding the implementation of
the program structural benchmarks was uneven.
Structural areas covered by World Bank lending conditionality
Under the World Bank’s Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit (ERRC) and the Institutional
Reform and Capacity Building Project (IRCBP), reforms are being implemented, comprising the
creation of a plan for the divesture of public enterprises, the enactment of an acceptable investment code,
the enactment of local government legislation, the strengthening of the financial management system,
the development of a program for procurement reform, including enacting a new legislation and
regulatory framework, the completion of an impact study on the Common External Tariff, the
establishment of a cadastre for mining rights, and the piloting of mining sector extension services
(Appendix III).
Status of areas covered by the HIPC Initiative floating completion point

Sierra Leone has made further progress toward meeting the HIPC Initiative completion
point triggers, notably related to disarmament and demobilization, decentralization of
government functions, education, and health. First draft of the full PRSP was circulated
for comments to all stakeholders in August 2004.The PRSP document is expected to be
completed by end-December 2004.The government needs to implement the full PRSP
for at least a year before the country could reach the HIPC Completion Point, which
would be earliest at end-2005. Table 6 provides an update on the status of
implementation of the triggers.

- 11 -

IV. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
15.
The discussions with the authorities focused on the medium-term strategy, including
the policies needed to support key growth and poverty reduction objectives, as well as on the
review of program implementation up to March 2004, updating the macroeconomic
framework and reaching understanding on macroeconomic policies for the second half of
2004, and establishing quantitative and structural performance criteria and benchmarks
through December 2004.
A. Key Challenges and Medium-Term Economic Strategy
16.
The authorities acknowledged the critical importance of sustaining high real growth
and a stable macroeconomic environment for tackling Sierra Leone’s widespread poverty.8
The medium-term macroeconomic framework projects annual growth in the range of
6-7 percent. Rising exports will continue to support high output growth in 2004-06, with
higher growth in 2005 led by mineral exports. Apart from mining, activities related to
agriculture, forestry and fishing as well as services are expected to remain vibrant in the
medium term, in part reflecting the favorable post-conflict environment. Inflation is projected
to revert to low single digits by the end of the period (Table 5). The current account balance
(excluding official transfers) is expected to narrow to 10 percent of GDP by 2007.
17.
The continued strengthening of state security is seen as vital for underpinning
economic confidence. The authorities stressed that more time was needed to assure investors
and other economic agents that Sierra Leone was moving firmly to a post-conflict phase. The
planned reduced presence of UNAMSIL forces, though implying increased security costs for
the country, was seen as a right step in confidence building, demonstrating that the country
could rely on itself to secure peace within its borders. The staff recognized the importance of
this issue and underscored the need to prioritize expenditures within limited budgetary
resources, placing due emphasis on poverty-reducing spending.
18.
The government’s medium-term fiscal strategy aims at achieving a more
sustainable fiscal position in order to address the emerging domestic debt problem. The
authorities recognize that in the medium-term, the overall resource envelope would remain
constrained. On the one hand, external budgetary resources (as a percent of GDP) are
projected to gradually decline as the country’s post-conflict support and HIPC grants taper
off; however, additional resources not currently projected could become available in the
context of the PRSP and financing for the MDGs. On the other hand, the introduction of the
Common External Tariff (CET) of the ECOWAS is expected to lead to a small reduction in
customs revenues (as a share of GDP). The staff, therefore, encouraged the authorities to
continue strengthening tax administration and effecting related measures aimed at enhancing

Sierra Leone as the last country in terms of human development indexes.

- 12 -

domestic revenue collection. Furthermore, the authorities agreed that the tax base needs to be
expanded to tap mineral revenues (the staff estimated that additional revenue between
1-2 percent of GDP annually could be expected from customs duties, royalties, and income
and other taxes due to rising mineral production and exports), to cover other activities not
currently taxed, and to gradually include the informal sector. They also agreed that the scope
of income and corporate tax rate reductions (proposed but not effected in the 2004 budget)
should be reconsidered in light of the overall resource envelope.
19.
In furtherance of privatization, the authorities indicated that with technical assistance,
sales of public assets (e.g., in ports, marketing boards, banks, and the national airline), could
raise additional fiscal revenues to finance poverty-related programs or to lower the domestic
debt stock. This is in line the authorities’ earlier efforts to privatize state enterprises and will
be pursued as part of the medium-term strategy.
20.
On the expenditure side, the staff projects current expenditures to gradually fall
in the medium-term, from 22 percent of GDP in 2003 to 18½ percent in 2007. In light of
this, better prioritization, rationalization, and cost-cutting is needed to allow the government
to meet its developmental and poverty-related objectives (in the contexts of the PRSP).
Furthermore, expenditure would need to be gradually reoriented away from consumption and
wages to investment (in light of sizeable infrastructure needs), to support economic growth.
More efficient service deliveries will also be necessary both at central and local government
levels.
21.
In response to repeated lower-than-projected outcomes of external budgetary support,
the authorities need to strengthen mechanisms for monitoring the implementation of donor
conditions to expedite disbursements. While the budget needs to reflect planned receipts of
external assistance, the authorities should plan their expenditures cautiously so that the bulk
of expenditures do not take place until the assistance is actually received.
22.
The Sierra Leonean authorities concurred with staff that fiscal sustainability
requires that the government progressively move toward a broadly balanced primary
position (Appendix V). 9 The authorities indicated that the budget for 2005 would be framed
in a medium-term context. Improved fiscal positions would lead to gradually declining debtto-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratios, and would assist in lowering the domestic debt stock and
domestic interest costs. Strong macroeconomic policies would be essential for fiscal
sustainability, as a negative output shock could lead to rapidly rising debt-to-GDP and debtto-revenue ratios; this remains a risk to the medium-term fiscal outlook. Fiscal sustainability
would be assisted by debt relief in the context of the HIPC Initiative.

23.
The updated external debt sustainability analysis points to a moderate risk of
debt distress (Appendix VI). In the medium-term, higher new borrowing projections in the
baseline scenario lead to a more graduated decline in the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, which
is projected to level-off at about 140 percent beginning in 2010. The debt service ratio is
projected to remain below 10 percent for most of the projection horizon. Even though the
baseline debt dynamics do not give rise to concern, substantial vulnerabilities emerge when
the baseline is subjected to stress testing.
24.
Sustained high growth in Sierra Leone will require substantial increases in
domestic savings and investment. The authorities believe that with institutional and policy
measures together with enhanced economic confidence, private sector savings would be
boosted. The staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts in assisting the growth of community
and microfinance institutions, and the commitment to maintain financial liberalization,
including market-determined interest rates. The government also plans to contribute to this
broad endeavor through budgetary savings. With these measures, the objective in the
medium-term is to substantially improve the domestic savings rate to a range of 8-10 percent
by 2006-07, from below 2 percent in 2004. Although this is an ambitious objective, staff
considers it attainable as it merely restores Sierra Leone’s historical average in the mid1980s, while remaining at about half of the average level for sub-Saharain Africa. On the
investment side, the investment rate has risen significantly, led by private investment in large
scale mining projects. Gross domestic investment is projected at 18.4 percent in 2004
compared to an average of about 12 percent of GDP in 2000-03. In the subsequent years, the
investment rate is projected to decline somewhat with the completion of the mining projects,
but the policy objective is to raise the medium-term rate significantly above the 2000-03
performance (para. 28). Public sector investment has depended largely on external donor
financing, which is likely to continue given the country’s substantial infrastructure and other
development related needs. The government intends to progressively raise the share of
domestically financed investment expenditure, in part by directing the projected expanded
mineral revenues to this purpose.
25.
The post-conflict situation in Sierra Leone will continue to demand substantial
strengthening of infrastructure to remedy past dislocations and reduce transaction

- 14 -

costs. The authorities pointed especially to the importance of rural roads for improved
agricultural marketing and social service delivery, and of water and sanitation for improved
health. They also underlined the role of energy supply, especially electricity, for productive
and consumer uses in various sectors, including small- and medium-scale enterprises. In this
regard, the authorities plan to mobilize concessional resources to complete the Bumbuna
hydroelectric power project, and to attract private investors, notably from South Africa, to
develop other sources of electricity. The staff encouraged the authorities to attract private
investors in the provision of electricity and other utilities.
26.
Agriculture and rural development will be crucial for broad-based growth and
poverty reduction. The share of the agricultural sector is projected to rise from 37 percent of
GDP in 2002-03 to about 40 percent in 2006-07. The authorities indicted that a key policy
goal is to achieve food security by 2007, particularly with respect to domestic rice
production. For this purpose, the government is embarking on a multi-pillar approach (in the
context of its poverty reduction strategy) to raise agricultural output and productivity,
promote large-scale commercial farming, and encourage crop diversification. The authorities
recognize the importance of capacity building (research, education, and training in farming
techniques), improved infrastructure, and support and extension services.10 The government
is also reviewing land legislation to develop an enabling environment for land utilization.11
The staff considered the government’s plan as ambitious, though achievable, and
underscored that in order to strengthen the overall approach and possibly attract donor
support in these areas, the government should sharpen the key elements of its policy for the
agricultural sector.
27.
In order to support rural development, the authorities are embarking on decentralizing
government administration and the delivery of services. In May 2004, local elections were
conducted. The local governments will be vested with the responsibility of providing core
public services and implementing the PRSP. Institutional strengthening and capacity building
will be vital in these efforts, and they are being supported by an IDA grant of US$6 million.
These efforts are also key to the government’s program of enhancing governance. The
authorities stressed that decentralization would be pursued strictly within anticipated
budgetary resources. There would be a transition phase of four years during which the
delivery of core services by local governments would be supported by corresponding
transfers from central government. Capital expenditures during this phase would also be
supported by the IDA grant. In the subsequent period, local government expenditures would

- 15 -

be supported by local taxes and other revenues, as well as predetermined transfers from the
central government.
28.
Private sector development and the improvement of the investment climate are a
vital pillar to support Sierra Leone’s continued growth. While the public sector will take
a lead in strengthening infrastructure and improving public service delivery, the authorities
emphasized the role of the private sector in spearheading the development of productive
activities in most sectors. The strengthening of the investment climate to attract domestic and
foreign investment, especially in mineral development, and the development of the financial
sector are seen as major challenges in that effort. The mining sector, with a share of slightly
less than 10 percent of GDP in 2002-03, has considerable export potential and the sector’s
share in GDP is expected to increase to about 13 percent in 2006-07. Significant revenues are
also expected from mining activities. The adoption of the new Core Mining Policy, which
will establish a comprehensive framework for the mining sector, the implementation of a new
investment code, with World Bank assistance, and participation in the EITI would be
important steps in attracting private sector investment while safeguarding the fiscal revenue
potential of the sector (Box 2).12
29.
Greater progress is needed in strengthening governance and transparency to further
improve the investment climate and safeguard the use of public resources. The authorities
outlined the progress made so far in fighting corruption, specifically through the work of the
Anti-Corruption Commission. They stressed that corruption in Sierra Leone is an old
problem inherited from past administrations and that the efforts required to stem it should not
be underestimated. Twelve corruption related convictions had been made, some involving
high officials, while 30-40 corruption cases were pending. The support to the Commission,
provided by DfID, was welcomed because the hiring of local lawyers was difficult at public
sector salaries, although current Commission employees were among the highest paid public
officials. The authorities also indicated that a national strategic committee which includes
representatives of donors and civil society had been formed to reinvigorate the anticorruption drive. The staff welcomed the formation of the committee and stressed the
importance of demonstrating local ownership and political commitment at the highest levels
of government.

12

Sierra Leone ratified in May 2004 the agreement on the certification of the origin of
diamond exports (the Kimberley Process). Furthermore, it has expressed an interest to
participate in the EITI.

- 16 -

Box 2. Sierra Leone: Large-Scale Mining –
Challenges and the Way Forward
Sierra Leone has considerable potential for large-scale mining. Prior to the war, the
Sierra Rutile mine, for example, produced over 25 percent of the world’s output.1 The
country has also two known kimberlite diamond deposits and a bauxite deposit. The
war in the 1990s, however, led to the closure of large-scale mining operations.
Facilitating the restart of large-scale mining operations poses a difficult challenge for
the government in that it has to balance the demand for suitable incentives with the
need for preserving the tax revenue potential of the sector. The existing general fiscal
regime provides a good starting point in that it imposes only a moderate tax burden and
is reasonably free of targeted incentives. The recently formulated Core Mineral Policy,
which lays out the government’s objective for this sector, confirms commitment to an
investor friendly, progressive and predictable tax regime with well defined parameters.
A review of existing legislation and the development of operational regulations will be
concluded in 2005 with the assistance of DfID.
A main challenge has been in the application of these ideas in practice, since on each
occasion in the past that an investor has applied for a mining lease, that investor had
also sought and received a special agreement incorporating specific fiscal terms for the
project. Moving forward, it will be important to ensure that such special agreements, if
granted, do not undermine the general fiscal framework. To limit discretionary tax
incentives, any fiscal provisions in these agreements should be restricted to crossreferencing the relevant fiscal legislation.
The second challenge relates to the enhancement of transparency in this sector. More
transparency on revenue flows from mineral extraction could go a long way towards
addressing wide-spread governance concerns. The government has taken a step in this
direction by expressing its interest to the World Bank in participating in the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).2 The World Bank is also assisting the
government to establish a modern mineral rights and cadastre (land registry) for the
mining industry.
________________________

Rutile is a mineral that consists of titanium dioxide with little iron.

The basic principle of the EITI requires the government to publish its receipts of mineral
resource revenues and the mineral companies to report their payments to the government. Any
differences should be reconciled in a clear and consistent manner.

- 17 -

30.
The authorities intend to maintain a floating exchange rate regime. A floating
exchange rate regime since the beginning of the 1990s allowed flexibility in response to
external and internal shocks, such as the sharp increase in domestic inflation in this period
that did not result in a sharp appreciation of the real effective exchange rate.13 Moreover, the
parallel market spread has remained low and broadly stable since the end of the civil strive in
2000 (Figure 4). Therefore, the staff considers a floating exchange rate appropriate for Sierra
Leone, given the open economy and the need to maintain a competitive external position.
The envisaged strengthening of the external current account position, led by strong export
expansion, could result in an appreciation of the real exchange rate over the medium-term.
Furthermore, the BSL plans to increase its reserves to provide a cushion against external
shocks. The exchange system will remain free from restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions.
31.
The medium-term objective of trade policy is the adoption of the CET as part of
the consolidation of the ECOWAS integration process.14 The adoption of the CET tariff
structure is projected to lead to a reduction in the simple average tariff from 17½ percent to
about 12 percent. Furthermore, joining the ECOWAS CET would allow Sierra Leone to
benefit from the envisaged Economic Partnership Agreement with the EU. Sierra Leone does
not impose significant non-trade barriers, has no export taxes, and does not face significant
export barriers in developed countries.
32.
Beyond the medium-term, available social indicators for Sierra Leone show the
very low level of human development and the pressing need for moving toward the
MDGs (Box 3).15 Comparing the indicators to their 1989/90 benchmarks, Sierra Leone has
made little headway in reducing poverty during the past decade, by and large, as a result of
the prolonged civil conflict.16 A full assessment of the current situation is, however,
hampered by the inadequacy of data (required to establish reliable trends). 17 On this issue,
the government has set up a technical working group comprising staff from various
ministries.
13

For comparison, the rise in inflation in mid-1980s combined with nominal exchange rate
rigidity resulted in a significant real effective exchange rate appreciation.

14

Changes to the trade regime since the last Article IV discussions have been minor.

15

The 2004 Human Development Report of the United Nations Development Programs lists
Sierra Leone as the last country in terms of human development indexes.

16

Given methodological and technical differences in the computation of consumption
poverty, it is difficult to compare the 2003/04 survey results with the 1989/90 results.

17

Data in Sierra Leone is at best unreliable and there are significant gaps in the data.

- 18 -

Box 3. Sierra Leone: Progress in Achieving Millennium Development Goals (1990-2015)
Sierra Leone, still recovering from the aftermath of the devastating civil conflict, ranks last in terms of life
expectancy, education attainment, child and maternal mortality rates, and income per capita in the 2004 UNDP
Human Development Index.
Owing to the economic, social and physical destruction caused by the decade-long civil conflict that ended in
January 2002, the country finds itself deeply impoverished, with the result that the current status of most
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and other socio-economic indicators, have deteriorated from their
base year (1990) position. With a GDP per capita of US$121 in 2002, the proportion of people living in extreme
poverty (with expenditures of less than US$1 per day) has increased from 57 percent in 1990 to an estimated 89
percent by 2002. Life expectancy at birth was only 34.3 years in 2002 compared to the average of 46.3 years for
sub-Saharan Africa. The 2002 child mortality rate of 284 per 1000 and the maternal mortality of 2000 per
100,000 live birth are the highest in the world.
The status for other MDGs, such as reducing the proportion of people suffering from extreme hunger,
increasing access to safe drinking water, and combating the spread of communicable diseases and HIV/AIDS is
also disappointing. Gender inequality persists, though data is still unavailable on the issue. Sierra Leone will
therefore have to make huge strides in the years ahead in order to come close to achieving the MDGs by 2015.
The completion of the full PRSP by 2004 and its implementation over the medium term is expected to
contribute significantly in the fight against the abject poverty and in monitoring progress towards the attainment
of MDGs.

33.
The emerging findings from the 2003/04 household survey suggest that in rural and
urban areas outside Freetown the incidence of poverty remains high. The national average
poverty rate is about 70 percent, using the national poverty line of Le 2,111 per day (this is
about 1 U.S. dollar per day) to cover food and nonfood basic needs.
34.
No independent estimate has been made to assess the resource requirements, but
it is clear that substantial external resources would be needed to make a leap towards
meeting the MDGs. Additional resources would need to be mobilized to ensure adequate
funding for public programs (including those outlined in Box 3) that are key to meeting the
stated human development goals by 2015 or within any other indicated time-frame. The
authorities expressed confidence that with the impending finalization of the full PRSP, they
would be able to focus better on the various poverty reduction goals with policies and
available resources. Appropriate policy frameworks would also need to be put in place to
safeguard macroeconomic stability in case of large increases in aid.
B. Macroeconomic Objectives and Policies for the Remainder of 2004
35.
The macroeconomic framework for 2004 was updated in light of recent developments
and revised outlook for the second half of the year. For 2004, staff projects real output to
grow 7.4 percent, slightly higher than under the program.18 The key drivers of growth would
be agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and service industries. Inflation has been
significantly above the programmed level (in June the year-on-year inflation stood at
15 percent), and staff projects year-end inflation at 13 percent. The revised outlook reflects a
continuation of inflationary pressures coming from the fiscal and external sides, although the
program aims at reducing the pressures through fiscal and monetary tightening. The current
account deficit (excluding official transfers) is projected at about 18 percent of GDP,
4 percentage points above the 2003 level, with large import needs for the rehabilitation of the
mining sector offsetting strong export growth.19

18
19

This reflects the broadening of the data coverage under the revised national accounts.

Previous estimates projected a current account deficit excluding grants of around
30 percent. The downward revision is due to changes in the compilation of the balance of
payments and national accounts data. The former led to significantly higher estimates of
private transfers and the latter to a substantial upward revision in Sierra Leone’s gross
domestic product.

Fiscal Policy
36.
Fiscal adjustment in the second half will aim at bringing domestic expenditures
closer to projected resources. A particular issue concerns domestic interest outlays, which
were significantly above the program level in the first half of the year and are projected to
remain well above in the second half as well. In order to contain the rise in overall spending,
the authorities agreed to reduce noninterest current outlays in the second half of the year.
Poverty-related expenditures would be protected as much as possible (they are programmed
to increase slightly from the previous year’s level), but would fall short of the original
program target. Reflecting this tightening, together with the projected pick up in external
program support (see next para.), the overall fiscal balance (including grants) and domestic
primary balance would improve significantly in the second half of the year. As a result,
domestic financing of the budget is programmed to decline during this period, which should
assist in easing pressure on the Treasury bill interest rates.20

The rapid rise of nominal interest rates reflects in part inflation expectations and the

- 21 -

37.
In respect of external budgetary support for the second half of 2004, the staff awaited
confirmation of the EU disbursement before finalizing the fiscal program for the remainder
of the year.21 The staff have confirmed the expected inflows from DfID and the World Bank
for the last quarter of 2004.
38.
To further improve revenue prospects the authorities should better target fiscal
incentives while limiting the discretionary granting of tax exemptions to foreign
investors. The staff suggested that tax incentives should not take the form of tax holidays, as
these have proven ineffective in attracting foreign investments in many countries, but rather
be linked directly to the amount of investment. In addition, the Mines and Minerals Act
should not include fiscal provisions (tax schedules for the mineral sectors should be part of
the relevant fiscal legislation). The NRA intends to develop model agreements for the
mineral sector, since similar agreements for the petroleum sector proved useful.
39.
On the expenditure side, further prioritization of expenditures affecting the rest
of 2004 has been made, to align expenditures better with available resources. Noninterest
expenditures were reduced by 2½ percent of GDP for the year as a whole, compared to the
original program. The domestic interest bill is projected to increase by almost two percent of
GDP relative to the original program in part due to significantly higher domestic borrowing
costs and financing than earlier envisioned.22
40.
Government ministries should avoid the accumulation of utility arrears. Progress
has been made with regard the National Power Agency (NPA) where the arrears that
resurfaced in late 2003 were cleared (through a cross debt liability arrangement and the
payment of the net debt totaling Le 6.4 billion due from government). It also appears that the
current billing arrangement with the ministries works reasonably well. However, the billing
arrangements for electricity and water services (provided by Sierratel and the Guma Valley
water company) resulted in the accumulation of arrears during 2002-03. A payment plan to
clear the amounts due from government is yet to be agreed. The problems are partly due to
inefficient expenditure controls23 and weak billing practices as well as insufficient budgetary
allocations.

21

About one-half of current expenditure are financed by donors. As noted earlier, in the first
quarter of 2004 no external non-HIPC budgetary support (programmed at Le 76 billion or
about 3 percent of GDP) was received.

22

The Treasury bill interest rate reached 27 percent in May 2004, compared to 15 percent in
October 2003. Interest rate on the government’s ways and means account balance with the
central bank has been set at 20 percent per annum.

23

For example, the introduction of cellular phones led to a huge increase in the phone bill.

- 22 -

41.
The civil service reform is ongoing.24 An important issue relates to the pay scale for
the envisaged executive service, recommended by a Presidential commission. The goal is to
establish a core group of highly trained and experienced senior executives, with pay linked to
performance. The staff emphasized that this would need to be implemented within a
predictable resource envelope. Decentralization of key government functions will have
significant impact on the civil service.
Monetary and financial sector policies
42.
In light of the recent inflationary pressures, the discussions centered around the
need to maintain an appropriately tight monetary policy. While recognizing the challenge
to monetary policy emanating from the fiscal side, the staff expressed concern over the rapid
expansion of commercial bank credit, particularly to the private sector that grew by
81 percent from June 2003 to June 2004. The growth was led by lending to commerce and
finance, manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. In this context, staff underscored
delinquency risks that could arise from the fast-paced expansion of banks’ balance sheets and
the need for banks to be adequately supervised and well capitalized (Box 4).
43.
Reserve money will continue to be the primary intermediate monetary policy
target. Reserve money growth is projected to increase by 6½ percent in the second half of
2004, after remaining broadly constant in the first half. The rise in reserve money reflects in
part higher statutory reserve requirement ratio (next para.) and increasing demand for
currency. The planned reduction in government borrowing from the banking system in the
second half of the year will be consistent with the reserve money target. The BSL will rely on
its net domestic asset as the principal instrument to achieve its stated monetary policy
objective of price stability.25 In this context, the authorities noted that they have introduced
regular meetings between BSL and senior officials in the Ministry of Finance to enhance
monetary and fiscal policy coordination.

24

Further discussion on civil service reforms is provided in the section on structural reforms.

1/ Assumes reported net interest is not included in reported provisions but reported separately as an asset and liability.
2/ Provisions net of interest in suspense divided by NPL net of interest in suspense.
3/ Net loans are gross loans minus provisions and interest in suspense.
4/ Cash assets comprise cash in vault, current account with BSL, and bank placements with First Discount House.
5/ Liquid assets comprise cash assets plus bank holdings of treasury bills and bonds, foreign currency, and balances with other banks abroad.

Key points:

•

Banking system assets have grown rapidly during December 2000-03. This has been fueled, on the liability side, by a
rapid growth of banking system deposits.

•

On a risk-weighted basis, banks’ capitalization has improved to 40 percent in 2003 compared to 25 percent in 2000.
Reported capitalization figures reflect the high level of government securities in banks’ balance sheets. During 2004
the risk-weighted capital ratio has declined somewhat due to an increase in nonperforming loans (NPLs).

•

The NPLs have fallen substantially since 2000. The decline reflects, for the most part, improvements in corporations’
financial position and their ability to repay debts. However, in light of the rapid increase in credits to the private sector
in recent years caution is warranted when interpreting these figures.

•

In an environment of rapidly expanding banking activities and high real interest rates the commercial banks have been
able to sustain a high level of profitability, as measured by return to equity.

44.
The BSL will implement several measures with the view of enhancing its liquidity
management. First, the authorities are in the process of raising the statutory reserve ratio,
which covers only banks’ local currency deposits. On reserve requirements for banks’
foreign currency deposits, the BSL has requested technical assistance from the Fund to guide
the authorities on best-practices and experiences with such requirements in other countries.
Second, BSL also intends to modify the liquid-asset requirements by including in it a cash
reserve ratio of 12 percent.26 This measure, accompanied by the increase in reserve
requirements, should constrain banks’ reserves to provide loans, causing a decline in deposits
and hence in money supply (by about 1 percentage point). Third, by end-October 2004 the
BSL plans to start secondary market (repurchase) operations in government securities to
strengthen its liquidity management.27 For this purpose, establishing an electronic book-entry
system for government securities and the framework for forecasting liquidity may need to be
supported by further technical assistance from MFD.
45.
The exchange rate will continue to be based on BSL’s weekly foreign exchange
auctions. At end-2003, the authorities closed the special window for providing foreign
exchange to oil companies. International reserves are programmed to rise from 1.5 months of
import cover at end-2003 to two months of imports by end-2004.
46.
The BSL has made further progress in strengthening its internal and external
controls. For the 2003 audit, the BSL has already contracted Parnell Kerr Forsters, with head
office in London, to sign off the report prepared with a local firm. Furthermore, additional
staff has been hired in the BSL’s Audit Department, including a qualified department head.
The computerization of the central bank’s record-keeping is under way (funded in part by the
World Bank), and will strengthen internal controls. The BSL needs to take additional steps
towards implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards as progress has been
limited so far.
47.
Fund technical assistance to the BSL continue to focus on monetary operations,
banking supervision, and payment systems. Additional assistance is expected on
developing primary and secondary market operations and liquidity forecasting of the BSL.

26

The liquid-asset ratio will remain at 40 percent for demand deposits and 20 percent for
time and savings deposits, comprising cash in tills and vaults, placements with the First
Discount House, holdings in treasury bills, and holdings of treasury bearer bonds maturing
within 91 days.
27

Repurchase operations are already taking place between commercial banks and the First
Discount House.

- 25 -

External sector policies
48.
The current account deficit should begin to narrow in 2005, after reaching its
peak in 2004. The current account deficit is projected to reach 18 percent of GDP in 2004.
Exports are projected to remain buoyant this year, benefiting from the resumption of rutile
production, while imports would remain high owing to the continued high demand for
reconstruction-related imports and the increased cost of fuel. Next year, export growth will
remain strong. While the growing economy would sustain a high demand for imports,
mining-related imports are expected to moderate. However, foreign exchange inflows on
account of emergency relief and UNAMSIL operations are projected to decline, thus
reducing appreciation pressure on the exchange rate.
49.
The Bank of Sierra Leone has adopted the Fifth Edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual and completed the compilation of the balance of payments for 2002. As a result, the
current account balance including public transfers has improved by about US$35 million in
2002 relative to previous estimates.28 This work has benefited from technical assistance from
STA, and entailed the development of new survey instruments.
50.
Significant progress has been achieved in preparing a comprehensive mineral
policy framework (Box 2). 29 In the interim, until the revisions to the legislative framework
have been finalized, the authorities intend to consult with Fund staff in the context of the
PRGF-supported program, as had been envisaged earlier (prior to any future commitments to
be made in this area).30
51.
Debt relief agreements with most official creditors have been reached, but there
is little progress with commercial creditors. Debt relief agreements on Naples terms have
been signed with all Paris Club creditors except Japan, and seven out of eleven agreements
28

The revision has led to better measurement of non-dutiable imports, and a very significant
upward revision in private transfers to non governmental organizations, which had not been
previously captured. Some items previously recorded as public transfers have also been
reclassified as private transfers, which contributed to a significant downward revision in the
current account deficit excluding public transfers.
29

Complementing these efforts in the non-mineral sector, the authorities intend to enact in
the near future an investment code, which has been reviewed by the World Bank.
30

The authorities consider last year’s decision to accept equity in a rutile mining project as a
one-off situation. The authorities intend to work towards ensuring that the terms of last year’s
agreement would not apply to any further mining leases of this company. The authorities,
however, do not object to offer of “free” equity, which is equivalent to a profit tax in the
sense that it allows the authorities to share in the upside benefits of projects, but does not
involve any financial obligations nor management involvement for the authorities.

- 26 -

on Cologne terms have been signed.31 Significant reduction in the NPV of debt to exports is
however expected after Sierra Leone reaches the HIPC completion point. All non-Paris Club
official creditors have agreed to deliver debt relief, or indicated their willingness to do so,
even though the terms in some cases fall short of what is expected under the HIPC Initiative.
The authorities have also requested the World Bank for a debt buyback operation under the
IDA facility in order to continue addressing the problem of commercial debt arrears (Box 5).

Box 5. Sierra Leone: Review of Financing Assurances
The staff considers that in light of the steps the authorities have taken to collaborate approach
with private commercial creditors, they have met the good-faith criterion established under the
Fund’s policy for lending into arrears.
The authorities have continued their efforts to reach agreements with commercial creditors
holding debt eligible for, but not included in, a 1995 World Bank-sponsored buyback. The
outstanding commercial debt can be broadly classified into three categories:
•

debt that was not validated at the time of the 1995 debt buyback, mostly because of late
submissions;

•

debt that was validated but where creditors chose not to participate in the debt buyback
operation;

•

and debt that was incurred after 1995, mostly owed to military suppliers.

Most of Sierra Leone’s commercial creditors have remained passive in recent years, but some
creditors, in particular those with claims in the second and third debt categories, have pressed
their claims aggressively, including using litigation. The authorities have engaged these
creditors repeatedly, and have made good-will payments of small amounts to several of them.
However, they have failed to reach debt rescheduling agreements that would be comparable to
recently signed Paris Club agreements and consistent with the HIPC Initiative.
To move the situation forward, the authorities decided to request a second debt-buyback to be
supported by the recently replenished debt-reduction facility of the World Bank (for IDA-only
countries). Such a debt buyback would be priced on the total outstanding obligations including
late interest and penalty, with prices always set below the NPV equivalent of the full provision
of traditional Paris Club and HIPC relief.
The accumulation of arrears to commercial creditors has not undermined program
implementation, since no new financing from commercial sources was anticipated.

31

Draft agreements for most of the outstanding cases have been prepared. Finalizing these
agreements has been delayed because negotiations were often conducted via correspondence,
which proved time consuming.

- 27 -

Structural reforms
52.
The reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data for the period 2000-02 will be a
structural performance criterion for end-November 2004. This would benefit from STA
technical assistance in October.32
53.
Further action is required to channel salary and other payments to teachers via
bank accounts. While the guidelines for the opening of school bank accounts were issued
earlier this year, the opening of these bank accounts has been slow at end-June school bank
accounts were only opened for about 30 percent of the schools). The government will aim at
raising the proportion of schools with bank accounts to 60 percent at end-December 2004,
which will be a structural benchmark for the sixth review under the program. Furthermore,
the government will encourage greater use of banking services for salary payments to civil
servants and teachers through individual bank accounts.
54.
The government is enhancing the effectiveness of public service deliveries. The
introduction of new personnel management regulations for the civil service, establishing a
code of ethics, an appraisal system, and a performance-based system, will be a prior action
for the fifth review. The government is also in the process of streamlining major ministries to
assist in the efficient staffing of the ministries. Diagnostics studies and reforms for six key
ministries would be finalized by 2005, and for the remaining ministries by end-2006. The
DfID is provided funding for these studies.
55.
Budgetary processes are being strengthened. The government would present to
Parliament, by end-October, the Budgetary and Accountability Act, aimed at streamlining the
budgetary process. In liaison with the World Bank, the government has also prepared interim
regulations to guide procurements until the new procurement act has been finalized (expected
by early next year); the authorities are in the process of establishing a permanent tender
board.33 In addition, there will be continuous structural benchmarks aimed at establishing and
publishing employment ceilings for all individual schools in the beginning of each school
year, and at updating monthly the database of civil servants and teachers. This information
would be used to update the payroll data base of the Accountant General’s Office.
56.
On securitizing the remaining stock of domestic arrears, the authorities have not yet
completed this structural benchmark. In order to bring this issue to a closure, the government
has examined various options and decided to pay smaller creditors in cash. For the remaining
amount of about Le 20 billion, which is owed to a single creditor and which is still subject to
legal and administrative disputes, the government was to communicate its final stand to the
claimant by end-September 2004.
32

Following reconciliation, the BSL will need to provide to the Fund revised program data
for all test dates.

33

The interim procurement regulations were approved by Cabinet in June 2004.

- 28 -

C. PRSP Process
57.
The authorities have completed the first draft of the full PRSP. They had
indicated that a full PRSP report would not be ready by mid-2004, as envisioned at the
conclusion of the fourth review, but would be completed in the coming months. The
authorities have undertaken the exercise in broad consultation with various sections of
society, and developed a policy framework comprising a matrix of four pillars related to
governance, pro-poor sustainable growth, human development, and addressing social
vulnerabilities. The staff underscored the importance of articulating clearly the policy agenda
that would emerge from the PRSP exercise, as this would help in securing, among other
things, donor support.34
D. Technical Assistance and Statistics
58.
Sierra Leone has received substantial technical assistance from the Fund in
recent years and has made progress in improving key areas. Full implementation of the
advice and recommendations is, however, constrained by limited institutional capacity.
Technical assistance in the fiscal area has focused on strengthening government’s
expenditure management, revenue administration, and income and indirect tax systems,
including the establishment of a tax regime for the country’s mineral sector and the
introduction of a value-added tax. In the monetary area, technical assistance has aimed at
enhancing the central bank’s monetary operations, strengthening the capacity to supervise
banks, and developing the payments system. With technical assistance from STA, BSL
adopted the Fifth Edition of the Balance of Payments Manual and completed the compilation
of the balance of payment for 2002.
59.
There is high demand for statistics with better coverage and quality.35 The
authorities are committed to promoting accepted international methodologies and standards
in the production and dissemination of official statistics. Although the country participates in
the General Data Dissemination Standards (GDDS) project, staff considers that Sierra Leone
still has a considerable way to go before it could meet the best practice GDDS
recommendations in the range and quality of outputs, as evidenced, for instance, by the
problems in reconciling monetary and fiscal data.
34

See further details on the progress with the PRSP in the joint staff assessment, prepared
jointly with the World Bank staff. Table 6 provides information on the progress with
implementing the HIPC triggers.

35

See the report of an IMF/World Bank joint mission in March 2004 on the Development of
a Strategic Plan for the Statistical System in Sierra Leone that made an initial assessment of
the steps required to prepare the statistical strategic plan as part of the beginning of a longer
process for national statistical development in Sierra Leone.

- 29 -

V. PROGRAM MONITORING AND REVIEWS
60.
The authorities are requesting waivers of the nonobservance of the structural
performance criteria on the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data, and on the
introduction of new personnel management regulations for the civil service. Regarding
the first structural performance criterion, the government was unable to complete it without
technical assistance from the Fund, made available in October 2004. On the second structural
performance criterion, the authorities had envisaged issuing the regulations to include the
new senior executive service. However, given the delays in the finalization of modalities for
the senior executive scheme, the authorities have decided to issue separately new regulations
only for existing civil servants. This structural measure will constitute a prior action for the
fifth review. The authorities are also requesting a waiver for the nonobservance at endMarch 2004 of the quantitative performance criterion on net domestic bank credit to the
government. The nonobservance resulted from the nondisbursement of non-HIPC program
support in the first quarter of 2004 to which the government could not adequately adjust
through expenditure cuts, given the large magnitude of the shortfall. It is expected that this
trend would be reversed during subsequent quarters following the receipt of external
financing.36 Fiscal measures have been undertaken to bring domestic financing closer to the
program target by year-end. In particular, the authorities have taken steps in the second half
of the year to reduce noninterest current expenditures below the program level. Domestic
financing of the budget will also be reduced below the mid-year level by about 0.5 percent of
GDP. For program monitoring, the sixth and final review will be completed by May 2005,
based on quantitative performance criteria through end-December 2004, a structural
performance criterion through end-November 2004, and indicative performance targets for
end-September 2004.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
61.
Economic recovery has been broad-based, reflecting improved business
confidence. Significant output gains have been made from post-conflict low levels, in
agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. However, inflation has also risen since 2003,
reflecting exogenous (higher cost of imported fuels) and policy-induced factors
(expansionary fiscal and monetary policies), as well as the depreciation of the exchange rate.
Despite the augmented activity levels, widespread poverty and high unemployment remain
critical socio-economic challenges, which need to be addressed in the medium- to long-term.
The full PRSP, to be finalized soon, should serve as an active vehicle for pursuing mediumterm objectives as well as the longer term goals (the MDGs).

36

The US$14.5 million was disbursed from AfDB in April 2004 and € 18 million was
disbursed from EU in September 2004.

- 30 -

62.
Real exchange rate depreciation in recent years has assisted Sierra Leone in
regaining international competitiveness. However, several disadvantages remain, including
poor infrastructure and the high cost of credit, which increase overall production costs.
Furthermore, public administration remains inefficient, although taxation and the tariff
regime do not impose an overly large burden.
63.
Performance under the program at end-March 2004 was mixed. While further
progress was made in implementing program structural measures, slippages occurred in other
areas of macroeconomic policy, as fiscal management was complicated by unanticipated
delays in external budgetary support. Further fiscal tightening and the containment or
reduction in domestic debt in the second half of 2004 will be essential to achieve program
objectives and safeguard debt sustainability.
64.
Provided that the PRGF-supported program is implemented effectively, overall
macroeconomic objectives for fiscal 2004 should be attained. Beyond this and also looking
ahead in the medium term, the following five areas need specific attention of the authorities.
65.
First, fiscal policy will need to assume a central role in supporting
macroeconomic stability. To achieve this, a better balance has to be achieved between
available resources and expenditure outlays. The government should seek to widen the
domestic resource envelope, by enhancing domestic revenue collections and tapping
additional revenues from expanded mineral activities. On the expenditure side, prioritization
will be essential, with a focus on protecting poverty-related outlays. An operational mediumterm budgetary framework, incorporating mineral revenues, reflecting the PRSP priorities,
and discussed with development partners, should be finalized by the authorities as a matter of
priority.
66.
Second, in order to derive full fiscal and related benefits from the country’s
considerable mineral potential, the authorities need to expedite the completion of the
on-going work on creating a consistent mineral policy framework for Sierra Leone. The
mining sector is promising for income and employment generation and, therefore, for poverty
reduction. The staff urged the authorities to revise the legislative framework for the mineral
sector, to make it consistent with the Core Mineral Policy (already approved by the Cabinet).
Furthermore, in order to protect tax revenues, the staff urged the authorities to eliminate or
tightly limit the discretionary granting of fiscal incentives to foreign investors.
67.
Third, monetary policy and practice need to be strengthened. In effect, this is
only possible if strongly supported by appropriate fiscal policy along the lines indicated
above. The BSL also needs to be more proactive in containing the growth of private sector
credit to control inflation and safeguard against future nonperforming loans. The staff
welcomes the BSL’s decision to increase reserve and liquidity ratios, as these measures
should in the short term assist the central bank in mopping up excess liquidity. Further
technical assistance from MFD will be needed in these directions. The strengthening of
BSL’s policy independence need to be pursued through institutional reforms over the
medium-term.

- 31 -

68.
Fourth, macroeconomic policies and structural reforms should aim at enhancing
saving and investment, targeting the domestic and foreign private sector. Sustained high
growth will require a substantial increase in domestic savings, both private and public.
Private savings should improve with enhanced income growth prospects as the economy
stabilizes from the post-conflict situation, but also a supportive institutional and policy
framework is needed, aimed especially at small- and medium-size savers. The authorities will
also need to plan for budgetary savings, within medium-term frameworks, in order to reduce
the overdependence of public investment financing on external sources. This issue has been
stressed in the context of public expenditure review discussions with the World Bank. In
respect of private investment, continued political and economic stability, together with
determined efforts to enhance Sierra Leone's investment climate, while addressing
governance issues, should assist in attracting both domestic and foreign investors. The staff
welcomed the finalization and imminent adoption of the new investment code, developed
with the assistance of the World Bank. The main risk to the medium term growth strategy
lies in the area of saving and investment. Without substantial progress on the savings side
and improvements in the investment rate, growth would slow down. The policy and
institutional measures required in this broad area will, therefore, remain critical.
69.
Fifth, while current data provision is adequate for Fund’s surveillance, efforts
should be continued to strengthen the country’s statistical base. Progress is being made
in the compilation of monetary and balance of payments statistics through implementing the
recommendations of previous statistics technical assistance missions. However, staff urged
the authorities to continue their efforts to improve other components of the database,
especially national accounts, through Fund and other technical assistance.
70.
On the basis of the steps taken to reduce noninterest current expenditures with the
objective of bringing domestic financing closer to the program target by end-2004, to deal
with the slippages in meeting the quantitative performance criterion for end-March on net
bank credit to the government, and the introduction of new personnel management
regulations for the civil service as a prior action subject to the fifth review under the PRGF
arrangement, the staff recommends that the Executive Board grants waivers for the
nonobservance of the performance criteria. Based on the commitments made in the attached
letter of intent, and the accompanying MEFP, the staff recommends completion of the fifth
review under the PRGF arrangement and extension of the arrangement for a three-month
period. The staff also recommends that the Ex-Post Assessment (EPA) for Sierra Leone be
considered by the Board at the time of the sixth review.
71.
The next Article IV consultation with Sierra Leone will be held in accordance with
the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.

Sources: Sierra Leonean authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ BOP data for 2002 were compiled for the first time on the basis of the Balance of Payment Manual Fifth Edition (BPM5), which has led to a number of significant changes.
2/ Includes unrecorded diamond exports estimated from partner-country data.

3/ The increase in imports is due to a better measurement of non-dutiable imports.

4/ Official interest payments due, including Fund charges.
5/ Includes mostly program grants.
6/ Includes worker remittances and transfers to NGOs.
7/ The adoption of the Balance of Payment Fifth Edition for 2002 data has led to a better measurement of private transfers through the use of new survey instruments
and through a reclassification of items as private transfers that were previously counted as public transfers, which led to significant changes in private and current
transfers.
8/ Includes investment related to the rehabilitation of the Koidu Kimberlite mine
9/ Assumes investment into rutile mining, financed by foreign loans, foreign investment, and government on-lending of an EU grant.
10/ Amortization due increases in 2003 and beyond because of debt service payments falling due on previously rescheduled arrears.
11/ Includes capital outflows associated with unrecorded diamond exports, change in trade credit, and errors and omissions.
12/ The arrears accumulation in 2002 is due to technical arrears that were accumulated while negotiations with bilateral creditors on rescheduling were not yet
concluded. The arrears reduction in 2003 results from the implementation of arrear rescheduling agreements with the EU, the Saudi Fund for Economic Development,
and the OPEC Fund. In 2004, arrear clearance operations with the EU and the OPEC Fund are completed.
13/ This reflects the rescheduling on Cologne terms for the period 2002-04 agreed by the Paris Club at the decision point in February 2002, and comparable relief by other creditors.
14/ The financing gap in 2005 could be closed with disbursements from the Fund under the present arrangement and a possible successor arrangement.
15/ The upward revision in the current account balance-to-GDP ratios reflects revisions due to the adoption of BPM5, and a significant upward revision in GDP.
16/ In months of imports of total goods and services of subsequent year.

- 44 Table 6. Sierra Leone: Status of HIPC Initiative Completion Point Triggers
Triggers
PRSP. Preparation of a full PRSP and implementation for at least one
year, as evidenced by the satisfactory joint staff assessment of the
PRSP and the country’s annual progress report.
Macroeconomic stability. Continued maintenance of macroeconomic
stability, as evidenced by satisfactory implementation of the PRGFsupported program.
Use of budgetary savings. The budgetary savings from interim debtservice relief in 2002 have been used in the priority areas indicated in
Table 2 of the enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
– Decision Point Document (www.imf.org) and monitored in the
framework for poverty reduction expenditures. The increase in total
spending on these priorities will be proportionate to HIPC relief.
Budgetary savings from interim debt-service relief in subsequent years
will be used in accordance with the agreed annual budgets for those
years.
Governance and decentralization of government functions:
• Completion of disarmament and demobilization and provision of
reintegration assistance to all ex-combatants under the DDR program.
• Biannual tracking of public expenditures on priority areas within
the PETS framework, including development expenditures,
dissemination and publication of results.
• Adoption and implementation of the MTEF, and budget system for
tracking expenditures at the regional levels.

Structural measures:
• New privatization legislation was introduced in September 2002
for the establishment of an independent National Privatization
Commission (NCP) to implement the government divestiture strategy.
• Adoption by the government of a revised mining policy to promote
formal activity (including artisan mining) and attract private
investment for medium-and large-scale mining.
Education:
• The primary gross enrollment rates for girls will have been
increased to at least 65 percent.
• At least 1,500 unqualified teachers will have received formal inservice training in primary schools, and at least 500 unqualified
teachers will have received in-service training in secondary schools.
Health:
• Distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets will have increased
from 18,482 in 2000 to 60,000.
• At least 200 persons, including health professionals and staff from
line ministries and civil society organizations, will have been provided
by the National HIV/AIDS Secretariat with HIV/AIDS, and STIs
education and training on prevention and basic care, in order to
encourage HIV/AIDS, and STIs avoidance behavior, destigmatize the
disease, and support those infected or otherwise affected by the
disease.
• Immunization coverage (percentage of children aged 12 to 23
months immunized against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus) will have
increased to at least 55 percent.

Status
A draft full PRSP has been circulated in August 2004 to solicit
comments from development partners before the finalization of the
document.
Macroeconomic stability continues to be maintained, as evidenced by
satisfactory implementation of the PRGF arrangement.
Utilization of interim HIPC relief in 2003 and beyond will facilitate the
required increase in budgetary outlays for pro-poor programs, including
the provision of education, health, and reviving agriculture and rural
development activities that directly benefit the poor.

• The Government concluded the DDR exercise in February 2004,
which benefited over 72,000 ex-combatants.
• Review of the PETS was conducted in March 2003, followed by
the development of a generic resource flow model. A Public
Expenditure Review (PER) was conducted, by the Government in
partnership with its main development partners, in January and
completed in June 2004.
• The coverage of the MTEF is being widened within the context of
the on-going decentralization programm that is contained in the Local
Government Act, 2004. The execution of the fiscal budget, starting
from 2005, will be decentralized to line Ministries, Government
Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in conformity with the on-going
drive for decentralization.
• NCP is fully operating and the strategic plan for the divestiture of
24 public enterprises, by December 2006, is ready for implementation.
Study visits have been concluded in all parastatals, of which three key
ones are slated for privatization by December 2004.
• Stakeholders’ workshop was held in Freetown to review and
strategize on a policy for reviving and promoting mining activities,
attracting private investment in the mining sector, and controlling the
artisanal mining.
• Primary school gross enrollment rates increased to 70.7 percent in
2002/03 school year, with the female gross enrollment in primary
school being 42 percent.
• 1,573 unqualified teachers are programmed for training under
REBEP, funded jointly by World Bank and AfDB. A training module
for unqualified secondary school teachers started in January 2004.
• Preliminary data suggest that 65,000 insecticide-treated bed nets
had been distributed by 2003.
• 14 public sector institutions established HIV/AIDS offices and
management team; 6 additional institutions have prepared work plan to
address HIV/AIDS among workers and with the support of UNICEF, a
two-day workshop was held for journalists on HIV/AIDS reporting.
Numerous guidelines have been developed and disseminated to various
public institutions pertaining to voluntary confidential counseling and
testing, antiretroviral treatment, prevention of mother to child
transmission, and monitoring and evaluation. Training has also been
provided on sentinel surveillance.
• 52 percent of the children aged 0-5 years have undergone the full
cycle of immunization coverage.

APPENDIX I

October 28, 2004
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
In accordance with the provisions of the three-year arrangement (approved on
September 26, 2001) under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), the
government of Sierra Leone, in cooperation with staff of the IMF, has evaluated the
implementation of the program to end-March 2004, and performance through end-June 2004.
The attached memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) highlights recent
economic developments and performance during 2003 and the first quarter of 2004, and sets
out the government’s macroeconomic objectives and policies and the structural reform
agenda for the remainder of 2004.
2.
Economic activity remained robust in 2003 and has continued at a solid pace this
year, reflecting expansions in agriculture, mining, and the services. Progress in enhancing
domestic security and the success in maintaining political and economic stability have
bolstered confidence. However, inflation has accelerated, in part owing to external factors.
The government expects the pace of economic expansion to continue strengthening in the
medium term, particularly as new mining projects are brought on line, and as confidence in
the economy improves. The government will work to ensure that economic expansion, key to
addressing the poverty problem, is undertaken while maintaining macroeconomic stability.
3.
Performance under the PRGF-supported program at end-March 2004 was mixed. The
government met all quantitative performance criteria except on net bank credit to the central
government, owing to the nondisbursement of external program support. The scaling down of
government expenditures proved inadequate to limit government bank borrowing. While
progress was made in implementing program structural measures, two structural performance
criteria were missed. The reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data for 2000-02 was not
completed by the end-May 2004 deadline, reflecting delays in the provision of STA technical
assistance. In addition, the issuance of new personnel management regulations for the civil
service, expected to be effected by end-May 2004, was delayed pending the finalization of a
compensation scheme for the senior executive service (SES); however, the implementation of
SES has now been further delayed due to the need to first clarify its financing. Therefore, the
government has decided to issue new personnel management regulations for existing civil
service by mid-October, 2004. Once the SES scheme takes effect, personnel management
regulations will be amended accordingly. The government of Sierra Leone has also taken
other measures to address the shortcomings and to bring performance during the second half
of 2004 broadly in line with the original program.

- 51 -

APPENDIX I

4.
In view of the above, the government of Sierra Leone requests for waivers on the
nonobservance of the end-March 2004 quantitative performance criterion relating to net
domestic bank credit to the government and on the nonobservance of the structural
performance criteria related to the completion of the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary
data for 2000-02 and the issuance of new personnel management regulations for the civil
service. The government requests for the completion of the fifth review and the disbursement
of the eight loan under the PRGF arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 14 million
(13.5 percent of quota).
5.
The government believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate
to achieve the objectives of its program, but will take any further measures that may become
appropriate for this purpose. Sierra Leone will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these
measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance
with the Fund’s policies on such consultation. The government is continuing to address
medium-term development issues, and has completed the first draft of a full PRSP that has
also been discussed with key stakeholders. The quantitative and structural performance
criteria for the sixth review, and quarterly indicative targets through end-2004, are set out in
Tables 2 and 4 of the MEFP.
6.
The fifth program review was held up by the delay in securing external financing that
was critical to the program. Upon the closing of the program financing gap, new
understandings were reached on the phasing of, and conditions for, the ninth disbursement,
which is proposed to be subject to end-December 2004 quantitative performance criteria, an
end-November structural performance criterion, structural benchmarks through endDecember, and a sixth program review, scheduled to be completed by end-May 2005. Given
the timing of the completion of the fifth review, the government would like to also request a
three-month extension of the arrangement from the current expiration date of March 25,
2005.
7.
The government authorizes the publication of this letter and the attached MEFP by
the Fund, including the posting of such documents to the IMF website, subsequent to
Executive Board approval.
Yours sincerely,

MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
OF THE GOVERNMENT OF SIERRA LEONE FOR APRIL 1–DECEMBER 31, 2004
VII. INTRODUCTION
1.
Progress continued to be made in strengthening peace and security in Sierra Leone.
The disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) program was completed in
February 2004, and improved security in neighboring Liberia is further enhancing stability.
The withdrawal of the United Nations forces in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), originally
scheduled for end-2004, has been delayed by the UN Security Council, maintaining a
reduced UNAMSIL presence until mid-2005, to allow more time for strengthening domestic
armed and police forces.
2.
Local government elections were held in May 2004. A decentralization plan and
timetable is being developed by the government. The Ministry of Finance is identifying
budgetary resources (for the 2005 budget) from line ministries for the devolved functions,
including primary education and primary health car. The total budgetary provisions for these
programs will be distributed to all regional and city councils using a grants distribution
formula, which reflects the relative needs of each council. Additional fiscal implications are
likely, given the need to strengthen ministries for carrying out their new functions of policy
formulation, monitoring and supervision.
3.
Improved security and the decentralization of government are having a positive
impact on the environment in which the government’s growth and poverty reduction policies
are being implemented.
4.
This memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) supplements the
one issued in February 2004. It describes recent developments and performance under the
program, and outlines government’s macroeconomic objectives and policies for the
remainder of 2004.
VIII. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
5.
Output growth was strong in 2003, reflecting robust agricultural, mining, and
manufacturing operations, but the economy also experienced a sharp increase in consumer
prices. Real output is estimated to have increased by 9.3 percent. Statistics Sierra Leone has
now received detailed returns on outturns for 2001 and 2002 and has revised GDP growth
rates for these years. Given the stronger than the earlier estimated performance in agriculture,
real GDP growth for 2001 is now put at 18 percent, compared to the original 5.4 percent,
while it is revised to 27.5 percent from 6.6 percent in 2002. Annual average inflation rose to
8.2 percent, resulting initially from higher fuel costs but expansionary monetary policy,
partly owing to delays in donor support, and a depreciation of the currency towards the end
of the year also fueled inflation. Year-on year inflation accelerated from 11.3 percent at end
December 2003 to 14.6 percent at end-June 2004.

- 53 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

6.
Fiscal performance in 2003 was somewhat weaker than envisioned, largely due to
overruns related to domestic outlays. While domestic revenue collection was stronger and
total expenditures were only marginally higher than projected, mainly reflecting higher wage
and nondefense expenditures (the latter included poverty-related outlays that exceeded the
programmed level by 0.1 percent of GDP), a shortfall in external program grants and loans,
vis-à-vis the original program, led to large domestic financing of the budget, especially from
the banking system.
7.
Fiscal pressures continued in the first quarter of 2004. The government scaled
down its expenditure outlays mainly in response to the 3.4 percent of GDP shortfall in nonHIPC external program grants and loans, but in the event domestic bank and nonbank
financing of the budget was larger than programmed. Non-interest current expenditures were
below the programmed level (this included lower than programmed social and povertyrelated outlays), whereas domestic interest outlays, in part reflecting the higher cost of
borrowing, and the repayment of domestic supplier and wage arrears were higher than
originally programmed.
8.
Poverty-related expenditures were constrained by delays in the issuance of new
procurement guidelines in line with the ongoing reforms in procurement policy. The delays
resulted in a large backlog in processing contract awards and, hence, effected payments. For
end-March 2004, actual expenditure for poverty-related outlays was Le 29 billion compared
to a projected amount of Le 55 billion, as significant under spending occurred in the health
sector. Domestic interest expenditures exceeded programmed levels in the first quarter of
2004 reflecting higher domestic bank borrowing and the higher interest rates on government
securities.
9.
Broad and reserve money growth rates in 2003 were higher than projected, mainly
due to expansion of credit to the government and the private sector. Growth in both
magnitudes continued at a rapid pace in the first quarter of 2004. Interest rates on threemonth Treasury bills rose to 26½ percent in March 2004, reflecting inflationary pressures
and large domestic borrowing of the government, while bank-lending rates remained
unchanged at 20 percent, after adjusting for inflation, the rates stood at 14 and 8 percent
respectively. Private sector credit expanded strongly in the first quarter, continuing the pace
experienced in 2003. This rapid expansion (from a relatively low base) is in part explained by
sustained high activity levels, notably in construction, manufacturing, and services.
10.
The external current account deficit, excluding official transfers, widened in 2003
to 14.1 percent of GDP, from 12.1 percent in 2002. However, this was less than programmed
and reflected delays in rehabilitating the Rutile mining operations. While export performance
during the year improved significantly, particularly for diamonds, import needs remained at a
high level due to continued expansion in reconstruction activities and high oil prices. Gross
official reserves fell to 1.5 months of imports (US$60 million at end-2003), and remained at
about the same level by end of first quarter in 2004.

- 54 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

11.
Partly due to delays in external donor assistance during the year, the government
missed a number of indicative performance targets at end-2003. The indicative ceilings on
net domestic bank credit to the government, and on net domestic assets of the Bank Sierra
Leone (BSL), as well as the floor on domestic primary budget balance were missed. The
ceiling on the government’s wage bill was also missed, in part due to the earlier
underestimation of pension and related social security expenditures as well as the
depreciation of the exchange rate that affected salary payments to foreign missions. All other
indicative program targets were met, including the floors on government domestic revenues
and poverty-related outlays.
12.
All quantitative performance criteria for the eight disbursement under the PRGF
arrangement have been met, except for the ceiling on net bank credit to the government, in
part owing also to the unexpected shortfall in program grants and loans (mainly, from the
African Development Bank (AfDB)), which was disbursed in April 2004, and from the
European Union (EU)). The end-March 2004 indicative program targets for floors on total
domestic government revenue and poverty-related expenditures were also missed. On the
revenues, there was some diversion of taxable activities through Liberia following the
beginning of the peaceful political transition in that country. As mentioned above, the
implementation of new procurement procedures delayed procurement in the social sectors
resulting in lower-than-projected expenditures.
13.
All structural performance criteria subject to the fifth review under the program
have been met, with the exception of the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data for 200002, and the issuance of new personnel management regulations. The exercise to reconcile
fiscal and monetary data will not be completed by the end-May 2004 deadline, reflecting
delays in the provision of IMF technical assistance. The issuance of new personnel
management regulations was delayed to allow the incorporation of the proposed new
structure for top civil servants—the senior executive service (SES)—into the guidelines.
Guidelines requiring double signature in operating school bank accounts were issued in
February 2004. However, the opening of school accounts has been slow as only 30 percent of
schools were operating bank accounts as at end June 2004.The aim now is to double the
proportion to 60 percent by end-2004. Identification cards were issued by mid-March for the
remaining twenty percent of all verified teachers.
14.
Progress has also been made in completing the benchmarks under the program.
With regard to the specific measures to strengthen the Auditor General’s Office, additional
professional and managerial staff has been hired to expedite the audits of government
ministries and agencies. Employment ceilings for individual schools have been established
and published in the government gazette. The Establishment Secretary’s Office (ESO)
database of civil servants and teachers is being updated monthly and used to update the
payroll data of the Accounting General’s Office. Equipment has been acquired to support
efforts for making the photo verification system for civil servants and teachers in the ESO
fully operational, and seven new staff have been hired. An action plan has been formulated to
implement recommendations of the financial audit of the Ministry of Education. The
amendments to the Income Tax Act, Sales Tax Act, and Customs Act to ensure consistency

- 55 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

with the National Revenue Authority Act are proceeding with the assistance of the
Commonwealth Secretariat and will be completed by mid-2005. Plans to convert the ESO
into a personnel management office is under way, and are being supported by the U.K.
Department for International Development (DfID). On the issuance of identification cards for
all civil servants, the software to handle the data has been obtained, and the process will
conclude by end-December 2004. The Fund provided, in April 2004, technical assistance for
developing a medium-term budgetary framework that would incorporate all major mineral
revenues. The medium-term budget will systematically incorporate these revenues beginning
in 2005. On the securitization of all remaining verified domestic arrears, the government has
examined various options and decided to pay smaller creditors directly. The remaining
Le 20 billion owed to a single creditor has continued to raise legal and other questions which
the government will examine, and communicate its final stand to the claimant by endSeptember 2004. Finally, diagnostic studies related to six key ministries have been
completed, and Cabinet has approved action plans on three of those. The remaining three are
at various stages of review and approval. Under phase 2 of the Governance Reform Project
funded by DfID, diagnostic studies on the remaining government ministries will be
conducted over a period of three years.
15.
The third public expenditure tracking survey (PETS) for FY 2002 was conducted in
October 2003 to effectively track the flow of public funds. The October 2003 survey traced
the flow of school fees subsidy, teaching and learning materials and essential drugs from the
central government to schools and health units, for financial year 2002. The report was issued
in July 2004. The survey identified significant transfer discrepancies in the flow of essential
drugs from the headquarters to health facilities. Similarly, transfer discrepancies were
discovered in the flow of teaching and learning materials. The survey also revealed that the
payment of school fees subsidies to primary schools improved significantly when an auditing
firm, KPMG, was contracted to undertake the payments.
16.
The IMF and the World Bank conducted a HIPC Expenditure Tracking Survey
(AAP) in January 2004. Sixteen key indicators were reviewed and benchmarks set for each
indicator. The assessment shows that the country met 7 out of the 16 Public Expenditure
Management (PEM) benchmarks in 2003. An action plan has been prepared to strengthen
PEM. With the coordinated assistance of the major donors active in PEM, adequate technical
assistance is being provided to support the implementation of the action plan.37
17.
Interim procurement rules and regulations were approved by Cabinet in June 2004
and were made effective immediately. A public procurement board to review procurement
cases has been set up. The drafting of a comprehensive procurement law commenced in June
2004, and a technical working group has been established by to review recommendations of
37

The IMF has introduced a regional public expenditure management advisor, based in
Accra, Ghana, to cover Sierra Leone, among other countries. This expert will focus primarily
on the issues identified in the HIPC AAP report.

the consultant drafting the law. A national consultative workshop was held in August 2004.
The draft law will then be submitted to Cabinet for approval and subsequently to Parliament
for enactment.
18.
On the preparation of a full poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), a first
complete draft was finalized in August. A series of consultations with key stakeholders were
undertaken in 2004, leading to policy matrices based on four sets of policy pillars.
Quantitative and qualitative poverty analyses have been carried out (partly based on a
household survey finalized in early 2004) and a poverty profile (including a poverty line) has
been established. Sector reviews were concluded in June. The complete draft is scheduled to
be discussed with domestic shareholders and development partners in August/September, to
be followed shortly after that by the finalization of the paper.
19.
In order to strengthen the fight against corruption, a review of the organization and
activities of the Anti-Corruption Commission was completed in 2002, with several
recommendations made for strengthening the commission, including capacity building,
strategic planning, staff rationalization, pay enhancement, and other improvements in the
conditions of service. Since March 2004, the Commission has been implementing these
recommendations. Furthermore, the prosecution of alleged corruption cases is being
expedited by the arrival of two judges from the United Kingdom while on the investigative
side, the relevant department of the commission is being strengthened by the recruitment, by
DfID, of two principal investigators and a senior investigator.
20.
A number of projects are currently under way to speed up the privatization of state
enterprises. In the financial sector, a financial advisor would be selected soon to lead the
privatization of the National Development Bank (fully government-owned) and the Rokel
Commercial Bank (majority government-owned). A consultant is being hired to set up the
regulatory agency for the energy sector. A consulting firm, PKF, has submitted a report to the
government for the privatization of the non-core activities of the ports, namely, port services,
ferry services, slipway and clinic. In addition, the terms of reference have been prepared for
the consultant to undertake a study on the core activities. A joint venture company has been
established to transform the National Workshop into an economic and trade zone;
construction work has already commenced. The UNDP has provided funding for the
evaluation of the assets of the Forestry Industries and KPMG has been appointed to
undertake the study.
21.
In November 2003, the government cleared all outstanding arrears to the National
Power Authority (NPA) through a settlement of cross debt liabilities, which resulted in the
net debt of Le 6.4 billion due from the government (paid in cash). In addition, several
measures have been implemented to prevent the reoccurrence of arrears, including priority
payment for utility bills by ministries out of departmental expenditure outlays. Government
has also mandated the utility companies to disconnect ministries in default of payment.
However, government has accumulated arrears to the national telephone company
(Sierra Tel) and Guma Water Company. A payment plan has been agreed. An amount of
Le1 5 billion was paid to the two parastatals during the first half of 2004.

- 57 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

IX. OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2004
22.
The government is assuming growing responsibility for maintaining peace and
security, while effecting the decentralization of public administration and related services to
local (district) authorities. Increased emphasis will be placed on maintaining macroeconomic
stability and reducing poverty. A full PRSP will be finalized in the course of the year and
discussed with key domestic stakeholders and development partners.
23.
The program for 2004 projects real GDP growth at 7.4 percent, revised upwards
from 6.8 percent in the original program (following the revised national accounts), supported
mainly by the continued recovery of the agricultural sector and expanded reconstruction and
other investment activities. Average annual inflation has also been revised upward in light of
the continued rapid rise in the consumer prices. For 2004, inflation is projected to average
13½ percent.
A. Fiscal Policy
24.
Fiscal policy will aim at supporting macroeconomic stability. A particular issue
relates to the domestic interest bill, which is projected to rise by almost 2 percent of GDP
relative to the program, reflecting rising interest rates and higher domestic borrowing. With
domestic revenues projected at slightly below the level of the original program (12.2 percent
of GDP), domestic non-interest expenditures will have to be contained to provide for the
higher interest outlays. The overall fiscal deficit, including grants, will increase from 5½
percent of GDP to 7½ percent (at 17 percent excluding grants) while the domestic primary
deficit will decline by 2 percentage points to 3 percent of GDP. The government will aim at
protecting poverty-related spending. The domestic financing of the budget is expected to rise
to about 1½ percent of GDP in 2004 compared to 0.9 percent in the program, to allow a
modest easing on the tight expenditure constraint.
25.
Domestic revenues are expected to reach Le 348 billion in 2004, reflecting gains
due to higher exchange rate and inflation, as well as improvements in revenue collection
efforts. A specific issue concerns the scope for implementing rate reductions for income and
corporate taxes (as announced in the 2004 budget); these revenue measures would be
expected to amount to about ⅔ of a percent of annual GDP. However, given the very tight
fiscal position, the tax rate reductions will be postponed beyond this fiscal year.
26.
External budgetary support will be broadly in line with the original program, but
uncertainties remain regarding the timing of the disbursement. Domestic financing of
the 2004 budget will need to come largely from nonbank sources as envisioned under the
program, as net bank credit to the government will have to be curtailed.
27.
In respect of mineral taxation, an important milestone was reached in November
2003 with the adoption of the Core Mineral Policy, which defines the broad policy
framework for the mineral sector. The next step, envisioned to be completed by mid-2005,
will be to amend the 1996 mineral act to make it consistent with the new policy framework,
issue relevant regulations, and develop a tax schedule for the mineral sector. All future

- 58 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT I

agreements with mining companies will be subsidiary to the revised mineral act.38 NRA has
undertaken to develop model agreements for the rest of the mineral sector, based on a model
agreement for the petroleum sector. In light of the significant revenues that are expected from
the mineral sector in coming years, the government has decided to join the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) to ensure maximum transparency in the collection
of these revenues. To this end, the government will work with mining companies and the
civil society towards the development of revenue reporting templates, which will be
reconciled by an independent agent, and published. As a first concrete step in this direction,
the government has requested technical assistance from the World Bank. Furthermore, tax
incentives have been included in the relevant tax laws, and not in the Investment Code.
28.
On the expenditure side, some reductions for the rest of 2004 are planned in critical
lines, including security and economic outlays, while, as much as possible, safeguarding
poverty-related outlays. In respect of the wage bill, its reporting will be done on an accrual,
rather than on cash basis in order to prevent repeated and unanticipated build-up of arrears.
The accumulation and payment of wage arrears will be shown separately below the line.
Furthermore, the hiring of teachers and other civil servants as well as any increases in
salaries would be strictly guided by programmed expenditures.
29.
As the international community reduces its intervention in maintaining peace in
Sierra Leone, the government will need to increasingly assume its responsibility in this area.
By October 2004, the peacekeeping forces, UNAMSIL, would have handed over
responsibility for security to the government throughout the country. This will have major
implications for security expenditures given the need to equip the security agencies. The
implementation of the decentralization process also has fiscal implications since all 19
councils would need to be assisted with initial administrative and related costs.
30.
The NRA will be pursuing a broad reform agenda aimed at enhancing the integrity
and probity of tax collectors at all levels. To improve tax administration, NRA has
decentralized the income tax department through the creation of tax districts and Taxpayer
Service Units (TSU) in each district; established a Large Taxpayer Unit (LTU) to improve
the management of tax arrears; streamlined the clearing of goods at the port; established
Flexible Anti-Smuggling Teams (FAST) to lead the fight against smuggling; developed a
strategy for the computerization of tax procedures; and mounted effective publicity and
education campaigns to sensitize taxpayers on their obligation. In 2004, the Government will
transfer to the NRA the three percent of tax revenues specified in the Act in order to
strengthen the institution. The Government Gold and Diamond Evaluation Office has now
been fully integrated into the NRA’s Income Tax Department to facilitate the collection of
the withholding tax for diamond exports. This has also resulted into the regularization of the
payment of a 5 percent withholding tax by the independent evaluator of Diamond Council
38

Fund staff will be consulted, in the context of the PRGF-supported program, prior to any
commitments to be made in this area.

International. With FAD technical assistance, medium-term revenue forecasts have been
proposed for each major mining project. The finalized forecasts will be incorporated in the
medium-term revenue framework beginning with the 2005 financial year.
31.
The implementation of the Automated System of Customs data (ASYCUDA) for
which the U.K. Department for International Development (DfID) has indicated readiness to
provide support is in progress. In this regard, technical assistance will be provided to conduct
a comparative study of ASYCUDA and Trade Net software to determine which would better
the NRA. The African Development Bank has also agreed to support the computerization of
the NRA subject to the outcome of an independent needs assessment, specification of
appropriate design features and costs.
B. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Reform
32.
Monetary policy in 2004 will complement fiscal policy to reduce inflation. The
BSL will pursue this objective mainly by managing its net domestic assets. Net bank credit to
the government will rise only modestly. Broad money is projected to rise by about 18
percent in 2004. To assist in containing money growth and mopping up excess liquidity, the
BSL raised the statutory reserve requirement ratio from 10 to 12 percent [the timing needs
to be confirmed by the authorities]. The BSL is also exploring the possibility of extending
the reserve requirement to foreign currency deposits of commercial banks, and would need
technical assistance from the Fund for the purpose. Secondary market trading in T-bills will
also soon be introduced. By end-October 2004, the Bank intends to commence securities
repurchase agreements (repos) after the necessary preparations have been finalized. Interest
rates should also rise as a result of the foregoing measures to moderate the growth of private
sector credit.
33.
The BSL has worked closely with the MFD on a program of reforms in the key
areas of banking supervision and monetary operations. Improvements in monetary
operations, together with the development of a secondary market for government securities,
will be critical for the BSL’s modernization program. In addition, efforts are under way to
strengthen the payments system. With the view of safeguarding the stability of the financial
system in light of the rapid growth in private sector credit, the BSL is monitoring closely the
portfolios of commercial banks to ensure observance of high credit standards.
34.
The exchange rate in Sierra Leone will continue to be market-driven, based on
BSL’s weekly foreign exchange auctions. At end-2003, the special window that had been
used by oil companies to purchase foreign exchange was closed.
35.
The BSL is implementing the recommendations of the Fund’s safeguard
assessment mission of 2002, in part to avoid the repetition of the internal check recycling
incident discovered in mid-2003. BSL’s external auditors have been replaced by a team
comprising a local and an internationally reputable audit firm; Parnell Kerr Forsters has been
selected to conduct the 2003 audit. The central bank’s recordkeeping is also being
computerized, with the view to strengthening internal controls.

ATTACHMENT I

C. External Sector Policies
36.
The current account deficit in 2004, excluding official transfers, is projected at
18 percent of GDP (at 12 percent, including transfers). A significant development on the
export side was the opening of the Koidu Kimberlite mine, which is expected to yield US$19
million in export receipts in 2004. Once the mine reaches full capacity in 2006 with an
annual production of about US$44 million, annual income to the government in form of
royalty, free carried interest, and corporate income tax payments could exceed
US$5 million.39 The government is also currently negotiating a production license for the
resumption of bauxite mining, and production could resume in late 2004. The rehabilitation
of these mines requires considerable capital imports, which have combined with the increase
in oil prices to produce strong growth in the value of projected imports. Over the mediumterm, however, import growth is expected to slow down leading to a considerable
improvement in the current account balance.
37.
The government has reached debt relief agreements with most of its official
creditors, but progress with commercial creditors has to date been limited. Despite efforts to
contact creditors with validated claims, and to make goodwill payments to most of them, it
has not been possible so far to reach debt relief agreements consistent with the HIPC
Initiative and on terms comparable to those granted by the Paris Club. In order to address this
situation, the government has decided to request for a second IDA debt buyback operation. It
is hoped that this would extinguish most of Sierra Leone’s outstanding commercial debt.
38.
In respect of fostering regional integration, the government plans to adjust its
external tariffs gradually toward the agreed common external tariff (CET) of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS). FAD has provided technical assistance for
this purpose. A study has also been initiated to assess the fiscal impact of the change in the
tariff regime, and a technical working group has been formed bringing together experts from
relevant ministries. A regional conference was held in July 2004 to review the various
country impact assessments with a view to adopting an implementation schedule consistent
with the 2005 implementation deadline.
D. Structural Reforms
39.
The program of structural reforms for the period July—December 2004 will focus
on three main areas: the management of the school system; the reinforcement of budgetary
discipline and transparency; and improvements in the civil service (Attachment I, table 4).
40.
In respect of the management of the school system, considerable progress has been
made. Further action is, however, needed in effecting payments for salaries and other
39

An exploration license in the Tonga area has been issued to the company operating the
Koidu Kimberlite mine. Should the bulk sampling be successful, a mine on a similar scale to
the Koidu mine could be developed.

transactions through the banking system. In this regard, the government is aiming at
increasing the proportion of schools with bank accounts from its current 30 percent to 60
percent at end-December 2004. In the same vein, the government will encourage greater use
of the banking system for the payment of salaries to civil servants and teachers through
individual bank accounts.
41.
The government is continuing to reinforce budgetary discipline and to increase
transparency. At a broad level, government is taking action to effect the enactment of the
Budgetary and Accountability Act, aimed at streamlining the budgetary process.
Additionally, interim guidelines have been adopted to guide government procurement; a
comprehensive legislation will be put in place before end-2004. The government has also
decided to monitor the wage bill on an accrual basis for each quarter of the year, starting in
the first quarter of 2005.
42.
Government is continuing to strengthen personnel management and to streamline
key ministries. New personnel management regulations for the civil service, establishing a
code of ethics, an appraisal system, and a performance-based system, will be issued by midOctober 2004. Diagnostics studies and reforms for key ministries will be finalized by 2005 to
assist in streamlining and staffing of these ministries. A senior executive service (SES)
within the civil service is planned to be introduced by mid-2005 to improve the management
of the key ministries and of governmental major initiatives. The introduction and
management of the SES will be made consistent with available fiscal resources.
X. PROGRAM MONITORING AND REVIEWS
43.
The government is requesting waivers for the nonobservance of the structural
performance criteria on the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary data, and on the issuance of
new personnel management regulations. The first performance criterion was missed because
of the delay in IMF technical assistance, while the implementation of the second one was
delayed in order to incorporate aspects related to the proposed senior executive service.
Furthermore, the government is requesting a waiver on the nonobservance of the quantitative
performance criterion at end-March 2004, pertaining to central government net credit from
the banking system, owing in part to the shortfall in external program grants and loans. The
government has since taken steps, as discussed in section III.A., to address this problem for
the remainder of 2004. Given the likely timing of the completion of the fifth review, the
government of Sierra Leone requests a three-month extension of the arrangement from the
current expiration date of March 25, 2005. The program will continue to be monitored based
on quantitative and structural performance criteria and benchmarks indicated in Tables 3
and 4 of this attachment. The sixth and final review of the PRGF arrangement will be
completed by end-May 2005, based on end-December 2004 quantitative performance
criteria, on end-November 2004 structural performance criterion, and on structural
benchmarks through end-December 2004.

Sierra Leone: Technical Memorandum of Understanding
October 2004
INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Sierra Leonean authorities
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding the definitions of the quantitative
performance criteria and benchmarks for the program supported by the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, as well as the related reporting requirements. The
definitions have been revised to ensure that the memorandum continues to reflect the best
understanding of the Sierra Leonean authorities and the Fund staff in monitoring the
program. Unless otherwise specified, all quantitative performance criteria and benchmark
will be evaluated in terms of cumulative flows from the beginning of the period, as specified
in Tables 1 and 3 of the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies of the
Government of Sierra Leone for April 1—December 31, 2004.
QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA: DEFINITIONS AND DATA SOURCES
Gross Foreign Exchange Reserves of the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL)
2.
Definition. Unless otherwise noted here, gross foreign exchange reserves of the Bank
of Sierra Leone (BSL) will be defined as reserve assets of the BSL. Reserve assets are
defined in the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual (5th ed.) and elaborated in the reserve
template of the Fund’s International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity: Guidelines
for a Data Template. They exclude, for example, foreign assets not readily available to, or
controlled by, the monetary authorities.
3.
Gross foreign exchange reserves consist of (a) monetary gold; (b) foreign currency in
cash; (c) unencumbered foreign currency deposits at non-resident banks; (d) foreign
securities and deposits; (e) SDR holdings and Sierra Leone’s reserve position with the Fund;
and (f) balances in the Bank of England account related to debt service to Paris Club
creditors. Gross reserves will exclude nonconvertible currencies and pledged, swapped, or
any encumbered reserves assets including but not limited to reserve assets used as collateral
or guarantees for third party external liabilities.
4.
Adjustment clauses. The floor on gross foreign exchange reserves will be adjusted
(a) downward (or upward) by the amount in U.S. dollars of the shortfall/excess in
programmed external budgetary assistance40; (b) downward (upward) for any shortfall/excess
40

External budgetary assistance is defined as program grants and program loans, but
excluding external financing for the Disarmamanent, Demobilization and Reintegration
(DDR) Program, project-related grants and loans. The leone value of the cumulative shortfall
(continued)

- 67 -

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

in the U.S. dollar value of disbursements from the IMF under the PRGF arrangement; and (c)
upward or downward for any increase in BSL short-term foreign currency-denominated debt
(to residents and nonresidents), using the definition of short-term debt below.
5.
For the purpose of this target, as well as of those for external debt and arrears,
valuation will be in U.S. dollars, using the program exchange rates. For the 2004 program,
the program exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other non-leone currencies will be
those prevailing at March 31, 2004.
6.
Supporting material. Data on gross foreign exchange reserves, including its
components, will be transmitted by the BSL to the Fund on a weekly basis within ten days of
the end of each week.
Net Domestic Assets of the (BSL)
7.
Definition. Net domestic assets (NDA) of the BSL are defined as the end-period
(based on daily data) stocks, during the month of the test dates, of the reserve money less net
foreign assets calculated at the program exchange rate of 2,735 leones per U.S. dollar.
Reserve money includes currency in circulation and required reserves on leone deposits. Net
foreign assets of the BSL are defined as gross foreign exchange reserves (defined above)
minus foreign liabilities (defined below).
8.
Foreign liabilities are defined as short-term (one year or less in original maturity)
foreign currency-denominated liabilities of the BSL to nonresidents and the outstanding use
of Fund credit.
9.
Adjustment clauses. The ceiling on the NDA of the BSL will be adjusted upward by
up to fifty percent of the amount of the shortfall in the external budgetary assistance at the
test dates. The ceiling will be adjusted downward by the amount of the excess in the external
budgetary assistance at the test dates.
10.
Supporting material. Net domestic assets of the BSL will be transmitted to the Fund
on a monthly basis within four weeks of the end of the month. This report will include
foreign assets excluded from the definition of gross foreign exchange reserves in Section IIA
above.

(excess) of external budgetary assistance will be calculated at the program exchange rate of
2,735 leones per U.S. dollar.

up to fifty percent of the amount of the shortfall in external budgetary assistance. The ceiling
will be adjusted downward by the amount of the excess in external budgetary assistance. The
leone value of the cumulative shortfall or excess in external budgetary assistance will be
converted at the program exchange rate of 2,735 leone per U.S. dollar. The ceiling will also
be adjusted downward (upward) by the net increase (decline) in the leone value of net issues
of government securities to the nonbank private sector up to the ceiling set on net domestic
bank credit to government for each test date.
13.
Supporting material. The data source for the above will be the series “Claims on
Government (Net)” submitted to Fund staff on a weekly basis and reconciled with the
monthly BSL monetary survey to be submitted to the Fund within six weeks of the end of
each month. These data will be reconciled with monthly reports on treasury bill transactions
and the ways-and-means account, and with treasury bearer bond transactions to be submitted

budgetary expenditures include but are not limited to those sub-components that are financed
by drawdown from the HIPC Relief Account at the BSL.
External Payment Arrears
22.
Definition. Official external payment arrears are defined as the stock of external
overdue debt-service payments by the public sector. For the purposes of this Memorandum,
the public sector will comprise the central government, all public enterprises and the BSL.
The nonaccumulation of external arrears is a performance criterion during the
program period. Excluded from this performance criterion are those debts subject to
rescheduling arrangements. This performance criterion will apply on a continuous basis.
23.

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

Official Medium- and Long-Term Nonconcessional Loans
24.
Definition. Those are defined as all forms of official debt contracted or guaranteed by
the public sector.41 This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in Annex
1of this Technical Memorandum of Understanding but also to commitments contracted or
guaranteed for which value has not been received. This performance criterion will apply on a
continuous basis. Excluded from this performance criterion are disbursements from the IMF
and rescheduling arrangements. In this memorandum, the public sector consists of the central
and regional governments and other public agencies, including the BSL.

Technical Memorandum of Understanding. For this purpose, short-term debt will exclude
normal trade credit for imports. A performance criterion is no new external short-term debt
during the program period. This performance criterion will apply on a continuous basis.
27.
Supporting material. A comprehensive report on all new external debt with original
maturity of less than one year owed or contracted by the public sector will be transmitted to
Fund staff by the BSL on a quarterly basis within four weeks of the end of each quarter.

41

Debt is considered concessional if it has a grant element equalent to 35 percent or more.
Calculation of the degree of concessionality of new external borrowing is based on the 10year average commercial interest reference rate (CIRR) of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) for loans with maturities at least 15 years and the
six-month average CIRR for loans maturiting in less than 15 years.

APPENDIX I
ATTACHMENT II

Implementation of the Revised Guidelines on Performance
Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt
The term “debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines
on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted on August
24, 2000 [which reads as follows: “(a) For the purpose of this guideline, the
term “debt” will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent,
liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of
value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which
requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these
payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred
under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones
being as follows: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money to obligor by the lender
made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in
the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and
buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to
fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer
in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier
permits the obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on
which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e.,
arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the
right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually
shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor
retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is
the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments
expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding those
payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
(b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9(a) above, arrears,
penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make
payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt.
Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under
this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt”]. (B)
Excluded from this performance criterion are normal import-related credits,
disbursements from the IMF, and those debts subject to rescheduling
arrangements.

VIII. Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) is subject to
an assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement, which was approved on September 26,
2001 and is scheduled to expire on September 24, 2004. A safeguards assessment of the BSL
was completed on July 29, 2002. The assessment concluded that substantial risks may exist
in the financial reporting framework. Staff findings, proposed recommendations under
program conditionality, and other recommendations are reported in “Sierra Leone—Second
Review Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and Request for a Waiver of
Performance Criteria,” (www.imf.org). Measures are being implemented by the BSL within
the prescribed timeframe. Measures with future deadlines continue to be monitored by staff.

APPENDIX II

Exchange Rate Arrangement

Since April 25, 1990, the exchange rate has been market determined. Commercial banks may
buy and sell foreign exchange from/to individual customers, as well as trade among
themselves or with the BSL on a freely negotiable basis. The BSL calculates an official
exchange rate every Friday morning as the weighted average of the auction rate, the
commercial banks’ mid-rate, and the bureaus’ mid-rate in the previous week, for customs
valuation purposes and for official transactions. As end-August 2004, the BSL mid-rate was
Le 2,716.84=US$1. The exchange rate regime is classified as “independently floating.”
With effect from December 14, 1995, Sierra Leone has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. On June 29, 2001, Sierra Leone removed the remaining
exchange restriction, in the form of a tax clearance certificate required for payments and
transfers of certain types of current international transactions.

APPENDIX III

Sierra Leone: Relations with the World Bank Group
The World Bank, through IDA, has assisted the government in pursuing four main objectives
as the country moves out of conflict: (i) consolidating peace, (ii) resettlement, reconstruction,
and reintegration, (iii) improving governance, and (iv) maintaining a macroeconomic
framework conducive to recovery. Instruments used in supporting these objectives have been
the second Public Sector Management Support Project (PSMS II), the Second and Third
Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Credits (ERRC II and III), the Community
Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project (CRRP) and the National Social Action Project.
The Bank’s Board endorsed a Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) for Sierra Leone for
FY 2002–FY 2003 on March 26, 2002. The Bank will complete a successor Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) in FY 2005. The Bank supports the Government’s HIV/AIDS
Program through the Multi-Sector HIV/AIDS Response Project approved on the same date,
under the MAP II.
To meet Sierra Leone’s exceptional financing needs in this transitional period, and based on
the country’s Post-Conflict Performance Rating, in FY03 the Bank provided US$30 million
in adjustment support (ERRC III), US$20 for the Rehabilitation of Basic Education, US$20
million for Health Reconstruction and Development, US$35 million for the National Social
Action Project for a total of US$105 million. In FY 2004 the Bank provided US$25 million
for an Institutional Reform and Capacity Building (ICRB) project. In FY 2005 the Bank has
provided US$35 million for a Power and Water Project and plans a US$12–15 million quickdisbursing operation in the fourth quarter.
As of September 30, 2003, the World Bank Group has approved 46 loans and credits for a
total amount of about US$721 million, with an undisbursed amount of about US$157
million. The portfolio consists of eight lending operations, as summarized below, in the areas
of adjustment support, poverty reduction, education, health, HIV/AIDS, infrastructure and
public sector management totaling US$215 million.

APPENDIX IV

Sierra Leone: Statistical Issues
1.
Owing to the prolonged civil war, Sierra Leone’s macroeconomic database has
serious deficiencies, particularly in the areas of the balance of payments, national accounts,
and social indicators. From the May 1997 coup to March 1998, the statistical compilation
virtually collapsed because of institutional damage and the departure of key skilled personnel
from the administration. Since April 1998, however, the authorities have endeavored to
rehabilitate the data collection and compilation systems. The authorities are fully cooperative
in providing data to the Fund for purposes of policy formulation and program monitoring.
The authorities are also trying to disseminate economic and financial data to the public on a
regular basis.
2.
A major and sustained improvement in the coverage and timeliness of economic data
will require the restructuring of the institutional framework along the lines recommended by
the March 2004 IMF/World Bank mission on the development of a strategic plan for the
statistical system in Sierra Leone. Budgetary resources remain scarce for the main statistical
unit, the Statistics Sierra Leone (SSL); this situation most adversely affects the compilation
of national accounts and price statistics. Cooperation and coordination between the main
statistical agencies also need to be improved. Sierra Leone is participating in the GDDS
regional project for Anglophone African countries that is funded by the Department for
International Development (DfID) of the UK. The authorities have prepared an initial set of
metadata that include detailed plans for improvement over the short and medium term; these
were posted on the Fund’s DSBB on May 29, 2003. These metadata were subsequently
updated in August 2004. Sierra Leone has received Fund technical assistance in priority areas
and additional assistance is expected to be requested in the context of the GDDS project.
National accounts
3.
National accounts data are prepared by the SSL using data received from government
ministries and agencies, public enterprises, and through occasional surveys of economic
activity. The consumer price index (CPI) is used extensively to derive estimates of GDP at
constant prices. A project to improve the system of national income and social accounts was
undertaken with Fund/United Nations Development Program (UNDP) technical support. As
a result, a set of revised national accounts for the period 1986/87–1994/95 (opening year–
closing month year) was published in December 1995. The main revisions involved the
adjustment of trade figures to reflect illegal diamond mining and fishing activity. However,
large adjustments were also made to the exports of nonfactor services, for which the SSL was
unable to provide sufficient explanation. Data on the exports and imports of services need
further improvement and efforts are ongoing to strengthen direct estimation techniques. Fund
missions continue to make their own estimates and projections of key national accounts
aggregates, as well as adjustments to historical data using available information. The latest
available national accounts data refer to 2003. Resource constraints have significantly
delayed data production for 2001 and 2002. The SSL should focus on the development of a

- 81 -

APPENDIX IV

new benchmark for the current price estimates and to rebase the constant price estimates to a
new base (current base year is 1990).
4.
A national accounts expert visited Freetown in March/April and again in September
2004 under the GDDS project. The expert reviewed the source data, methodologies, and
compilation issues. She prepared and agreed with the authorities on a short-term action plan
that would bridge the gap to the longer-term improvements that are to be incorporated into
the strategic plan.
Prices
5.
The CPI for Freetown is prepared monthly by the SSL and published with a lag of
more than three weeks. The CPI covers the capital city only, although with the onset of peace
the SSL intends to extend the coverage of the index to towns and selected rural areas. It is
desirable for the SSL to compile a national CPI with revised base period weights. A
wholesale price index, which has remained dormant for many years, needs to be
reestablished.
Government finance statistics
6.
The budget reporting system was established with technical assistance provided under
the Fund/UNDP technical assistance project. Monthly data on central government revenue,
current expenditure, and financing are being provided, with appropriate disaggregation. The
European Commission (EC) is providing technical assistance to the Accountant General’s
Office that will improve the timeliness and quality of fiscal data. Data on capital expenditure
are poor. While Sierra Leone has reported fiscal data to AFR, it has not provided annual data
for publication in the GFS Yearbook since 1999. Fiscal data only cover the budgetary central
government, excluding extrabudgetary agencies and local governments.
7.
There is an urgent need for greater timeliness and accuracy of data on foreignfinanced development projects. Reports on the implementation of the development budget
and its financing are currently not produced in a format that is suitable for budget analysis. In
particular, data on the implementation is missing. There is also need for assuring quality
control of the final data.
Monetary statistics
8.
The main components of the central bank balance sheet are available on a daily and
weekly basis; this system provides an early warning system on key financial targets. The full
monetary survey is prepared with a lag of about six weeks, with comprehensive coverage of
commercial banks.
9.
The Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) is compiling monetary data using a compilation
system established by the 1996 STA mission for data reporting to AFR and STA. Most of the
mission’s recommendations have been implemented, resulting in substantial improvements in
the quality of the monetary data. However, commercial banks continue to distinguish

- 82 -

APPENDIX IV

between their foreign and domestic positions based only on the currency of denomination
and not on residency. In addition, the recent GDDS metadata and monetary and financial
statistics mission identified that (i) the institutional coverage of monetary statistics does not
include those financial corporations that accept nontransferable deposits and (ii) the BSL
records the counterpart to the foreign exchange received through foreign grants and loans to
the central government as foreign liabilities instead of liabilities to the central government.
Some other data problems result from mispostings in the balance sheet of the BSL and
misclassifications of new accounts. Also, bank reserves as reported by the BSL and
commercial banks, do not match. After considerable work by the authorities and commercial
banks the misclassification of government deposits has only been resolved for 2003.
Balance of payments statistics
10.
The BSL is responsible for the compilation of the balance of payments for Sierra
Leone. The BSL obtains the data for the balance of payments estimates from various sources
including the SSL, government ministries, the Customs and Excise Department (Customs),
and the “Financial Survey of Major Limited Companies,” for data on foreign direct
investment. Goods estimates are based on the import and export data compiled by Customs
and are adjusted for coverage, valuation, and timing to fit the balance of payments
definitions. However, the BSL does not make adjustments to BOP data using supplementary
information to take account of unreported data.
11.
Sierra Leone’s external transactions are characterized by a large volume of activity in
the informal sector, owing principally to the smuggling of diamonds. A considerable portion
of imports is financed by these unrecorded exports. As a result, official balance of payments
statistics tend to substantially understate transactions. The staff has been addressing this
problem through the use of third-country (principally EC member) import data. The Fund’s
Statistics Department is providing technical assistance under the GDDS project to help the
authorities with the implementation of BPM5.
12.
Outstanding data problems exist with regard to trade in services, income statistics,
current transfers, and in the financial and capital accounts. Regarding the latter, there are, in
principle, substantial difficulties in tracking financial transactions of the public and private
sectors that are not routed through the central bank but through commercial banks. While the
authorities are able to report accurately what public sector debt service payments are after
debt relief, they have difficulties in estimating debt service due before debt relief. Estimates
of smuggled imports and exports, in particular diamonds, are also not available.
13.
Against this background, information on official program grant and loan receipts is
relatively good and is prepared by the staff on the basis of contact with the Sierra Leonean
authorities and donor agencies. In contrast, data on private capital flows are very poor. Some
information on private banking flows can be derived from the monetary survey. Other private
capital flows, especially those linked to the informal diamond trade, are effectively captured
only in “Errors and omissions.” Data on the gross and net official reserves positions of the
BSL are provided monthly to the Fund with a short lag. STA has been providing technical

- 83 -

APPENDIX IV

assistance on BOP issues in the context of the GDDS project and the most recent visit took
place in September/October 2004.
14.
Information on public external debt is deemed to be good. A comprehensive debtreporting system has been in operation, which is capable of monitoring official external debt
and related interest payments. Data on the present stock of private sector external debt are
satisfactory, following the verification exercise made in connection with the July 1995
commercial debt buyback operation and the reconciliation exercise undertaken in the context
of the HIPC Initiative.

Sierra Leone: Fiscal Sustainability Analysis
A. Main results
This appendix summarizes the results of the fiscal sustainability analysis for Sierra Leone.43
The baseline scenario assumes a sustained high output growth together with low inflation.
Real output is projected to grow between 6-7 percent annually in the medium term, with
inflation reverting to low single digits.
The primary balance is projected to strengthen over the medium-term. This is brought about,
on the one hand, by stronger domestic revenue effort and augmentation of the revenue base.
An improved revenue effort will be necessary because the share of foreign grants as percent
of GDP is projected to decline from 40 percent of total revenues and grants in 2003 to below
10 percent by year 2022. Consequently, current expenditures would need to be covered to
large extent by domestic revenues.
On the other hand, government expenditures as a whole are projected to decline to facilitate
the attainment of fiscal sustainability in the long run. The reduction should be achieved in
part through cost cutting, rationalization, and other reforms to contain costs and improve
efficiency of government services. Furthermore, in light of the need to limit expenditures,
outlays need to be prioritized reflecting developmental and poverty-related needs (in the
context of the PRSP/MDGs, which provide key guidance on this). The share of investment
expenditure is also projected to increase to promote high output growth.
The long-run debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratios are projected to fall in the medium- to
long-run (Table 1). As a result of fiscal consolidation and improved fiscal management, staff
projects that debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratios would remain broadly stable or decline
in the long run. In part, this is assisted by debt forgiveness under the HIPC Initiative, which
will lower the net present value of external public debt. Moreover, lower domestic borrowing
(as percent of GDP) helps to alleviate the rising cost of borrowing from domestic sources, a
key medium-term risk to fiscal sustainability in Sierra Leone (the share of domestic debt to
total debt stock is projected to fall from 41 percent in 2003 to 18 percent in 2022).
B. Sensitivity Analysis
The overall macroeconomic environment in which the government is operating will have an
impact on the fiscal outcome, and by extension fiscal sustainability. That is, changes in real
growth and inflation, as well as in the external environment, would need to be offset by fiscal
adjustments to preserve long-term fiscal sustainability. Private sector consumption and
saving decisions affect interest rates and the cost and level of private investment activity, and
eventually economic growth and government’s revenue collections and ability to spend on
43

10/29/04 (www.imf.org).

- 86 -

APPENDIX V

various public programs. Foreign investments in the country would be equally important for
supporting domestic activities and export growth. Expectations and public confidence in the
government’s ability to implement appropriate economic policies influence private sector
decisions and hence need to be fostered. Improved macroeconomic performance and fiscal
balance would be essential for medium-term fiscal sustainability. The following conclusion
can be made regarding the sensitivity analysis:
•

Based on historical averages for real growth and primary fiscal balance, the debt
indicators would deteriorate in the long run. Although this reflects the country’s
volatile past, it also suggests that Sierra Leone needs to maintain a high level of
output growth and achieve broadly balanced primary position in the medium-term;
otherwise, the fiscal position may not be sustainable. The outcome that further fiscal
consolidation will be required is reinforced by the results of a scenario where the
fiscal primary balance is kept constant at its level in 2002 leads to an explosive trend.

•

A temporary negative output shock could lead to an unsustainable fiscal adjustment
and rapidly rising debt-to-GDP and debt service ratios. This is because total
expenditures, as a percent of GDP, would rise significantly, leading to a larger
primary deficit and borrowing.

•

A temporary worsening of the primary balance, which could be caused, for example,
by delays in external grant financing, may not necessarily affect the government’s
long-term fiscal position permanently, provided that the authorities adequately adjust
the fiscal portfolio in the medium-term.

Furthermore, a liquidity risk could arise from a higher rollover of short-term domestic debt.
In Sierra Leone, virtually all domestic public debt is issued as short-term.44 Since there are no
long-term debt instruments available in Sierra Leone (beyond the maturity of one year), all
future borrowing would be financed through the issuance of short-term debt. In the long-run,
this would result in a situation where virtually all domestic debt would be short-term. Given
the size of the domestic debt stock at end-2003, equal to about 41 percent of GDP, the debt
carries a significant rollover risk.45 The government should therefore promote domestic debt
markets.
Privatization of state-owned enterprises could also promote fiscal sustainability. The sale of
state assets could be used to raise additional revenues to finance poverty-related expenditures
or lower the domestic debt stock.
44

The remainder comprises noninterest-bearing debt in the Bank of Sierra Leone balance
sheet.

45

The instrument used to refinance domestic borrowing is 3-month Treasury bills, the debt
stock would be rolled over four times in a year.

APPENDIX VI

Sierra Leone: External Debt Sustainability Analysis
This section presents the results of updating Sierra Leone’s external debt sustainability
analysis (DSA). The update of the baseline debt ratios has been done in two steps; first, the
decision point DSA has been updated, and then, second, the new DSA framework for lowincome countries has been applied (see Box 1).46 The new framework yields estimates for the
NPV of debt-to-exports ratio that are somewhat lower than those obtained from calculations
using the HIPC methodology.47 The baseline scenario under the new framework yields a path
for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio that is fairly stable around 120 percent (Table 1a and
Figure 1, middle panel).48 The profile for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio is somewhat
different, with the ratio slowing rising to about 34 percent in 2010, and then gradually
declining to about 25 percent in 2020 (Figure 1, top panel). The debt service ratio stays for
most of the projection period below 10 percent (Figure 1, bottom panel).49
The NPV of debt-to-exports and -GDP ratios can be considerate moderate, and the debt
service ratio is low. For example, the NPV of debt-to-exports and the NPV of debt-to-GDP
ratios in non-HIPC low-income countries in 2001 have been 143 and 39 percent respectively,
which are both higher than the projected ratios for Sierra Leone after delivery of HIPC
relief.50 Sierra Leone’s debt service ratio of over the medium-term is projected to average
about 7 percent, which is only about half the prevailing ratio in non-HIPC low-income
countries.51 The baseline scenario alone seems to suggest that Sierra Leone is at low risk of
debt distress.
The application of stress tests reveals, however, substantial vulnerability to shocks. The
stress tests comprise an alternative scenario, where key variables grow in the projection
period from 2002 onwards at their historic rates, and shocks to individual variables.52 The
46

All debt ratios assume full and unconditional delivery of HIPC relief, and additional
bilateral relief beyond HIPC, beginning in 2000.

47

As discussed in Box 1, this is mainly because of different discount rate assumptions, and
because the new framework uses current exports instead of the backward-looking three year
average used under HIPC.
48

Under the HIPC methodology, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio stays around 145 percent.

49

The increase in the debt service ratio in the period 2010-15 is due to projected large
amortization payments falling due to the Fund in this period, and a slowdown in export
growth as kimberlite and rutile mines reach the end of their production life.
50

See Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries – Status of Implementation, Table 1.

52

The projection period begins in 2002, because only the loan-by-loan update of the DSA
that will be conducted at the completion point will determine the final debt numbers for the
period after the decision point.

APPENDIX VI

historic growth rates and standard deviations, which are used to calibrate the shocks, are
computed on the basis of data for the period 1992-2000. The historic scenario shows nonstabilizing debt dynamics for the two debt stock indicators, and high debt service ratios (solid
thin line in Figure 1). The other stress tests (broken line) show large vulnerabilities to onestandard deviation GDP and export growth shocks, and to a less severe but simultaneous
shock to all variables (combined negative shock). These shocks raise the debt ratios to clearly
unsustainable levels, yet one-standard deviation shocks occur relatively frequent so that they
cannot be considered ‘extreme’.
A possible explanation for the large vulnerability to shocks is that during the entire period
1992-2000, which was used to calibrate the shocks, Sierra Leone was engulfed in civil war.
In this sense, the stress tests could reveal nothing more than that should the country slide
back into war, its current debt will become once again unsustainable. To test this, a second
alternative scenario has been computed, where all shocks have been calibrated based on
historic data for the 1980s. The results, however, confirm those from the first set of stress
tests: debt dynamics become unsustainable even if key variables grow at their historic rates
from the 1980s (Table 1b). In sum, the vulnerability to shocks makes it necessary to consider
Sierra Leone not at low, but at moderate risk of debt distress, even after the full delivery of
HIPC relief. Maintaining low debt ratios is necessary to protect against the consequences of
negative shocks, which have occurred frequently in the past. To achieve this, it will be
necessary to continue to borrow on highly concessional terms and to seek grants whenever
possible.

APPENDIX VI

Box 1: Update of Sierra Leone’s Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
The update of Sierra Leone’s debt sustainability analysis was done in two steps:
1.

Sierra Leone’s decision point DSA was updated to reflect end-2003
discount and exchange rates, and new borrowing and export assumptions:
a.

The decline in the average discount rate by about 170 basis points and
the depreciation in the US dollar by about 15 percent against major
currencies since end-2000 (i.e., the base year for the decision point
DSA) led to an increase in the NPV of debt by about 30 percent.

b.

New borrowing in the period 2001-04 is somewhat lower than
expected, but medium-term borrowing projections have been revised
upwards significantly. The decision point DSA had assumed a sharp
decline in average annual new borrowing from about US$110 million
in 2001-04 to US$45 million in the medium-term, whereas the updated
DSA assumes that new borrowing over the medium term will
approximately remain at 2001-04 levels of about US$90 million per
annum, partly because absorptive capacity has increased recently (new
borrowing is likely to reach US$130 million in 2004).

c.

Export performance in 2001-04 was largely as expected, but medium
term projections have been revised upwards, reflecting, inter alia, the
beginning of large-scale diamond mining (Koidu kimberlite mine).
This partly offsets the upward revision in new borrowing.

In sum, the updated NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is somewhat higher than
projected at the decision point, with the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio
leveling off now at about 135 percent (Figure 1).

APPENDIX VI

Box 1: continued
2.

In a second step, the methodology of the new DSA framework for
low-income countries has been applied. Debt service and export projections
are used as inputs into a template that computes baseline projections for the
NPV of debt-to-exports ratio and then subjects the baseline to various stress
tests. These baseline projections for the NPV of debt-to-export ratio differ
from those computed in the first step under the HIPC methodology in two
ways (Figure 2):
a.

The template uses a discount rate of 5 percent, which is about 60 basis
points higher than the currency-specific discount rates used under
HIPC. This lowers the NPV of debt by about five percent relative to the
HIPC methodology. (Figure 2, broken line)

b.

The NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is computed relative to current
exports, as opposed to the backward-looking three year average used
under the HIPC methodology. In years when exports are growing
rapidly, for example in 2000-06, the current-exports series is higher by
20 percent than the series for the backward-looking average. In
contrast, in years when export growth is flat, i.e. in the period 2013-15
when the Koidu kimberlite mine reaches the end of its production life,
the difference is small. (Figure 2, solid thin line)

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt. From 2000 onwards unconditional delivery of HIPC relief is assumed.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value. For public and public guaranteed debt, unconditional delivery of HIPC relief from 2000 onwards is assumed.
5/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ The reduction in the debt stock in 2000 is due to the assumption of the unconditional delivery of HIPC relief. The hypothetical delivery of HIPC relief is not included in the exceptional financing item, and leads to a large unexplained residual.
8/ The large exceptional financing item in 2001 reflects a Paris Club rescheduling on Naples terms. The large debt service ratio is due to the repayment of post-emergency assistance to the Fund.
9/ In 2002, the BOP was compiled for the first time on the basis of the Balance of Payments Manual Fifth Edition, which led to a large upward revision in private transfers. Another major change ocurred in the compilation of
national accounts data, where the use of new survey instruments has led to better measurement of previously unrecorded activity, which resulted in a large upward revision in GDP.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
November 12, 2004
1.
This statement provides further information by the staff on the progress made by the
authorities in preparing a full poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP).1 The information is
based on the authorities’ PRSP Preparation Status Report. The contents of this statement does
not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal. Fund staff’s assessment is shared by the staff of the
World Bank.
2.
The authorities’ preparation status report outlines the various stages and processes
leading to the production of the draft PRSP. Against the backdrop of the serious capacity
constraints and the country’s postconflict circumstances, Fund staff considers that Sierra
Leone is making adequate progress in the preparation of its PRSP. In the interim, weaknesses
in Sierra Leone's poverty reduction strategy that are critical to Fund support under the PRGF
arrangement are also being addressed.
3.
Beyond this, the staff has advised that policy actions on various sectors need clearer
prioritization and sequencing to facilitate implementation. Donors have also noted that food
security and good governance, key priorities for Sierra Leone, should be adequately
emphasized in poverty reduction efforts. Future allocation of expenditures should also be
consistent with the strategic priorities and the medium-term budget. Furthermore, the staff
has suggested that the implementation of the PRSP should be placed within existing central
and local government structures. The authorities have indicated that the existing
Development Assistance Coordination Office (DACO) would be given responsibility for the
overall coordination of PRSP implementation. The staff has also advised that data
development issues should be integrated more clearly into the PRSP process, to facilitate
monitoring and donor assistance. The General Data Dissemination Standards (GDDS)
framework, which Sierra Leone subscribes to, provides a basis for identifying key areas and
the related technical assistance and other costs.

Paragraph 57 of the staff report contains a discussion on the PRSP process.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Sierra Leone
On November 12, 2004. the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Sierra Leone.1
Background
The authorities have been implementing wide-ranging structural reforms and pursuing prudent
macroeconomic policies, supported by the PRGF arrangement since 2001. With enhanced
economic and political stability, real GDP growth has picked up while inflation has remained
moderate. During 2003, the economy enjoyed a robust recovery, reflecting robust activity in
agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and services, but inflation accelerated. Average inflation in
June 2004 reached 12 percent.
Further progress was made in 2003 towards completing Sierra Leone’s post-conflict transition.
The government concluded the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) exercise
in February 2004. Security in neighboring Liberia has improved and will enhance stability in
Sierra Leone.
Growth prospects in the medium term are encouraging, largely based on some mining projects
coming to fruition, agricultural expansion, and service-related activities. Real growth is
projected in the range of 6-7 percent in 2005-07 (with higher growth in 2005 led by mineral
exports), reflecting these activities in the country’s post-conflict phase. Inflation is expected to
revert to low single digits, while the current account deficits would narrow, aided by growth in
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2mineral exports. The projected strong growth will, however, still leave Sierra Leone quite far in
terms of achieving the MDGs.
The authorities’ overall medium-term strategy for promoting growth and reducing poverty
focuses on six key strategic areas: continued strengthening of state security; aiming at a more
sustainable fiscal position; raising domestic savings and investment; strengthening
infrastructure; agricultural and rural development; and the promotion of the private sector.
Fiscal performance in 2003 was somewhat weaker than envisioned, largely due to domestic
expenditure overruns. External program financing (5.5 percent of GDP in the original program)
only materialized at slightly over 3 percent of GDP. This led to much larger than programmed
domestic financing of the budget, especially from the banking system. Poverty-related outlays
were above the programmed level. Fiscal pressures continued in the first quarter of 2004.
While the government made an effort to scale down its outlays, this was insufficient to offset the
large shortfall in external non-HIPC grants and program loans. Therefore, domestic financing of
the budget exceeded the program target by a large margin.
Monetary policy in 2003 was expansionary, as Bank of Sierra Leone allowed private sector
credit to continue growing at a rapid pace. Monetary policy also accommodated the
expansionary fiscal policy. Treasury bill interest rates began to rise in late 2003 in response to
inflation expectations and large government borrowing. As a result, broad and reserve money
growth rates were higher than programmed for the year as a whole. A rapid monetary growth
has continued in 2004.
The external current account weakened further in 2003. While export performance during the
year improved, particularly for diamonds, imports remained high due to continued expansion in
reconstruction activities and the high cost of fuel. Gross official reserves fell to 1.5 months of
imports, which was well below the program level. The real effective exchange rate depreciated
by 17 percent in 2003, partly reflecting the high foreign-exchange demand of the private sector
as a result of higher oil prices.
Debt relief agreements with most official creditors have been reached, but there has been little
progress with commercial creditors. Debt relief agreements on Naples terms have been signed
with Paris Club creditors except Japan, and seven out of eleven agreements on Cologne terms
have been signed. Significant reduction in the NPV of debt to exports is expected after Sierra
Leone reaches the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) completion point. All non-Paris Club
official creditors have agreed to deliver debt relief, or indicated their willingness to do so, even
though the terms in some cases fall short of what is expected under the HIPC Initiative. The
authorities have also requested the World Bank for a debt buyback operation under the
International Development Association facility in order to continue addressing the problem of
commercial debt arrears.
The authorities have completed the first draft of the full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) and have indicated that a final version of the PRSP would be ready by end-2004. The
exercise to prepare the document had been undertaken in broad consultation with various
sections of society.

-3Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities on concluding the disarmament, demobilization,
and reintegration (DDR) exercise for over 72,000 former combatants in February 2004, which
led to a significant improvement in the security situation of the country. Directors welcomed the
United Nations’ decision to maintain a presence in the country at least until mid-2005, thus
providing additional time for the Sierra Leonean government to train and equip its police and
military forces.
Directors noted that Sierra Leone’s economic recovery had been broad-based, reflecting
improved business confidence. Significant output gains had been made from post-conflict low
levels, especially in agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and services. Real output in 2003 is
estimated to have increased by 9.3 percent. However, Directors expressed concern that
inflation had accelerated resulting initially from higher fuel costs, but later also reflecting
expansionary monetary policy and a depreciating currency.
Directors supported the authorities’ overall medium-term strategy for sustaining high growth and
reducing poverty. The strategy focuses on the strengthening of state security; the attainment of
a more sustainable fiscal position; raising savings and investment; strengthening of
infrastructure; agricultural and rural development; and the promotion of the private sector.
Directors also endorsed the authorities intention to maintain a floating exchange rate system,
given the open economy and the need to maintain a competitive external position.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue addressing structural reforms and governance
issues with the aim of attracting both domestic and foreign investors. In this context, Directors
welcomed the finalization and imminent adoption of the new investment code. They also
commended the authorities on expressing interest in participating in the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI), which would address governance concerns and enhance the
transparency of reporting on mineral revenues. Looking forward, Directors pointed out that the
main risk to the medium term growth strategy lies in the area of saving and investment;
therefore, the policy and institutional measures required in this broad area would remain critical.
Directors broadly endorsed the macroeconomic objectives and policies for the remainder of
2004. They concurred with the need to tighten fiscal policy to bring domestic expenditures,
excluding as much as possible poverty related expenditures, closer to projected resources.
In order to reduce inflationary pressures, Directors also emphasized the need to maintain an
appropriately tight monetary policy, including the authorities’ planned reduction in government
borrowing from the banking system in the second half of the year.
In light of the proposed policy framework for the remainder of 2004, Directors granted waivers
for (i) the ceiling on net bank credit to the government, which was exceeded after adjusting for
the shortfall in the external program support, (ii) the introduction of new personnel management
regulations, which was not introduced by end-May 2004 as envisaged, pending the finalization
of a new employment scheme for senior civil servants, and (iii) reconciliation of fiscal and
monetary data for 2000-02, which was not completed by the end-May 2004 deadline, as the
provision of Fund technical assistance was not forthcoming as projected. In addition, Directors
agreed to extend the arrangement for a three-month period.

-4Directors commended the authorities on the completion of a comprehensive first draft of the full
PRSP, which was produced by a relatively broad based national participatory process.
Given the requirement to implement the full PRSP at least a year before reaching the HIPC
completion point, which is envisaged for end-2005, Directors urged the authorities to complete
the PRSP document by end-December 2004. Directors also recommended that the full PRSP
serve as an active vehicle for pursuing medium-term objectives as well as the longer term
MDGs.
Directors commended the authorities for the progress made in implementing the
recommendations of previous statistics technical assistance missions. To further enhance the
surveillance of the economy, they urged the authorities to continue their efforts to improve the
statistical base, especially the national accounts, through Fund and other technical assistance.

IMF Completes Fifth Review Under Sierra Leone's
PRGF Arrangement and Approves US$21.1 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fifth review
of Sierra Leone's performance under an SDR 130.8 million (about US$197.6 million) Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement (see Press Release No. 01/39).
The completion of this review enables the release of an amount equivalent to SDR 14 million
(about US$21.1 million), which would bring the total amount drawn under the arrangement to
SDR 116.8 million (about US$176.5 million).
In completing the review, the Board waived the nonobservance of an end-March quantitative
performance criterion and two structural performance criteria and approved an extension of the
arrangement for a three-month period until June 25, 2004.
Following the Executive Board's discussion of Sierra Leone's economic performance,
Rodrigo de Rato, Managing Director and Chair, made the following statement:
“Sierra Leone made further progress in 2004 toward completing the post-conflict transition, with
the conclusion of the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration exercise for over 72,000
former combatants.
“The broad-based economic recovery continued in 2003, as improved business confidence
stimulated activity in the agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and services sectors. However,
inflation increased sharply in 2003 and the first half of 2004, reflecting higher fuel costs,
expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, and a depreciation of the currency.
“The authorities have made progress in implementing structural reforms. Fiscal and monetary
policies in the first half of 2004 were weaker than envisaged, but corrective actions are being
taken in the second half of the year. Shortfalls in external financing have also adversely affected
program implementation in the first half of the year. The authorities are stepping up efforts to
better monitor donor conditionalities in order to expedite disbursements.
“Given Sierra Leone’s large reconstruction needs in the medium term and the heavy debt burden,
domestic revenue mobilization will be important, including through tapping mineral revenues
and strengthening tax administration. Expenditure will need to be better prioritized, in the

context of poverty reduction efforts, and gradually reoriented toward investment. Better
coordination with donors will help ensure more efficient fiscal management and the mobilization
of increased resources for poverty reduction programs.
“To reduce inflation, monetary policy needs to be strengthened and complemented by prudent
fiscal policy. The authorities are encouraged to be more proactive in containing the growth of
private sector credit. This, together with strengthening of financial supervision and regulation,
will also safeguard against a rise in nonperforming bank loans.
“The authorities have completed the first draft of a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), in
broad consultation with various sections of the society. The PRSP sets out a medium–term policy
framework based on four pillars. These relate to governance, pro-poor sustainable growth,
human development, and reduction of social vulnerabilities. The authorities need to clearly
articulate the policy agenda that would emerge from the PRSP exercise, as this will help in
securing, among other things, donor support.
“All non-Paris Club creditors have agreed to deliver debt relief, or indicated their willingness to
do so. The authorities have also approached the World Bank for a debt buyback operation under
the IDA facility, in order to continue addressing the problem of commercial debt arrears,”
Mr. de Rato said.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in a Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are consistent
with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural and social policies to foster
growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are
repayable over 10 years with a 5 ½-year grace period on principal payments.

Introduction

Sierra Leone has made important progress over the past one year to solidify its economic gains,
maintain the peace, as well as develop a realistic and ambitious medium-term framework to
guide economic policy-making. With success in the peace-keeping since 2000, prudent
macroeconomic policy measures have been pursued by the authorities, including the
implementation of wide-ranging reforms. Output has continued to expand rapidly during the
period 2001-03, an indication of the gains realized from the resettlement of the population and
increased activities in agriculture, mining, manufacturing and services. Other measures have
been directed at reaching the country’s full tax potential, which include those for the tapping of
mineral revenues. Expenditures have been prioritized in the context of the PRSP objectives
with a gradual reorientation towards financing investment. Better coordination procedures have
also been pursued with donors, a process necessary for ensuring efficient fiscal management
and for the mobilization of increased resources for poverty reduction. In addition, there is
strong determination by the authorities to pursue the policy challenges of enhancing the
investment climate, strengthening governance and transparency, as well as deepening of the
financial sector.
2.

Recent Economic Developments

The Sierra Leonean economy grew by 6.5 percent in 2003, reflecting robust operations in
agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. Progress in enhancing domestic security and the
success in maintaining political and economic stability have continued to bolster confidence.
For 2004, real output is expected to grow at 7.4 percent, a little above the programme target.
Increased emphasis has been placed on maintaining macroeconomic stability and reducing
poverty. In addition, government has taken over responsibility from the UNAMSIL to maintain
peace and security. This has resulted in major budgetary implications for security expenditures,
given the need to equip and finance operations of the security agencies. The decentralization of
public administration and related services to local authorities has also had fiscal implications,
as all 19 councils would need to be initially assisted with administration and related costs. The
higher fuel costs and delays in donor support have resulted in expansionary monetary policy
and have also led to an increase in annual average inflation to 12 percent by end-June 2004.
The authorities have directed their efforts at reducing the inflationary pressures through
progressive implementation of fiscal and monetary tightening, and in addition have taken
measures for further containment of domestic debt to achieve program targets and maintain
debt sustainability, namely:
•

The fiscal policy stance aims at supporting macroeconomic stability. The overall fiscal
balance and domestic primary balance is expected to significantly improve in the
second half of 2004, in reaction to implementation of measures that would lead to a
reduction in domestic financing of the budget.

-2-

•

On monetary policy, given that broad money is projected to rise by 18 percent, the
BSL has raised its statutory reserve requirement ratio from 10 to 12 percent to help
contain money growth and mop up excess liquidity. In this regard, though reserve
money is projected to grow by 6.5 percent in the second half of 2004, it will continue to
be the primary intermediate monetary policy target.

•

External sector policies are being directed at narrowing the current account deficit
from its current level, projected at about 18 percent of GDP, which is 4.0 percentage
points increase above the 2003 level, partly due to high oil prices and large import
needs for the rehabilitation of the mining sector.

•

As regards debt relief, my authorities have reached agreements with most official
creditors and more effort is being made to conclude debt relief arrangements with
commercial creditors. Upon reaching HIPC completion point, the authorities expect
significant reduction in the NPV of debt to exports. As they continue to address the
problem of commercial debt arrears, my authorities have requested the World Bank for
assistance for a debt buyback operation under the IDA debt reduction facility.

3.

Progress Made on the Reform Agenda

(i)

On structural reforms, action has been taken to channel salary and other payments to
teachers via the banking system, including raising the proportion of schools with bank
accounts to 60 percent at end-December 2004, thereby facilitating greater use of
banking services for payments to civil servants and teachers. Progress has also been
made in completing benchmarks under the program, including hiring of professional
and managerial staff in the Department of the Auditor General to expedite audits of
government ministries and agencies. Employment ceilings have been established for
schools and are now being published for enforcement. A monthly update of personnel
data in the Establishment Secretary’s Office has also been undertaken.

(ii)

To sustain the gains made in revenue mobilization, the authorities have targeted
fiscal incentives for tax collectors and have limited discretionary granting of tax
exemptions to foreign investors. Sierra Leone has also joined the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI) to ensure maximum transparency in the collection of
revenues expected from the mineral sector.

(iii)

In their determination to contain expenditures, the authorities have implemented
measures to reduce noninterest outlays during the second half of the year. They will
continue to prioritize expenditures in order to align them with available resources.
Inspite of the above, poverty-related expenditures have been protected and the measures
to contain expenditures will have minimal impact on the poor. Additional measures
have also been implemented to avoid any accumulation of utility arrears by government
ministries, departments and agencies.

-3(iv)

Financial sector reforms are being implemented by the BSL in order to enhance
liquidity forecasting. The exchange rates continue to be based on weekly foreign
exchange auctions. International reserves increased to two months of import cover, an
increase of 0.5 months by end-2004. Progress has been made in strengthening both
internal and external controls of the BSL, including taking additional steps towards
implementation of the International Financial Reporting Standards.

(v)

The authorities have also achieved significant progress in the preparation of a
comprehensive mineral policy framework. Given the above developments and until
the envisaged revisions to the legislative framework are finalized, the authorities will
continue to consult with Fund staff in the context of the PRGF-supported program.

Medium-Term Outlook and Challenges, 2005 - 2007

The authorities are fully aware of the critical importance of sustaining high real growth as well
as stable macroeconomic environment for tackling Sierra Leone’s widespread poverty. The
medium-term macroeconomic framework projects an annual growth of between 6 and 7
percent. Rising exports will continue to support high output growth during 2004-06, while
higher growth in 2005 is expected to be led by the mineral sector. Agriculture, forestry and
fishing, including services are expected to continue to be vibrant in the medium-term, a
reflection of the favorable post-conflict environment. Inflation will be curtailed to single digits,
and the current account balance, excluding official transfers, is expected to narrow from the
current level of 31.3 percent of GDP to 10 percent by 2007. In this regard, the authorities would
need more time to provide the necessary assurances and environment to encourage private
investors, while moving towards a stable post-conflict situation.
Relevant policies that are needed to support key growth and poverty reduction objectives will
continue to be pursued. The authorities are aware that sustained high growth requires
substantial increases in domestic savings and investment, and as a result they will proceed with
their objective to implement measures that would assist growth of community and microfinance
institutions, in addition to liberalization measures that incorporates market-determined interest
rates in the financial sector. They plan to contribute to this endeavor through budgetary savings,
with the aim of ensuring substantial improvement in the domestic savings rate in the mediumterm within a range of 8-10 percent by 2006/07, far above the 2.0 percent realized during 2004.
Also, in this regard, the authorities intend to progressively raise the share of domestic
investment through directing projected mineral revenues for this purpose.
Fiscal policy
The medium-term overall resource envelope would remain constrained. As a result, measures
to strengthen tax administration, and enhancing domestic revenue collection would be
undertaken, including broadening the tax base to tap mineral revenues and incorporate the
informal sector. Possible amendments to the scope of income and corporate tax rate reductions
are also under consideration. With the availability of technical assistance, sales of non
performing public assets will be pursued to generate additional revenues that would facilitate
financing of poverty programs and reduction of the domestic debt stock.

-4Efforts will be strengthened to prioritize, rationalize and reduce expenditures to enable
attainment of economic growth, as well as developmental and poverty-related objectives, in
addition to the production of more efficient public service delivery at both central and local
government levels. Mechanisms for monitoring implementation of donor conditionalities to
ensure faster disbursement of donor resources will be strengthened, and the authorities are
currently taking measures to plan their expenditures more cautiously taking into account
assured availability of donor financing as well as revenues generated from domestic sources.
Monetary and Exchange Rate policy
Over the medium-term, the authorities intend to continue to maintain a floating exchange rate
regime, free from restrictions and one that would ensure flexibility in response to external and
internal shocks, and enable the parallel market spread to maintain its current low and broadly
stable position. In addition, a major objective of the authorities will be to strengthen the
external current account position, which, if led by strong export growth, could bring about an
appreciation of the exchange rate over the medium-term. The monetary authorities will
continue to increase external reserves to provide a cushion against external shocks.
External Sector policy
Over the medium-term, the authorities will work towards adopting common external tariff, a
major objective aimed at consolidating the ECOWAS integration process. This measure is
expected to reduce average tariff to 12 percent from the current high level of 17.5 percent, and
would work to ensure achievement of benefits from the envisaged agreement on Economic
Partnership with the European Union. More efforts will be made to take advantage of the
opportunities available to the country from less export barriers in developed countries.
Implementation of Further Reforms
The authorities are giving specific attention to the implementation of recommendations of the
financial audit of the Ministry of Education in line with the revised framework. The proposed
amendments to the Income Tax, Sales Tax and Customs Acts with assistance of the
CommonWealth Secretariat are expected to be finalized for implementation in early 2005.
Efforts will also be made to finalize the new Procurement Act. Furthermore, the NRA will
develop model agreements for the mineral sector in line with similar agreements in the
petroleum sector. In addition, diagnostic studies and reforms which are funded by DfiD for six
key ministries are to be conducted over the next three years.
Poverty Reduction Strategy Process
The authorities are working towards seeking external resources to ensure a realization of the
MDGs. They intend to mobilize additional resources to facilitate funding for programs which
are important in achieving human development goals by 2015. Given the efforts towards
finalization of the full PRSP, appropriate policy frameworks will be instituted to safeguard
macroeconomic stability in case of large increases in aid.

-5In view of the relative importance of agriculture and rural development in promoting broad
based growth and poverty reduction, the authorities will embark on a multi-pillar approach to
raise agricultural output and productivity, promote large-scale commercial farming, and
encourage crop diversification. The authorities recognize the importance of capacity building,
improved infrastructure and support and extension services in these endeavours and are
committed to providing them within the limitations of the budget and also seek technical
assistance from the international community. They are also reviewing land legislation to
develop an enabling environment for land utilization.

Conclusion

Although performance under the program at end-March has been mixed, the authorities have
taken necessary measures to address the shortcomings and have been able to bring performance
back on track during the second half of 2004, which is broadly in line with the original
program. This is an indication of their strong commitment to the implementation of the
program. To reverse the slippages that have occured, they have taken steps to reduce noninterest current expenditures in line with program targets; and have taken measures to deal with
the slippages in the quantitative performance criteria for end-March on net bank credit to
government; and have introduced new personnel management regulations for the civil service.
In this regard, and in line with the agreement reached with the staff mission, the authorities are
committed to take measures to strengthen and consolidate the reform process, particularly in
those areas where slippages have occurred. They will continue to take measures to reconcile the
fiscal and monetary data for the period of 2000/02 and explore options to extend reserve
requirements to foreign currency deposits of commercial banks. Implementation of securities
repurchase agreements will commence following finalization of the necessary preparations.
Given the existing capacity constraints in many areas, my authorities are seeking Fund
technical assistance in the areas of fiscal and monetary operations, banking supervision,
payment systems and liquidity forecasting. Furthermore, additional reforms in all the relevant
areas are being proposed in the near-term to strengthen program implementation.
In the light of these strong commitments, my authorities are requesting a completion of the fifth
review under the PRGF arrangement and an extension of the arrangement for a three-month
period. The authorities have consented to the Fund’s publication of the paper.
