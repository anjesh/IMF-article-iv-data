FRANCE
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with France
Approved by Michael Deppler and G. Russell Kincaid
January 25, 2008

Executive Summary
France’s near-term economic outlook is moderately positive, but clouded by risks from the global
environment. While direct linkages between the ongoing financial turbulence and France’s domestic
real economy have so far been limited, staff analysis indicates that France’s economy is highly sensitive
to global common shocks. In 2008, spillovers arising from higher oil prices, the financial turbulence, and
the rise in the euro are set to more than offset a tax cut stimulus. Staff forecasts GDP growth of
1.6 percent in 2008, with a recovery in 2009. Core inflation remains low, but has edged up. With weaker
growth and some likely slippages, the fiscal deficit is forecast to widen temporarily to 2.7 percent of
GDP in 2008.
The authorities’ reform stance provides an historic opportunity to place France onto a sustained
growth path. Other countries’ experience and staff simulations suggest that a “critical mass” of
structural reforms is the most apt to exploit synergies, generate faster and larger payoffs, and attenuate
opposition. Experience also indicates that the payoffs are largest where current market distortions are the
greatest. In France’s case, labor market rigidities and pervasive constraints on competition in services
markets are appropriately at the center of the reform agenda. Staff and the authorities differed however
on the importance assigned to raising “purchasing power” and on the related demand-side orientation of
some of the government’s measures.
With a pause in fiscal adjustment in 2008, France remains distant from its medium-term objective
of budget balance. The 2008 budget entails no underlying adjustment—due to tax cuts—and fiscal
balance has been deferred to 2012. The authorities see the cuts as fulfilling campaign pledges and paving
the way for the broader reform effort. Staff view the postponement of the medium-term objective as
eroding credibility and is critical of some of the measures (notably the tax exemption of overtime, a
second-best response to the original distortion of the mandatory workweek reduction). Going forward, it
advocated the return to an ambitious fiscal adjustment path. The authorities are conducting potentially
far-reaching, and welcome, tax and spending reviews.
The financial system has weathered the market turmoil comparatively well, and repercussions on
the real economy have so far been limited. Bank losses to date imply manageable effects, and lending
standards have been tightened only marginally. Well capitalized banks, limited exposure to the U.S.
subprime market, and a comprehensive supervisory framework have contributed to this relative
resilience, but global market conditions have yet to return to normal and there are risks of a deeper
fallout. The authorities have launched a “Paris-Place Financière” initiative, providing an opportunity to
modernize France’s financial system and boost its contribution to growth, purging the remnants of a
heavily regulated and administered past. The authorities are also supportive of ongoing efforts to
strengthen the EU’s cross-border crisis management framework.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
While reforms have advanced in recent years, France’s economic performance
has remained comparatively weak. In its conclusions of the Article IV consultation last
year, the Executive Board observed that France “has changed more than is commonly
perceived,” but that “much remains to be done.” This continues to be the case. Reform
progress has been gradual and piecemeal, growth has stalled below other major industrial
economies, unemployment—though falling—has remained high, and export growth has been
weak. A growing consensus has emerged that a more aggressive reform strategy is required
to move the country onto a higher growth path—a consensus reflected in President Sarkozy’s
explicitly reformist platform.
2.
GDP growth has been modest due to supply-side weakness. GDP has risen by less
than the euro area average for nine consecutive quarters (2005Q3-2007Q3), with France not
participating in the revival of European growth since 2004, prompting political emphasis on
a “growth deficit.” For 2007, growth is
5
expected to be 1.9 percent, down from

2.0 percent in 2006 (Figure 1 and

domestic demand, with the external
sector persistently negative. The main

contribution to growth has come from
private consumption, reflecting steady

growth of some ½ percent of GDP per
annum over the past five years.
3.
Export growth has slowed in recent years, heightening concerns about
competitiveness. Real export growth has lagged behind the euro area average since 2003,
generating a drop in market shares for French exports, both worldwide and within the EU
and the euro area (Figure 2). With strong import growth, France’s current account balance
has deteriorated from a surplus of 1.4 percent of GDP in 2002 to a projected deficit of
2.0 percent of GDP in 2007 (Table 2); current account and trade balances with the euro area

4
have also deteriorated.1 The ratio of exports to
GDP has risen by 2 percentage points versus a
surge in import penetration of 5.1 percentage
points of GDP.
4.
While unemployment has declined,
labor market performance remains weak
(Figure 3). The (EU harmonized)
unemployment rate has fallen 1 point over the
past year (to 7.9 percent), mirroring the
decline in the euro area (to 7.2 percent).
However, unemployment remains
stubbornly above the EU average and is
particularly acute among younger workers
(near 20 percent). At the same time, the
employment rate is among the lowest in
Europe. While employment creation has
improved since 2004, it remains under
1 percent per year. Growth of the minimum
wage (SMIC) has sharply outstripped
general wages (and productivity), pricing
many low-end workers out of the market.

Monetary conditions have
tightened since 2006. The monetary

reflecting ECB tightening and, more
recently, euro appreciation. Moreover,
risk premia on lending have increased due
to the fallout from the financial turbulence
(Figure 4). While long-term interest rates
have risen moderately, short-term rates
have spiked in recent months. In contrast,
the fiscal stance has eased.

II. OUTLOOK
7.
Financial turbulence has had little impact on the domestic economy to date, with
limited effects on French banks, but global spillovers stand to dampen growth. Banks’
performance has continued to be solid, and exposure to the U.S. subprime market appears
limited. Credit default swap spreads have risen, but somewhat less than for some other major
European banks (Figure 5), and no bank has yet experienced the type of difficulties seen
elsewhere. French banks are generally well-capitalized and there is no domestic subprime
market as such. While real estate prices have risen markedly and may be somewhat
overvalued, French households are much less indebted than their U.K. or U.S. counterparts,
and the share of variable rate mortgages is low. This low leverage of French households may
soften the impact of any weakening of the real estate market. Nevertheless, the turmoil is
expected to dampen growth in 2008 via effects on partner country demand as well as
generally tighter credit conditions. Lending standards have been tightened by French banks,
but less so than elsewhere in the euro zone.2 Tighter conditions in 2006-07 may also trim
growth in 2008-09, given the lags in monetary transmission.
8.
For 2008, staff forecasts growth of 1.6 percent, weaker than anticipated earlier
and below official projections.3 The spike in oil prices, the rise in the euro, and weakening
economic prospects in partner countries will be a drag on growth, offsetting the stimulus
2

Lending survey data through October indicate that only 10 percent of French banks reported tightening
conditions, versus 30 percent for the euro area as a whole.

The December consensus forecast growth for 2008 is 1.8 percent. Staff forecasts might be reviewed further in
the course of the current WEO process, and would be reflected as needed in a Supplement.

from the 2007-08 tax cuts.4 Domestic demand will continue to sustain output, with the
external sector contributing negatively. Downside risks predominate, notably concerning the
depth and persistence of the financial market turmoil and its effects on other advanced
economies. On the upside, rapid reform progress could help sustain confidence and growth.
The authorities maintain the budget forecast of growth of 2-2½ percent for 2008. Core
inflation is expected to remain around 1½-1¾ percent, but headline inflation may rise due to
pressure on food and energy prices.

The chart includes the following risks to the baseline projections of growth (1.9 percent in 2007
and 1.6 percent in 2008):
● persistent tightening of financing conditions;
● 10 percent euro appreciation;
● 1 percent drop in foreign demand;
● boost in domestic confidence reflecting steady progress in reform agenda;
● a US recession and a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances.
They are weighted by the staff's subjective probability assessment of their occurrence.

9.
The staff baseline for medium-term trend growth is just under 2.2 percent
annually—close to the authorities’ 2.1 percent. Growth is forecast to remain somewhat
below potential in 2009 due to the aftereffects of slower global growth and tighter monetary
conditions. Thereafter, staff projects growth to accelerate, with scope for an increase in
potential output growth through structural reform. Staff projects 1 percent total factor
productivity growth annually in the medium term. Relatively high fertility, strong
immigration, and lower mortality should attenuate the effects of aging of the labor force.
Staff estimate that the incentive effects of reduced taxation on overtime and other measures
of the 2007-08 fiscal package might marginally boost growth, but more far-reaching,

4

Staff analysis indicates that France’s economy is highly sensitive to global common shocks (especially demand
shocks, which seem to originate from the U.S.) and reacts more through changes in employment and
productivity than through wage and price flexibility, buttressing the case for structural reforms (Alain Kabundi
and Francisco Nadal De Simone, “France in the Global Economy,” IMF Working Paper 07/129).

7
simultaneous reforms could boost long-run GDP by much more—up to 10 percentage points
over 10 years.5
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
10.
The government’s policy agenda is centered on implementing comprehensive
structural reforms to generate higher growth, raising employment and purchasing
power. Labor market reform is central to the government’s program, as is captured in the
slogan “work more to earn more.” Key initiatives are also underway in product and services
markets, as well as broad tax and expenditure reviews. Policy discussions centered on these
initiatives, with staff stressing the need for ambitious efforts and a focus on the country’s
supply deficiencies. The supply-side focus was prompted by some early (mainly demandoriented) measures and the emphasis on increasing households’ purchasing power, where
there is sharp political pressure for action. Fiscal policy was also central to the discussions,
with differences of view over the perceived trade-off between fiscal adjustment and
structural reforms, and the related “adjustment pause” in 2008, but full agreement on the
importance of rethinking the state’s role in the economy in order to secure expenditure-based
consolidation in the medium term.
A. France’s External Sector Weakness
11.
Competitiveness—as measured by the real effective exchange rate—has
deteriorated, but the appreciation fails to fully explain France’s poor export
performance. France’s real effective exchange rate has risen by 4½ to 12 percent since
2002, depending on the deflator used––due to euro

appreciation and to higher French labor cost

12.
Broader structural factors underlie faltering export performance. A
strengthening euro is no doubt increasingly challenging exporters, but staff viewed structural
factors, including high wage increases, supply constraints, and insufficient flexibility in

Synchronization Across Markets and Countries,” IMF Working Paper 06/137.

8
responding to changing global demand as more important constraints on export performance.
The authorities acknowledged the structural rigidities, but also saw a widening cost gap
chiefly with Germany as a key factor in weakening French export performance within the
EU.6 France’s sector specialization is also unfavorable—with export weakness concentrated
in automobiles and small firms.7 Consequently, strengthening the export capacity of SMEs
and increasing investment in R&D were seen as major levers to further export performance
in the medium run. While few workers in the export sector are at the minimum wage (SMIC),
strong SMIC increases have contributed to wage pressure elsewhere, and have helped boost
imports.
B. The Reform Agenda
13.
The move to a more forceful reform stance raises several political economy
considerations. The authorities have opted to pursue simultaneous reforms across a wide
range of areas, breaking with the incrementalist approach of the past. Staff supported this
strategy, noting that important synergies exist in contemporaneous action. Properly
calibrated, simultaneous reforms—addressing rents in several areas—could help attenuate
the political opposition of special interests.8 A “critical mass” of reforms would also generate
faster and larger payoffs in terms of growth, employment, productivity, and lower prices for
consumers, thereby garnering consensus. However, staff and the authorities had different
views about the interaction between fiscal adjustment and structural reforms. The authorities
felt it important to fulfill campaign pledges and provide early tangible benefits to pave the
way for reforms whose results take more time. It was in this light that they justified the
government’s early tax reduction measures. These measures also addressed a key concern of
the electorate—the perception of stagnant or declining real incomes (pouvoir d’achat). While
acknowledging the political potency of these arguments, staff’s reading of the data suggests
that French incomes have actually risen more than in other euro area countries (Box 1). Staff
noted that the emphasis on purchasing power risked obfuscating the true nature of France’s
growth difficulties—the weakness of its supply potential—while raising expectations that
could not be met. More generally, staff viewed fiscal adjustment and structural reforms as
complementary and thus considered the decision to pause fiscal consolidation in 2008 illadvised.

6

It has been apparent for some time that the German and French economies have been out of synch on several
dimensions (Figure 7).

7
8

See the background study on non-price competitiveness from a regional perspective, forthcoming.

The authorities did not see much scope for pursuing proposals (cf. in particular Jacques Delpla and Charles
Wyplosz, La Fin des Privilèges: Payer pour Reformer, 2006) to “compensate” stakeholders for the loss of rents
created by long-standing public policy.

9
Box 1: Pouvoir d’Achat: Perception and Reality
In recent opinion polls, French consumers rank eroding purchasing power (pouvoir d’achat) as their greatest
economic concern, above unemployment. Yet data show that over the past seven years, real disposable
household income has increased in France faster (18 percent) than in the euro area (11 percent), and
significantly faster than in most neighboring countries (panel 1). There is thus a wide disparity between a public
perception and the national accounts data.1 Reasons for this disparity may include:
•

Income per head has increased less than the aggregate due to population growth (0.6 percent).

•

While real wages per hour have risen, real wage incomes have stagnated since the 1980s largely due to
a decline in paid hours worked.

•

Perceived inflation has been persistently higher than measured inflation since early 2001 (panel 2).
Highly visible price increases (e.g for food) may have had a disproportionate impact on perceptions.

•

Strong increases in rents, which are weighted less in the consumer price index (6.1 percent) than in
the national accounts (18.6 percent weight in private consumption, including imputed rents by owners).

•

A rising share of non-discretionary spending, such as for housing, financial services, and insurance.
Down payments on housing loans, for example, are savings in the national accounts, but many private
households regard them as reducing their purchasing power.

•

An unequal distribution of income, leaving certain households financially pressed. Income
distribution data (available only through 2004) indicate that real incomes for the lowest and highest
deciles of the population rose between 2002-04, but most other deciles were stagnant or declining,
resulting in a middle class “squeeze.” As noted in the October 2007 WEO, however, “among the
largest advanced economies, inequality appears to have declined only in France.”

and Nobel laureates Stiglitz and Sten have been asked to consider including “quality of life” factors in
measuring growth.

10
Freeing the labor market
14.
There was agreement that labor market rigidities are probably the single most
significant barrier to higher economic growth and employment. France’s already low
labor input declined further in recent years, reflecting both high unemployment and lower
working hours among the employed. Main shortcomings in the labor market, as identified by
the authorities and the OECD (Figure 3), are: (i) burdensome legal restrictions on hiring,
firing, working hours, and functional mobility under permanent contracts, generating
inefficiencies and a severe “insider-outsider” divide; (ii) pervasive judicial involvement in
labor relations; (iii) inefficiencies and lack of coordination among public job placement and
unemployment compensation agencies; (iv) a high minimum wage; and (v) one of the highest
tax wedges on employment in the OECD. These distortions in turn weigh heavily on the
public purse, as tax breaks attempt to compensate for the rigidity of labor market institutions.
15.
The social partners have concluded a 4-month long negotiation on the reform of
labor contracts. Changes in the labor framework include an increase in the trial period, a
new labor contract that will allow project-linked employment and new incentives to end
permanent contracts through amicable separation. Dismissed workers will carry with them
rights to complementary health insurance, training and unemployment benefits that reflect
the contributions they made while employed. While this agreement should allow increased
use of temporary contracts and facilitate separations on permanent contracts, it falls short of
a comprehensive reform. Staff noted that studies suggest that reforms making the labor
market more flexible at the margin are ineffectual, tending to artificially increase the
turnover rate and only modestly affecting job creation, while having potentially harmful
effects on welfare.9
16.
The government is undertaking other initiatives to mitigate labor market
distortions. The most important among these are a review of the mechanism for setting the
SMIC, the merger of the unemployment and job placement agencies, and steps to impart
greater flexibility to the 35-hour workweek arrangement. There was agreement that the
secular rise of the SMIC has priced young and unskilled workers out of jobs and compressed
wages at the bottom end, demotivating effort. To begin correcting these distortions, the
government omitted the habitual discretionary increase of the SMIC in 2007 (the so-called
coup de pouce), limiting the adjustment to that determined by the indexation formula (a
combination of inflation and the increase in the average base salary). While staff saw
drawbacks in the formula, it is unlikely to change. The authorities are leaning rather toward a
9

See Pierre Cahuc and Stéphane Carcillo, “The Shortcomings of a Partial Release of Employment Protection
Laws: The Case of the 2005 French Reform,” IMF Working Paper 06/301. The scope for reform may also be
affected by the fact that France is among eight OECD signatories of the ILO Termination of Employment
Convention No. 158. In November 2007, an employment contract introduced in 2005, aimed at facilitating
hiring and dismissals in small enterprises (the Contrat Nouvelles Embauches—CNE), was found by the ILO as
not in observance of the Convention.

11
U.K.-style “low pay commission” to provide technical input and de-politicize decisions. The
merger of the job placement and unemployment agencies aims to promote a “return-to-work”
orientation via a closer, one-stop guidance of job-seekers.
17.
The authorities have attempted to make the 35-hour workweek less binding,
without formally reversing what is viewed as a social acquis.10 The main measure to date
is the elimination of taxes and social charges on overtime work. While uncertain, estimates
suggest that the measure would create relatively few new jobs, at a budget cost of about
0.3 percent of GDP. The authorities highlighted the signaling value of the measure in
extolling work effort, providing greater flexibility, and reducing marginal wage costs, while
not completely discounting staff criticisms of its shortcomings (windfall effects, operational
complexity to avoid probable fraud, and further recourse to the budget to alleviate a
distortion). More recently, the president has announced other possibilities to ease the
workweek limit, including through majority agreements in individual companies in exchange
for wage increases. These steps have met with a mixed reception, given their administrative
complexity, especially for smaller firms.
Goods and services markets—raising competition and consumer welfare
18.
Staff and the authorities agreed that further goods and services market reforms
could significantly boost potential output, competitiveness, and consumer welfare. This
emphasis is supported by studies showing that the benefits would be sizeable.11 The
authorities have assigned priority to early reforms in the retail distribution sector, while
undertaking preparatory work for the implementation of the EU Services Directive. A careful
review of all existing regulations is underway to ascertain their compatibility with the
Directive’s provisions. There was agreement that action need not await the Directive’s
drawn-out timetable, and could proceed in several areas—notably as regards regulations in
retail distribution, hotels, and restaurants, and tightly controlled activities and professions
(Box 2).

Staff work raises questions about the extent to which workers approve of the mandatory reduction in working
hours, which is estimated to have constrained the choice of a significant number of individuals. See Marcello
Estevão and Filipa Sá, “Are the French Happy with the 35-Hour Workweek?” IMF Working Paper 06/251.

11

Romain Bouis, “Évaluation de l’impact macroéconomique de reformes sectorielles a l’aide d’un modèle a
deux secteurs,” September 2007, finds an increase in GDP growth of 1.2 percentage points and of 250,000 jobs
resulting from structural reforms in financial markets, the distribution sector, and hotels and restaurants
(representing about 15 percent of GDP). These results are comparable to those in Everaert and Schule (2006).

12

Box 2. Key Product and Services Market Reforms
Several reform areas appear particularly promising in their ability to improve economic efficiency, yielding
lower consumer prices and greater productivity:
•

Supplier-retailer relations. Heavy-handed regulations originally designed to protect against predatory
pricing (codified in the loi Galland) have in practice strengthened the market power of large existing
firms, resulting in higher consumer prices. Previous steps to contain prices on national branded products
and the 2005/06 reform of the loi Galland yielded positive results. More recently, the government
introduced legislation to free wholesale margins, passing savings fully on to consumers.

•

Retail space and openings. Legal entry barriers1 have reduced new establishment of large retail shops,
hotels, and restaurants by almost 60 percent and limited the share of “maxi-discounters” to 13 percent in
France, compared to 30 percent in Germany. These barriers strengthen the bargaining position of large
retailers against suppliers and protect incumbents from competition. The authorities also intend to ease
regulations on retail opening hours and on sales periods.

•

Regulated activities and professions. Pervasive entry barriers include training requirements (certified
accountants, notaries, lawyers, architects), licenses (taxi drivers), and restrictions on establishment
(medical profession, pharmacies). Partly a result of self-regulation, entry barriers limit the supply of
services, providing rents. Accordingly, there is significant scope for reforms, as recognized by earlier
reports (e.g. Camdessus,2 and Cahuc and Kramarz3). The latter includes a list of 75 regulated activities
(métiers) and 28 regulated liberal professions.

The Lois Royer (1973) and Raffarin (1996) protect small retailers by subjecting the establishment of “grandes
surfaces” (above 300 m2)—including hotels—to special approval.

19.
Moving competition policy to center stage would, in staff’s view, be aided by a
unified, independent, and reinforced competition authority. In line with both the OECD
and the Attali Commission,12 staff advocated a change in France’s institutional framework
for competition policy, modifying its dualistic setup (split between the Conseil de la
Concurrence and a Directorate at the Ministry of Economy and Finance), including removing
responsibility for merger control from the ministry—an arrangement at odds with
international best practice. The authorities concurred that there was scope for greater
advocacy vis-à-vis the public of the virtues of competition, but expressed doubts that the
French institutional arrangement has compromised policy effectiveness. They pointed to the
favorable ratings France has received in comparisons of national competition authorities, and
questioned whether a unified authority was a genuinely superior arrangement.

12

The Commission has been charged with recommending measures to boost France’s growth.

13
C. Achieving Fiscal Sustainability
The fiscal position and objectives
20.
After several years of fiscal adjustment, progress stalled in 2007. Between 2003
and 2006, the structural deficit fell by over 1½ percentage points of GDP, bringing the
overall deficit to 2½ percent of GDP in 2006. However, higher revenues contributed most to
the adjustment, with the share of general government outlays to GDP remaining broadly
unchanged. Strong growth of social security and local government spending largely offset
tight control of central government expenditures. This trend continued into 2007 due to
slippages in health and pension-related spending. As a result, the general government deficit
is estimated to have remained broadly unchanged in 2007 (at 2.4 percent of GDP), implying
an underlying adjustment of only ¼ percentage point of GDP—half the SGP-recommended
pace for countries and still distant from their medium-term objectives.
21.
Despite continued spending restraint, the 2008 fiscal plans entail no underlying
adjustment due to the costs of tax-reducing measures. On the positive side, real general
government spending growth is limited to 1.4 percent, which would produce a 0.6 percentage
point decline in the expenditure-to-GDP ratio (to a still high 52.6 percent of GDP). The
budget also incorporates an unprecedented reduction in public employment (by 23,000);
improves the coverage of the central government expenditure norm; limits the growth of
transfers to local authorities; increases precautionary reserves; and contains further steps to
enhance the co-responsibility of health care users and discourage early retirement. However,
this expenditure restraint is largely undone by the cost of the tax package (½ percent of
GDP). In addition to the tax exemption for overtime hours, the package includes tax credits
for mortgage interest—viewed critically by staff due to its demand-side orientation with
likely little impact on home ownership or economic growth (as demonstrated by international
experience).13 Indeed, France had removed this deduction in the mid-1990s. More positively,
the 2008 budget includes a reformed research tax credit. The authorities project a general
government deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP (based on GDP growth of 2¼ percent), resulting in
an essentially unchanged structural balance and a marginal reduction in the public debt ratio
(to 64 percent of GDP).
22.
The 2008 budget appears subject to risks of slippage. The budget’s
macroeconomic and revenue assumptions are optimistic, social security overruns remain a
major risk (notably in health care), and expected efficiency gains in central government
outlays could prove elusive. As a result, staff expects a structural balance deterioration of
¼ percent of GDP and the overall deficit to reach 2.7 percent of GDP, close to the Maastricht

Working Paper No. 9284, October 2002) find the mortgage interest deduction to be “a particularly poor
instrument for encouraging homeownership.”

limit (Text Table)—perilously so were downside risks to growth to materialize.14 The
authorities thought staff overstated the risks, and viewed the possibility of approaching the
Maastricht limit as remote.

23.
Views differed on the 2008 fiscal adjustment pause. The authorities considered the
2008 budget to contain positive pro-growth measures and other effects underestimated by
staff, particularly in terms of generating goodwill for future, fundamental reforms. Staff, for
its part, viewed fiscal consolidation and structural reforms as complementary and pressed
that fiscal consolidation be restored as a national priority, as enshrined in last year’s budget
documents and in the Pébereau Report on public debt. Experience in other industrial

14

Each 0.2 percentage point in lower growth increases the deficit by roughly 0.1 percent of GDP. Thus, if
growth fell to 1 percent in 2008 (a 20 percent probability by staff’s estimate), the deficit could breach the
Maastricht limit absent corrective action.

15
economies (such as Canada—see Box 3—and others15) has shown that contemporaneous
fiscal consolidation and structural reforms can generate virtuous cycles of improved
competitiveness, higher growth, and healthier public finances. Maintaining a steady pace of
fiscal adjustment would promote credibility, eroded by the continuous postponement of the

Box 3. Canada’s Experience: Combining Fiscal Consolidation and Structural Reform
Facing debilitating economic conditions, Canada launched path-breaking fiscal and structural reforms in
the mid-1990s. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Canadians saw a marked deceleration in the growth of living
standards combined with a chronic deterioration of public finances. Slowing productivity and employment
growth led to sub-par economic performance while lax public spending contributed to further policy dislocation
and spiraling debt dynamics (Figure 8). In 1994, the government set out a bold economic reform to strengthen
Canada’s macroeconomic performance by cutting government deficits, rebalancing the policy mix (with lesser
reliance on monetary tightening), and establishing conditions to heighten competition and boost job creation.
A key priority was to eliminate the federal government deficit of over 5 percentage points of GDP based on
the following initiatives:
•

A retooling of the budget process to incorporate a transparent budget forecasting framework, including
a contingency reserve for debt reduction.

•

An expenditure review of all federal ministries to refocus the role of the government and stress the cost
effectiveness and efficiency of public services. A similar approach is guiding France’s recently
launched review of public policy.

•

An ambitious state reform including notably a 20 percent cut in the federal civil service; a reduced
presence of the government in the economy through selective privatization, and contracting out; and
broad deregulation.

Steps to raise economic flexibility and competitiveness complemented the fiscal reforms. Key initiatives
included reform of employment insurance and social assistance, pension reform, reduction of internal and
external trade barriers, deregulation of major network industries, and cutback of administrative burdens.
The fiscal turnaround after 1994 was remarkable. The federal government outperformed its fiscal targets
every single year thereafter and achieved fiscal surplus in 1998, a year earlier than planned. Expenditure cuts
allowed federal spending to fall from near 17 percent of GDP in 1994 to about 12 percent in 1998. With the
improvement of the fiscal situation, the government enacted one of the largest tax cuts in Canadian history in
2000.
The improved macroeconomic framework based on sound fiscal, monetary, and structural policies
created the conditions for sustained economic growth. Between 1997 and 2006, Canada enjoyed the highest
job creation and output growth among G7 countries.

15

Sweden’s experience in combining fiscal consolidation and structural reform is illustrated in S. Thakur,
M. Keen, B. Horvath, and V. Cerra, Sweden’s Welfare State, International Monetary Fund, 2003. See also
A. Annett, “Lessons from Successful Labor Market Reformers in Europe,” IMF Policy Discussion Paper 07/01,
which shows that four top EU reformers improved fiscal balances (while cutting labor taxation) during episodes
of labor market reform. Germany provides a more recent example.

set out in the end-2006 Stability Program—possible only with appreciably higher growth
(~3 percent). They viewed insistence on the same target date for all euro area countries as a
conceptually flawed “one-size-fits-all” approach likely to fail in several euro area countries.
Such an outcome was seen as more harmful to SGP credibility than France’s approach of a
realistic 2012 target based on comprehensive tax and expenditure reviews (see below). Staff
responded that the 2010 date per se was not the key issue; rather it was the failure to
maintain a consistent adjustment pace and the repeated rescheduling of adjustment
commitments that undermined credibility and increased the costs of adjustment (due to
higher debt stocks and increased demographic pressure). Staff noted that any successful
adjustment would require returning to a path of steady consolidation, achieved in the shortrun by stricter spending targets; general pension reform in 2008, building on the reform of
the special regimes underway; further healthcare reforms to expand co-payments and reduce
underlying spending pressures; and strengthened commitments to restrain local government
spending.

Fiscal reform
25.
The government has launched a comprehensive review of public policy to secure
better public services and lasting expenditure efficiency and reduction. Building on
substantial efforts in recent years to improve fiscal governance and control expenditures
(notably via the Organic Budget Law, LOLF), this broader review (RGPP) aims to go
beyond marginal improvements in cost and efficiency to achieve a more fundamental
improvement in public services and reduce spending as a share of GDP. A review of the
extensive role of the state in the economy is key, refocusing on core missions and
rationalizing the overlapping functions of multiple levels of local government. The planned
merger of the tax and public accounting directorates (DGI and DGCP), modernizing tax
administration structure, is a positive example of this rationalization. Finally, the review will
serve to place public spending in a strategic framework, with a move to multiyear budgeting
for the period 2009-11. Recently, the authorities unveiled the interim findings of the

17
comprehensive audits underway, including some 100 streamlining measures. Staff strongly
supported the exercise, noting the positive fruits that effective implementation yielded
elsewhere (such as Australia, Canada, and Sweden), while cautioning against expectations of
early results.
26.
The government has also initiated a general review of the tax system. The review
(RGPO) will allow the authorities to reevaluate the type of tax system needed to address the
challenges of the globalized economy of the twenty-first century. The review’s objectives of
greater stability, a supportive framework for business and investment, and greater use of
environmental taxes should guide reform toward a more efficient system. Staff noted that the
reform should give prominence to simplification and greater neutrality, producing a system
with fewer distortions (deductions, exemptions, and tax credits, see Box 4). A key element
should be a sharp reduction in tax expenditures, and the enshrining of the principle that all
such tax decisions be taken only in the context of the budget (Loi des Finances). Until then,
staff advocated a freeze on further tax expenditures, which are often taken off-budget cycle
in response to sectoral pressures—a proposal viewed with favor by the budget authorities.
The authorities, while noting the staff’s proposals, saw a tension in the call for stepped-up
fiscal adjustment and its concomitant support for tax reform which, they noted, is seldom
revenue-neutral.
D. Combining Financial Sector Stability and Efficiency
27.
French banks remain sound and well-capitalized, though the recent financial
turmoil has weighed on profitability and highlighted the importance of maintaining a
strong capital base. Consolidated net income and return on equity of the eight main banking
groups rose sharply and the ratio of nonperforming loans continued to decline in 2006
(Tables 6-7). This solid performance continued in the first half of 2007 which, combined
with strong capitalization, provided a cushion to absorb the impact of the crisis without
jeopardizing solvency. However, growth came mostly from corporate and investment
banking, asset management, and foreign markets, with expansion in domestic retail banking
weaker. This slowdown in domestic retail earnings and increasing reliance on nonintermediation activities have increased banks’ balance-sheet vulnerability to heightened risk
aversion and global liquidity retrenchment. Recent actions by some banks to consolidate offbalance sheet exposures, albeit generally not large, may also drive down banks’ earnings, as
may rising risk in corporate credit.16 In addition, the cooling-off in real estate prices,
tightened mortgage lending, and expected sluggish demand raise the risk of a future
downturn in the mortgage market.

16

An analysis of the impact of the turbulence on the French corporate sector is presented in the selected issues
paper “Financing and Risks of French Firms.”

18
Box 4. Tax Reform in France: Challenges and Options
The increased complexity of the French tax system has been an unfortunate by-product of a piecemeal
approach to tax reform. In recent years, the government has undertaken several initiatives to reduce the tax
burden on labor while seeking to accommodate global competitive pressures to lower capital taxation. Some of
these, such as the earned income tax credit (PPE), simplification of the personal income tax, or the reform of the
taxe professionnelle have brought noticeable improvements to the system. Nonetheless, measures have also been
introduced to compensate for other policy distortions, notably in the labor market, degrading the overall
coherence of the tax system by creating new distortions and loopholes. The August 2007 tax package is another
example of such a piecemeal approach.
Against this background, the announced general review of the tax system is timely. The strategic
assessment of the tax system should aim for greater stability, a supportive framework for business and
investment, and greater use of environmental taxes. It is the first tax assessment exercise of this scope in France,
and provides an opportunity to strategically revamp the system to increase tax efficiency and competitiveness.
Fundamental reforms elsewhere in the EU, notably to corporate and capital income taxation, pose challenges for
France by offering an attractive regime while safeguarding revenue. Staff sees several areas for reform of the
main taxes:
•

The statutory rate of the corporate income tax will soon be the highest in Europe. A lower rate with a
broader base could make the system simpler and fairer, deterring the shifting of profits and investment
to lower-taxed countries.

•

There is scope for further simplification and base-broadening of the personal income tax; transition
issues in moving to mandatory withholding are surmountable.

•

The intended restructuring and streamlining of France’s income support system (minima sociaux) and
work-pay initiatives (PPE) could help eliminate the distortions produced by the complexities of the taxbenefit system.

•

The VAT in France is increasingly out-of-step with international best practices. A move to unify VAT
rates and broaden coverage could raise as much revenue with a headline rate significantly below the
current 19.6 percent, reducing incentives to informality and allowing distributional objectives to be
pursued by better-targeted instruments.

•

The “tax shield” (bouclier fiscal) complicates tax administration and represents a second-best solution
to limiting the distortions caused by a high tax rate and an overly complex system. Reform should
reduce rates, including through the phasing-out of the wealth tax.

The emphasis being placed on environmental issues in reviewing the tax system is welcome.

28.
The exposure of the French financial sector to ongoing financial turbulence
appears manageable, despite some challenges.17 Direct exposure to subprime through
retail banking in the U.S. is negligible. French banks appear to be in a position to provide
liquidity and regulatory capital to their off-balance sheet vehicles if needed. The outstanding
amount of asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) is low (about 3 percent of the U.S. level).
17

In Q3 2007, BNP Paribas reported losses from the subprime and structured credit of €230 million, Société
Générale €328 million, Natixis €407 million, and Crédit Agricole Group €546 million. These banks all reported
overall profits for the quarter, however.

19
French banks run several conduits and one structured investment vehicle (SIV), but exposure
to mortgage-backed securities represents only 0.3 percent of total assets, and potential
subprime exposure via conduits accounts for less than 2 percent of assets. No banks have
taken their conduits onto their balance sheet yet, but Société Générale announced a
US$4.3 billion bail-out of its sole SIV, with an impact of about 5 b.p. on its tier-one capital
ratio. French banks’ exposure to Leveraged Buy-Out (LBO) risk also appears manageable.18
According to the authorities, French banks’ participation in recent ECB’s liquidity operations
was disproportionately low compared to their share of euro area assets and liabilities.
29.
Some French mutual funds, including notably so-called “dynamic” money
market funds, experienced temporary difficulties at the start of the global turbulence.
These funds, run by large financial institutions, suffered due to exposure to U.S. subprime
mortgages, leading in a few cases to a temporary trading suspension. While the timing of this
action—at the height of market jitters—was sensitive (given the potential for confusion
between operations on the bank’s own account and those in funds managed by the bank), the
decision is seen to have protected investors’ interest and safeguarded equality among
investors. The authorities have nonetheless initiated a review of financial product advertising
and of the marketing practices of these funds, whose nomenclature could be read as
suggesting liquid money market investments.
30.
On financial stability issues, the authorities are contributing to initiatives to
improve financial supervision and favor greater EU cooperation and regulatory
harmonization. Domestically, the authorities see the relative resilience of the French
financial system as clear validation of their supervisory model, with the proximity provided
by separate banking supervision (and coverage of all credit-granting institutions, the absence
of which they view as a determinant of the subprime crisis) ensuring timely information.
Internationally, they see the turbulence as demonstrating the need for coordinated initiatives,
set out inter alia in the Brown-Merkel-Sarkozy declaration of October 2007. At the European
level, the authorities strongly support strengthening the financial stability framework, favor
including an EU dimension in the statutory mandates of national regulators, and aim to press
the Lamfalussy process forward ahead of France’s EU Presidency in the second half of 2008.
31.
The authorities agreed that the financial sector’s contribution to growth could
be enhanced, and viewed the “Paris-Place Financière” initiative as contributing to this
end. The initiative aims to promote Paris as an international financial center, and envisages
steps to attract long-term capital, modernize the legal framework, and improve the tax and
regulatory environment. The authorities have also taken advantage of the implementation of
MiFID to implement “better regulation” principles. Finally, a commission headed by
18

Senior LBO tranches predominate (85 percent), with a small share of junior tranches (less than 6 percent) on
banks’ balance sheets. While there are signs of increasing leverage and longer time to syndicate, the pipeline is
estimated to be less than €10 billion and banks are decreasing origination volume.

20
Michel Camdessus has recommended ending the monopoly of distribution for certain
administered savings instruments (notably the Livret A), and the affected Banque Postale has
been granted the possibility of offering consumer credit—steps toward gradually phasing out
administered loan and savings schemes and reducing the state’s role in the financial sector,
as long advocated by the Fund.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
The government’s reformist intentions provide an historic opportunity to place
France onto a sustained higher growth path with greater opportunities for all. An
unwavering drive for reforms, entailing a true rupture from the past and complemented by a
stronger fiscal adjustment than currently planned, would create a virtuous cycle of higher
growth, healthier public finances, and lower unemployment. Aiming for a “critical mass” of
simultaneous reforms across different areas exploits the synergies of contemporaneous action
and—by addressing rents across several markets—more fairly distributes costs and benefits.
Fund staff simulations show that such a strategy would yield appreciably larger and faster
growth dividends than a gradual and piecemeal approach. However, to the extent that choices
must be made, efforts are best concentrated where current market distortions are the
greatest—in the labor market and constraints on competition in services markets—as is
indeed being planned.
33.
Economic policy should address the root cause of France’s faltering growth
performance: the weakness of its supply potential. While there is a widespread public
perception that a lack of purchasing power is constraining growth, the sources of France’s
growth difficulties lie not in deficient consumer demand, but in rigidities that impede supply
and impair export performance. The government rightly aims to address these rigidities, but
its emphasis on raising purchasing power—while understandable in political economy
terms—blurs the problem and raises unrealistic expectations. An unambiguous focus on the
country’s supply deficiencies would impart an overarching internal coherence to the
government’s economic strategy.
34.
Weak external sector performance adds urgency to the case for structural
reforms. While France’s measurable competitiveness gap is modest, its disappointing export
performance is testimony of deep-seated rigidities. Broad reforms addressing these rigidities,
along with fiscal adjustment, are key to raising future growth and export performance.
35.
With one of the lowest labor inputs in the OECD, France indisputably needs to
“work more” if it is to “earn more.” The government’s emphasis on work effort is most
apposite given the country’s low labor force participation, employment rates, and hours
worked. Three areas should receive priority attention. First, the various measures to ease the
35-hour workweek restrictions, including the tax exemption for overtime, do not address the
original distortion of the statutory reduction in working time, and as such are complex,
second-best responses. It is emblematic of the pernicious nexus between rigid labor market

21
institutions and the budget that—having spent considerable sums to implement the 35-hour
workweek—additional public money is now being diverted to circumvent it. Second, the
secular rise of the minimum wage needs to be halted. The decision to forego a discretionary
adjustment in 2007 is thus welcome, and should be maintained going forward. A “low pay
commission” of independent experts to advise on the yearly setting of the SMIC and raise
awareness of the impact of a high minimum wage on unemployment and public finances
could be helpful. Third, the present, highly limiting juridical framework for labor relations
merits comprehensive reform. While the outcome of the recent negotiation on labor contracts
is a welcome step towards reducing severe labor market rigidities, since social partners have
taken the current limiting framework as given, the agreement may only marginally ease labor
market constraints. A superior option would be to ease the restrictiveness of permanent
contracts more generally.
36.
Further goods and services market reforms could significantly boost potential
output and consumer welfare. Placing competition policy at center stage would be aided by
replacing the current dual responsibilities for competition policy with a single, reinforced,
and independent competition authority, as recommended by the OECD and the Attali
Commission. This authority could also be vested with a mandate to be a public advocate for
competition. For the benefit of consumers, current reforms of retail distribution should lead
to a complete removal of the prohibition of below-cost pricing, allowing full contractual
freedom between suppliers and retailers. More generally, the liberalizing opportunity offered
by the EU Services Directive should be fully seized.
37.
While the 2008 budget contains several commendable initiatives, it implies an
inopportune pause in fiscal adjustment, stemming from the tax-cutting provisions. The
2008 budget incorporates several positive features to contain spending, including an
unprecedented reduction in public employment. But the resulting expenditure restraint is
offset by the tax cuts, which focus largely on demand-side stimuli rather than on increasing
productivity and flexibility on the supply side.
38.
Fiscal policy should be vigilant to the risk of slippage in the fiscal deficit in 2008
and aim for a return to an ambitious fiscal adjustment path going forward. Risks in
2008 stem primarily from the prospect of lower-than-budgeted growth and from continued
spending pressures, most notably in social security. In addition, if growth were to turn down,
the deficit could move perilously toward its Maastricht limit, and early corrective action
should be taken. From 2009, a structural adjustment path of ¾ percentage points of GDP per
year, around which the stabilizers could be allowed to play, would bring the fiscal accounts
close-to-balance by 2010, contributing to the credibility of the medium-term objective.
39.
The ongoing expenditure and tax policy reviews are most welcome. International
experience shows that these exercises stand to yield appreciable results, providing lasting
improvements in the fiscal position and in the efficiency of public services. Expectations of
early results should however be tempered. In 2009-10, fiscal consolidation should be based

22
on tight spending plans and the recognition that the present state of public finances allows no
scope for further tax reductions or for continued recourse to tax expenditures to address
distortions or sectoral requests.
40.
The French financial system has weathered the recent financial market
turbulence comparatively well so far, but risks remain. The system’s strong
capitalization, its modest exposure to the U.S. subprime mortgage market, and a supervisory
system that covers all credit-granting institutions have all contributed to this relative
resilience. Still, the current environment continues to pose challenges, as market conditions
have yet to return to normal, which could further increase banks’ financing costs, reduce
their profitability, and induce credit tightening. Continued vigilance will thus be paramount.
The authorities’ readiness to include a European dimension in the statutes of national
regulators and the impulse they intend to give to the Lamfalussy process are welcome.
41.
The contribution that a modernized financial sector can make as a driver of
economic growth deserves greater prominence. In this regard, the “Paris-Place
Financière” initiative provides an opportunity to modernize France’s financial markets.
France’s financial system, while a leader in some sectors, continues to carry the legacy of a
heavily regulated and administered past. To improve the efficiency of the banking sector,
administered schemes should be phased out and the state’s role in the financial sector
reduced. Ending the monopoly on the distribution of Livret A provides opportunities in this
direction; in particular, with the Banque Postale being given the possibility to become a fullfledged bank and in due course privatized.
42.

It is proposed that France remain on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

Fiscal Transparency—Update

IMF Country Report
No. 04/345, 11/03/04

Summary: The report found that France has achieved a high level of fiscal transparency and
has introduced a number of improvements in coverage and presentation of fiscal information.
Notable areas of progress include the development in the final accounts publication to
include more complete information on government assets and liabilities as well as disclosure
of contingent liabilities. Accounting standards have been changed to reflect accruals
principles in a number of areas, and these standards are clearly explained. The staff
suggested that further steps could be taken to identify and report quasi-fiscal activities in the
budget presentation, provide a more consolidated picture of fiscal activity outside the
appropriation process, and improve the reconciliation of stated policies with outcomes at the
general government level.
These issues have been addressed in the Loi organique aux lois de finance (LOLF), which
has become fully effective on January 1, 2006. In addition to the annual appropriations, the
government has to commit to a multi-annual framework, details of which are provided in the
economic, social, and financial report attached to the Budget Act. The budget is organized
along missions and provides details on the level of appropriations for each mission and
performance indicators by which the expected results of the mission will be assessed ex post.
The State Audit Office has been given the new assignment of certifying the public accounts,
and implementation of accruals-basis accounting has been confirmed. Parliamentary
oversight powers have been strengthened.

Summary: The 2000 ROSC noticed that transparency of financial policies is accorded a
high priority by all financial agencies assessed, and they are in observance of the good
practices of the Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial
Policies. The major agencies disclose their objectives, their legal and institutional
frameworks, and have open processes of policymaking and regulation. The principles of
transparency are observed by dissemination of relevant information to the public and in the
agencies’ arrangements for internal conduct, integrity, and accountability. However, the staff
noted that the framework for supervision and regulation applicable to mutual insurance firms
is not as well defined and suggested to improve its transparency. The transparency of
monetary policy was not assessed by the Fund team as the Banque de France is a member of
the European System of Central Banks and no longer conducts independent monetary policy.
Subsequently, the framework for supervision and regulation applicable to a specific group of
mutual insurance firms was modified in a number of steps. In August 2003, legislation
created a single supervisory body, the Commission de Contrôle des Assurances, Mutuelles et
Institutions de Prévoyance (CCAMIP) by merging the regular insurance supervisor (CCA)
and mutualities’ supervisor (CCMIP). Coordination with the banking sector supervisors was
strengthened and the powers of the supervisory authorities extended.

Summary: The report found that France is in observance of the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS). In particular, the mandate of INSEE and the Banque de
France for the production of the six macroeconomic datasets is clearly defined, with the
reporting burden and the confidentiality provisions given special consideration notably
through the CNIS. Professionalism is central to the statistical operations of the two
institutions, internationally and/or European accepted methodologies are generally followed,
the degree of accuracy and reliability of the six datasets is remarkable, statistics are relevant
and provided on a timely basis, and they are accessible to the public.
The report made a number of suggestions for further improvements: the responsibility of
INSEE as the producer of government finance statistics should be clarified; data sharing
between the Banque de France and the rest of the French statistical system improved;
classification and valuation methods in balance-of-payments statistics reviewed; consistency
between the current account of the balance of payments and the goods and services account

43
in the national accounts improved; the timing of revisions in the quarterly and annual
national accounts aligned; and identification of data production units of INSEE facilitated.
France continues to implement several of the 2003 ROSC Data Module recommendations,
including by promoting a broader understanding of statistical data revisions, making greater
use of firm-level data to improve the measurement of changes in stocks, and intensifying
work on portfolio investment income with the objective of starting to record those
transactions on an accrual basis.

Summary: The report concluded that France’s financial sector is strong and well supervised.
No weaknesses that could cause systemic risks were identified. The strength of the system is
supported by the financial soundness indicators and the strong conformity to the supervisory
and regulatory standards approved by the Basel Committee, IAIS, IOSCO, FATF, and CPSS.
The degree of observance of the transparency code is high in all relevant areas. The French
banking sector has been modernized and restructured over the past two decades and is well
capitalized. Systemic vulnerabilities in the important insurance sector are well contained.
Securities markets are large and sophisticated.
Notwithstanding the strengths of the French financial sector, a number of issues emerged
from the FSAP, including (i) concentration in banking may have reached a point where
further consolidation could intensify concerns over the scope for collusion and long-term
stability where many banks could be considered “too big to fail;” (ii) banks’ large and
growing portfolios of fixed-rate residential housing loans could represent a longer-term risk
in the event of large increases in funding costs and/or a significant fall in real estate prices;
(iii) some administered savings schemes and other policy measures give rise to costs and
impede financial market innovation. These schemes are not well targeted to achieve intended
social goals and are not well aligned with current priorities, such as strengthening the
pension system; (iv) the banking system’s rapid accumulation of capital strengthens banks’
resilience. This accumulation is harder to control for mutual banks, given their legal
restrictions on remuneration of their members. And, for all banks, it could encourage

44
expansion through expensive takeovers and risky new ventures; (v) the supervisory system of
the financial sector is composed of specialized segments. Coordination mechanisms need to
be further adapted. Additional steps should be considered in the future as cross-sectoral
financial groups become more prevalent; (vi) the consolidation of the French stock and
futures markets with others in Europe has increased the importance of effective cooperation
across national jurisdictions. Moreover, the authorities face the challenge of adjusting to and
effectively implementing the significant regulatory overhaul that took place in late 2003; and
(vii) the infrastructure for the clearing and settlement of payments and securities is generally
sound and modern. However, there is some room for improvement in the clearing and
settlement of retail payments and securities, where the multilateral netting systems lack fully
adequate safeguards to ensure timely settlement in case of default.

45
APPENDIX II. FRANCE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
The economic database is comprehensive and of high quality, and data provision to the Fund
is adequate for surveillance. The authorities regularly publish a full range of economic and
financial data, and calendar dates of main statistical releases are also provided. France
subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The transmission of data in
electronic form from INSEE (Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques)
and the profusion of data from various institutions (Banque de France, INSEE, ministry of
finance, ministry of labor and solidarity) have helped to build an infrastructure, in which all
data can be easily accessed through the Economic Data Sharing System. A data ROSC
mission conducted an assessment of the statistical system in March 2003, and the report was
published in October 2003. A factual update to the main report was published in November
2004.
France’s monetary and banking statistics methodology conforms with the European Central
Bank framework, which provides comparable details as the Standardized Report Forms
developed by STA. Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions
and monetary aggregates are prepared on a monthly basis and are timely. Monetary data are
also disseminated in the quarterly IFS Supplement on monetary and financial statistics.
France follows the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95). Data
for GDP and its expenditure components are available from 1978 onwards. Both annual and
quarterly accounts provide reliable information, although estimates from the two accounts
differ slightly before the quarterly accounts are revised to be aligned to the annual ones. In
2005, national accounts estimates were rebased to 2000 prices.
Government finance statistics have been strengthened recently. Both central and general
government data are presented in a more comprehensive fashion than previously and the data
for 2006 and 2007 also reflect the various impacts of recent budgetary reform. Although the
source data is collected by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, INSEE is principally
responsible for the compilation and dissemination of fiscal data in a framework that is
consistent with ESA95. INSEE’s website has recently been enhanced; in particular, it
includes expenditure tables and government revenues by subsector (central government,
miscellaneous central government agencies, local governments, and social security
administration).
Balance-of-payments statistics should be interpreted with caution, given large errors and
omissions. Greater coherence between the external current account and the rest of the world
account in the national accounts is needed. In this regard, work with promising early results
has been undertaken on the transportation account.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
FRANCE
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with the Policy Development and Review Department)
Approved by Michael Deppler and Matthew Fisher
February 12, 2008

This supplement to the staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with France provides
an update on staff’s revised economic outlook, recent developments in financial markets, and
structural reform proposals. The information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Summary
Growth is forecast to dip in 2008 to 1.5 percent, slightly lower than anticipated in the staff
report due to a further weakening of the global environment, as set out in the recent interim
WEO. Headline inflation has continued to rise, given higher oil and food prices, but core
inflation remains below 2 percent. While the banking system so far appears to be only
moderately affected by the ongoing financial turmoil, the full extent of necessary write-downs
is still unknown, and a massive fraud case at Société Générale is troubling. The Commission
for the Liberalization of Growth in France (Attali Commission) has presented its report and
the government has undertaken to implement most of its (over 300) specific
recommendations, though protests by taxi drivers seem to have led it to distance itself from
the report’s proposals in this area.
Output and inflation
1.
Staff projects a deceleration of GDP growth to 1½ percent in 2008 (Table 1). The
revision is driven by slower growth in the U.S. and Europe and the effects of higher inflation
on consumer spending. It is consistent with the mark-down of ½ percentage point in euro
area growth in the interim WEO published on January 29, which reflects broadly evenhanded
reductions across main euro area countries. While lending flows to the private sector have
continued to be strong, the global financial market turmoil has led to appreciably tighter bank
lending standards for firms. Recent developments have also weighed on consumer
confidence, which dropped in January to its lowest level in 12 years. The tax cuts approved

2
in July 2007 and in the 2008 budget (½ percent of GDP) became fully effective in January
and stand to mitigate somewhat the negative external effects on demand. With a fiscal deficit
projected by staff to widen to 2.8 percent of GDP (versus 2.7 percent of GDP in the staff
report) in 2008—near the Maastricht limit—and a relatively high debt/GDP ratio, there is no
room for additional discretionary fiscal stimulus. In this respect, on February 12, 2008 the
ECOFIN Council invited France to “strengthen the pace of budgetary consolidation and debt
reduction.” The risks to the staff’s forecast are broadly balanced, with downside risks related
to the international environment and, on the upside, a possibly stronger rebound in the
aeronautics and automobile industries. A relatively strong showing of industrial production in
December 2007 may provide some ground for the latter.
Financial sector
2.
On January 24, Société Générale (SG) communicated that a massive rogue
dealing fraud has cost the bank €4.9 billion. SG reported the fraud in addition to
€2.1 billion in U.S. residential mortgage and monoline related write-downs; the latter were
revised to €2.6 billion on February 11. SG has launched a rights issue to raise €5.5 billion in
fresh capital in the market. In a report, issued on February 4, the authorities concluded that
the fraud was an isolated event, but pointed to failures in the bank’s internal controls of
derivatives trading, with questions already raised last year by the derivatives exchange,
Eurex. The report finds that the subsequent unwinding of the trader’s position conformed to
market practice, but was carried out under difficult market conditions. Minister Lagarde has
asked for clarification of the communication requirements between regulatory agencies and
the government in crisis management. Various other enquiries into the episode are underway.
Separately, the authorities have indicated their aversion to possible hostile takeover bids of
SG.
3.
Notwithstanding the SG episode, the French banking system appears to be only
moderately affected by the ongoing financial turbulence. So far, most of the large French
banks have disclosed manageable exposure to the U.S. subprime market. Two of the large
banks have revealed preliminary results for the entire year: BNP has reported an increase
over last year’s net income, and––excluding the fraud-related write-downs––SG has reported
stable results, despite losses related to the turbulence. However, banks’ exposure and risk
may increase in case of a worsening situation of monoline bond insurers1 and a persistence of
the turmoil.
4.
The government has asked financial institutions and regulators to join in efforts
at both the national and international level to strengthen internal control of market
operations. The government has asked firms and regulators to work together on improved
1

hit by the global turmoil.

3
internal control systems and better regulation of operational risk management, to reduce
vulnerabilities in the French banking system. It noted that banks’ management should be
fully involved in risk control and fraud identification, and that supervisors may need to raise
monetary sanctions against violations of regulations. France has called for setting
homogeneous international standards on the management and transparency of operational
and reputational risk, within the framework of Basel II.
5.
Credit standards have tightened appreciably in corporate lending, but not in
household lending. The Banque de France’s most recent lending survey reported a sharp
tightening of banks’ credit standards to firms in the fourth quarter and expectations of a
further tightening in 2008. French firms have relatively strong balance sheet positions and are
less reliant on bank lending than in some other euro area countries; nonetheless, tightening
credit conditions, especially if confirmed going forward, would compound downside risks to
growth.2 In contrast to firms, lending standards to households have remained little changed.
This difference suggests that, beyond the impact of the turmoil on bank leverage, the
worsening economic outlook may have played a major role in the credit tightening.
Structural issues
6.
President Sarkozy has undertaken to implement most of the Attali Commission’s
proposals to generate growth in France. In mid-January, the Commission presented
316 specific measures (décisions) covering education, future technologies, competitiveness
of SMEs, labor markets, rents and privileges, taxation, and public spending. The objectives
are to raise potential growth by 1 percentage point, reduce unemployment to 5 percent, cut
poverty, and improve living conditions in problem neighborhoods by 2012. Prime Minister
Fillon announced the presentation of a draft law on the “modernization of the economy” in
spring 2008, which would also include proposals on the deregulation of retail trade,
strengthened competition policies, and measures in support of SMEs. He also initiated
consultations with social partners and economic agents to formulate reform plans in a
number of other areas, including the regulated professions. Protests by taxi drivers seem, for
their part, to have induced the government to distance itself from the specifics of the Attali
report’s recommendations. Other report proposals are to be covered by existing processes,
such as the general expenditure review (RGPP) and negotiations on pension reform due later
this year. Ahead of these talks, the government has announced a multi-year increase in the
minimum pension (minimum vieillese), with a first installment already in 2008.

2

See Selected Issues II, Financing and Risks of French Firms (www.imf.org). The tightening of lending
standards for credit to firms, which was more moderate in France until October 2007 (¶7 of the staff report), is
now in line with the euro area average.

4
Staff assessment
7.
The events at Société Générale are troubling, and revealing of serious
shortcomings in internal controls, but not such as to affect the overall stability of the
French financial system. If Société Générale successfully concludes its announced
recapitalization of €5.5 billion or is merged with a stronger partner, there are unlikely to be
systemic repercussions. Contestability, including by potentially interested foreign parties,
should however be fully assured. Efforts to enhance operational risk management to avert
similar frauds in the future are welcome, with effective enforcement of existing regulations
being the priority, and incentives to undue risk-taking in proprietary trading re-examined;
regulatory changes might also be needed, and weighed against their cost implications.
8.
Many measures proposed in the Attali report could help lift growth and raise
consumer welfare. The removal of barriers to doing business in the retail sector, including
hotels and restaurants, and the strengthening of competition policies would raise supply,
improve the efficiency of markets, and lower consumer prices—and are specifically endorsed
in the staff report (¶36 and others). Their inclusion in a broader liberalizing draft law in the
spring is welcome. With respect to other reforms, it will be important that consultations with
social partners and professionals do not result in undue delays or weak agreements,
maximizing long-term benefits to consumers. Given the state of public finances, it will be
important to offset the budgetary costs of some of the proposals by a redeployment of
resources.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with France
On February 15, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with France.1
Background
Economic growth in France has averaged 2 percent since 2003, lagging both the revival of
European growth and past growth performance at the same stage of the economic cycle. While
domestic demand has remained robust, net exports have been a significant drag on growth,
detracting close to ½ percentage point of GDP per year on average. In 2007, growth was
1.9 percent, down from 2.0 percent in 2006. Domestic demand has remained the driver of
growth. As a result of the deceleration in real export growth and the continuation of dynamic
import growth, France’s current account has deteriorated steadily: from a surplus of 1.4 percent
of GDP in 2002 to an estimated deficit of 1.3 percent in 2007.
Inflationary pressures are mounting, but headline inflation remains one of the lowest in the euro
area. After ebbing down to 1.2 percent in mid-2007, headline inflation has rebounded to
2.8 percent in December 2007 with the surge in food and energy prices. Unit labor costs have
risen, as productivity gains have lagged wage inflation. Monetary conditions have tightened
noticeably since 2006, reflecting ECB rate increases and, more recently, euro appreciation and
the increase in risk premia due to the fallout from the financial turbulence.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Financial turbulence has had a limited impact on the domestic economy to date, and
performance of the banking sector remains solid. French banks’ exposure to the U.S. subprime
market appears fairly limited and credit default swap spreads have risen less than for some
other major European banks. Nonetheless, financial institutions remain vulnerable, particularly
with regard to off-balance sheet exposures. In addition, profitability may be further impacted by
rising risk in corporate credit, the cooling-off in real estate prices, and generally tighter credit
conditions. Recent events at Société Générale have revealed shortcomings in internal control,
which the authorities intend to address.
For 2008, GDP growth is projected to reach 1.5 percent, substantially weaker than anticipated
earlier. The spike in oil prices, the rise in the euro and weakening economic prospects in partner
countries will be a drag on growth. The risks to the staff’s forecast are broadly balanced, with
downside risks related to the international environment and, on the upside, a possibly stronger
rebound in the aeronautics and automobile industries.
The authorities are pursuing an ambitious structural reform program across a wide range of
areas. At the center of the program is the need to increase flexibility in labor markets. To date,
the government has introduced a number of measures to make the 35-hour workweek
restriction less binding. In addition, social partners have reached agreement on key labor
market reforms, upon which the government intends to act. Other labor market initiatives
include a review of the mechanism for setting the minimum wage (SMIC) and the merger of the
unemployment and job placement agencies. The government is also pursuing goods and
services market reforms, which could boost potential output and consumer welfare. Among the
key priorities, early action is expected in reforming the retail distribution sector.
The 2008 budget represents a pause in fiscal consolidation. The budget maintains spending
restraint (including an unprecedented reduction in public employment), but it is offset by the cost
of the August 2007 tax package, leaving little deficit improvement. Over the medium term, the
government aims for an annual structural adjustment of ½ percentage point of GDP consistent
with the objective of reaching fiscal balance by 2012 under its central scenario.
The government has launched a comprehensive general review of public policy. The review
aims to achieve a fundamental and lasting improvement in public services while reducing public
spending on a sustainable basis. Analogously, a general review of the tax system has also
begun. It would be the basis for reform toward a more efficient tax system based on greater
stability, a supportive framework for business and investment, and greater use of environmental
taxes.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for their intention to accelerate the economic reform
process and to push for simultaneous reforms across different areas. Directors noted that this
strategy increases the prospects for an appreciable acceleration in economic growth by
exploiting the complementarities of reforms. They welcomed the authorities’ focus on reforming
areas where market distortions are currently greatest—notably labor and services markets.

3
Such an approach would address the sources of France’s growth difficulties which, Directors
noted, lie not in deficient consumer demand, but in rigidities that impede supply and impair
export performance. Directors stressed that eliminating these rigidities would raise productivity
and stimulate growth, and over time yield a greater contribution to improving the purchasing
power of French households than short-term measures to boost disposable income.
Directors noted that near-term growth prospects for France have weakened with the onset of
the global financial turmoil and the slowdown in advanced economies, with a recovery expected
in 2009-10. Growth in recent years has been sustained by domestic demand, with the external
sector contributing negatively. Export growth has lagged, producing a widening current account
deficit. Directors noted that competitiveness, as reflected in the real effective exchange rate,
shows some deterioration. However, the deterioration is modest—suggesting that the exchange
rate is not the principal constraint on exports, and underscoring the need to address
inefficiencies in factor and product markets to boost performance.
Directors saw labor market reforms as central to a strategy of raising growth, reducing
unemployment, and improving the purchasing power of French households. They noted that the
government has already taken steps to alleviate the country’s highly restrictive labor
regulations, including by relaxing the 35-hour workweek requirements and fostering an
agreement between employers and trade unions to rationalize labor contracts and improve
employment flexibility. Directors also welcomed steps to rationalize public employment services.
They highlighted the need for further reforms, including steps to reduce wage compression by
limiting future discretionary adjustments in the minimum wage, further relaxing the 35-hour
workweek, and making more fundamental improvements in the flexibility of permanent
employment contracts. In this context, a number of Directors noted the fiscal costs implied in
trying to alleviate labor market rigidities via the budget, and favored an approach that addressed
the core problems directly.
Directors viewed goods and services market reforms as having the potential to significantly
boost output and consumer welfare. They welcomed steps to liberalize retail distribution, which
should lead to a positive effect on inflation, and the planned move to a unified competition
authority. More generally, the liberalizing opportunity offered by the EU Services Directive
should be fully seized. Directors looked forward to the draft law expected in the Spring taking up
the recommendations of the Attali Commission.
Directors noted that, while the 2008 budget contains several commendable initiatives to contain
spending, including an unprecedented reduction in public employment, it entails a pause in
fiscal adjustment due to tax cuts. While recognizing the challenges to policy making in the
present conjuncture, most Directors stressed that fiscal consolidation should proceed in tandem
with structural reforms. They accordingly encouraged the authorities to be vigilant to the risk of
slippage in the fiscal deficit target in 2008. With lower growth forecast in 2008, the deficit risked
moving toward its Maastricht limit, leaving in these Directors’ view no room for additional
discretionary fiscal stimulus. Several other Directors, however, felt that it was appropriate for
fiscal policy to play an active countercyclical role in the face of the weakening global economic
environment and other downside risks to the French economy. More generally, Directors urged

4
the authorities from 2009 to return to an ambitious adjustment path for the fiscal deficit,
strengthening the credibility of their medium-term objective of budget balance.
Directors strongly welcomed the government’s ongoing expenditure and tax policy reviews.
They observed that international experience shows that these exercises can provide significant
lasting improvements in the fiscal position and in the efficiency of public services. They noted,
however, that these improvements take time to materialize, so fiscal consolidation in 2009-10
should be based on tight spending plans.
Directors noted that the French financial system appears to have been only moderately affected
by the recent financial market turbulence. The system is well-capitalized, exposure to the U.S.
subprime market is limited, and off-balance sheet exposure appears to be moderate. But market
conditions have yet to return to normal and risks remain. Directors thus encouraged the
authorities to remain vigilant to the possibility of further spillovers from other countries and from
other market segments. The recent trading fraud at Societé Générale, while it appears to be an
isolated event, points to the need to continue to reinforce risk management controls in banks.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ prompt investigation of the affair and their commitment to
take the necessary steps to ensure that similar problems do not recur. Directors recommended
that the authorities move forward with the modernization of France’s financial market, moving
away from its administered past, as advised also by the recent Camdessus report on regulated
savings. A more efficient financial sector could make a significant contribution to boosting
economic growth. The impulse that the authorities intend to give to the Lamfalussy process is
also welcome.

Statement by Ambroise Fayolle, Executive Director for France
February 15, 2008
We wish to thank staff for a quality report that provides an in-depth analysis of the strengths
of the French economy—and the challenges it faces—at a pivotal time in its history. We are
also grateful for the Selected Issues, which we found most interesting. The discussions with
the team were warmly appreciated by the French authorities, in addition to providing useful
input for their own assessments. As the authorities themselves explained during the mission,
they are hopeful that the IMF can more widely disseminate cross-country analyses and
experiences. The French authorities set great store by the surveillance exercise, as evidenced
by their decisions to implement two of the resulting recommendations: the ending of the
monopoly over the distribution of the livret A accounts and the establishment of a unified
regulatory authority in charge of competition issues.
Structural reforms
“France is on the move,” IMF staff asserted in the Concluding Statement for the 2007
Article IV Consultation. The government’s strategy is to free productive capacities. To
achieve this goal, the government has embarked upon a reform process distinguished by one
clear objective and three characteristic features: its scope, its method, and its speed of
implementation.
- Objective: raise France’s potential growth by 1 percent over time.
- Scope: achieve a “critical mass” of reforms so as to maximize synergies.
France is implementing a comprehensive structural reform strategy aimed at
raising productivity, increasing the employability of individual workers, and
enhancing the attractiveness of France’s economy.
- Method: move quickly while allowing adequate time for collective
bargaining, consensus and avoiding deadlocks.
- Implementation: once decisions have been reached, the authorities will press
ahead quickly with the structural reforms. A sizable number of reforms have
already been carried out, as staff has pointed out. I would like to touch upon
some of these reforms.
Improve labor market mobilization
The reform of overtime rules, adopted last August, is producing a supply-side effect. A mere
3 months after its adoption, by November 2007, 50 percent of firms with more than
10 employees had reported already using the new system. In addition, special pension plans
have been reformed, with particular reference to contribution periods and indexation rules,
which have been aligned with the rules governing reformed pension plans. In 2008, the full
set of financing parameters of pensions will be examined with a view to reducing mediumand long-term financing requirements. The merger of UNEDIC and ANPE, a reform that has
been on the table for over twenty years, will foster a more effective matching of supply and

2
demand, while improving labor market flexibility. And as Fund staff have pointed out, the
decision to forego any hike in the SMIC (minimum wage) in July 2007 will make it easier for
employers to hire unskilled workers. Furthermore, the agreement reached between 8 out of 9
employers’ and workers’ unions on January 11, 2008 will increase the flexibility of the labor
market and improve the employment rate. This agreement relaxes the requirements for
terminating employer-employee relationships in exchange for the introduction of an
occupational and social safety net for workers in addition to the preservation of their acquired
rights. Negotiations have begun in other areas, in which the employers’ and workers’ unions
are expected to reach agreement by March 31, 2008. I am referring in particular to the
strengthening of vocational training and negotiations with respect to working hours.
Increase competition in the market for goods and services. The law adopted last
December, rightly described as “particularly promising” by staff (Box 2), frees wholesale
margins and passes savings on to customers. According to forecasts, this key measure should
decrease the CPI by 1½ to 2 points. Other reforms have already been decided upon, with
implementation beginning in early 2008: the liberalization of ports and rail freight, and the
over-the-counter sale of pharmaceutical products. Finally, a draft law is expected in the
Spring to take up the recommendations of the Attali commission.
Strengthen R&D. The London protocol has been ratified. This will allow French firms to
reduce patent costs while at the same time increasing the international comprehensibility of
patents. The research tax credit (implemented on January 1, 2008) modifies the eligible tax
base with the aim of encouraging long-term innovation efforts. It is one of the most attractive
settings in Europe. The GDP increment associated with the latter reform will be in the range
of 0.3 and 0.5 point of GDP after 10 years. Furthermore, the universities were reformed in
August 2007.
France is drawing inspiration from successful foreign experiences. When discussing
foreign experiences, it is vital to take full account of those factors—monetary conditions in
particular—that are key to the successful implementation of the accompanying reforms. The
annex and the box on the Canadian experience could be amended in that regard.
Last but not least, reflecting France’s commitment to the surveillance exercise, the
authorities recently adopted two decisions long recommended by the IMF. First, last
December, the Prime Minister announced the ending of the monopoly on the distribution of
livret A accounts, which should take effect by January 1, 2009 at the latest, as called for by
the Fund (paragraph 41). Moreover, on January 23, 2008 the President of the Republic
announced his support for the Attali Commission’s proposal to establish a unified
competition authority, in accordance with IMF recommendations (paragraph 19).
Economic environment
The short-term outlook is reasonably good. Naturally, France is not immune from the
slowdown in the global economy. Consequently, the government has indicated that for 2008,

3
France’s growth forecast will be around 2 percent. The most recent INSEE economic outlook
survey, published in mid-December 2007, projected a growth carry-over of 1.7 percent by
mid-2008, i.e., well above Fund staff’s estimates.
The French economy performed well in 2007. In particular, job creation has been robust:
more than 230,000 new jobs appeared in the business sector during the first three quarters of
2007, in contrast to 190,000 for all of 2006. The unemployment rate at the end of the third
quarter was 8.3 percent (down from 9.8 percent at end 2005). Furthermore, short-term
economic indicators are on track. The business climate in the manufacturing sector has thus
remained buoyant throughout 2007 in France. This is attributable in particular to the recovery
of the automobile industry and the ongoing dynamic performance of the aviation sector.
These welcome developments are expected to continue in 2008 and to support France’s
industrial production and exports. In spite of the increase in inflation through end-2007,
household consumption is expected to remain strong in early 2008, benefiting from the
steady improvement in the labor market in 2007 and measures adopted last summer.
Furthermore, despite tighter interest rates, consumer credit remained dynamic at end-2007.
The relatively low level of household indebtedness (68 percent of gross disposable income),
mainly at fixed rates, and a real estate market unhampered by risks identified in other
countries, are two other positive factors going forward.
With respect to the impact of the financial crisis on French firms, as analyzed in the
Selected Issues, we share the view that French firms continue to perform favorably.
However, we wish to point out that in view of the selection bias in the study, its conclusions
are relevant to the sole listed companies.
France’s economy is more resilient to a global slowdown than other comparable
economies, given the manner in which its growth is structured, contrary to the claims
made by staff, particularly in the Selected Issues. Although the analytical method
proposed by staff is appealing, it will require further verifications and additional econometric
support if it is to be truly convincing, particularly with regard to the suggested policy
recommendations.
Economic policy
The authorities have indicated their intention to pursue their fiscal consolidation effort
through 2010, cyclical conditions permitting. The timetable and arrangements for this
adjustment are consistent with the government’s economic strategy, which is designed to
achieve sustainable improvements in government finance, focusing on two key areas.
First, the implementation of structural reforms is designed to boost potential growth.
Available research (IMF studies in particular) shows that current and proposed reforms will
raise potential growth by 1 percent over time.

4
Second, the government is embarked upon an unprecedented drive to control public
expenditure. Specifically, the framework for expenditure control (stabilization in volume
terms) has been broadened, particularly to include withholdings from revenue (in favor of
regional governments and the European Union). In light of those expenditures for which
increases are automatic (pensions, debt outlays), compliance with the expenditure framework
will necessitate volume reductions in other government expenditures. The decision not to
replace one out of every two civil servants will represent a key component of this effort, as
adopted in the 2008 budget law (except for national education, where the ratio will be one
out of three). Lastly, the government has made a commitment to parliament to identify a tax
expenditure supervision tool, as a complement to the expenditure framework. The 2008
budget will be rigorously implemented.
The objectives of public expenditure control are credible. First, the broad review of
public policy (RGPP) is under way. As a result of this review, staff reductions should be
accompanied by organizational changes and streamlining. This exercise is being led at the
very highest levels of government and the main decisions will be taken in the Spring. Then,
in 2009, a three-year government budget will be adopted to supplement the RGPP, in order to
align the timetable of the reforms with the budget process. This multi-year approach will
make it possible to strengthen the beneficial reforms introduced by the budget framework
law (LOLF).
We are in broad agreement with the main message in the Selected Issues regarding the
French tax system. However, the claim that the fundamental changes of the kind seen
elsewhere have yet to appear in France is unduly harsh. Staff’s message (i.e., the need for
a comprehensive approach) is consistent with the wide-ranging review of the tax and social
contribution system (RGPO) currently being pursued by the authorities. However,
the reforms that are already in place should not be overlooked. For example, the maximum
marginal rate of the income tax in France is now one of the most competitive. Moreover,
France is at the forefront of efforts to achieve tax neutrality—for example, through the phaseout of double taxation on equity securities for businesses. Finally, although the nominal rate
of corporate income tax remains high, France has lately been focusing its corporate income
tax reduction efforts on the reform of the taxe professionelle, as acknowledged in Box 4.
Financial system
Like staff, we believe that France’s financial markets have weathered the recent
financial turbulence well. The impact of the crisis in France has affected different banking
groups in different ways, depending on their operational structure; yet, as IMF staff make
clear, the impact was softened by the solid performance in the first half of 2007 and strong
diversification of services and products, as well as the limited direct and indirect exposure of
major French banks to the subprime market. In particular, the overall solvency of the French
banking system remains satisfactory. With regard to the difficulties encountered by mutual
funds (paragraph 29), the staff report should specify that the amounts associated with funds

5
that have undergone closure or temporary trading suspension account for less than
0.5 percent of total assets under management.
The existing supervision model, which is relatively straightforward, has proven its
worth in the face of recent financial upheavals. In fact, in managing this crisis, close
cooperation between supervisory authorities and central banks has proven to be instrumental
in enhancing the effectiveness and credibility of government policy. France’s supervision
mechanism allows the supervisory authority to give the Bank of France prompt notification
of factors influencing bank behavior, which is essential in times of crisis. Furthermore,
market information, data on payment systems, as well as the statistics gathered by Bank of
France staff enable policymakers to make a more informed assessment of the dynamics of the
crisis. All in all, the close links between the two institutions allow for a better understanding
of the financial system’s vulnerability to credit and liquidity risks, and this partnership
enhances their capacity to assess the situation properly. This is particularly important for
understanding indirect risk—for example, risks associated with contagion effects.
One of the largest French banks, Société générale, has been the victim of a huge fraud. I
would like to make four comments. First, depositors and savers were protected; there was no
panic. Second, the bank’s capital will be restored to levels higher than those preceding the
fraud, thereby ensuring its financial soundness. Third, the stability and integrity of financial
markets have been preserved. Last but not least, there has been no recourse to government
money. The Minister of Economy has already submitted a report to the Prime Minister. In
particular, the authorities are seeking to strengthen internal controls of financial institutions,
to toughen regulations governing internal oversight of operational risk, to focus more intently
on the detection of internal fraud as a key component of internal supervision, and to ensure
the wholehearted involvement of senior and middle management of banks in risk control.
Even before the financial crisis, the French authorities were committed to improving
the competitiveness of Paris as an international financial center, as Fund staff make clear
(cf. paragraph 31). They have pursued vigorous and coordinated action with professionals in
order to bolster France as a firmly established, strong and well-structured financial center.
