Executive Summary
Economic Developments
•

Economic activity picked up in FY2005 (ending September 30). Real GDP growth is
estimated at 3½ percent, partly driven by a more expansionary fiscal stance, and to a
lesser extent, improvements in agriculture. Inflation is estimated to have risen to
3½ percent, reflecting higher oil prices.

•

The fiscal position deteriorated in FY2005 to an estimated deficit of 2 percent of
GDP, mainly owing to an underperformance of domestic revenue. The decline in
domestic revenue reflected a drop in nontax revenue because of lower fees and charges.
On the expenditure side, current expenditure was broadly unchanged, while capital
expenditure rose markedly in line with the disbursement of external grants and
implementation of previously-planned programs.

•

The current account surplus is estimated to have narrowed in line with a rise in
imports, stemming from higher economic activity. In addition, service receipts declined
with the closing of the tuna processing plant.

Policy Discussions
•

Over the longer term, fiscal and structural reforms are necessary to achieve
budgetary self-sufficiency. With the declines in grant funds under the amended Compact
of Free Association and the increase in debt service payments, the large government
sector will become increasingly unsustainable. A sizeable budget adjustment is needed to
build reserves in the trust fund that would allow real GDP growth to remain steady after
the grants end in 2023. This will also require the speedy implementation of structural
reforms. In this context, there is a need to improve the land registration procedure and to
clarify and update the legal framework for secured lending. In addition, efforts aimed at
simplifying regulations for domestic and foreign investors should be continued.

•

The government’s first priority should be to achieve a fiscal surplus in FY2006.
Given the size of the medium-term fiscal adjustment that is needed to achieve long-term
fiscal sustainability, consolidation should start immediately. In particular, tighter controls
on expenditure on goods and services and cuts to the wage bill are warranted. These
measures could provide substantial savings, leading to an overall fiscal surplus.

•

Steps have been taken to strengthen financial sector supervision, but additional
efforts are needed. In particular, the development bank should be placed under the
supervision of the Banking Commission and tighter controls and reporting requirements
for the shipping trust company are warranted. The Banking Commissioner should
monitor closely the consequences of the loss of correspondent banking relationship for
the Bank of Marshall Islands (BoMI), which by inhibiting its processing of foreign
transactions, has resulted in a large shift of demand deposit accounts from BoMI to the
remaining commercial bank, thereby reducing competition in the banking sector.

I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands consists of 29 low-lying atolls in the central
Pacific. The atolls are made up of over 1200 islets and 5 islands, totaling a land area of 70
square miles across a sea area of over 750,000 square miles. Over two-third of the
population, estimated at about 58,000, resides in the Majuro and Kwajalein atolls. The
country suffers from development constraints common to many small island economies—
such as a narrow production and export base, isolated geography, limited natural resources,
and vulnerability to external shocks.
2.
As in most Pacific island countries, the public sector plays a dominant role in the
economy of RMI, backed by generous external assistance (Box 1). Government
expenditure accounts for more than
GDP and Total Grant Flows

3.
After nearly a decade of growth following independence in 1986, economic
activity declined markedly in the mid-1990s. Real GDP per capita is estimated to have
fallen around 30 percent since FY1994. This

Sector Reform Program. Following a period
of fiscal consolidation in the late 1990s, economic growth picked up (Table 1). Over the past
five years, however, the reduction in civil service employment has been reversed. Also,
public debt and government loan guarantees, while currently manageable, are approaching
their 1990s levels when loan repayments exerted strain on revenues. Key human
development indicators are broadly commensurate with those in other lower-middle income
countries (Table 2).

-5-

Box 1. Marshall Islands: Comparison with other Compact Countries
The RMI, the Federated States of Micronesia
(FSM), and the Republic of Palau (all formerly
part of the U.S. Trust Territory of the Pacific
Islands) currently have Compact of Free
Association agreements with the United States.
While the three countries have similar
characteristics, with heavy reliance on official
grants and dollarization, cross-country
comparisons highlight notable differences among
them.
Compared with FSM, RMI has experienced
higher growth and currently has higher per capita
GDP. However, both RMI and FSM have lagged
Palau in terms of economic development, and a
large part of their population is still in the
subsistence sector. Compared with Palau, growth
in RMI’s private-sector employment has been
modest. The difference in economic
performances may be partly attributed to
geography: Palau is the closest of the three
countries to large Asian countries and receives
the largest number of international visitors. All
three countries have enjoyed price stability
during recent years, thanks to their use of the
U.S. dollar.
Regarding fiscal performance, the three countries
are characterized by low domestic revenue, high
dependence on grants, and large current
expenditure. As a share of GDP, RMI has an
average level of domestic revenue and the
smallest capital expenditures. The current level
of government debt is high, relative to the other
Compact countries, reflecting large concessionary
loans from the AsDB. Compared with the mid1990s, when RMI borrowed against future
Compact revenues, the level of external debt has
declined as a result of the 2001 repayment of
commercial debt, but remains substantially higher
than in the FSM and Palau.

4.
The amended Compact agreement extends U.S. financial support until 2023 with
grants declining steadily. The new agreement reflects a major change from the way past
funding has been delivered, mainly through the establishment of a trust fund, grants more
focused on key sectors, and enhanced accountability and monitoring. It also includes
provisions for the United States to retain access to Kwajalein Atoll, where there is a large
U.S. military base. A July 2005 review by the U.S. Government Accountability Office
(GAO) identified some shortcomings in the implementation of the agreement to date and
provided recommendations to overcome them, some of which are being addressed by both
the RMI and U.S. governments (Box 2).
5.
The looming phase-out of Compact grants underscores the need for policy
reform to avoid major setbacks—as in the mid-1990s. In the very near term, economic
activity is expected to improve temporarily, in part reflecting the one-off effects of bump-up
funds of the amended Compact and special capital-related grants. While the immediate
outlook is brightening from increased grant flows, policies will need to take on promptly the
longer-term challenge of channeling resources to advance economic self-reliance. In
particular, careful management of the grants, along with prudent fiscal policies and structural
reforms, will be needed to help lay the foundation for future sustained growth.
6.
At the conclusion of the last consultation in January 2004, Directors stressed that
public sector reform, improvements in infrastructure, health, and education, as well as
strengthened private sector development, were essential components of a viable economic
strategy for the Marshall Islands. They urged that these reforms be accelerated, but progress
to date has been limited.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
7.
Based on limited data, real output growth appears to have slowed sharply in
FY2003 and again in FY2004. Economic activity has been hampered by delays in
implementing an upgraded public works program and the closure of a large privately-owned
tuna processing plant because of financial

Box 2. Marshall Islands: Amended Compact of Free Association with the United States
The amended Compact went into effect on May 1, 2004, with the aim of continuing economic
assistance during FY2004-23. Its features are as follows:
•

Total funding. Funding of $42.7 million per
year in 2004 dollars (roughly 40 percent of
GDP at present) includes grants, trust fund
contributions, and audit funds. Grants will
decline by $0.5 million per year, while the
trust fund contribution is augmented by
$0.5 million per year. These amounts will be
partially adjusted for inflation until 2014, after
which grant funding will be fully adjusted for
inflation.

deducting Kwajalein rental payments and trust fund contributions from Compact flows.

•

Sector allocation. Grants target six specific sectors: education, health care, public infrastructure,
the environment, public sector capacity building, and private sector development, with priority
for education and health.

•

Trust fund. The amended compact provides for the establishment of a trust fund, which is meant
to ensure a sustainable source of revenue to replace grant assistance beginning in 2024. The RMI
was required to make a one-time contribution of $30 million to the trust fund. The initial
contribution from the United States (of $7 million) will be augmented annually.

•

Accountability and monitoring mechanisms. New procedures were introduced to enhance
financial accountability and economic management. A U.S.-RMI Joint Economic Management
and Financial Accountability Committee (JEMFAC) was established to approve grant allocations
and review performance outcomes and audits. The amended compact allows for the possibility
that the U.S. government could withhold funds in the case of noncompliance with grant terms and
conditions.

Other provisions of the amended Compact include:
•

Rental payments, funded separately from the Compact, for U.S. military use of the Kwajalein
Atoll through FY2066. The United States has the option to terminate payments as early as
FY2030, with advance notice of seven years, or to extend use through FY2086.

•

An extension through FY2023 of some federal education and disaster management services
received by RMI under the original Compact.

•

Immigration provisions were tightened slightly, with visitors to the United States now required to
show a passport.

GAO initial review of amended Compact found:
•

Progress has been made in the implementation of new funding and accountability requirements in
FY2004, but challenges remain mainly related to the agreement’s lack of assessment of the longterm impact of grants and the effective use of funds.

8.
CPI inflation remains subdued, tracking that of the United States. Inflation
picked up to 2.4 percent (year-on-year) in September 2004, and is expected to have risen to
3½ percent in FY2005, reflecting primarily higher fuel costs and, to a lesser extent, higher
alcoholic beverage prices following a rise in
import duties.
9.
The real effective exchange rate has
remained broadly stable, thanks to a low and
stable inflation differential with the United
States, the largest trading partner. In terms of
costs of doing business, especially for the
tourism industry, RMI is perceived as not
competitive relative to other destinations in
the Pacific, owing to its geographical
isolation, limited hotel facilities, and deficient
waste management.

imports relating to capital projects and the
closure of the tuna processing plant. There are no reliable statistics on remittances; however
staff estimate the net outflow to be large, reflecting the flow of Kwajalein rental receipts to
non-resident landowners.
11.
Gross external debt has risen despite the retirement of the government’s
commercial debt in FY2001 (Table 4). Outstanding debt, at nearly 70 percent of GDP, is
high, although about 60 percent of it is on concessional terms, primarily owed to the Asian
Development Bank. The remaining 40 percent is mainly owed by two utility companies—the
Marshall Islands Telecommunications Authority and the Marshalls Energy Company.
12.
The fiscal position deteriorated in FY2004 (Table 5). This deterioration reflects, on
the revenue side, a decline in grants aimed at infrastructure projects owing in part to delays in
initiating projects, lower income tax collection, and volatility in non-tax revenue. At the same
time, total expenditure increased with some shift in its composition from capital to current
expenditure. Spending on wages and goods and services continued to rise, contributing to the

-9-

worsening of the fiscal position, and has
reached 22½ percent of GDP in FY2004 (up
from 15½ percent of GDP in FY2000). The
rise in wages and salaries stemmed from
increases in the number of civil servants and
the harmonization of wage levels in the
Ministry of Education. In FY2005, the
government’s overall deficit is estimated at
2 percent of GDP, mainly stemming from an
underperformance of revenue collection. The
government has fully met its mandatory
contributions to the Compact Trust Fund,
amounting to $25 million in FY2003–2004,
and $5 million in FY2005–2006.

13.
The near-term outlook is brighter. Real growth is projected to be 4 percent in
FY2006, somewhat above trend, mainly due to higher public expenditure on capital projects.
Inflation is expected to rise to around 3 percent, owing to higher oil prices and the lingering
impact of increases in tariffs on tobacco and alcohol. The current account surplus (including
official grants) is projected to widen, reflecting further increases in official transfers.
Meanwhile, the fiscal deficit is expected to be eliminated, in part as a result of improvements
in tax collection and expenditure control.
14.
The main downside risks to the outlook stem from capacity constraints that
could lead to delays in grant disbursements and from high and volatile oil prices. To
date, the impact of higher oil prices appears to have been moderate, but it could dampen
growth going forward. Preliminary estimates suggest that a 10 percent increase in oil prices
could lower growth by 1 percentage point and reduce the current account balance by
¾ percent of GDP.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Medium-Term Framework
15.
To help promote longer-term sustainability, RMI will need to consolidate the
government sector and vitalize the private sector through structural and fiscal reforms.
Against this background, the policy discussions focused on: (i) the short-term policy
measures necessary to achieve fiscal surplus; (ii) the extent of fiscal adjustment required in
the medium term to offset the step-downs in the amended Compact grants; (iii) the reforms
vital to invigorate growth and employment in the private sector; and (iv) the efforts needed to
strengthen financial sector supervision. These areas of focus are consistent with past policy
dialogue with the Marshallese authorities (Box 3).

- 10 -

Box 3. Marshall Islands: Policy Dialogue in 2001 and 2003
The staff and the authorities have shared comprehensive views in the past about policy priorities.
But frequently the authorities have followed more moderate steps than recommended by the staff,
primarily owing to capacity constraints. The advice given in the last two consultations have been
broadly consistent with the points highlighted below.
Fiscal Policy
Fund recommendations: Fiscal consolidation, amounting to 4–5 percent of GDP, to build additional
reserves in the trust fund. To this end, one focus was on control of current expenditure — especially
on wages and goods and services; limiting capital expenditure to Compact priority areas; and raising
revenue by bolstering tax administration and broadening the tax base.
Policy Developments: The authorities acknowledged the need to build reserves and have taken
preliminary steps by retiring high-cost commercial debt and augmenting institutional capabilities.
Financial Sector Policy
Fund recommendations: Strengthen financial supervision by: (i) improving banking commission
data and information collection; (ii) placing the development bank under the supervision of the
banking commission; (iii) taking steps to remove RMI from the FATF money laundering list; and
(iv) agreeing to the IMF OFC Module 2 assessment.
Policy Developments: The authorities have made efforts to strengthen supervision, including the
banking commission conducting on- and off-site bank supervision. A number of decisive steps were
taken to discourage money laundering leading to RMI’s removal from FATF’s list in October 2002.
An IMF OFC Module 2 assessment was conducted in 2002.
Structural Reform
Fund recommendations: Remove key impediments to private sector development by clarifying
property and land tenure rights, changing existing minimum-wage legislation to increase wage
differentiation between skill levels, reducing extensive state involvement in business through
privatization, and reducing constraints on foreign investment.
Policy Developments: The authorities passed legislation to address land tenure issues, including the
establishment of Land Registration Authorities.
Statistical
Fund recommendations: Core economic data need to be compiled and reported on a timely basis as
serious deficiencies impede effective surveillance. Priority should be given to PFTAC’s
recommendations on statistical improvements, including joining the General Data Dissemination
System.
Policy Developments: The authorities have broadly agreed with these priorities, but little progress
has been made.

- 11 -

16.
The amended 20-year Compact agreement, which has been in force less than two
years, provides RMI an opportunity to achieve economic self-reliance. The medium-term
outlook remains uncertain and hinges on the authorities’ commitment to fiscal adjustment
and structural reform (Table 6). Growth is likely to falter over the medium term without
aggressive fiscal adjustment and structural reforms, owing to declining grant flows and
increasing external debt repayments. The longer the adjustment is delayed, the harder it will
be for RMI to adjust and achieve self-reliance.
B. Fiscal Adjustment
17.
The FY2006 budget – approved by Parliament in October – is likely to generate
a modest surplus, just under a ¼ percent of GDP. The improvement in the overall balance
is a result of a projected rise in revenue, owing in part to the large disbursement of special
infrastructure grants. Domestic revenue is also targeted to increase by 2¼ percent of GDP,
reflecting higher income tax revenue and a one-off increase in import duties. The budget
projects current expenditure to fall in relation GDP, owing mainly to a decline in goods and
services that is partly offset by increases in wages and salaries. Capital expenditure is
expected to increase markedly as a result of large inflows of external grants earmarked for
special projects, related in particular to the renovation of the Majuro airport.
18.
The staff commended the authorities for their
efforts to improve the current fiscal situation, but
urged the government to aim for a larger fiscal
surplus in FY2006. Staff strongly recommended that
consolidation begin immediately and that the government
should target a surplus of about 3 percent of GDP for this
year in line with medium-term fiscal sustainability. In
particular, staff urged that measures be taken to trim the
wage bill and to limit expenditure on goods and services
not linked to specific Compact funds. Such measures, as
shown in the table, could provide savings of about 3
percent of GDP.

The authorities recognized that fiscal consolidation is necessary. However, they
indicated that their immediate focus is to increase revenue in light of recent experience with
substantial shortfalls. In this context, they seek to modify the income tax structure and
restructure import duties. They also indicated that they are monitoring expenditure by
implementing quarterly budget limits. Staff suggested that the authorities consider trimming
expenditures by more than what they had incorporated in this year’s budget, especially the
wage bill, which had increased by 50 percent from FY2002 to FY2004. The authorities
expressed concern about the short-term adverse impact on growth. However, in the staff’s
view the large increase in capital related grants schedule for this fiscal year would help
mitigate the initial adverse effects.

- 12 -

20.
Staff argued that larger long-term fiscal adjustment is unavoidable, given the
decline in Compact funds and the increase in debt service payments. Staff urged the
government to establish a medium-term consolidation strategy and take concrete steps to
implement it as this would signal to the public the government’s commitment to put public
finances on sound footing and lay the foundation for private-sector growth. Without such
measures, growth is likely to decline as financing constraints would cause capital spending to
fall along with the step-down in external grant flows in real terms, necessitating a larger and
costly adjustment at a later date.
21.
An illustrative long-run scenario based on sound macroeconomic policies
underscores the importance of reforms (Annex I). This scenario, which was discussed
with the authorities, shows that a medium-term fiscal adjustment of about 3 percent of GDP
starting in FY2007 onward is needed to build reserves in the trust fund. Although the
adjustment seems large, it is 1–2 percentage points less than recommended in the past two
consultations, thanks to revised GDP figures and commitment of substantial contributions to
the Compact Trust Fund by Taiwan Province of China. Combining fiscal adjustment with
structural reform would help secure sustainability and improve the productive capacity of the
economy and allow real GDP growth to remain steady at around 2½ percent (in line with the
average of other Pacific islands), following a possible modest initial weakening of economic
activity as a result of the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus. Growth could be even higher if payoffs from structural reforms were higher, while the amount of the fiscal adjustment would be
lower.
22.
The authorities concurred with the staff’s view that the amended Compact
provided important opportunities to reorient fiscal policy. They acknowledged that the
endowments of the Compact trust fund were not aimed at fully replacing the grants, and
agreed that long-term growth could be hampered in the absence of fiscal adjustment. In
particular, they agreed that it is important to maintain budget surpluses and build reserves by
setting aside the budget surpluses in the trust fund. They also stressed their concern that debt
service payments could take up to 3–4 percent of GDP in the medium to long term. Staff
agreed that this debt servicing burden was indeed an issue, which as the baseline scenario in
Annex I shows, would require small surpluses to meet debt obligations.
23.
To achieve budgetary surpluses of 3 percent of GDP staff recommended that
expenditure-control measures in combination with additional revenue-enhancement
measures be adopted, including:
•

Reduction of the wage bill. Payroll expenditures, which now account for more than
40 percent of current expenditures, have expanded following the downsizing efforts
prior to FY2000. While some of this increase has been associated with Compactrelated projects, especially in the education sector, restoring payroll expenditure to
the levels envisioned under the AsDB Reduction in Force program could significantly
reduce current expenditure. In this context, staff strongly supported policies to reduce
the number of civil servants, including attrition and limiting recruitment to key areas.
The authorities concurred with the staff noting that they were awaiting concrete

- 13 -

recommendations from a technical assistance (TA) report on civil service reform,
which would guide their medium-term plan to reduce expenditure. The authorities
also indicated their immediate intention to enforce attrition of the government
workforce and to realign government wages.
•

Restrain public expenditure. Efforts are needed to limit increases in spending on
goods and services to priority sectors under the Compact. The authorities indicated
that in the short term expenditure would be reduced by 1 percent of GDP. In addition,
they stated that savings could be realized by closely monitoring transportation costs.

•

Measures to revive revenue growth. Staff welcomed the proposed changes in the
tax regime as spelled out in the FY2006 budget speech, including unifying import
duties and adjusting the income tax structure. However, staff also encouraged the
authorities to take further measures to broaden the tax base, bolster tax
administration, simplify the tax structure, and eliminate the cascading effects of sales
taxes. A more comprehensive reform of the tax system could be considered in the
medium term, perhaps through the introduction of a VAT or consumption tax.

24.
In addition to fiscal policy measures, fiscal management and governance should
be strengthened through greater expenditure control and planning and improved
revenue administration.
•

Fiscal management. There have been some improvements in this area, including the
set up of a medium-term budget and investment framework to meet the accountability
requirement of the amended Compact agreement. In light of wide fluctuations in both
revenue and expenditure, staff suggested that further strengthening of medium-term
planning, including improvements to financial control and reporting, and linking the
current year budget to the medium-term framework, could help the authorities
maintain fiscal sustainability. The authorities agreed with this suggestion and stated
that as a first step, they had initiated a quarterly budget allocation program to better
monitor expenditures.

•

Revenue administration. Progress is also being made in customs reform, but
decisive measures to improve governance and administration are needed, including
by implementing a data processing and customs management system. In this context,
staff supported the authorities’ intention to phase in, over the next two or three years,
the tax reform program based on improvements in revenue collection and
administration, including building a culture and operational capacity in enforcement
and compliance. Staff commended the authorities’ recent decision to centralize the
licensing of import of alcohol and tobacco.

•

Governance. Staff urged the government to avoid nontransparent quasi-fiscal
transactions, such as the FY2003 large trust fund deposit with the development bank,
which was then onlent to struggling businesses. This set of transactions was of
particular concern as there was a substantial risk that the loans would not be repaid.

- 14 -

25.
Staff strongly recommended prudent management of the Compact Trust Fund
in line with international best practices and the IMF Guide on Resource Revenue
Transparency, including through a sound, transparent, and accountable governance structure.
Furthermore, staff urged that budgetary saving be used to increase the endowment, especially
in light of uncertainty on revenue performance. The authorities noted that they were
disappointed by the delay in investing the trust fund, but welcomed the recent transfer of the
fund and the appointment of an asset manager. They indicated that the public disclosure of
reports on the Trust fund’s performance has not yet been decided.
C. Structural Reforms to Promote Private Sector Growth
26.
The authorities agreed with staff that private sector growth was key to economic
development. They explained that they are in the process of addressing a number of factors
that have impeded private sector development. In this regard, staff urged the authorities to
put priority on achieving progress in the following areas:
•

Human resources. Despite previous efforts to downsize public sector employment,
the government continues to be the largest employer. Public sector wages are higher
than those in the private sector, hampering labor mobility. In addition, government
wages tend to drive up private-sector wages and salaries. Staff recommended and the
authorities concurred that greater wage differentiation between skill levels be adopted
in the public sector. Furthermore, staff suggested that the minimum wage legislation
be reviewed with the objective of lowering the cost of doing business and reducing
distortions to the labor market. The authorities noted that their proposed restructuring
of the income tax structure, which would increase the initial level of taxable income,
in part addresses the minimum wage issue.

•

Role of the public sector. The government should limit direct and indirect subsidies,
which are mainly for copra and inter-island shipping, and move toward managing
public enterprises on a commercial basis. The authorities, in general, agreed that
subsidies needed to be reduced. They indicated that all exemptions on diesel fuel had
been eliminated except those related to electricity. In this context, staff welcomed the
recent changes in the electricity pricing mechanism to better reflect world energy
prices.

•

Private sector participation. Staff commended the recent efforts by the authorities
to involve the private sector in the reform program by holding outreach retreats and
recommended that these efforts be maintained. The authorities noted that they intend
to meet more regularly with the business community to share information about
government operations and address public concerns. They stated that they have
started this process, by holding discussions with the Chamber of Commerce to
highlight recent improvements in the customs area, including a program that has been
put in place for addressing problems such as smuggling.

- 15 -

•

Capacity constraints on implementation of infrastructure projects. The new
process for implementing capital projects and disbursing sectoral grants as required
under the amended Compact agreement has prompted the government to reform its
operations, policies, and priorities. Staff welcomed the progress made to extend
performance budgeting review beyond the “priority” ministries as required by the
amended Compact. Staff encouraged the authorities to continue these efforts to help
avoid delays in the implementation of capital projects and improve management
practices.

•

Restrictions on foreign investment. While some progress had been made in
streamlining the approval process for foreign investment, it is still often hampered by
limited access to land for development, administrative delays in processing the
needed licenses, and specific restrictions on permitted areas for foreign investment.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ plan to amend the Foreign Direct Investment Act in
the upcoming Parliamentary session, with measures that are conducive to private
sector participation, including streamlining the application process and clarifying
existing regulations to remove ambiguities and loopholes. These changes could
reduce the cost of doing business and help attract foreign business and eventually
contribute to growth and employment.

27.
The authorities acknowledged that progress had been slow on land tenure and
secure lending issues. Currently there are no official records that provide clear and legal
evidence of ownership or rights to land, leading to the possibility of disputes and creating
uncertainty for potential investors. Since Parliament passed legislation in 2003 to establish a
land registry little progress has been made. To date, only one land title has been issued while
four other cases are pending. While these measures go in the right direction, further efforts
are needed to increase land registration, including expanding outreach programs and possibly
lowering application costs, especially for residents of the outer atolls. In addition, RMI still
has no effective framework for secured lending against movable property. Clarifying and
updating the legal framework for secured lending would lower financial intermediation costs
and reorient bank lending toward the private commercial sector.
D. Financial Sector
28.
More decisive steps are needed to strengthen the RMI’s financial infrastructure
and harness domestic savings for financing growth. The lack of collateral and the
difficulties of foreclosing on defaulters have been significant impediments to business
lending. As a result, a significant proportion of commercial bank assets are held in deposits
overseas, and lending is concentrated on consumer loans. In addition, the recent loss of the
Bank of Marshall Island’s correspondent banking relationship, which inhibits its processing
of foreign transactions, has resulted in a large shift of demand deposit accounts from BoMI to
the remaining commercial bank, thereby reducing competition in the banking sector.
Although the short-run impact of this loss seems to be more of an inconvenience, there is a
risk that the longer-run impact could be to dampen bank lending if depositors shifted not only
demand deposits ($5 million to date), but also other funds away from BoMI to the Bank of

- 16 -

Guam, which tends to maintain only a small loan portfolio in RMI. Staff recommended that
the Banking Commission closely monitor the situation.
29.
More generally, staff recommended that financial sector supervision be further
strengthened. While the Banking Commission has begun on-site and off-site supervision,
additional steps are needed to continue to improve data and information collection. The
authorities concurred with the staff’s assessment that the development bank, which is
currently not subject to supervision and engages in a broad range of commercial lending
activities, should be placed under the supervision of the Bank Commission. While the RMI
has taken a number of decisive steps to discourage money laundering and the financing of
terrorism, including adopting a modern and comprehensive anti-money laundering law and
enforcing regulations, staff encouraged the tightening of controls and reporting requirements
for the shipping trust company, which is not currently subject to oversight, although it reports
to the Minister of Transport and Communication. Increased monitoring of the ship registry
would strengthen the efficacy of the AML/CFT regime and reduce potential risk to their
reputation.
E. Other Issues
30.
The RMI’s trade regime is relatively open. The general import duty is currently
8 percent with 5 percent applying to foodstuffs, although a number of products, mainly
luxury items such as cars, tobacco products and alcoholic beverages, are subject to other rates
ranging from 15 to 150 percent. The authorities indicated that changes to import duties to a
uniform rate of 6 percent, while maintaining high tariffs on luxury items and other selected
goods, will be considered in the next session of Parliament. Staff viewed this move to
simplify import duties as a step in the right direction, which could increase revenue. At
present, there are no quantitative restrictions on imports or other significant nontariff barriers
to trade, and RMI does not face any difficulties in accessing export markets. The RMI is a
member of the Pacific Forum, and is involved in ongoing discussions with the European
Union on a trade arrangement under the Economic Partnership Agreement. The RMI is
negotiating regional trade arrangements within the Pacific, including the Pacific Agreement
on Closer Economic Relations and the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement.
31.
There is a need to improve the reliability, coverage, and timeliness of economic
statistics for monitoring and policy evaluation. Staff commended the ongoing efforts to
improve data collection, especially in the area of budget monitoring and welcomed the recent
efforts to improve the national accounts data. Staff and the authorities concurred that the
statistical office would benefit from additional technical assistance to build capacity,
especially to maintain the national accounts system. In the longer term they would benefit
from help in refining the balance of payments estimates compiled by the Article IV mission
and hands on training with the compilation of the fiscal data in Government Financial
Statistic (GFS) format. The authorities stressed that they welcomed hands-on help that they
have currently received to develop capacity, rather than a list of areas that need improvement
without further guidance. They also stated that they understood the value of membership of

- 17 -

the GDDS project, but felt that there was little scope to devote resources to it without more
staff engaged in the office.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
The policy challenge for RMI is to advance economic self reliance, which will
require major, possibly painful, reforms. Given the anticipated declines in Compact grants
and increasing debt service payments, the large government sector will become increasingly
unsustainable. Thus, significant fiscal and economic reforms are needed over the medium
term to put public finances on a secure footing and encourage private sector development.
Prompt adjustment is necessary to avoid more serious fiscal strains. The longer the
adjustment is delayed the harder it will be for the country to adjust and achieve economic
self-reliance.
33.
In recent years, the authorities have taken steps to place RMI on the path to
sustainable development. Notably, the government has retired high-cost commercial debt
and built reserves in order to meet its mandatory contribution requirement to the Compact
Trust Fund. In addition, with the help of donors and multilateral agencies, the authorities
have begun to augment the government’s institutional capabilities, including fiscal
budgeting, management, and enhanced financial sector supervision. However, limited
progress has been made on many significant structural issues.
34.
In the short term, the government’s first priority should be to achieve a larger
fiscal surplus in FY2006. Given the size of the medium-term fiscal adjustment that is
necessary to achieve economic self-reliance, consolidation should begin immediately.
Ongoing revenue measures would ideally be complemented by action to reduce the wage bill
and limit increases in expenditure on goods and services not linked to specific Compact
funds. Such measures could provide budgetary savings of around 3 percent of GDP in
FY2006.
35.
In the medium term, budgetary surpluses of 3 percent of GDP per annum are
needed to ensure fiscal sustainability and allow real GDP growth to remain steady at
around 2½ percent (in line with the average of other Pacific islands). To achieve this
degree of consolidation requires substantial cuts in current expenditure in combination with
revenue enhancing measures. Policy measures should focus on limiting payroll expenditure
and other current expenditure to more sustainable levels. To safeguard core expenditures,
revenue measures should contribute to the medium-term adjustment. In this regard, staff
welcomed the proposed changes in tax regime as spelled out in the FY2006 budget speech.
Further measures should be implemented to revive revenue growth by broadening the tax
base, bolstering tax revenue, and simplifying the tax structure. It is also important that the
government avoid further external borrowing and efforts should be made to reduce external
debt, which is presently about 70 percent of GDP.
36.
In addition, improved fiscal management and governance are necessary. Steps
need to be taken to improve financial control and reporting, and linking the current year

- 18 -

budget to the medium-term framework. Also, decisive measures are necessary to improve
governance and administration, including implementing a new customs management system.
The recently established Compact Trust Fund needs to be managed in line with international
best practices, including through a sound, transparent and accountable governance structure.
37.
Structural reforms are essential to promote sustainable private sector growth.
The main focus for the authorities’ reform agenda should be the removal of obstacles for
private sector development in key areas. In this regard, further efforts to expand participation
in land registration are needed, such as conducting outreach programs and lowering
application costs. In addition, updating and clarifying the legal framework for secured
lending would also help lower intermediation costs and facilitate the reorientation of
commercial bank lending activities toward the private commercial sector. At the same time,
the government should take steps to foster greater wage differentiation between skill levels,
especially in the public sector.
38.
Measures are required to address current constraints on bank lending. In order
for the banking system to play a full role in the development of the economy, factors that
currently impede lending, including the difficulties of using land as collateral and of
foreclosing, need attention. In addition, the Banking Commission should monitor closely the
consequences of the loss of the correspondent banking relationship for the Bank of the
Marshall Islands, which is inhibiting the processing of foreign transactions and to some
extent has reduced competition in the banking sector. Although the short-run impact seems to
be more of an inconvenience, there is a risk that the longer-run impact could be to dampen
bank lending if depositors shifted funds away from BoMI to the Bank of Guam, which tends
to maintain only a small loan portfolio in RMI.
39.
Further efforts are needed to strengthen financial supervision. While the Banking
Commission conducts periodic on-site and off-site supervision of the two commercial banks,
additional steps are needed to improve data and information collection, including loan quality
and remittances. An important priority is to place the development bank under the
supervision of the Banking Commission, limiting permitted activities, and its focus should be
shifted from consumer loans to more traditional lending activities for a development bank.
Also, tighter controls and reporting requirements for the shipping trust company should be
put in place. Such a regime will strengthen the efficacy of the AML/CFT regime.
40.
Statistical deficiencies and lack of reporting to the Fund continue to impede
effective surveillance. There are deficiencies in fiscal, monetary, and external data, although
recent progress has been made on improving GDP statistics. Further efforts are needed to
improve data collection and dissemination.
41.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the 24month cycle. The authorities expressed interest in an interim staff visit.

ANNEX I

MARSHALL ISLANDS: LONG-RUN FISCAL ADJUSTMENT SCENARIOS
The assumptions in both illustrative scenarios are based on the economic provisions of the
amended Compact (outlined in Box 2).
Baseline
The authorities run a small surplus, necessary to meet debt obligations. Fiscal reserves remain at
very low levels, and the authorities make only modest headway in reducing expenditure and
increasing revenue. This reflects spending pressures from a growing population, difficulties in
reducing public expenditure in a society that is characterized by traditional relationships built on
the exchange of patronage, and an underdeveloped private sector. Current expenditure decreases
annually by about ¼ percent of GDP, forced essentially by financing constraints. Revenue
growth lags real GDP growth by ½ percentage point, roughly in line with the tax elasticity of the
past decade.
Fiscal expenditure shrinks over the medium term as grant inflows decline. The burden of
adjustment falls mostly on capital spending—including infrastructure maintenance—leading to
weaker growth. At the end of the Compact, the RMI draws the entire annual returns from the
trust fund, causing the fund to begin to decline in real terms. Initially, the real GDP growth rate is
2¼ percent per annum, but it gradually falls to zero as government expenditure declines and
private sector growth remains anemic.
Adjustment
The authorities pursue an adjustment strategy including: concerted expenditure control, improved
tax administration and reform, and enhanced fiscal management and governance; public
investment in priority areas, especially health, education, and infrastructure; and limited
withdrawals from the trust fund to maintain its real value after FY2023.
A budget surplus of about 3 percent of GDP is targeted from FY2006 onward. Despite reduced
Compact inflows, the government is able to build sizeable reserves while maintaining capital
expenditure at near 10 percent of GDP. It is notable that the government’s commitment to build
reserves in the trust fund during the past four years has been supported by the public. This
secures long-term fiscal sustainability, improves the productive capacity of the economy, and
allows real GDP growth to remain steady at around 2½ percent (in line with the average of other
Pacific islands).
There are other ways to reach this same outcome. For example, another alternative adjustment
strategy—based on lower surpluses in the near to medium term owing to even higher capital
expenditure than the 10 percent of GDP assumed in the adjustment scenario (primarily financed
through Compact grants)—could possibly deliver higher growth in the long run and hence help
maintain the real value of the trust fund after 2023. However, the returns on such an investment,
like human capital, could take years to materialize and are difficult to quantify, especially in light
of the substantial migration flows of higher-skilled workers to the United States. Following such
a strategy could be a missed opportunity to save and build reserves for longer-term sustainability
and stability.

MARSHALL ISLANDS: RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTRE1
The PFTAC’s assistance to the RMI has mostly focused on financial supervision and public
expenditure management. Most of the assistance was provided prior to 2003 and there have been
no missions to RMI in the last two years. The RMI sent officials to regional seminars and
workshops, and the PFTAC organized one secondment in banking supervision.
Public Financial Management
There was a heavy concentration of missions in the period prior to 2003. An ongoing action plan
was developed covering basic improvements from a very low base included a timetable for
budget preparation, enhanced internal consistency of numbers, and a simple medium-term
budgeting framework. However, implementation of the action plan has slipped and other donors
have now become involved in the reform process.
Tax Administration and Policy
In July 2003, PFTAC designed a modernization strategy and action plan for customs, including
improvements to the Customs Act, automation, compliance units, and training. No progress was
made on those reforms. The authorities have recently shown renewed interest in tax reforms and,
if requested, PFTAC will provide resources to assess the revenue system, design a tax
administration modernization plan, and review exemptions.
Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
The Centre provided substantial hands-on training to the two previous Banking Commissioners,
covering both on-site and off-site inspections. The last Commissioner benefited from attendance
at two PFTAC-sponsored regional conferences on banking supervision, and participated in a
course run by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board in 2002. Following involvement with the Offshore
Financial Centers assessment in 2002, PFTAC provided assistance to draw up a program to better
comply with the Basel Core Principles and also guided the RMI during the closure of a foreign
bank’s branch operations.
Economic and Financial Statistics
An August 2002 review of the statistical system recommended an increase in staffing and
proposed a two-year work program. Statistical work was then integrated into the new Economic
Policy, Planning and Statistics Office. A June 2003 update recommended the use of an external
advisor and further efforts to recruit and train staff for the unit as donor agencies, including the
U.S. Census Bureau, need more and better-trained counterpart staff to make further progress. A
website, hosted by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), for disseminating statistics
was established but the RMI has not yet implemented PFTAC’s recommendation to join the
GDDS.

Pacific Regional Strategy FY2006-2009, May 2005.
Embarking on a Global Voyage: Trade Liberalization and
Complementary Reforms in the Pacific, September 2002.

Since becoming a World Bank Group member in May 1992, the Marshall Islands has
received a grant of US$150,000 from the Institutional Development Fund. The fund was
approved in May 1993 to assist the Presidential Committee on the rationalization of the
public service. The prepared report detailing an action plan for public sector reform was
accepted by the Government, and the recommendations were implemented in joint assistance
with the UNDP.
The Bank’s fifth biennial Regional Economic Report for its Pacific Island member countries,
including Marshall Islands, was issued in September 2002. The report focuses on the efforts
of Pacific Island Countries to integrate more closely with the global economy. It evaluates
their strategy to enter into a regional trade agreement, and analyzes the interaction of trade
liberalization with complementary reforms in taxation, and the public sector.
The new Pacific Regional Strategy, which covers the Marshall Islands, will direct the Bank’s
work in the region from 2006-2009. It focuses on creating an environment conducive to
generating sustainable economic growth and employment, while recognizing that small
populations and marked remoteness of the Pacific island countries pose significant
development challenges to the region. The Bank seeks to play a selective role in the Marshall
Islands, focusing on policy advice to leverage donor resources and build local capacity.
The Marshall Islands is an IBRD-eligible country.

ANNEX V

MARSHALL ISLANDS: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) has approved eleven loans totaling about
US$78.1 million to the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) since it joined the Bank in
April 1990.
In November 2000, the AsDB approved the Skills Training and Vocational Education Project
for US$6.8 million, to help implement a national skills training system. This loan is due to
close at the end of August 2005.
In May 2001, the AsDB approved a US$12 million Fiscal and Financial Management
Program to: (i) ensure a sustainable income flow for future generations; (ii) strengthen public
sector financial and economic management; (iii) stabilize the fiscal position; (iv) enhance the
policy environment for the private sector; and (v) improve the effectiveness of the public
service. The program was supported by a package of technical assistance (TA), and the loan
and TA closed on schedule during the second quarter of 2004.
In November 2002, the AsDB approved the Outer Island Transport Infrastructure Project for
US$7 million, aimed at improving the safety, frequency, and reliability of shipping and
transport services in the outer islands. Though subject to some delays this project has now
commenced.
In October 2003, the AsDB approved an advisory technical assistance for improving the
performance of Economic Policy, Planning, and Statistics office. This TA was extended to
July 2005.
In November 2003, the AsDB approved a project preparatory technical assistance for youth
social services. This TA was due for completion in September 2005. The Government has
decided to forgo ADB loan funds and to use its own funds to finance a new agency that will
contract out the provision of welfare and other services to youth at risk to non-government
service providers.
In November 2004, the AsDB approved an advisory technical assistance to help improve the
environment for private sector development. Continued assistance to the Land Registration
Authority, the establishment of a Commercial Registration Authority, a study of the status
and trends of land tenure, and continuation of the administrative barriers working group are
all components of this TA.
In December 2004, the AsDB approved an advisory technical assistance to assess the
ownership and demand for improved education through extensive, informed, and facilitated

participatory processes. This is a pilot exercise designed to test the demand for civil service
reform. The project was due to be completed by end August 2005.
As of end December 2004, TA grants totaling US$18.0 million for 46 TA projects have been
approved. These comprise both project preparatory and advisory TA. Project preparatory TA
has focused on public sector reform, fisheries, education, health, water, sanitation, youth, and
outer island infrastructure, whereas advisory TA has focused on institutional development,
policy reforms, and capacity building.
The overall framework for the AsDB country strategy for the RMI is set out in Pacific
Strategy, 2005 to 2009, Responding to the Priorities of the Poor. The country strategy for the
RMI was updated in 2004 in a fully participatory manner engaging representatives of civil
society as well as government in formulating a new strategy. The new strategy is aligned
with the Strategic Results Areas of the new regional strategy. In this regard, the AsDB will
help RMI to improve the environment for private sector business, help improve the
productivity of public service delivery, and in support of both these objectives, help
strengthen governance, most especially policy formulation.
AsDB published a Pacific Island Economic Report on the RMI in 2001 known as Meto 2000.
This is currently being updated. In March 2003, AsDB also published a participatory
assessment of poverty under the title “Priorities of the People, Hardship in the Marshall
Islands.” Over the past twelve months, AsDB has funded a series of four retreats between
representatives of elected and executive leadership of the RMI, USDOI, leaders of civil
society, and officials of AsDB. These retreats have focused on overall development, and
particularly on private sector development and tax policy.

ANNEX VI

MARSHALL ISLANDS: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Economic and financial data provided to the Fund suffer from serious shortcomings that hamper
surveillance. A new Economic Policy, Planning, and Statistics Office (EPPSO) was established
in February 2003 to collect and disseminate statistical data. However, EPPSO still lacks qualified
statistical staff and the capacity to produce timely data. The publication of the Quarterly Bulletin
of Statistics was resumed in June 2003, containing mainly CPI data. Other quarterly and monthly
statistical data are not published or transmitted to the Fund. Extensive Fund technical assistance
has been provided from headquarters and the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre, but
many recommendations have not been implemented. The authorities have expressed an interest in
participating in the IMF General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). The Marshall Islands
would then be eligible for follow-up technical assistance under the Pacific Regional GDDS
project funded by Japan.
Real Sector
Preliminary national income accounts (the latest data through 2004) have been prepared by an
AsDB consultant on an institutional approach with data going back to 1997. Shortcomings with
these data remain, especially with the deflators to create real GDP, operating surpluses, and
employment data sources, but these estimates represent an improvement over earlier estimates.
Previously the data were prepared on a production basis since 1991. The new consumer price
(CPI) index rebased in 2003 replaced the CPI index developed in the 1980s. The updated CPI is
based on information from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2002, conducted with
assistance from the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Census Bureau.
Government Finance
Fiscal data are regularly compiled for budget control, but they are not consolidated into a format
suitable for analysis. The authorities received technical assistance on budgetary accounting
in 1994 and 2001. The Marshall Islands do not report Government Finance Statistics for
publication in the GFS Yearbook and IFS.
Monetary Accounts
A reporting system has been established for domestic banking institutions on the basis of
monthly reporting forms and guidelines developed by the 1993 STA mission. Even though data
are reported by banks to the Banking Commissioner, they are not published or reported to the
Fund. In March 2005, STA held a regional seminar at the Singapore Training Institute to
introduce the standardized report forms for monetary statistics but unfortunately Marshall Islands
officials did not participate.
Balance of Payments
Balance of payments data are not compiled, although technical assistance has been provided in
this area. Compilation of import statistics has been hampered, mainly due to backlogs in data
entry, and inappropriate classification and coding. With no compulsory reporting, export
statistics are incomplete. Only limited data are available on services, factor income, and private
transfers, and there are no data on private capital flows.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of the Marshall Islands
On February 15, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of the Marshall Islands.1
Background
The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), a small Pacific island country, is heavily dependent
on external assistance. Government expenditure accounts for more than 70 percent of GDP,
and about 50 percent of government revenue consists of external grants, mainly from the United
States. Consequently, overall economic activity is highly correlated with government
expenditure and external grant flows. The private economy remains underdeveloped,
primarily providing services to the government, with small contributions from agriculture, fishery,
and tourism.
After nearly a decade of growth following independence in 1986, economic activity declined
markedly in the mid-1990s. Real GDP per capita is estimated to have fallen around 30 percent
since FY1994. This was a result of declining grant flows and the need to retire external public
debt incurred through external commercial borrowing by the government against future
Compact revenues. The weak economy reportedly fostered emigration to the United States,
as citizens need only a valid passport to work there, and forced large expenditure cuts in part
through the implementation of the Asian Development Bank Public Sector Reform Program.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2Following a period of fiscal consolidation in the late 1990s, economic growth picked up.
Over the past five years, however, the reduction in civil service employment has been reversed.
Also, Public debt and government loan guarantees, while currently manageable,
are approaching their 1990s levels when loan repayments exerted strain on revenues.
The amended Compact agreement extends U.S. financial support until 2023 with grants
declining steadily. The new agreement reflects a major change from the way past funding has
been delivered, mainly through the establishment of a trust fund, grants more focused on key
sectors, and enhanced accountability and monitoring. It also includes provisions for the United
States to retain access to Kwajalein Atoll, where there is a large U.S. military base.
Based on limited data, real output growth appears to have slowed sharply in FY2003 and again
in FY2004. Economic activity has been hampered by delays in implementing an upgraded
public works program and the closure of a large privately owned tuna processing plant because
of financial difficulties, leading to an estimated loss of 500 jobs. Civil service employment
appears to have increased, primarily as a result of increased spending on education and health
in line with the amended Compact agreement. Nevertheless, overall growth in employment
continues to fall short of labor supply, and unemployment, especially for school-leavers,
has increased above 30 percent. Real growth is expected to have picked up in 2005,
reflecting an expansionary fiscal stance and, to a lesser extent, improvements in agriculture.
The current account surplus narrowed in FY2004, largely reflecting delays in official transfers.
The trade balance improved slightly as export growth continued at trend, driven mainly by
increases in the re-export of diesel fuel associated with the fishing transshipment base in
Majuro, while imports were moderately lower reflecting lower spending on capital project-related
imports. In FY2005, the current account surplus is estimated to have narrowed further, in part
as a result of higher imports relating to capital projects and the closure of the tuna processing
plant. There are no reliable statistics on remittances; however staff estimate the net outflow to
be large, owing to the Kwajalein landowners investing their rental receipts abroad.
The fiscal position deteriorated in FY2004. This deterioration reflects, on the revenue side,
a decline in grants aimed at infrastructure projects owing in part to delays in initiating projects,
lower income tax collection, and volatility in non-tax revenue. At the same time,
total expenditure increased with some shift in its composition from capital to current
expenditure. Spending on wages and goods and services continued to rise contributing to the
worsening of the fiscal position, and has reached 22½ percent of GDP in FY2004, up from
15½ percent of GDP in FY2000. The rise in wages and salaries stemmed from increases in the
number of civil servants and the harmonization of wage levels in the Ministry of Education.
Over the two years FY2003-04, the government met its mandatory contributions to the Compact
Trust Fund, amounting to US$25 million. In FY2005, the government’s overall deficit is
estimated at 2 percent of GDP, mainly stemming from an underperformance of revenue
collection.

-3-

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the steps taken by the authorities to move the Marshall Islands
toward lasting growth, including steps to improve fiscal sustainability through the retirement of
high-cost commercial debt, and by building reserves to meet its mandatory contribution
requirement to the Compact Trust Fund. While commending progress made in strengthening
the government’s institutional capacity, Directors underscored that, given the anticipated
declines in Compact grants and prospective increases in debt-service payments, further fiscal
and structural reforms are needed to advance to economic self-reliance.
With growth projected to pick up in the near term, it was emphasized that actions to achieve a
larger fiscal surplus than budgeted in FY2006, consistent with medium-term fiscal sustainability,
should be given priority. Directors stressed the importance of restraining current expenditures,
especially on wages, and goods and services not linked to specific Compact funds, and further
measures to enhance the revenue base. Some Directors, while recognizing the magnitude of
the medium-term fiscal challenge, considered that an abrupt fiscal contraction could weigh on
economic growth, and proposed that, with the support of the Fund’s staff, the authorities could
develop a program for the medium term that would avoid high upfront impact on employment.
Directors underscored the need to maintain substantial fiscal surpluses over the medium term in
order to ensure fiscal sustainability and to avoid the further accumulation of external debt. In this
regard, most Directors welcomed the tax measures proposed in the FY2006 budget speech,
and observed that additionally broadening the tax base and simplifying the tax structure will be
needed to revive revenue growth. On the expenditure side, while calling on the authorities to
reduce outlays, Directors stressed the importance of protecting core expenditure.
Directors underlined the need to improve fiscal management and governance.
They encouraged the authorities to strengthen the budgetary process by linking the current year
budget to the medium-term framework. In addition, Directors called on the authorities
to decisively improve governance and administration by implementing a new customs
management system and managing the Compact Trust Fund in line with international best
practices. They urged the authorities to avoid nontransparent quasi-fiscal operations.
Directors observed that the exchange regime, with the U.S. dollar as the sole legal tender,
has imparted monetary stability, with domestic inflation largely mirroring that of the United
States. Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to an open trade regime, and
welcomed the prospective participation of the Marshall Islands in regional trade arrangements.
Looking ahead, Directors underscored the critical importance of structural reforms to promote
lasting private sector-led growth. In this regard, they noted that further efforts are needed to
expand participation in land registration and to clarify the legal framework for secured lending,
in order to help lower intermediation costs and facilitate the reorientation of commercial bank
lending activities toward the private commercial sector. In addition, Directors encouraged steps
to foster greater wage differentiation across skill levels, especially in the public sector.

-4-

Directors urged the authorities to step up efforts to address current constraints on bank lending,
allowing the banking system to play a full role in the development of the economy. In this
connection, they encouraged the Banking Commission to address the consequences of the loss
of the correspondent banking relationship for one of the major banks, which currently inhibits
the processing of foreign transactions and could dampen future bank lending.
Directors called for further efforts to strengthen financial supervision. They welcomed recent
progress made by the Banking Commission in on-site and off-site bank examination,
while noting that additional steps are needed to improve data and information collection,
including loan quality and remittances. Directors called for the development bank to be placed
under the supervision of the Banking Commission, with tighter controls and with activities limited
to those traditional for a development bank. Directors urged further strengthening of the
AML/CFT regime, including through tighter controls and reporting requirements for the shipping
trust company.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve the reliability, coverage, and timeliness of
statistics to enhance monitoring and policy evaluation. They supported the authorities’ request
for additional technical assistance.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the
IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV
consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of
post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program
engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters,
unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report for the 2005
Article IV Consultation with the Marshall Islands is also available.

Statement by Richard Murray, Alternate Executive Director
for Republic of the Marshall Islands
and Byung-Hee Seong, Advisor to Executive Director
February 15, 2006
Key Points
•

The RMI remains highly dependent on external aid and is characterized by the
dominant public sector with limited private sector development.

•

My authorities plan to introduce further fiscal reform measures to help lay the
groundwork for more sustainable growth.

•

Private sector development will be a major component of the long-term strategies for
stable economic growth.

•

My authorities value highly the Fund’s support in capacity building activities in the
Marshall Islands.

The Republic of the Marshall Islands wishes to express its appreciation to the Fund and its
staff for the production of a well-structured report, successfully highlighting the country’s
general characteristics, its economic status, and the challenges it faces. The studies in the
Selected Issues Paper address issues of contemporary economic importance and provide
helpful insights on challenges to long-term economic self-reliance. My authorities value
highly the Fund’s contribution to the economic policy dialogue and its support in capacitybuilding activities in the Marshall Islands.
My authorities are also deeply grateful for the ongoing support from the international
community and, in particular, from the United States (US). The relationship with the US is
significant, valued and long term, and is not only evident in financial support through the
amended Compact of Free Association with the United States but in capacity building and
other areas such as people flows. The operation of the Compact itself brings a degree of
capacity building, such as in the requirements for procurement and tendering processes.
The RMI remains highly dependent on external aid and the public sector is dominant
while private sector development is limited.
The RMI is made up of 29 coral atolls and five single islands scattered across an exclusive
economic zone of nearly 1 million square miles, and has been independent only since 1986.
As staff note, a significant proportion of the government budget remains externally funded,
primarily by the US. For some key sectors, reliance on US support has increased in recent
years, especially with new financial backing under the amended Compact. For example, the
US funded 68 percent of the recurrent education budget in FY1999 and in FY2006 this will
increase to 88 percent. For health, the US share has increased from 42 to 53 percent over the
same period. The public sector remains the major source of economic activity. As of 2005,

-2the government sector, inclusive of state owned enterprises (SOEs) accounted for
approximately 40 percent of GDP and some 41 percent of total formal sector employment.
My authorities recognize that the current size of the public sector is not sustainable, given the
impending fiscal pressures.
The private sector is not thriving in terms of employment, contribution to GDP, or revenues.
With the closure of the tuna loining plant in late 2004, net private sector employment growth
has been flat and minimal. In terms of its share of overall GDP, the private sector has fallen
from 36.6 percent to 35.6 percent since 2000. Growth in aggregate gross business revenues
has also been flat to minimal in real (inflation adjusted) terms over time.
The RMI is well aware that this is neither desirable nor sustainable given the unsuccessful
experiment with state-led development in the past and the impending fiscal pressures of the
future. My authorities are mindful of the fact that the challenges facing the RMI and its
people in 2006 and beyond, are neither easy nor quick to overcome.
Some achievements have been made
The RMI has made progress in a number of areas. The RMI, under the amended Compact,
has established a national trust fund, Compact Trust Fund (CTF), that will help provide some
stability to the long-term fiscal balance. My authorities have met the requirement to
contribute to the CTF, $30 million, or over 20 percent of GDP in 2005. Second, the RMI
successfully reformed its social security administration, transforming it from one of the worst
run social security programs in the Pacific to one that is now healthy and performing well.
Third, the RMI has made strong advances in its health management system, improving onisland diagnostic capabilities and significantly reducing its off-island referrals costs. Fourth,
the establishment of the Economic Policy, Planning, and Statistics Office (EPPSO) has
strengthened policy and planning capabilities, including improved collection, analysis and
dissemination of data. Above and beyond these specific accomplishments, the RMI has
maintained strong political and social stability.
The economy has started to show signs of improvement
The economy has started to show signs of development in recent years as the Government
begins to reap the benefits of a prudent fiscal policy put in place since 2004. Estimates of
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) show promising signs of growth in the economy. While
these growth figures are promising, most of this growth reflects the impacts of the bump-up
in funding after the end of the first 15 years of the Compact and the one-off impact of the
injections of grant funds under the amended Compact. The public sector has grown as these
revenues have come into the Government’s budget and the challenge now is to translate this
into sustainable growth in the private sector in the medium to long term. It is anticipated that
substantial infrastructure developments planned in 2006 will help to kick-start this process
while taxation reforms in the pipeline and further improvements in the business environment
will help to place this growth on a sustainable path.

-3Repayment efforts will be maintained, but debt service payments will be a considerable
burden to the RMI in the medium- to long-term
Recent policy analysis from EPPSO has reviewed the government’s debt situation. The
Government’s debt situation while manageable, is again approaching levels of concern
experienced in the 1990s when bond repayments absorbed most of the Compact revenues.
By 2001, commercial debt had been eliminated but during the 1990s the Government had
acquired other debts by taking a number of AsDB Loans on concessional terms. The AsDB
lending, while heavily concessional, is not cost-free. This is becoming apparent with the
ramping up of repayments of much of the AsDB lending in the 1990s as the grace periods
expire. This will place increasing pressure on the Government’s fiscal situation over the next
five years and beyond.
My authorities plan to introduce further fiscal reform measures to help lay the
groundwork for a more sustainable growth
My authorities recognize the need for fiscal consolidation and the magnitude of the fiscal
challenge ahead of them, which is well-captured in staff’s long-run scenarios set out clear
and concise in Annex I. The scenario suggests that a medium-term fiscal adjustment of about
3 percent of GDP starting in FY2007 is needed to build reserves in the Trust Fund. They
acknowledge the need to maintain budget surpluses and set aside the surpluses in the Trust
Fund. My authorities firmly stand committed to prudent fiscal policy through improving the
tax system and prioritizing expenditures in a consistent and plausible manner. On the other
hand, we do not consider an abrupt fiscal contraction of almost 5 percent of GDP in 2006 to
be a sensible economic or policy strategy to address a medium-term issue, especially at a
time when restoration of a reasonable rate of economic growth is a high priority.
My authorities are looking to improve the country’s revenue raising capability through
simplification and streamlining to improve efficiency. The goal is to maintain revenues in the
short-term but to encourage economic activity in the long-term. The 2006 budget which
includes income tax restructuring and import tax simplication will take some initial steps in
this direction. Modifying the income tax structure aims at relieving the heavy burden on
low-income earners by restructuring the income tax regime to improve fairness. The intent
of the review of import duties is to simplify administration while minimizing government’s
loss of revenue.
My authorities are committed to further tax reform to enhance administration of the current
tax regime, including future import duty restructuring. They have initiated a dialogue with
the private sector and civil society about ways that this might be approached. Consultations
have raised serious issues regarding administration that the Government is already addressing
through, among other things:
•

implementation of taxation and customs management information systems;

•

recruitment of auditors and the introduction of a regular tax auditing program
supported by training; and

•

increased penalties and prosecution through regulatory and legislative changes.

-4My authorities are well-aware that their personnel expenditures need to be restrained if they
are to attain an appropriate fiscal balance. Growth in the Government’s payroll is
unsustainable and appears to be crowding out employment in the private sector. To keep
these costs under control, an internal personnel audit will be undertaken to verify positions,
salaries, and attendance among other things. Complementing this, the Government will
establish a more rigorous monitoring system for public service employees to improve the
budgeting process, given that such a large proportion of the Government’s budget is
consumed by personnel expenditures. In an effort to rationalize government spending
patterns, they are allocating ministry and agency spending based on a quarterly allotment
instead of annual allotment from fiscal year 2006 onward. They also are waiting for concrete
recommendations from a technical assistance (TA) report on civil service reform, which
would help guide their medium-term plan to reduce expenditure.
My authorities believe that private sector development will be a major component of
the long-term strategies for stable economic growth
Recent analyses into private sector development offer numerous suggestions on how to create
a more enabling environment for private sector growth. My authorities are well cognizant of
the need to rationalize state involvement in the economy (via reform and privatization of
state-owned enterprises), improve financing for growth and entrepreneurship, provide the
necessary regulatory infrastructure that provides policy certainty, strengthen institutions
(including improving access to land), lower business costs, and improve enforcement of
(debt) contracts. They acknowledge that little progress has been made on the land registry
since the establishment of the Land Registration Authority in 2003. As in many Pacific
Island countries, land tenure is still a complicated and indigenous issue in terms of collective
ownership. They welcome the staff’s suggestions for expanding outreach programs and
lowering application costs, and will take this advice into consideration in their own policy
deliberations. They will maintain their efforts to enhance private sector participation by
holding outreach retreats and regular dialogue with the private sector. In order to attract
more foreign investment, my authorities also plan to amend the Foreign Direct Investment
Act in the next Parliamentary session.
In order to increase the trade openness of the economy, the RMI is negotiating regional trade
arrangements within the Pacific, including the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic
Relations (PICTA) and the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PACER). The RMI is
also a member of the Pacific Forum and is actively participating in the Pacific Plan for
Strengthening Regional Cooperation and Integration in the context of economic growth,
sustainable development, good governance and security.
Despite some improvement of financial sector supervision, further efforts are needed
for strengthening supervision
The financial sector in the RMI is small and, for a variety of reasons, credit has been
increasingly concentrated in the form of relatively small consumer loans, for which there is
strong demand. Banking supervision has been fortified in the past couple of years with the
provision of additional resources to the Banking Commissioner and the commencement of
on-site and off-site bank examinations. As staff note, further improvements are still needed

-5and this will be a continuing process as local staff gain experience. They are grateful for the
extensive technical assistance provided in this area.
My authorities share staff’s concerns on the consequences of the loss of the corresponding
banking relationship for the Bank of the Marshall Islands. They take note of a possible longterm risk to bank lending and will pay due attention to the situation. Regarding the
development bank, my authorities concur with the staff’s assessment and believe that the
Fund’s advice on the proper design of a development bank, including the operation of the
Board as well as the supervisory framework, would be helpful against the background of its
expanding consumer and commercial loan portfolio.
The RMI has implemented AML/CFT measures and was removed from the FAFT’s list in
October 2002. The Fund has given clear advice of the need to further strengthen the
AML/CFT framework, which my authorities will need to address.
My authorities value highly the Fund’s support in capacity-building activities in the
Marshall Islands
My authorities remain committed to further improvement in data collection and
dissemination. While some progress has been made in strengthening the statistical data base
in the RMI, significant efforts are still needed for effective surveillance, especially in
national accounts statistics, and fiscal, monetary, and external data. My authorities welcome
hands-on help for building capacity and request continued technical assistance in the areas of
expertise of the Fund, especially in the areas of fiscal management and audit. Furthering the
tax reform agenda may also require Fund support.
For the first time since joining the Fund in 1992, my authorities indicate that they consent to
the Fund’s publication of the Staff Report and the Selected Issues Paper.
