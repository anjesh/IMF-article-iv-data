•

Discussions. A staff team held discussions in Nassau during April 26–May 6. The team
met with Acting Prime Minister Pratt and her cabinet, other senior officials, and
representatives from the political opposition, labor unions, and the business and financial
sector.

•

Team. W. Lewis (Head), M. Dehesa, A. Faria, and E. Verreydt (all WHD). M. Kruger
(OED) attended key meetings.

•

Previous consultation. At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation on
July 2, 2003, Directors stressed the need to consolidate the fiscal position, raise
international reserves, and diversify the economic base. They recommended a gradual
move toward a more flexible and market-oriented framework for liquidity and credit
management.

•

Effectiveness of past surveillance. The authorities have generally agreed with the
Fund’s policy advice, particularly as regards the further strengthening of the supervisory
and regulatory framework for the financial sector, maintaining an adequate level of
international reserves, and the need for fiscal prudence. Directors have noted in past
Article IV consultations the need to overhaul the tax structure and reverse the decline in
the tax-to-GDP ratio by reducing tax exemptions, lowering import duty rates, and
introducing a value-added tax. However, the authorities have not succeeded in building a
domestic consensus for rapid progress in the areas of tax reform and trade policy. Also,
Directors have urged private sector participation in key public utilities and infrastructure
sectors, but progress in this area has been limited.

•

Fund relations. The Bahamas has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange system that is free
of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions (Appendix I). The Bahamas participates in the GDDS, and its metadata are
posted on the Fund’s Data Standards Bulletin Board.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

Growth. Real GDP growth increased to 3 percent and unemployment declined
in 2004 as the tourism sector began to turn around, despite two strong hurricanes in
September 2004.

•

Fiscal performance. The fiscal deficit remained above 3 percent of GDP during
FY 2003/04, and declined to 2½ percent of GDP in FY 2004/05, mainly reflecting
revenue effort. However, the debt-to-GDP ratio has continued to rise.

•

Monetary policy. Net international reserves (NIR) increased steadily to reach
117 percent of base money at end-March 2005. In response, the central bank relaxed
credit controls in August 2004. Reflecting the build-up of NIR, free bank reserves
rose strongly in the last quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.

•

Financial sector. Steps have been taken to implement the recommendations of the
report of the Module 2 assessment of the offshore financial center, including the
closure of “shell” banks and the establishment of a commission to determine how best
to consolidate regulatory functions.

•

Medium-term outlook. Large-scale investment in the tourism sector is expected to
provide a stimulus to growth in 2005–06, but fiscal measures are needed to avoid
larger fiscal deficits and a marked rise in the debt ratio by 2010.

Policy discussions
•

Fiscal targets and the budget for FY 2005/06. Although the authorities are
committed to lowering the government debt ratio to 30 percent over the next five
years, the budget proposal for 2005/06 would allow the deficit to rise to almost
3 percent of GDP and postpone the needed adjustment. An additional fiscal effort is
needed, focusing on improved tax administration and restraint on public sector wage
increases. Public enterprises should be managed on commercial bases or privatized,
as circumstances permit.

•

Financial sector policies. The mission emphasized the potential for an increase in
bank credit and loss in NIR, and recommended mopping up excess bank reserves.
The authorities agreed that more market-oriented instruments of monetary policy
should be introduced in the context of a gradual relaxation of capital controls.

•

Trade agreements. The mission encouraged the authorities to continue with the
process of integration into the regional economy through multilateral trade
arrangements.

I. BACKGROUND AND PROSPECTS FOR 2005
A. A Brief Perspective
1.
The Bahamas is a small, open, and relatively wealthy economy, which is highly
dependent on tourism from the United States and offshore financial activities. Per capita
GDP is US$18,000, and other indicators of social development compare favorably with
Caribbean averages (Tables 1 and 2). Offshore financial activities have developed rapidly
since the early 1990s and now account for roughly 15 percent of GDP. This has reduced the
economy’s dependence on the tourism sector, which is focused on the higher end of the
U.S. market but still accounts for a quarter of GDP. However, economic activity remains
narrowly based, and options for further diversification appear limited.
2.
The economy’s external dependence contributed to a marked weakening of the
macroeconomic situation

attacks on tourism. However,
with the exchange rate pegged to the U.S. dollar, annual inflation remained low at around
2 percent.
3.
The economic slowdown also contributed to a deterioration in the fiscal accounts
(Table 3). A boom in tax revenue and expenditure restraint lowered the central government
deficit to ½ percent of GDP by FY 2000/01, but the deficit widened to 3¼ percent of GDP in
FY 2001/02 and 3½ percent of GDP in FY 2002/03, taking central government debt to
37 percent of GDP (Table 5).1 Two thirds of the deterioration reflected the effects of lower
imports and reduced stopover visitors on tax collections, and the remainder was the result of
increased current outlays, especially following a wage contract that provided for a substantial
increase in 1999 and escalators during 2001–04. Although deficits were almost fully
financed by domestic banks, roughly half the bank financing involved U.S. dollar loans from
the offshore books of foreign banks, which contributed to a large increase in the net foreign
liabilities of the banking system.
4.
The authorities used credit controls to alleviate pressures on international
reserves and the exchange rate. The Bahamas maintains significant restrictions on capital
flows and supplements these with direct instruments to control liquidity, including credit

Accordingly, as net international reserves (NIR) declined in the third quarter of 2001 by
US$60 million to US$300 million (77 percent of base money) and the peg appeared under
threat, the central bank introduced in September a bank-by-bank freeze on domestic currency
credit to the private sector. This action helped reverse the decline in NIR in 2002 by
restraining household sector demand, which is import-intensive.
B. Recent Developments
5.
The Progressive Liberal Party enjoys a strong majority in Parliament. The
government’s popularity has been strengthened by the launch of several large-scale tourism
projects; general elections are due by August 2007.

A depreciation of the real effective exchange rate vis-à-vis regional competitors
in 2004 suggests an improvement in The Bahamas’ competitiveness (Figure 2).3
However, while the share of Caribbean tourism expenditure rose during 1998–2002, this
trend may not have continued in 2003–04, judging by stopover arrivals.
8.
Fiscal performance fell short of budget objectives. Although current outlays on
nonwage goods and services and capital expenditure were contained, the fiscal deficit
remained above 3 percent of GDP during FY 2003/04 (see Table 3 and Figure 3), compared
with the authorities’ target of 2¼ percent of GDP. Tax revenues were depressed, partly as a

public sector wages rose in line with the escalators established under the 1999 wage
agreement.
9.
The government deficit is estimated to have narrowed to 2½ percent of GDP
in 2004/05, slightly better than the budget projection. About two thirds of the reduction in
the primary deficit of 0.6 percentage point of GDP was attributable to one-time factors,
namely, the settlement of tax arrears by a hotel being sold to a large developer and grants for
post-hurricane repairs (0.3 percent and 0.1 percent of GDP, respectively). Revenues were
boosted by a rapid growth in property tax and stamp tax collections in response to
strengthened enforcement efforts. Budget reallocations made room for post-hurricane repairs
while keeping outlays within budget limits, and total expenditure remained stable in relation
to GDP. Although a new public sector wage agreement had not yet been reached, real wages
continued to rise, owing to wage drift, resulting in a cumulative rise in real wages of
23 percent since 1998/99.
10.
The increase in public sector debt since 2000 has tended to reflect the rising
central government debt (Figure 4 and Table 5).

11.
The balance of payments strengthened markedly in 2004, and net international
reserves (NIR) rose substantially (Table 7). The trade deficit widened, largely owing to the
higher oil import bill, but this was offset by an expansion of tourism receipts and
reinsurance-related inflows following the hurricanes that hit The Bahamas in September. As
a result, the current account deficit narrowed to 5½ percent of GDP, from 8 percent in 2003.
Coupled with an increase in direct investment, which boosted the financial account surplus,
NIR—already buoyed by a government bond issue in 2003—rose further in 2004, reaching
105 percent of base money at end-2004.
12.
The central bank responded to the strengthening of net international reserves by
relaxing credit controls in August 2004. The bank-by-bank credit freeze—which had been
introduced in 2001—was lifted, and was replaced by prudential guidelines for consumer
loans and mortgages that were designed to contain the growth of household debt. Bank credit
to the private sector grew by only 6 percent in 2004, after having stagnated during 2003, and
credit growth remained subdued in first quarter of 2005, suggesting the lack of pent-up
demand for credit by the private sector. Net international reserves have also continued to
strengthen, reaching 117 percent of base money at end-March 2005.

High and persistent excess bank liquidity has led interest rates to fall. Domestic
interest rates have tended to move independently from international interest rates, reflecting
the autonomy gained from capital controls, and their recent decline contrasts with the firming
of international rates.

reduction in the central bank discount rate of 50 basis points in February 2005 consolidated
this trend by leading commercial banks to lower the prime lending rate by an equivalent
amount, to 5.5 percent.
14.
The regulation and supervision of the domestic and offshore financial sectors
have strengthened over the last two years. The Module 2 assessment of the offshore
financial center (OFC) report was generally favorable, including with regard to compliance
with the Basel core principles for bank supervision.4 Steps were taken in 2003–04 to
implement the report’s recommendations, including the closure by mid-2004 of all banks
without a meaningful physical presence, and an ongoing study of how best to consolidate
regulatory functions. Anti-money laundering legislation was reconciled with current best
international practices; processes were streamlined; and legislation prohibiting the financing
of terrorism was approved in December 2004. Bank soundness indicators improved
somewhat in 2004, as nonperforming loans fell to just under 5 percent and provisioning
increased (Tables 8 and 9).
15.
The economic expansion is expected to strengthen slightly in 2005, with real
GDP growth rising by 3.5 percent. A further recovery of tourism activity is expected (with
the possible exception of Grand Bahama, the island most severely hit by the hurricanes), and
buoyant construction activity will result from large-scale projects in the tourism sector and
from post-hurricane reconstruction. Bank credit to the household sector is expected to pick
up in response to rising employment and household incomes, leading to a decline in banks’

construction-related imports are expected to widen the trade balance, despite the increase in
tourism receipts.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
16.
The policy discussions centered on the need to provide a stable macroeconomic
environment that would foster private sector growth. The main policy challenges lie in
the fiscal area, where policy adjustments are needed to lower the government debt-to-GDP
ratio to a more prudent level and to strengthen the financial performance of the rest of the
nonfinancial public sector.
A. Fiscal Policy
17.
The authorities agreed that the budget for 2005/06 should be geared toward a
medium-term objective of lowering the government debt-to-GDP ratio. In the budget
communication for 2003/04, the government stated its intention to eliminate the budget
deficit “as quickly as possible and return the ratio of government debt to GDP to well below
40 percent.” The mission supported this objective, and suggested that the government aim at
a reduction in the debt ratio to the lower end of the range observed over the last 10–15 years
(around 30 percent; see Figure 4). Therefore, the mission called on the authorities to establish
a debt reduction objective in the context of a budget for 2005/06 that would demonstrate
credible movement toward this goal. In this context, the team suggested aiming to lower the
FY 2005/06 deficit to just under 2½ percent of GDP. Although only a modest decline relative
to 2004/05, it would require significant adjustment relative to a baseline scenario
(¾ percentage point of GDP), given that the 2004/05 position had been boosted by the
nonrecurring payment of tax arrears.
18.
The authorities are concentrating revenue enhancement efforts on improved tax
administration. In particular, they have begun to implement a customs information
management system, which encompasses better tracking of information needed for good
governance within the customs administration, better internal controls, and more efficient,
risk-based control and audit procedures.
19.
The mission supported these efforts, but also emphasized the need for additional
revenue measures. There is scope for reducing customs duty exemptions, which have
become more extensive since 2001 and do not appear to have been accompanied by
commensurate benefits in terms of increased investment and private sector growth.5
Moreover, many fees have long remained unchanged and could be adjusted (e.g., business
licenses for offshore firms, road user fees, and business license fees for all but the smallest
domestic firms); excise taxes on tobacco and liquor could be adjusted; and the updating of
property tax rolls and collection of property taxes intensified.
5

Equivalent to 3–4 percent of GDP in the period from 2000/01 to 2003/04.

-920.
The authorities have not yet committed themselves to tax reform. They
acknowledge that the tax base is heavily dependent on trade taxes, and that accession to the
WTO would require lower tariffs that significantly reduce tax receipts. Although
consideration was being given to the introduction of a VAT or sales tax, the authorities
cautioned that implementation would be difficult, given the absence of an institutional
framework for administration of income or sales taxes upon which to build. In their view, the
more pressing priority was the program for the modernization of customs administration,
which also would be an essential prerequisite for a VAT administration.
21.
The authorities agreed that expenditure restraint should be focused on public
sector wages. They acknowledged that wages had increased substantially in real terms
since 1999, and hoped that demands from the wage negotiations now underway could be
contained. This would reduce the need for other fiscal measures in support of the deficit
target, and it would also help discipline private sector wage demands and reduce pressures on
cost competitiveness. The mission noted that there was also a need to reduce and rationalize
the transfers and net lending to public enterprises.
22.
A budget proposal for 2005/06 was presented to Parliament in late May,
allowing for a modest increase in the deficit, to 2.9 percent of GDP. The Budget
Communication stated the government’s intention to reduce government debt to 30 percent
of GDP within a five-year period, and it provided indicative deficit targets for the following
two fiscal years, which would stabilize the debt ratio at just under 38 percent. The staff
welcomes the authorities’ announcement of deficit targets for the next three years. However,
the authorities’ deficit path implies a postponement of adjustment efforts until close to
the 2007 electoral period (Figure 7). In the staff’s view, a somewhat lower deficit in 2005/06
would be needed to establish the credibility of the authorities’ objective on lowering the
government debt ratio. The team also stressed the importance of monitoring budgetary
developments closely during the year and establishing contingency plans that could be
activated if needed to lock in the fiscal targets.
23.
The authorities agreed with the mission on the need to broaden the scope of debt
management to include government-guaranteed debt. In this context, they are seeking to
fund a major expansion of the main airport through a Build/Operate/Transfer (BOT) contract
that would avoid government guarantees as well as direct budgetary support. The mission
supported these objectives, and emphasized the importance also of monitoring the
government-guaranteed debt of the public utilities and other state-owned enterprises that are
incurring debt to finance capital projects.
24.
The authorities have taken steps to revive their privatization program. The sale
of a large government hotel has been agreed; consideration is being given to the privatization
of the state airline; and there is a renewed interest in selling the telephone company. While
welcoming these efforts, the mission noted that the government’s clear support of the
privatization efforts would be required to overcome the inertia that previously has kept such
enterprises in the public sector. Staff also emphasized the need to ensure that other public
enterprises were operated on sound, commercial bases and to address inefficiencies in the
financial public sector.

- 10 25.
The mission welcomed the preparation of a major reform of the public pension
system. Although the system is not facing immediate funding problems, a proposal aimed at
ensuring its long-term sustainability is expected to be presented to parliament by end-2005. It
will be based on recent recommendations from a government-sponsored commission, which
included phased adjustments to contribution rates, a higher retirement age, and changes in
pension eligibility requirements.6 There also is considerable scope for reducing
administrative costs of the public pension system, currently equivalent to 20 percent of
contribution income. The authorities are separately considering the introduction of a health
insurance scheme, to be financed through a payroll tax and administered by the National
Insurance Board, under which benefits would be provided by both public and private health
care providers. Specific proposals on the scope and cost of the new scheme are expected to
be assessed by the government by end-2005.7
B. Financial Sector Policies
26.
The mission welcomed the recent build up of international reserves but
cautioned that the high level of bank reserves posed risks. The mission observed that,
with credit growing moderately and NIR strengthening through the first quarter of 2005, the
risks inherent in the high level of excess bank reserves had thus far been contained.
However, with the expected pick-up in economic activity, the apparent liquidity overhang
could stimulate a sharp increase in bank credit and a rapid loss in NIR, and it would seem
prudent to begin mopping up excess bank reserves. The authorities agreed that it would be
appropriate—now that NIR had reached comfortable levels—to maintain external reserves at
least at the equivalent of base money. However, they took a more sanguine view of the
banks’ liquidity position, namely, that banks’ excess reserves were likely to remain high for
an extended period of time, hence did not pose a major near-term risk to NIR.
27.
The Central Bank is exploring alternative operational frameworks to support
the exchange rate peg. The authorities noted that one specific option being considered is the
possibility of establishing a targeting framework for international reserves. The mission
cautioned, however, that the operational aspects of reserves targeting—including trigger
points and response mechanisms—had not yet been well defined, and there did not seem to
be obvious merits to this approach. It would seem preferable to avoid a mechanistic rule and,
instead, to leave the Central Bank with the discretion to determine whether reserve
movements reflected temporary or permanent factors. Partly in response to these concerns,
the authorities have postponed the adoption of a targeting framework.

6

The commission proposed increases in the minimum contribution period, a revision of the
formula for the reference wage used to calculate pension benefits, an increase in the income
ceiling for pension contributions.
7

An additional component of a possible social security reform that is being discussed is a
personal disaster relief fund (see background paper on selected issues for details).

- 11 28.
The authorities are considering a partial and gradual relaxation of exchange
controls on capital transactions. 8 The mission supported the objective of easing controls,
which would foster a deepening of the domestic capital market and increase competition in
the financial sector. However, the team cautioned that the pace and extent of easing controls
should depend on the authorities’ ability to maintain adequate international reserves and a
strong fiscal position, and to develop effective indirect instruments of credit control.
29.
The authorities agreed that efforts should be made to promote more marketoriented instruments of liquidity and credit management. They plan to develop a
secondary market for government securities, which could facilitate other measures, including
the possible use by the central bank of repos to adjust commercial bank liquidity.
30.
The authorities have taken several steps to implement the recommendations of
the Module 2 assessment of the offshore financial center. Most recently, legislation to
combat the financing of terrorism was approved in December 2004; a commission was
established in April 2005 to develop recommendations for the consolidation of regulatory
functions; and the securities legislation is being revised with assistance from MFD.9
C. Policies for Competitiveness and Growth and the Medium-Term Outlook and Risks
31.
The exchange rate peg continues to serve the country well. The small size of The
Bahamas and its strong commercial ties with the United States argue for maintaining the peg
to the U.S. dollar. Inflation has remained low, contributing to the stability of the currency in
real effective terms (see Figure 2). The strategy of targeting the high end of the tourism
market has allowed The Bahamas to keep a broadly stable share of Caribbean tourism
expenditure, and plans for major investments in the tourism sector over the next several years
should provide for further expansion over the medium term. However, the steady decline in
The Bahamas’ share of stayover tourist arrivals during the past decade highlights a source of
vulnerability, which may partly reflect the high wage costs in The Bahamas relative to other
Caribbean destinations.
32.
The mission supports the authorities’ ongoing efforts to promote diversification
of the economy. The aim is to foster a more broadly based growth and to reduce the
vulnerabilities arising from the high degree of dependence on the tourism sector. Plans to
promote e-commerce and private sector initiatives to install a pharmaceutical plant and a ship
8

The central bank proposals would halve the premium—currently 25 percent—on approved
purchases of foreign securities; expand the listing of foreign securities on the Bahamas stock
exchange through depositary rights; allow cross-listings of Bahamian and foreign companies
on principal CARICOM exchanges; and allow limited foreign investments by the National
Insurance Board at the official exchange rate.

The status of key recommendations in the Module 2 assessment is described in the
background paper on selected issues.

- 12 repair facility in Freeport are steps in this direction. In addition, the authorities are actively
considering proposals for the installation of an LNG terminal to supply Florida.
33.
The mission encouraged the authorities to continue with the process of economic
integration through multilateral trade arrangements. Remaining outside the multilateral
system would deprive The Bahamas of formal mechanisms to resolve differences with other
countries and make it more vulnerable to unilateral pressures because of its reduced
bargaining power. The mission understands that accession to the WTO is likely to be drawn
out over an extended period of time, as it would need to be linked to a plan for reducing trade
taxes.
34.
Staff has prepared a baseline ‘debt sustainability’ scenario through 2010 that
illustrates the dangers of an unchanged fiscal stance (Table 11). Large-scale investment
in the hotel sector is expected to provide a stimulus to growth of output in 2005–06.
However, over the medium term, an unchanged fiscal policy stance would raise the central
government’s deficit considerably, owing to adverse debt dynamics, and its debt would
increase from 37 percent of GDP in 2005 to 44 percent of GDP by 2010. The domestic
borrowing requirement would increasingly crowd out investment by Bahamian enterprises
and constrain economic activity, which the staff estimate would cause growth to decline
gradually to 3 percent.10 The debt of the rest of the public sector is projected to stabilize at
11½ percent of GDP, following the increase in deficits of the public utilities to finance
capital expenditures in 2005.
35.

This scenario is also subject to downside risks:
•

Hurricanes represent a perennial threat to the tourism sector. Although they
have caused less damage to The Bahamas than to other Caribbean economies,
their timing and severity are inherently uncertain.11

•

Large wage settlements in the hotel sector could erode competitiveness,
especially in the lower and middle tiers of the Bahamian tourism industry.

•

Further increases in oil prices would directly affect the economy and worsen
the trade deficit, including by dampening growth in partner countries.

10

The largely foreign-owned hotel sector would be less affected than other sectors. Tourism
is projected to grow in real terms by 3 percent a year on average from 2007 to 2010,
compared with 2 percent annual growth during the past decade, on the assumption that
foreign investment eases capacity constraints and that tourism grows roughly in line with
projected growth of private consumption in the United States (3–3½ percent a year).

11

According to one study, the cumulative damage over the period 1970–2002 was 13 percent
of annual GDP in The Bahamas, compared with 37 percent in the Caribbean region
(WP/04/224).

- 13 •

The team’s debt sustainability analysis illustrates that the public debt
dynamics would worsen further in the event of shocks to growth, interest
rates, or the demand for tourism (possibly induced by an unanticipated
weakness in U.S. private consumption) (Appendix IV).

36.
Staff has prepared an active scenario through 2010 that assumes a fiscal
adjustment path that would yield a gradual but sustained decrease in the debt-to-GDP
ratio, broadly consistent with the authorities’ medium-term fiscal objective (Table 12).
A fiscal adjustment of ¾ percentage point of GDP in 2005/06, relative to the baseline
projection, would result in a small decline in the deficit compared with the year before. The
primary balance would improve by a further 1½ points of GDP over the following four years.
For a discussion of specific measures that could be considered, see Section II.A. This
scenario targets a downward path for the government budget deficit that would lower the
debt-to-GDP ratio modestly, to 33 percent of GDP, by 2010. Growth in 2005 would be lower
than in the baseline scenario, owing to the cut in public sector demand. It is assumed that
growth would stabilize at 4 percent annually, slightly lower than in the second half of
the 1990s, as significant increases in tourism capacity come on stream. This scenario, while
still subject to many of the downside risks that apply to the baseline scenario, would leave
the economy in a stronger position to absorb eventual exogenous shocks.
D. Other Issues
37.
The authorities have recently completed a revision of the national accounts,
which were published shortly after the mission. The mission welcomes the publication of
these statistics, given that previously published data on GDP extended only to 1995.12 The
methodology for calculating the official GDP series may not be fully supported by the
country’s current statistical capacity, and the decision to use an average of production and
expenditure estimates will require additional resources for the data compilation. The
authorities also are planning to implement a data release schedule to further improve data
dissemination practices. To help identify priorities for this work, the mission encouraged the
authorities to undertake a data module ROSC to assess the quality of data, and recommend
steps to address remaining weaknesses.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
The economy has recovered well from the 2001–02 slowdown and the damage
from two hurricanes in 2004. Inflation has been contained, reserves have rebounded, and
growth is expected to strengthen in 2005, boosted by the expansion of construction in the
tourism sector.

12

Final national accounts statistics through 2002 and preliminary data for 2003–04 were
released.

- 14 39.
The medium-term outlook appears broadly favorable, but challenges remain.
Low inflation, a sound banking system, and generally prudent fiscal policies have set the
stage for private-sector led growth. The key prerequisites going forward will be a
strengthening of the fiscal position sufficient to place the debt/GDP ratio on a downward
path, and structural policies and private infrastructure investment that will support further
growth and diversification of the economy.
40.
Against this background, the authorities’ intention to lower the government
debt-to-GDP ratio to 30 percent over the medium term is welcome. However,
the 2005/06 fiscal stance still needs to be further strengthened, relative to the budget proposal
for 2005/06, to support the authorities’ debt objective. The rise in the government debt-toGDP ratio in recent years underscores the importance of a more frontloaded path for
lowering the deficit and the debt ratios, and of creating more room for policy responses to
economic shocks. In any event, it will be important to monitor closely budgetary
developments in the course of the year, and to develop contingency plans to ensure that the
authorities’ budget deficit target is not disrupted by exogenous shocks.
41.
Revenue and expenditure measures will be needed to support the 2005/06 budget
and medium term debt reduction. The steps being taken to modernize the customs
administration are welcome, and there would also seem to be scope to enhance revenues by
adjustments to a number of user fees. Over the medium term, since accession to the WTO
will require significantly lower tariffs, a comprehensive tax reform involving a VAT or sales
tax could help sustain revenues and reduce the vulnerability of the economy to external
shocks. On the expenditure side, it will be important to contain public sector wage demands
given the large increases over the last several years and the need to maintain international
competitiveness. There also is a need to reduce and rationalize transfers to public
corporations.
42.
Improvements in debt management would also help contain fiscal
vulnerabilities. In particular, the scope of debt management should be broadened to
encompass all public sector debt, including government-guaranteed debt and contingent
fiscal liabilities. In this context, the authorities’ intention to meet the needs for expansion of
the main airport through a commercial arrangement that would avoid government guarantees
as well as direct budgetary support is welcome.
43.
The efforts to reinvigorate the government’s privatization program are
encouraging. In order to maintain the new-found momentum, it will be important to actively
pursue opportunities to divest the state airline and public utilities, and to ensure that the other
public enterprises are managed on commercial bases and privatized as circumstances permit.
44.
The authorities are taking welcome steps to strengthen the monetary policy
framework in support of the exchange rate peg. The development of a secondary market
for government securities could provide a useful basis for developing more market oriented
instruments for the central bank to adjust commercial bank liquidity. The relaxation of
exchange controls on capital transactions that is contemplated may bring benefits, including
by improving the efficiency of the domestic financial sector. However, care will be needed to

- 15 ease controls in a gradual and prudent manner, ensuring that prudential systems and reserves
are strong. In this latter regard, the monetary authorities are appropriately aiming at ensuring
that reserves are kept at a level of at least the equivalent of reserve money. With the
prospective strengthening of economic activity and credit demand, the central bank should be
prepared to withdraw some of the banks’ excess reserves, possibly through repos, to protect
NIR.
45.
The authorities have taken commendable steps to implement the
recommendations of the Fund’s offshore financial center assessment report. However, it
will be important to finalize the guidelines concerning the confidentiality required from
overseas regulators in order to permit the efficient exchange of information.
46.
The exchange rate peg at parity with the U.S. dollar continues to be appropriate
for The Bahamas. Low inflation has helped keep the currency stable in real effective terms;
The Bahamas has maintained a generally stable share of Caribbean tourism expenditure; and
plans for investment projects in the tourism sector should provide for further expansion over
the medium term.
47.
The authorities’ ongoing efforts to promote diversification of the economy are
welcome. These efforts will help foster a more broadly based growth and reduce the
vulnerabilities arising from the high degree of dependence on the tourism sector. At the same
time, however, it remains important to safeguard the tourism industry’s competitiveness by
maintaining low inflation.
48.
The authorities are encouraged to continue to move toward closer integration
into the global economy through multilateral trade arrangements. Remaining outside the
multilateral system would deprive The Bahamas of formal mechanisms to resolve differences
with other countries and make it more vulnerable to unilateral pressures.
49.
The recent revision—and publication—of national accounts statistics is a
positive achievement. The authorities are encouraged to participate in the data module of the
ROSC, to help identify further steps to improve the quality of economic statistics.
50.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with The Bahamas take place on
the 24-month cycle.

APPENDIX III

The Bahamas—Statistical Issues
The Bahamas has made significant recent progress in the timeliness and quality of
economic data, although weaknesses remain. The Bahamas Department of Statistics
(DOS) has just published official GDP series for the period from 1989 through 2002, and
preliminary data for 2003 and 2004. The central bank produces annual and quarterly reports
covering macro economic developments, but several series have long lags and are frequently
revised. The DOS is responsible for generating output statistics, but many series have been
discontinued or are not available.
The Bahamas began participation in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS)
in 2003. Its metadata were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on
February 14, 2003.
National Accounts
The DOS calculates the GDP from the production and the expenditure sides. The main
source of the production-based estimates of GDP is the annual business establishment
survey, which is complemented with information from the Department of Agriculture, the
Department of Fisheries, the Central Bank, the Registrar of Insurance, the Government
Treasury Accounts, public corporations, and some other sources.
There are few independent sources for the estimation of the expenditure on GDP. Whereas
government expenditure is based on data from the government,13 and exports and imports of
goods and services data come from the balance of payments,14 roughly 55 percent of the
private final consumption expenditure is estimated based on the retail trade sales data from
the business establishment survey. The remaining 45 percent is estimated based on the
census, Central Bank data, the 1994 household expenditure survey, and the 2001 Bahamas
Living Conditions Survey. A substantial portion of gross capital formation is also based on
estimates from the business establishment survey.
Despite the fact that a substantial portion of the expenditure-based estimates of GDP come
from the production data, the DOS regards the quality of expenditure-based estimates as
superior to the production-based estimates. The weakness of production data results from the
fact that several of the surveys have very low response rates and reduced coverage, many
times limited to the islands of New Providence and Grand Bahama. The retail trade survey,
13

the part of the business establishment survey used to estimate private final consumption
expenditure, is, by contrast, one of the surveys with the highest response rates (especially in
New Providence). Also, the production-side estimates do not cover credit unions, timeshare,
and the National Insurance Board.
In view of these limitations, the DOS decided to calculate the official series on GDP as an
average of production and expenditure-based estimates of GDP.
From 1996 on, The Bahamas did not publish official numbers for the series of GDP. During
this period, IMF estimates published in the Article IV staff reports were widely used by the
government and the private sector. The table and chart below present a comparison of the
two series, both in nominal and in 1991 constant prices.

Government Finance
Monthly and quarterly data are regularly reported by the central bank for publication in IFS.
Data on budgetary operations of the central government (excluding social security) are
updated on a quarterly basis. Annual data covering the budgetary central government
accounts have been submitted for publication in the GFS Yearbook through 2003. The
National Insurance Board (a social security fund) is not included in the coverage of central
government data. Data are compiled in accordance with the GFSM 1986, but the authorities
indicated that plans for improvements over the medium term include the compilation and
dissemination of quarterly data using guidelines from the IMF Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001. Data on public enterprises are available only with long lags (in some
cases exceeding one year) and do not follow the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics
methodology.
Money and Banking
The availability and quality of monetary and banking data are adequate. The central bank
could improve the coverage of banking data in its quarterly economic bulletin by including a
table on quarterly prudential indicators (weighted capital-to-assets ratios, share of
nonperforming loans in total loans, provisions for past due loans, earnings to net worth

- 40 -

ratios) and indicators of the banking structure (number of banks and nonbank institutions,
market shares in deposits and assets).
External Sector
Quarterly balance of payment statistics are reported to the Fund on a timely basis. However,
the disaggregated series on imports and exports published by the DOS end in 2001. No
information is available on private external debt.

APPENDIX IV

The Bahamas—Debt Sustainability Analysis
Under the baseline scenario, public sector debt would be on an unsustainable path, rising
steadily relative to GDP starting in 2005.15 The baseline scenario assumes that the
government does not implement revenue and expenditure measures. Debt would increase to
56½ percent of GDP by 2010 from 49 percent in 2005, entailing rising gross financing needs,
growing interest payments and a sustained rise in public debt relative to fiscal revenue. The
authorities finance the fiscal deficit mainly in the domestic market to minimize external
vulnerabilities but at the risk of crowding out domestic investment.
This scenario is vulnerable to shocks in the real GDP growth rate, interest rates and fiscal
slippages. All these shocks would accelerate the rise in the public sector debt ratio that could
reach as high as 68½ percent of GDP. Of particular interest is the tourism expenditure shock
in 2006 and 2007 under which the public sector debt would rise to 60 percent of GDP
in 2010, above the ratios under historical and baseline assumptions, but still 8½ percentage
points below the ratio in the case of a shock to real GDP growth.
External debt vulnerabilities are less pronounced, owing to the relatively low level of
external debt (6 percent of GDP at end-2004). With the large past and projected inflows of
foreign direct investment, stabilization of the external debt ratio can be achieved with a
relative large current account deficits (6½ percent of GDP), though smaller than the 10-year
historical average (around 10½ percent of GDP). The shock in tourism expenditure increases
slightly the ratio of external debt to GDP, but lowers the debt-stabilizing current account
deficit.

15

Public debt on a gross basis includes the central government and the rest of the public
sector debt but excludes assets from the National Insurance Board.

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation
with The Bahamas
On June 24, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Bahamas.1
Background
Economic activity recovered in 2003–04, following two years of low growth that reflected the
effects on tourism of the U.S. recession and the September 2001 terrorist attacks. Real GDP
growth increased to 2 percent in 2003, owing to a rapid pick-up in financial and other
services, and reached 3 percent in 2004 as the tourism sector began to turn around despite
two strong hurricanes in September 2004. The recovery also led to a decline in the
unemployment rate in 2004, to just over 10 percent. The economic expansion is expected to
strengthen slightly in 2005, with real GDP rising by 3.5 percent.
The medium-term outlook appears broadly favorable, but challenges remain. Low inflation,
a sound banking system, and generally prudent fiscal policies have set the stage for privatesector led growth.
The government deficit rose sharply during the economic slowdown of 2001–02, albeit from a
low level, and remained above 3 percent of GDP over the three years to FY 2003/04 and
above the authorities’ 2¼ percent of GDP target for 2003/04. Although current outlays on
nonwage goods and services and capital expenditure were compressed, tax revenues
remained depressed, and public sector wages continued to rise.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

-2The government deficit in 2004/05 is estimated to have declined to 2½ percent of GDP,
but the debt-to-GDP ratio continued to rise, to about 37 percent of GDP. The revenue effort
improved in 2004/05, albeit less than projected, aided by a boost from the settlement of tax
arrears by a hotel being sold to a large developer. Total expenditure remained stable in
relation to GDP as post-hurricane repairs were accommodated through budget reallocations
that kept outlays within budget limits.
The balance of payments strengthened markedly in 2004, and net international reserves
(NIR) rose substantially. A widening of the trade deficit, owing mainly to the higher oil import
bill, was offset by an expansion of tourism receipts and reinsurance-related inflows following
the hurricanes. As a result, the current account deficit narrowed to 5½ percent of GDP.
In response to the increase in NIR, the central bank relaxed credit controls in August 2004.
The bank-by-bank credit freeze—which had been introduced in 2001—was lifted, and it was
replaced by prudential guidelines for consumer loans and mortgages that were aimed at
containing the growth of household debt. In early 2005, NIR continued to rise, reaching
117 percent of base money at end-March, and excess bank reserves rose strongly, as credit
growth remained subdued. A reduction in the central bank discount rate of 50 basis points in
February 2005 led commercial banks to lower the prime lending rate by the same amount, to
5.5 percent.
The regulation and supervision of the domestic and offshore financial sectors have
strengthened over the last two years. The IMF’s Module 2 assessment report on the offshore
financial center (OFC) was generally favorable, including with regard to compliance with the
Basel core principles for bank supervision. Steps were taken in 2003–04 to implement the
report’s recommendations, including the closure by mid-2004 of all banks without a
meaningful physical presence. Bank soundness indicators improved somewhat in 2004,
as the share of nonperforming loans fell to just under 5 percent and provisioning increased.
Executive Board Assessment
The Directors observed that the Bahamas economy has recovered well from the 2001–02
slowdown, with some acceleration of activity in 2004 having been achieved even in the face
of two hurricanes, and that economic growth is expected to strengthen further in 2005.
Inflation has been contained, international reserves have rebounded, and the banking sector
has remained sound.
Directors noted, however, that the fiscal position has been relatively weak in recent years,
and that public debt has risen significantly. Although prospects for the tourism sector appear
generally favorable, realizing the economy’s growth potential would require a strengthening
of the fiscal stance over the medium term to place the debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward
path. This fiscal strengthening should be supported by structural policies and private
infrastructure investment that would help promote the diversification of the economy.
Several Directors also suggested that, in light of the significantly adverse impact of
hurricanes on the Bahamas economy, consideration could be given to establishing a system
to improve disaster management.
Against this background, Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to lower the
government debt-to-GDP ratio to 30 percent over the medium term, as well as their

-3preparation of multi-year budget forecasts. Nonetheless, in part to provide greater room for
policy responses to adverse shocks, Directors recommended a further strengthening of
the 2005/06 fiscal stance relative to the budget proposal and closer monitoring of budgetary
developments to help ensure that the more stringent objective is achieved.
Directors suggested that both revenue and expenditure measures could be used to support
fiscal tightening. While welcoming the ongoing modernization of the customs administration,
they noted that other revenue measures, such as adjustments to user fees, also would likely
be needed. Directors noted that a comprehensive tax reform, entailing the introduction of a
VAT or sales tax and a lowering of import tariffs, would help sustain revenues and reduce the
vulnerability of the economy to external shocks, while also facilitating the possible accession
to the World Trade Organization (WTO) that the authorities are presently considering.
Noting the importance of adequate preparatory work for the introduction of a value added tax,
Directors welcomed the studies commissioned by the government on operational and other
aspects of the proposed system. On the expenditure side, Directors emphasized the
importance of containing public sector wages—which have risen significantly in recent
years—for maintaining international competitiveness, especially in the tourism industry.
They also recommended reducing and rationalizing transfers to public corporations.
Directors observed that the fixed exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar has served the
Bahamas well, and welcomed the authorities’ plans to strengthen the monetary policy
framework in support of the exchange rate peg. They considered that the development of a
secondary market for government securities could provide a useful basis for developing more
market-oriented instruments for effective central bank control over commercial bank liquidity.
Directors supported the authorities’ intention to relax exchange controls on capital
transactions to improve the efficiency of the domestic financial sector. However, they
cautioned that controls would need to be eased in a gradual and prudent manner,
while keeping prudential systems strong and international reserves at an adequate level,
and therefore welcomed the authorities’ intention to proceed cautiously in this area.
Directors supported the monetary authorities’ strategy of keeping international reserves at a
level of at least the equivalent of base money, and stressed that the central bank should be
prepared to withdraw some of the banks’ excess liquidity if such a step were needed to
protect international reserves.
Directors commended the authorities on their implementation of recommendations in the
Fund’s offshore financial center assessment report. They encouraged the finalization of
guidelines for overseas regulators that will permit the efficient exchange of information while
meeting the need for confidentiality. They welcomed the actions to strengthen the
Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework.
Directors encouraged the authorities to reinvigorate the privatization program with an
appropriate regulatory framework. In particular, they recommended that opportunities to
divest the state airline and public utilities be actively pursued, and that other public
enterprises be managed on a commercial basis or be privatized.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to promote diversification of the economy,
including the development of a National Information and Communications Framework to help
promote e-commerce in the Bahamas. They considered that these efforts will help foster a
more broadly based growth and reduce the vulnerabilities arising from the high degree of

-4dependence on the tourism sector. Directors encouraged closer integration into the global
economy through accession to the WTO, and emphasized that the multilateral trading system
would provide the Bahamas with formal mechanisms to resolve trade differences.
Directors welcomed the recent publication of revised national accounts statistics.
They encouraged participation in the data module of the Report on Observance of Standards
and Codes (ROSC) to help identify further steps to improve the quality of economic statistics.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of
the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the
country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article
IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional
level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with
longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of
general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Kevin G. Lynch, Executive Director for The Bahamas
Mark Kruger, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
June 24, 2005

Our Bahamian authorities welcome the staff report as an objective and expert assessment of
the performance of, and prospects for, the Bahamian economy. The staff’s view is quite close
to the authorities’ own assessment. By and large, our authorities agree with the thrust of the
IMF recommendations, both in the staff report and the selected issues papers, bearing in
mind that, for many years, the Bahamian economy has been managed along lines which
accord well with IMF advice and analysis.
Nevertheless, the authorities are well aware that challenges remain. The government is
committed to ensuring that the debt-to-GDP ratio is put squarely on a downward trend. The
authorities are assessing the benefits and issues arising from possible medium-term accession
to the WTO. The government is also considering how best to deepen Bahamian capital
markets, liberalize the capital account, and move to indirect instruments of monetary control.
Recent Economic Developments
Notwithstanding the dislocation caused by hurricanes Frances and Jeanne, the Bahamian
economy grew by 3.0 percent in real terms in 2004, double the rate recorded in 2000-2003.
The strengthening growth arose primarily from modest annual increases in real private sector
consumption, steady rise in government expenditures and a healthy pickup in business and
residential investment.
Growth is expected to increase to 3.5 percent in 2005, driven by stronger private investment.
Moreover, there is every likelihood that these strong rates of growth will be sustained in
subsequent years, given the flow of investment projects coming on stream.
The current account deficit narrowed to 5.3 percent of GDP in 2004, compared to an average
of 9 percent of GDP in the four previous years. However, much of this improvement was due
to the inflow of insurance claims following the hurricanes. The current account is expected to
widen over the next few years as direct investment increases.
The Bahamas experienced very modest consumer price inflation during 2004. With a
marginal decrease in average housing costs, the most heavily weighted component of the
Retail Price Index, average consumer price inflation in The Bahamas declined to 0.9 percent
in 2004, from 3.0 percent in 2003.

Fiscal Policy
The deficit for the 2004/05 fiscal year came in at 2.6 percent of GDP, compared to the 2.8
percent of GDP forecast in the budget.1 This represents an improvement from the deficits of
3.2 and 3.4 percent of GDP recorded in the 2003/04 and 2002/03 fiscal years, respectively.
The 2005/06 Budget foresees a slight increase in the deficit to 2.9 percent of GDP, in part,
because of increases in civil servants’ pay.
The 2005/06 Budget is the first to provide multi-year budget forecasts, projecting public
finances for 2006/07 and 2007/08, on the basis of present trends and policies. The authorities
feel that this presentation is important in increasing the transparency of fiscal policy, since it
illustrates how commitments can only be made when their full implications on the mediumterm fiscal position are accounted for.
The authorities are well aware that high levels of debt could constrain their capacity to
borrow on advantageous terms. The 2005/06 Budget aims to contain the ratio of government
debt-to-GDP to just under 38 percent of GDP. Over the next five years, the authorities intend
to bring the debt-to-GDP ratio down to the low 30 percent range, a policy which is broadly
supported by the public.
Our Bahamian authorities have some reservations about some of the fiscal recommendations
regarding the proposed approach and time-path for strengthening the fiscal position. The staff
recommends a “front-loaded” fiscal effort in 2005/06 of ¾ percentage points of GDP. The
authorities prefer to assess the impact of the scheduled capital inflows, which they believe
will be pronounced during the course of 2005/06 and will positively impact the government’s
fiscal position. In this context, they cite the experience with the Atlantis hotel and resort, and
related projects, in 1997-1999 as examples of the significant impact that this type of major
capital inflow can have on improving the fiscal position in The Bahamas. The authorities
expect that, given the projected private investments, public finances will benefit from
revenue buoyancy, making it possible to reduce the fiscal deficit and bring down the ratio of
government debt-to-GDP to the low 30 percent range. Furthermore, the Government
envisages the early and successful sale of the telecommunications company, and there is
1

The deficit figures noted here are according to IMF classification.

-3national consensus that a substantial portion of the net proceeds should be used to reduce
government debt.
The Government is committed to a programme of improvement and modernization of the
existing revenue regime. The authorities have implemented a number of revenue measures in
2005/06, which tighten loopholes for evading and avoiding stamp duty on property
transactions, increase taxes on alcohol and bring taxable properties onto the real property tax
register. A new Trade Information Management System is being implemented in the
Customs Department and the needs of each of the other revenue agencies are being
addressed. Furthermore, the Government intends to establish a compliance unit, which will
strengthen the monitoring and administration of all major revenue units.
The authorities understand that while accession to the World Trade Organization would bring
benefits to the economy, it would also entail the loss of significant customs duties. This
would mean finding a satisfactory replacement to yield the same level of revenues. The
Government has commissioned studies on operational and other aspects of a value-added tax,
the successful implementation of which requires a soundly functioning revenue
administration. The strategy is to ensure that when it is judged essential and desirable to do
so, the administrative apparatus for a VAT can be readily put in place.
The fiscal situation is monitored on a monthly basis and, at a minimum, quarterly budget
progress reports are submitted to Cabinet (including updating on macroeconomic issues).
Furthermore, Parliament must approve any Government guaranteed debt or financial liability
related to the Public Corporations. This procedure enables the Government to be aware of its
contingent liabilities and to determine the Corporation appropriate borrowing methods.
The staff points to the need to restrain the growth in public sector wages. The authorities
agree but note that, in view of the economy’s dependence on services (tourism and financial
services), it is vital to maintain a harmonious industrial relations climate while endeavoring
to ensure moderation in wage expectations to maintain competitiveness. The Government
endeavors to achieve these ends by engaging in close and open consultations with the
representatives of organized labour.
Monetary Policy
In 2004, strong foreign currency inflows led to accelerated growth in bank deposits, which
were more than adequate to fund domestic credit growth. These inflows also permitted a
substantial buildup in external reserves. The Central Bank timed the relaxation of its credit
restraint policy, which had been in place since 2001, with indications that asset quality in the
local banking system was improving, as evidenced by the falling ratio of non-performing
loans.
While banks have been permitted to resume growth in their private sector loans, they are
required to do so within prudential parameters established by the Central Bank in August
2004. A minimum equity contribution of 15 percent from borrowers towards most new
personal loans is required and the total debt service ratio from loans taken on is limited to 40-

-445 percent of ordinary monthly income. The authorities feel that these measures will prevent
the loss of reserves, which could occur if credit was to expand too rapidly. They continue to
monitor the behaviour of bank credit very closely.
Financial Sector
In view of its importance to the national economy, the authorities intend to ensure that the
offshore financial center meet international standards. The banking sector continued to adjust
to the Central Bank's physical presence requirements, which are designed to eliminate “shell
banks” that did not perform true banking services. The number of licensed banks and trust
companies fell to 266 in 2004, from 284 in 2003 and 2002. As of the end March 2005, the
number of licenses had decreased further to 262. However, total bank employment, which
corresponds more closely to physical presence, increased during 2004 to more than 4,300 and
banks' total expenditures in the economy rose above $400 million (7 percent of GDP).
A number of important initiatives are being considered to accelerate the development of the
local capital markets. A secondary market for government securities is being contemplated,
as this would establish a benchmark for the pricing and issuance of private debt securities.
Consideration is also being given to the further gradual liberalization of Exchange Controls,
including those on certain portfolio investments.
The authorities intend to proceed cautiously, as advised, in further capital liberalization and
in the development of a more active monetary policy. They appreciate that sound
macroeconomic management, including appropriate fiscal policy, are essential for this
purpose. They intend to proceed with care so as to maintain a stable environment, avoiding
sharp or sudden and disruptive fluctuations in either interest rates or capital availability
(particularly as these would affect private sector working capital requirements, household
mortgages, and Government debt).
Economic Diversification
The authorities are mindful of taking advantage of every opportunity for diversification, and
of the importance of safeguarding the competitiveness of the tourism sector. The Ministry of
Finance, with technical assistance from Canada, is developing a National Information and
Communications (NIC) Framework. The NIC Framework will provide on-line access to
healthcare, education, and government services such as land registration and land use policy,
and will be a driving force in developing e-commerce in The Bahamas.2 Increased levels of
e-commerce will enable Bahamian companies to compete in the global marketplace. The
development of a vibrant and entrepreneurial information technology sector will create
employment, encourage diversification, and boost investor confidence.
The Framework also envisages the transformation of the Bahamas Telecommunications
Company (BTC), into a state-of-the-art communications firm. This process is already the
2

Bank.

-5subject of intense work, with the assistance of international consultants. BTC is proceeding
urgently with the project to develop a fiber-optic cable linkage to provide all of the inhabited
islands of The Bahamas with reliable and efficient connection. This project is of paramount
importance to enable hotels and other facilities to develop in the inhabited Family Islands and
to provide each Island with diversified economic opportunities.
The Government has been equally concerned with promoting investment by Bahamian
entrepreneurs and has established a Venture Capital Fund. In the 2004/05 Budget, $1million
was made available for this fund, which was augmented by a further $1 million in the
2005/06 Budget.
Data Issues
As noted in the staff report, the Department of Statistics has recently revised the National
Accounts data and has published final data through 2002 and preliminary data for 2003-04.
This is a major advance over previous years when only provisional data and partial indicators
were available. The Bahamian authorities intend to maintain the momentum in this area and
would welcome a ROSC to assess data quality.
Conclusion
While recent economic performance has been favourable, the authorities are not complacent
and are actively addressing the challenges the economy faces. They are undertaking
extensive improvements in tax administration to manage the debt ratio. They are actively
examining the implications of moving to a VAT, in the context of possible WTO accession.
They are exploring ways of deepening financial markets.
My Bahamian authorities would like to express their sincere appreciation to the staff for a
constructive consultation. The mission provided useful input into the deliberations of the
Cabinet during the formulation of the budget. The authorities plan to publish the staff report.
