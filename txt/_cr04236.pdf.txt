Executive Summary
Background
The Austrian economy has continued to perform relatively well. Growth of real GDP
averaged 1 percent during 2001-03, unemployment is among the lowest in the EU, and
competitiveness remains strong. Also, a gradual recovery is underway and short-term
economic prospects are positive, although risks remain. In a major shift from the policies of
the 1990s, the authorities have adopted an ambitious strategy aiming at balancing the budget
over the cycle, reducing the tax burden to 40 percent of GDP by 2010, containing fiscal
pressures from population ageing, and increasing Austria’s growth potential. Concrete
achievements so far include the first (small) fiscal surplus in over 30 years in 2001, followed
by three years of structural budget balance; a major pension reform in 2003; a wave of
privatizations and deregulation in product and labor markets; and tax reforms in 2004-05.
Key issues
• Short-term outlook. Staff expects growth to rise to 1.6 percent in 2004 and 2.4 percent
in 2005, and inflation to remain low and stable over this period. There are uncertainties
related to the behavior of consumption, but risks to this outlook are balanced.
• Fiscal policy. The tax reform of 2005 will contribute to a temporary widening of the
fiscal deficit in 2005-06 because the planned expenditure savings will come on stream
gradually. The authorities envisaged a return to budget balance in 2008, when the next wave
of tax reform is expected to be launched. This temporary widening of the deficit does not
raise concerns about fiscal sustainability. However, staff cautioned that the deviation from
the policy of structural balance—especially before an election year—might raise questions
about the government’s medium-term intentions. Also, unless the widening is limited and
reversed quickly, the next wave of tax reform may not be feasible. In the short-run, staff
recommended securing the savings already planned in order to contain the deficit in 2005-06,
and ensuring that regional governments contribute to this effort. In the medium term,
achieving the necessary expenditure cuts required re-thinking the role of the state and
introducing a comprehensive medium-term expenditure framework.
• Financial sector issues. The recent FSAP found the Austrian financial system to be
generally sound, well supervised, and resilient to shocks. There is a high degree of
compliance with international standards. Looking ahead, there are areas of potential risk
stemming primarily from the exposure of Austrian banks in central and eastern European
countries and to foreign currency loans to households, and scope for strengthening
supervision and reviewing the current deposit insurance system over the medium term.
Structural policies. Progress with the authorities’ ambitious reform program has been
impressive, but there is unfinished business. Completing the remaining agenda should be the
main policy objective in the period ahead. The immediate priority should be to harmonize the
various public pension systems—a key commitment of the government.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Despite a solid growth performance, the 1990s were characterized by policy
drift. Annual growth averaged 2½ percent, above the EU average, but, except for a spurt of
adjustment during 1996-97, persistent fiscal deficits resulted in a rising public debt-to-GDP
ratio. In addition, policies shied from tackling longer-term structural problems: growing
population-ageing pressures were left unattended, labor force participation of the older age
cohorts was one of the lowest in Europe, the state retained a pervasive role in the economy,
and productivity growth in services, in particular, was lackluster.
2.
In a major policy shift, the coalition government in power since 2000
consolidated Austria’s public finances and embarked on an ambitious reform agenda.
Its objectives are to balance the budget over the cycle, reduce the tax burden to 40 percent of
GDP by 2010, and increase Austria’s growth potential. It made significant steps in this
direction with the first (small) fiscal surplus in over 30 years in 2001; a major pension reform
in 2003; a wave of privatizations and deregulation in product and labor markets over the past
four years; and tax reforms in 2004 and 2005. The successful fiscal consolidation effort, in
particular, set Austria apart from its EU partners (Box 1).

Following the fiscal consolidation effort during 1996-99, most EU
countries set ambitious medium-term goals in their 1999 Stability
Programs to reduce the tax burden (vertical axis) and cut expenditures
(horizontal axis) while, at the same time, delivering a further
improvement in the general government balance (shaded area). Austria
made similar plans, targeting a ¾ percentage point improvement in the
general government balance.

In the event, largely as a result of the global slump, fiscal balances
worsened in all but two EU countries. In many cases, the worsening
went beyond the operation of automatic stabilizers. However, only
Austria managed to reduce the tax burden and cut the deficit by 2003.
And even though Austria’s tax and expenditure reductions were smaller
than initially planned, the deficit reduction was broadly on target.

3.
This policy shift was broadly in line with previous IMF advice. Echoing earlier
recommendations, at the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation on November 24,
2003, Directors endorsed the authorities’ policy strategy since the turn of the decade but
stressed that their ambitious tax reform plans should not jeopardize macroeconomic stability.

-5-

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Austria has weathered the global slowdown relatively well (Figure 1). Growth
performance was broadly in line with the average of the EU but better than Austria’s major
EU partners, notably Germany. Real GDP grew 1 percent per year during 2001-03 buoyed by
strong exports during most of the period. Growth decelerated to ¾ percent in 2003 and the
current account remained broadly balanced (Table 1). Unemployment rose by almost
1 percentage point but, at 4½ percent in mid-2004, remains well below the EU average, as in
the past. Broader measures of labor market slack, notably the employment ratio, have also
shown only a modest deterioration during this slowdown, and the average duration of
unemployment actually fell to 101 days in 2003.
5.
Austria’s competitiveness and export performance remained strong despite the
appreciated euro. Austria’s REER rose modestly during the past twelve months (¾ percent
and 1½ percent in ULC and CPI terms, respectively). Austria enjoys a large competitiveness
margin built during the 1990s on the back of sustained wage moderation. In addition, the
successful expansion of Austrian business into Central & Eastern European countries
(CEECs) has boosted demand for Austrian exports. As a result, although real export growth
slowed in 2003 (dipping briefly into negative territory in Q2), export market shares remained
largely intact (Figure 2). Moreover, a change in the direction of exports is underway: as
Austria starts gradually to lose its first-mover advantage in the new EU members, it is gaining
market share in Southeastern Europe.
6.
The slack in the economy and a stronger euro have kept inflation pressures low.
Inflation (headline and underlying) averaged 1¼ percent in 2003, among the lowest in the
euro zone, and its acceleration to 2.1 percent in May 2004 reflects the impact of higher
energy prices. Wage growth (2¼ percent in 2003) was in line with productivity
developments, and collective agreements for 2004 suggest continued moderate growth.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
8.
Discussions focused on the government’s outstanding policy objectives. The
political cost of last year’s pension reform notwithstanding, the government’s economic
policy priorities remain unchanged. Discussions explored ways to realize the remaining
objectives while safeguarding the past achievements of fiscal policy over the coming years.
•

Although the major part of the government’s reform agenda is already accomplished,
there are significant unfinished tasks. Most importantly, harmonization of the
various public pension schemes—a key commitment of the government—is still
pending; and tax reform will have to go beyond the measures in 2004-05 in order to
lower the tax burden to 40 percent of GDP by 2010.

•

There is tension between the pursuit of tax reform and the government’s
commitment to a balanced budget over the cycle, as shown by the envisaged
widening of the deficit in 2005-06. To return to balance by 2008, as planned by the
government, and indeed to implement further tax reform by 2010, extensive
expenditure restructuring is necessary at all levels of government.

9.
Discussions also covered the financial sector based on the findings and
recommendations of the recent FSAP.
A. Short-Term Outlook
10.
There are some signs that the economy is picking up steam. Fixed investment
rebounded in the second half of last year after a three-year slump, buoyed partly by tax
incentives introduced in September 2002, and industrial production has been gathering pace
(Figures 3 & 4). Other indicators, however, are mixed: employment showed steady gains
during 2003 but took a turn for the worse in early 2004; private consumption growth came to
a halt in Q4 2003, also mirrored in slowing retail sales; and consumer and business
confidence indicators remain tentative.
11.
The slump in private consumption in late 2003 is a puzzle. The behavior of private
savings and consumption in Austria has historically been dominated by consumption
smoothing. In 2003, however, private savings rose despite a drop in the growth rate. If
confirmed (quarterly data are subject to significant revisions), this increase may reflect a shift
toward precautionary savings behavior reflecting the 2003 pension reform and increased
uncertainty about the recovery.
12.

Nonetheless, there are reasons to be optimistic about the short-term outlook:
•

Competitiveness remains strong and the inroads made into new markets offer
opportunities for continued export growth.

-7-

•

A healthy financial system at home and the de-leveraging of corporate
balance sheets bode well for the financing of investment.

•

The tax cuts planned for 2005, as well as the extension of tax incentives
through end-2004, will provide stimulus.

13.
Authorities and staff broadly agreed on the assessment of economic prospects
and risks. Staff projects growth to pick up to 1.6 percent in 2004,1 gradually accelerating
above potential in the second half, and average 2.4 percent in 2005. This forecast is broadly
in line with those of the OeNB, the leading research institutes, and the May consensus
forecast. The main sources of growth in 2004 would be investment and exports, though the
pace of investment would moderate following considerable frontloading during 2003 in
response to the tax incentives. But with high—by Austrian standards—unemployment and
moderating wage growth, consumption is expected to recover only slowly in 2004. In 2005,
consumption will start making a larger contribution and exports are projected to rise further.
However, as imports gather momentum on the back of strengthening domestic demand, the
external sector is expected to make virtually no contribution to growth in 2004-05. Inflation
is projected to remain around 1¾ percent during 2004-05 as the still substantial slack in the
economy and wage moderation in 2004 broadly balance the impact of higher oil prices.
14.
There is considerable uncertainty around the baseline outlook, but risks are
evenly balanced. With a strong competitiveness position, Austrian exports are poised to
benefit from a positive surprise in external demand. But the recovery will not gain traction
until private consumption starts growing again. The uncertain outlook for household
consumption and savings thus increases the margin of error around staff’s current forecast. In
addition, risks associated with the external environment—including oil prices—cast a
shadow on the short-term prospects for Austria: despite recent favorable data, the recovery
underway in the euro area remains on shaky ground as long as the much-anticipated recovery
in Germany is not firmly established; and persistent global imbalances might cause a further,
disorderly appreciation of the euro that could hurt exports.
B. Fiscal Policy and Tax Reform
15.
The authorities targeted an appropriately neutral fiscal stance in 2004. They
expected the general government deficit to narrow to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2004, consistent
with a broad structural balance, but 0.4 percent of GDP above budget plans. This difference
mainly reflects the operation of automatic stabilizers; much of the impact of discretionary
measures—most notably the fiscal package announced in October 2003 with measures aimed
primarily at supporting R&D and investment—would be offset by additional expenditure
1

This includes a one-off calendar adjustment of 0.1 percentage point. In comparison, the
calendar adjustment in Germany is estimated at 0.6 percentage point.

-8-

savings. More importantly, the budget includes the first round of tax reform (IMF Country
Report No. 03/372), whose net budgetary impact will be virtually nil this year. Staff endorsed
the plans for 2004 and agreed with the authorities that automatic stabilizers should be
allowed full play.
16.
The authorities considered the tax reform planned for 2005 to be a critical step
in their efforts to enhance Austria’s attractiveness as a business location and promote
investment and growth (Box 2). They also saw it as the first major step toward their longerterm objective to reduce the tax burden. The emphasis on reducing corporate taxes was meant
to make the most of the higher visibility of this tax, compared with taxes on labor, and was
also in tune with trends in neighboring countries: the authorities estimated that the planned
measures would reduce the effective corporate tax rate to 21-22 percent, a level comparable
to that in the new EU members. The total net revenue loss from tax reform was estimated at
1 percent of GDP. Staff noted that, while little had been done to reduce the burden on labor,
the priority given to the corporate tax was understandable given the mobility of capital and
the reality of corporate taxation in the expanded EU.
Box 2. Tax Reform in 2005
•

Corporate tax will be lowered through a reduction in the tax rate from 34 to 25 percent and a relaxation of
rules on the taxation of groups of companies, allowing a group headquartered in Austria to offset local
profits with losses elsewhere. In addition, the tax base will be widened by eliminating the tax-free transfer
of realized hidden reserves of corporations and the interest deduction on the increase of own capital, and
additional incentives will be provided for spending on R&D.

•

The brackets of the personal income tax will be reduced from four to three and the tax-exempt personal
income threshold raised from € 14,500 to € 15,770. The general tax credit will be built into the tax schedule
to make the marginal tax rates more transparent. The top marginal rate will remain at 50 percent. Tax
credits for sole earners and single parents will increase effective 2004.

•

Some taxes with small yield will be abolished (tax on sparkling wine) or reduced (tax on beer).

17.
The authorities have ambitious expenditure plans to offset the impact of tax
reform but, with the bulk of savings coming on stream later, they anticipate temporary
structural deficits in 2005-06. The November 2003 Stability Program envisaged a range of
expenditure measures (presented in IMF Country Report No. 03/372): health spending is to
be reduced through hikes in certain contributions and co-payments; staff in public
administration is to be reduced by 10,000 by 2006 and operating expenses to be lowered by
3 percent at the federal level; and education spending at the regions is to be controlled
through increasing the student-teacher ratio. These measures, in addition to the cyclical
strengthening and the impact of the 2003 pension reform, were expected to offset the impact
of the tax cuts by 2007 and return the general government budget to broad balance by 2008.
But the deficit was projected to increase temporarily to 1¾ percent of GDP in 2005 and
1½ percent of GDP in 2006 as a result of the lack of synchronicity between tax and

-9-

expenditure cuts. Given the short-term outlook, this would represent a procyclical relaxation
of fiscal policy in these two years.
18.
Staff questioned the planned temporary widening of the deficit in 2005-06.
A temporary deficit of this size would not threaten macroeconomic stability or fiscal
sustainability in Austria (Table 3), even in conjunction with various adverse macroeconomic
shocks (Appendix III). However, staff noted that this deviation from the policy of balanced
budget over the cycle, especially before an election year, might raise questions about the
government’s medium-term intentions. In addition, staff noted that even these deficit targets
for 2005-06 were subject to risks, since they assumed full implementation of the planned
expenditure measures, some of which—notably in health and education—depended to a
considerable extent on regional governments. Without these measures, the deficit could reach
2 percent of GDP in 2005 and 2006.
19.
The authorities were cognizant of the risks but defended their approach. As they
argued last year, tax and expenditure cuts could not be synchronized fully because
expenditure measures had to be implemented by all levels of government, required consensus
and coordination, and could not be expedited. A good part of the planned savings depended
on regional governments, with whom negotiations on a new revenue sharing agreement
(Finanzausgleich) and internal stability pact were ongoing. In the authorities’ view, the longterm benefits of tax reform outweighed the costs of a temporary hike in the deficit. While
they acknowledged the risks inherent in their plans, they pointed out that Austria had already
managed once to reduce taxes while cutting the deficit, and would do it again.
20.
Both sides agreed that, unless the widening of the deficit was limited and
reversed as quickly as possible, further tax reform after 2005 would not be feasible.
•

In the short run, this required securing the savings already planned—namely in
public administration, health spending and other transfers—to contain the deficit in
2005-06. It also meant that the Finanzausgleich that would be concluded this year
should ensure a significant contribution to this effort by subnational governments.

•

In the medium term, success in containing expenditure required a re-thinking of the
role of the state. The ongoing work of the Austria Convention (Box 3) presented an
excellent opportunity to improve efficiency and generate savings at all levels of
government. Moreover, the staff reiterated the recommendation to introduce a
comprehensive medium-term expenditure framework, with multi-year targets broken
down by major program. Work on such a framework had indeed progressed since last
year: a draft linking the objective of a balanced budget over the cycle with overall
spending ceilings by program and by ministry had been prepared. However, it was not
clear that it could be implemented under the existing legal framework, which
envisaged only annual budgets submitted to parliament.

- 10 -

Box 3. Austria Convention
The federal parliament set up in May 2003 a body of experts (Austria Convention) to submit proposals for
reform of the federal constitution so that the state can fulfill its tasks in a cost-effective, transparent, and citizenfriendly way.
The Convention is expected to submit by end-2004 proposals covering a range of issues, including the goals and
tasks of the federal state; division of responsibilities between the federal government, provincial governments,
and municipalities; and the structure of public administration.

21.
There was agreement about the direction of future tax reform. The authorities
saw the main benefit of tax reform in terms of a higher growth potential. Having lowered the
tax burden on capital with the reforms of 2004-05, they intended next to reduce the burden on
labor, which was relatively high. Staff endorsed these plans, which were supported by the
results of its own empirical study showing that (i) reducing government size benefits growth,
and (ii) cuts in direct taxes have a higher effect on growth than cuts in indirect taxes (Box 4).
The authorities welcomed the findings, which they considered supportive of their case for tax
reform.
Box 4. Staff Research on Tax Reform, Government Size, and Growth
While many studies, as well as the experience of several countries, confirm that reducing the fiscal deficit
through expenditure consolidation benefits growth, the literature examining the economic impact of reducing
both taxes and spending simultaneously is not extensive. An empirical study by the staff, based on the
experience of 18 OECD countries and circulated as a Selected Issues paper, suggests the following:
•

Reducing government size (both revenues and expenditures) by 5 percentage points of GDP in high-tax
economies would increase the long-term growth rate by about ¼ of a percentage point per year.

•

This impact could be even higher if tax reductions focus on direct, rather than indirect taxes, because the
former are more distortionary.

•

Lowering corporate taxes has a positive impact on private investment.

C. Financial Sector Issues
22.
The authorities welcomed the findings of the FSAP and broadly agreed with the
key recommendations.2 The mission concluded that the Austrian financial system was
generally sound, well supervised, and resilient to shocks, and had a high level of compliance
with international standards in banking, insurance, securities, and anti-money laundering
(Box 5). Also, indicators of financial vulnerabilities were at comfortable levels (Table 4).
2

See the accompanying Financial System Stability Assessment for details.

- 11 -

Box 5. FSAP Main Findings
The Austrian financial system is generally sound, resilient to shocks, and dominated by banks. The
insurance sector is well developed, but securities markets play a minor role in financing enterprises. The banking
sector consists of about 900 banks with total assets of about 270 percent of GDP at end-2003. It is profitable and
well-capitalized and, in recent years, has seen major restructuring and consolidation: only four of the largest ten
banks in 1990 still exist and government ownership has been reduced drastically. The sector has also seen a
successful expansion in the CEECs, and the large banks have made major strides in adopting best practices in
risk management. These features helped the system weather the recent slowdown relatively well.
Austria enjoys a high standard of financial supervision, based on strong institutions and a modern legal
framework. The consolidation of supervision in the new Financial Market Authority (FMA) in 2002 was
smooth; cooperation among the FMA, OeNB, and Ministry of Finance is good; and the FMA’s capacity to
discharge its mandate is being built quickly and effectively.
Looking forward, the FSAP identified the following medium-term challenges and areas of potential risk.
•

The successful expansion in the CEECs has helped boost the performance of banks, offsetting
chronically low profitability in the home market. But growing exposure to local clients there implies new
risks and requires continued monitoring and vigilance.

•

Despite progress in recent years, bank and branch density in Austria remains high by international
standards, creating room for further restructuring and consolidation. Banks should avoid complacency
arising from high profitability in the CEECs and persevere in their efforts to improve their cost structure.

•

The growth in foreign currency lending, particularly to households that do not have a foreign currency
hedge, is a source of concern. The authorities should continue educating customers about the risks and
helping banks—particularly the smaller ones—improve their risk management.

•

The sectoral deposit insurance system has worked well and incorporates multiple lines of defense. But
the restructuring underway in the banking industry argues in favor of taking a fresh look at the system to
reduce the likelihood of recourse to public funds.

•

Financial supervision should be strengthened further. While ongoing reforms and EU directives in the
pipeline will address most of the remaining gaps, the authorities need to resolve outstanding legal issues, in
particular the public liability of supervisors, so that the latter can carry out their mandate effectively.

23.
All agreed that Austrian banks’ exposure in the CEECs required continued
vigilance, though risks appeared manageable. The ongoing shift from relatively risk-free
assets (government securities) that still dominate the balance sheets of Austrian banks in the
CEECs to loans to local customers called for increased vigilance. To this end, the supervisory
authorities were in close contact with the banks to sensitize them to the risks of doing
business in the CEECs, as well as with local supervisors. In addition to the existing four
Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with CEECs, two MoUs were to be concluded soon
and more were in the pipeline. Finally, the FMA and OeNB were planning to intensify on-site
inspections abroad.
24.
In the authorities’ view, the relatively low domestic profitability of Austrian
banks was not a symptom of inefficiencies but the result of special factors. Although the
overall return on assets was healthy, reflecting the profitability of operations in CEECs, the

- 12 -

cost-income ratio was among the highest in Europe (though still lower than Germany). The
authorities attributed this mainly to Austrian banks’ conservative provisioning, better service,
and the historical legacy of a sector dominated by cooperative banks. They nonetheless
agreed that the prospects of closer cross-border financial integration and intensified
competition at the European level necessitated ongoing cost-cutting efforts. Such adjustment
was already underway in commercial banks, including by closing branches, had indeed been a
factor behind the recent improvement of domestic profitability, and was expected to continue.
25.
In most other areas, the authorities had already begun to address issues
identified by the FSAP:
•

Supervision was adapting quickly to changes in financial markets. The
supervisors had intensified on-site inspections of banks, had issued regulations in
response to recommendations by the FSAP, and planned to issue more. On the
insurance side, in sharp contrast to no on-site inspections a few years ago,
inspections planned for this year alone would cover about half the sector. In the area
of securities supervision, three new directives would, among other things, give the
FMA new instruments to fight insider trading. Also, two guidelines were issued to
strengthen the AML/CFT framework.

•

Governance was being strengthened further. While pointing to an already high
level of compliance with the Code of Corporate Governance in the banking sector, the
authorities outlined plans to introduce by end-2004 standards for internal audits, the
auditing profession, and the number of company boards on which a person can serve.

•

Risks stemming from lending in foreign currency were being addressed. The
proactive stance by supervisors and banks had contributed to a shift away from the
more volatile Japanese yen to Swiss franc loans. Furthermore, the FMA had issued
two minimum standards to improve banks’ risk management; conducted a bank
survey and put under closer prudential supervision those banks found to have weak
risk management; and drafted amendments to the Consumer Protection Act and the
Banking Act requiring full disclosure of risks to consumers.

26.
Changes to the deposit insurance system were not an immediate priority. The
authorities pointed out that the multiple lines of defense in the sectoral deposit insurance
scheme had worked well so far and had not prevented entry of foreign banks and
consolidation. Even though there was room for improvement, changes would require the full
support of banks and thus take time to implement.
D. Structural Policies and Other Issues
27.
The authorities aimed to complete pension reform with the full harmonization of
the public pension systems. The 2003 pension reform had already yielded small budgetary
savings that would increase over time (IMF Country Report No. 03/372, Annex). Moreover,

- 13 -

the decision to let the 10 percent cap on benefit losses expire in 2032 had removed some of
the uncertainty concerning the long-term impact of the reform. The authorities planned to
harmonize the public pension systems by the end of this year, with the main objective of
reducing inequities and distortions; generating additional savings was secondary, to be
achieved only in the long run. However, the authorities faced an uphill battle in building
consensus in key areas. Staff noted that harmonization would ensure fairness between future
pensioners and have positive effects on the labor market by enhancing mobility and removing
the distortions generated by the different contribution rates and benefit levels across schemes.
Staff also noted that, despite the ongoing rationalization of disability pensions, the number of
new claimants remained high.
28.
The authorities intended to maintain the momentum of structural reform. This
was a key component of the government’s economic strategy, and one where very significant
progress had been made since 2000 (Box 6), placing Austria among the top EU members in
terms of implementing the Lisbon Agenda.
29.
The full impact of these reforms on productivity and growth would only be felt
in the medium term, but some encouraging signs were already evident. Labor force
participation of older workers—among the lowest in Europe—rose marginally in 2002-03.
Despite the weak economy, business start-ups jumped over 12 percent in 2003, and R&D
spending actually rose. Partly as a result of plans to cut corporate taxes, there had been a
sharp rise in interest by foreign business in moving operations to Austria. Also, the
liberalization of the electricity sector in 2001 has resulted in lower prices for consumers.
30.
The government planned to continue the push for deregulation. In the near term,
the proposed amendment to the Cartel and Competition Laws would bring Austria fully in
line with EU law. Over the medium term, the government’s priorities would center on further
deregulation of product markets and services and further reductions in red tape. Given the
chronically low productivity growth in Austria’s services sector, staff expressed its support of
this agenda, and urged the authorities to speed up the opening of sheltered sectors to
competition.
31.
Austria has been a strong supporter of multilateral trade liberalization within its
EU membership, and in favor of preferential treatment of poorer countries. The
authorities reiterated their support for the removal of access barriers for non-agricultural
products, and noted that their concerns about trade in agricultural products (such as ensuring
environmental protection and food safety) were fully taken into account in the EU negotiating
positions in the WTO. Concerning the Doha round, the authorities viewed the outcome of the
Cancún Ministerial Conference as a setback, and remained committed to the objectives of the
Doha Development Agenda. While strongly in favor of a rules-based international trade
system, the authorities supported special and differential treatment of developing countries.
As regards CAP reform, they expected only a small macroeconomic or budgetary impact.

Box 6. Main Structural Reforms Since 2000
Privatization: The government sold stakes in ten enterprises, leaving just two enterprises with majority
government stake and five with minority government stakes in the government holding company (ÖIAG). The
ÖIAG is to be dissolved after the completion of privatization.
Competition: Recent reforms have brought Austrian competition law closer to international best practice: an
independent Federal Competition Authority was created under the new legal framework for competition that
came into force in 2002; the Cartel Law was strengthened in 2002 by establishing a federal cartel attorney and
reinforcing the range of sanctions; and draft amendments to the Cartel and Competition Laws designed to bring
the national competition law fully in line with EU law are under deliberation.
Retail, distribution, and trades: Regulations governing the services sector have been eased somewhat. Entry
restrictions on a number of trades were also eased in 2002. The amendment to the Shop Opening Hours Act,
enacted in July 2003, entitles retailers to open their shops for 66 hours a week (as was the case under the old
regulation), but within a more extended time frame. The amendment also sets the maximum shop opening hours
at 72, but implementation has been left to the regional governments.
Network industries: The electricity (2001) and gas sectors (2002) were liberalized ahead of EU deadlines.
Research and development: The government set the goal to raise R&D spending to 2.5 percent of GDP by
2006 and 3 percent of GDP by 2010; granted tax incentives for R&D; set up a national R&D foundation; and,
will provide funds to raise the ratio of public/private spending on R&D to one half.
Labor market: The law restricting placement by private employment agencies was abolished in 2001; a new
severance pay scheme came into force in 2003, extending entitlements and requiring employers to contribute to
employee provident funds; permits for seasonal workers and rules for the employment of foreign nationals were
eased; the 2003 and 2004 budgets included measures to reduce nonwage labor costs, reform part time
employment and the incentive/disincentive system with a view to increasing older workers’ participation and
employment rates. Pending changes to the unemployment benefit system included the introduction of
unemployment insurance on a voluntary basis for the self-employed and limiting conditions under which benefit
recipients can reject job offers.
Business environment: The Industrial Code was liberalized and procedures for the establishment of industrial
plants were shortened in 2001. Steps to promote private entrepreneurship included cuts in red tape, reduction of
the administrative burden on establishing new business, tax concessions for start-ups, funds to strengthen equity
capital for small and medium enterprises, and training in entrepreneurial skills.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
A strategic policy shift since 2000 has made Austria a showcase for reforms. In a
relatively short period of time, Austria has strengthened its public finances; implemented a
bold pension reform that strengthened significantly the long-term sustainability of the system;
began to reduce the tax burden; unified financial sector supervision; modernized the legal and
institutional framework of competition policy; and took measures to make the labor market
more flexible, stimulate R&D, and encourage entrepreneurship.

- 15 -

33.
The near-term economic prospects are positive although uncertainties remain.
The improving global outlook coupled with Austria’s strong competitiveness, as well as the
rebound in domestic investment, provide a sound basis for the recovery. But the pace will
depend on the behavior of consumption, whose prospects are uncertain.
34.
The challenge ahead is to complete the unfinished reform agenda. To manage the
fiscal implications of recent and future reforms, especially of the tax system, while
maintaining a balanced budget over the cycle, the government will need to show the same
perseverance it has shown in implementing its far-reaching structural reform agenda since
2000.
35.
The government’s tax reform plans, whose first major round comes next year,
are appropriate. The reform in 2005 will reduce further the tax burden, make Austria more
attractive as a business location, and boost investment and growth in the long run. Still more
needs to be done in the medium term to achieve the government’s objective to lower the tax
burden to 40 percent of GDP by 2010. The emphasis in the next round of reform should be to
lower the tax burden on labor, which is among the highest in developed countries.
36.
But the success of this and future tax reforms hinges on implementing lasting
expenditure cuts. The planned tax reform implies a widening of the deficit in 2005-06,
possibly up to 2 percent of GDP, meant to be temporary as savings accelerate over time. The
difference in the timing of tax and expenditure measures is understandable. A temporary
deficit of this magnitude would not endanger macroeconomic stability or fiscal sustainability,
but would nonetheless represent a substantial deviation from the government program targets,
raising questions about the government’s medium-term intentions. More importantly, unless
this widening of the deficit is reversed, further tax reform after 2005 will not be feasible.
37.
Putting the budget on the path to structural balance will require additional
efforts by all levels of government. In the short term, the focus should be on implementing
the planned expenditure measures and ensuring that subnational levels of government
contribute to the fiscal effort in order to contain the increase in the deficit in 2005-06. In the
medium term, restoring a structural budget balance and reducing the tax burden further would
require substantial, durable savings that cannot be generated without a re-thinking of the role
of the state. The Austria Convention provides an excellent opportunity for streamlining
relations between the various levels of government, aligning spending authority with taxing
responsibility, redefining the essential functions of the government in a modern market
economy, and improving efficiency in the delivery of public services.
38.
Success of the expenditure reduction measures would also require a
comprehensive medium-term expenditure framework. The Stability Program should be
supplemented by a multi-year framework, with annual targets broken down by major
program. Such a framework would illustrate tradeoffs, enhance transparency, facilitate policy
choices, and strengthen credibility. The advancement of work in this area since last year is

- 16 -

welcome; now the authorities should carry this agenda forward to the cabinet and, eventually,
parliament.
39.
The financial system is generally sound, well supervised, and resilient to shocks.
The banking system is profitable, bank capital ratios are comfortably above prudential
minima, and stress tests confirm the resilience of the system. Austria enjoys a high standard
of financial supervision and a high degree of observance of international standards in
banking, insurance, securities, and anti-money laundering. The authorities are commended
for taking prompt action in areas identified by the FSAP.
40.
Looking forward, there are medium-term challenges and areas of potential risk
in the financial system. The successful expansion in the CEECs has raised the exposure to
risks and requires continued vigilance. Despite progress in recent years, there is still scope for
further restructuring and consolidation in the banking sector. The extent of foreign currency
lending, particularly to households, is a source of concern. The recent measures to make
banks and households more aware of risks are welcome, and the authorities are urged to
continue their proactive approach. The sectoral deposit insurance system has worked well,
but the restructuring underway in the banking industry would require reexamining the system
in the medium term. Financial supervision should be strengthened further, and the
outstanding legal issues be resolved so that supervisors can carry out their mandate
effectively.
41.
The government is encouraged to complete its structural reform agenda. Progress
so far has been substantive, but key tasks remain. Harmonizing the various pension systems
should be the highest priority: delivering on this major commitment would underscore the
government’s credibility and cement the gains from last year’s pension reform. The ongoing
rationalization of disability pensions should be continued, focusing on targeting them to those
truly unable to work. There is considerable scope for efficiency gains and budgetary savings
in the health sector. The authorities are encouraged to continue their efforts to raise labor
force participation of older workers; reduce red tape further; liberalize services; and privatize
the remaining state holdings in the government holding company.
42.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to raise official development assistance
to 0.33 percent of GNP by 2006 and encourages them to raise it further toward the U.N.
target of 0.7 percent of GNP.
43.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

from swaps.
2/ For 2004, authorities' budget and IMF staff's GDP projections. For 2005-06, projections reflect the Stability Program's expenditure
and deficit objectives adjusted for estimated deviations from spending and tax plans based on information provided by the authorities.
Projections for 2007-09 assume unchanged structural balance from 2006.
3/ For 2004, authorities' budget and IMF staff's GDP projections. For 2005-06, projections reflect the Stability Program's expenditure
and deficit objectives adjusted for updated IMF staff projections of yields of spending and tax measures based on information provided
by the authorities. Projections for 2007 reflect the Stability Program's expenditure and deficit objectives. Projections for 2008 assume
a further improvement in the structural and overall balances based on expenditure measures. For 2009, projections assume unchanged
overall and structural balances from the previous year.

of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for international transactions with the
exception of restrictions notified to the Fund (EBD/03/116, 12/17/03) in accordance with
decision No. 144-(52/51) resulting from UN Security Council Resolutions and EU Council
regulations. Furthermore, national restrictions apply with respect to certain terror
organizations and their activists within the EU, implementing decisions in the CFSP
framework of the EU.

APPENDIX II

Austria: Statistical Issues
Austrian statistics are adequate for surveillance. Austria has subscribed to the Fund’s Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and its metadata are available on the Fund’s electronic
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/dsbbhome/).
Austria has taken advantage of the SDDS flexibility options on the timeliness of the
industrial production index and merchandise trade data.
The timeliness of some Austrian statistics could be improved, notably national accounts,
industrial production, the (accrual based) current account, international investment position,
and merchandise trade. Compared to Germany and France, for instance, the publication of
these statistics lags by at least one month.
The transition to the new European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95) has complicated the
analysis of Austrian national accounts and fiscal data. New national accounts data provide no
information on household disposable income (only an economy-wide aggregate), barring the
calculation of a household saving ratio. In addition, the reclassification of public hospitals in
1997 has introduced a break in the national account series on public and private consumption.
Fiscal data from 1995, compiled in accordance with the ESA 95, are not complete. The
government’s stocks of assets, liabilities, and net worth have not yet been reported for
inclusion in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.
There is a large difference between the data on goods trade recorded by the statistical office
(Statistics Austria) and the payments data recorded by the Austrian National Bank. Data on
accrual basis are only available with a long time lag. Data based on the Balance of Payments
Manual, fifth edition are only available back to 1992.

well as the results of sensitivity tests based on shocks (expressed as temporary deviations
from historical means) applied to the baseline scenario in 2004-05. The projections are based
on an “unchanged policies” assumption (Scenario I in Table 3), which is more pessimistic
than the government’s Stability Program. The results are shown in Table 5.
2.
Austria’s general government debt has been stable in recent years. Reflecting the
weak fiscal position in the 1990s, general government debt rose from 57 percent of GDP in
1990 to 67½ percent of GDP in 1999. The policy shift toward fiscal consolidation in 2000
contributed to small decline in the debt ratio by 2003.
3.
The staff’s baseline scenario projects a decline in the general government debt
ratio of about 4 percentage points to about 61 percent of GDP by 2009. This scenario is
predicated on the staff’s macroeconomic forecast for the projection period; the authorities’
budget projection for 2004; and the staff’s fiscal projections for 2005-06. Projections for
2007-09 assume unchanged structural balance from 2006.
4.
The outlook for general government debt appears to be resilient to various
macroeconomic shocks. The general

scenario 7, after an initial peak the debt ratio

government is implausible in Austria, its
implications are nonetheless manageable. This

is even more the case in all other plausible
scenarios.
5.
The only scenario in which the debt dynamics do not show an improvement
should be interpreted with considerable caution. In scenario 1, it is assumed that the
historical means of real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance prevail over the
projection period. In this case, the debt ratio rises marginally (by ½ percentage point of GDP)
but steadily over the projection period without showing any signs of a downward trajectory.
However, this result ignores the systemic policy shift that took place at the turn of the last
decade, as well as Austria’s commitments to the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact. As a result
of this policy shift, the average primary surplus in 2000-03 was 1 percentage point of GDP
higher than the average over the six preceding years also used in the simulation.

Over the longer term, pressures from population aging on the pension system
would rise, but the 2003 pension reform made a key contribution toward the long-term
sustainability of the system. The reform is expected to eliminate over one-third (about
1½ percent of GDP annually) of the projected increase in pension spending in the long run.
Accounting for the direct and indirect effects of the reform, the deficit of the pension system
is projected to rise from about 1½ percent of GDP in 2005 to a peak of 3¾ percent of GDP
around 2035, and decline thereafter as demographic dynamics improve (see IMF Country
Report No. 03/372, Annex). While non-negligible, such deficits would not undermine fiscal
sustainability as long as the government returns to its goal to balance the budget over the
cycle, which would put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a robust downward trajectory.

Statement by Johann Prader, Alternate Executive Director for Austria
August 2, 2004

The Austrian authorities appreciate the consultations with the Fund and the high quality of the
staff report. They broadly agree with the staff's assessment of Austria's economic situation and
its general recommendations on economic and financial policies. They welcome the Selected
Issues study on growth and public finances as useful input for the policy of further lowering the
tax burden. The Austrian authorities also wish to express their appreciation for the very
constructive dialogue with the Fund in the context of the FSAP-mission.
The staff report highlights Austria's good economic performance relative to its European peers
in terms of GDP-growth, unemployment (the lowest in the EU), competitiveness and public
sector deficit.
Short-term outlook
In the first quarter of 2004, at a rate of 0.7 percent of GDP, growth remained surprisingly low,
mainly due to weak growth of private consumption. However, more recent hard data on exports,
construction activity, tourism and employment clearly point to an acceleration of growth, thus
confirming the growth projections of the IMF staff. Exports will be the main driving force and
private consumption will lag behind, as is typical for an upswing in Austria.
Fiscal policy
The government undertook a sharp fiscal adjustment of some 2 percent of GDP in 2001,
resulting in a small budget surplus (0.3 percent in Maastricht definition). The average fiscal
deficit for the period 2000—03 amounted to 0.6 percent which is low by international
comparison and relative to its cyclical position. The government let automatic stabilizers play
fully and implemented three stimulus packages, which were quite successful in terms of private
investment and expenditures for R&D. Investment contributed 1.3 percentage points to GDP
growth in 2003, and the new tax premium for R&D financed expenditures to the tune of
0.15 percentage points, which helped to increase the ratio of spending on R&D as a proportion
of GDP to 2.3 percent in 2004. Also, due to lower tax revenues, the deficit widened to 1.3
percent in 2003. As parts of the 2005 tax reform have been advanced to this year, my authorities
expect a budget deficit of about 1.1 percent of GDP in 2004.
Last year, the staff welcomed the plan for a tax reform in 2005 aimed at lowering the high tax
burden in Austria as a first step towards the 40 percent (of GDP) target ratio to be achieved in
2010. The staff recommended that the system be simplified and that the burden on factors of
production be lowered. In May 2004, parliament adopted the tax reform amounting to 1.3
percent of GDP. The personal income tax schedule was simplified and the tax-free income
threshold was increased, in particular for families and single parents. Some minor taxes were
abolished or reduced. Most importantly, the corporate tax rate was reduced by 9 percentage
points from 34 percent to 25 percent (while, the tax base was broadened) and a group taxation
was introduced in order to foster Austria as a headquarter location. Incidentally, this tax reform

-2is consistent with the econometric evidence from the very interesting Selected Issues study of
the staff on growth-enhancing fiscal reform. Notably, the reduction of the corporate tax rate has
led to a significant interest of foreign companies in investing in Austria.
We see no danger of pro-cyclicality of the tax reform, as the output gap will remain negative
until 2006, previous investment incentives will phase out and reductions of public expenditure
will phase in. Thus, the tax reform will support the Austrian economy on its way back to
potential output, but will not lead to any overheating. As to the widening of the deficit to close
to 2 percent in 2005, it is to be noted that this figure is still within the cyclical safety margin of
the SGP and the government is strongly committed to ensuring that this is only a temporary
departure from the government goal of a balanced budget over the cycle.
Austria will continue its reform process, cut public expenditure and achieve a balanced budget
again in 2008. The next major steps will be the renewal of the internal stability pact and a
revision of the law regulating fiscal relations between national and regional authorities. The
Austria Convention aims at revising the role of the state, including a reduction of administrative
layers. The Ministry of Finance has recently sent a proposal for a medium-term expenditure
framework to the Convention.
Pension harmonization
Since the release of the staff report, important progress has been achieved in the harmonization
of the various public pay-as-you-go pension systems. After 22 rounds of extensive negotiations
with the social partners, the Government agreed on the reform on July 12. The draft law will be
submitted to the parliament in autumn and will become effective on January 1, 2005.
Let me briefly point out the main pillars of the reform:
• Individual, transparent pension accounts will be set up for all pension entitlements,
regardless of the various pension systems. Thus, the distortions from the old system and
mobility barriers between civil servants, workers, farmers and self-employed will be
removed.
• The base for the contributions will be harmonized, with the same floor and ceiling for all
insured. The contribution rate will be 22.8 percent of gross wages, but farmers and selfemployed will pay 15 percent and 17.5 percent, respectively.
• Several provisions will address social hardship, allow for a more flexible entry age, and
reward parenting, unemployment, military service etc.
• The system will also include a factor correcting for increasing life expectancy.
• Persons currently above 55 years of age will stay in the old system.
This harmonization of the pension systems is broadly in line with the recommendations in the
staff report and will secure the long- term sustainability of public finances.
Other structural policies
Privatizations continued with the sale of the federal housing company to private investors. An
amendment to the competition and cartel law is in preparation in order to bring the Austrian
competition law fully in line with European standards.

-3FSSA
1. General Assessment
Coming so soon after the establishment of the new Financial Market Authority (FMA),
the FSAP process provided a valuable and timely “supervision“ of Austrian financial
market supervision. The Austrian authorities are pleased with the results, which they see
both as a confirmation of the solidity of their supervisory institutions, and as valuable
encouragement for further improvement.
2. Two results of the FSSA are particularly noteworthy:
1) The confirmation of the overall stability of the financial system, and of the
successful strategy of the Austrian banks in Central and Eastern Europe, and
of their strategies in financial consolidation and improvement of domestic
earnings.
2) The confirmation of the reform of financial supervision in the form of the new
supervisory structure, in particular the launching of the new Financial Market
Authority, and of the successful inter-institutional cooperation with the other
supervisory agencies, i.e. the ministry of finance and the central bank. The
FSSA will bolster their intentions to strengthen the legal provisions for the
supervisor by enhancing the FMA’s powers to regulate, as part of the process
of implementation of Basel II. This will address the concern, relating to the
FMA’s regulatory powers expressed by the mission.
3. Future work
i) Deposit Insurance
While the current system functions well and no medium-term problem appears likely to
arise. Nevertheless, in the longer run certain adjustments should be considered, to take
into account new developments in the banking system both in Austria and in the rest of
Europe. The authorities are therefore exploring solutions along the lines suggested by the
IMF.
ii) New pension instruments ("Zukunftsvorsorge")
The FMA, as regulator has taken care to design adequate risk management instruments in
the financial sector for the guarantees extended. Further, the FMA has introduced
additional reporting requirements and conducts ad hoc surveys to actively monitor the
risks involved. The FMA plans the publication of the results to ensure high market
transparency. The FMA will also develop further prudential guidelines for this sector.
From the point of view of bank and insurance supervision, the risks are well managed and

-4early monitoring of any emerging unwelcome trends is ensured, enabling the authorities
to take appropriate steps at any time.
iii) Public Liability
Efforts to address this issue are already well advanced, on the basis of discussions that
were conducted independently of the FSAP. The intention is to address the following
issues:
• Clarify that the auditor is acting for the company audited and not for
the FMA, thus excluding liability in all cases where the auditor is not
commissioned by the FMA.
•

Identify the Federal Republic as the principal addressee of claims.

•

Discuss public liability in connection with the reform of the deposit
insurance system

iv) Foreign Currency Lending
A number of important measures have already been taken, prior and during the FSAP,
which are aimed at:
-

-

Informing consumers very clearly about features and risks of some instruments used
for foreign currency lending. Also, through extensive public debate on the subject,
both the FMA and the OeNB have created public awareness of the issue.
Obliging banks to ascertain fully the information level of their customers
Publishing guidelines on this issue
Finally, the FMA is also considering some legal steps to enhance client information
and ensure risk awareness of consumers.

4. Anti Money Laundering
The FSSA shows that Austria has achieved a high level of compliance with the FATF
40+8 Recommendations for AML/CFT. There has been substantial progress in the last
years, as a result of important legal amendments and an active policy by the FMA, as
well as acute awareness and support from the private sector. Moreover, the FSAP-process
has also provided an important incentive for Austria to further review and enhance its
AML / CFT regime consistent with international best practices, and implement additional
active monitoring measures.
Many of the recommendations in the report are already being actively implemented in
Austria. Further guidance notes are currently being drafted by the FMA. The FIU shares
practical knowledge in a very pro-active policy of seminars and awareness-raising
meetings with financial institutions, and the onsite inspections program has been both
intensified and increased. Also, Austria, as part of the EU, is actively working on a

-5common implementation of the new 40 Recommendations (2003) to improve its system
further.
Finally, we would like to underline that, as a member of the European Union, Austria is
actively engaged in the further development of a number of projects related to all the
assessed sectors, and expects that many of the suggestions of the IMF will be implemented in
Austria either through the implementation of already existing EU Directives such as the
Market Abuse Directive, or the Prospectus Directive, and the Investment Services Directive
II (Financial Instruments Market Directive) or through the implementation of documents that
are still under discussion such as the Basel II Directive or the 3rd Anti Money Laundering
Directive.

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Austria
On August 2, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Austria.1
Background
The government in power since 2000 has set the objectives to balance the budget over
the cycle, reduce the tax burden to 40 percent of GDP by 2010, contain fiscal pressures
from population ageing, and increase Austria’s growth potential. Concrete steps so far
include the first (albeit small) fiscal surplus in more than 30 years in 2001; pension reform
in 2003; privatization and deregulation in product and labor markets over the past four
years; and tax reform in 2004-05.
Austria has weathered the global slowdown relatively well. Real GDP grew 1 percent per year
during 2001-03, buoyed by strong exports during most of the period. This was broadly in line
with the average growth of the EU, but more than Austria’s major EU partners. Despite a
rebound of fixed investment in the second half of 2003, growth of real GDP decelerated to
0.7 percent as private consumption growth came to a halt in the last quarter. However, other
indicators point to a gradual recovery of activity. The current account remained broadly
balanced and competitiveness strong in 2003, despite the appreciation of the euro.
Unemployment rose almost 1 percentage point during 2001-03, but, at 4.4 percent in
mid-2004, remains well below the EU average. Inflation averaged 1.8 percent during the same

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2period, among the lowest in the euro zone, and its rise to 2.1 percent in May 2004 reflects the
impact of higher energy prices.
Short-term economic prospects are positive, although risks remain. Growth of real GDP is
expected to pick up to 1.6 percent in 2004 and average 2.4 percent in 2005, supported by
robust investment and exports. There are uncertainties related to the behavior of private
consumption and the global environment, but risks to the outlook are balanced. The inflation
outlook is benign.
Austria’s fiscal policy has been guided by the objective to maintain a balanced budget over the
cycle while making room for tax cuts. At 1.4 percent of GDP (on ESA95 basis), the general
government deficit was on target in 2003. It is expected to narrow to 1.2 percent of GDP in
2004, 0.4 percent of GDP above budget plans, but consistent with maintaining the broad
structural balance achieved in 2003. Following some measures in 2004, the first significant
step in tax reform is planned for 2005. However, tax reform will contribute to a temporary
widening of the general government deficit in 2005-06 as the corresponding expenditure
savings needed to maintain a balanced budget over the cycle will come on stream gradually.
Given the short-term outlook, this would represent a procyclical relaxation of fiscal policy in
these two years. The government envisages a return to budget balance by 2008, when the
next wave of tax reform is planned.
The recent Financial Sector Assessment Program concluded that the Austrian financial system
is generally sound, well supervised, and resilient to shocks. Compliance with international
standards in banking, insurance, securities, and anti-money laundering is high. The banking
sector is profitable and well-capitalized, and has seen major restructuring, consolidation, and a
successful expansion in Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) in recent years.
Moreover, the large banks have made major strides in adopting best practices in risk
management. Looking ahead, there are areas of potential risk stemming primarily from the
exposure of Austrian banks in the CEECs and to foreign currency loans to households, and
scope for strengthening supervision and reviewing the current deposit insurance system over
the medium term.
Progress on the structural front has been impressive since 2000. Structural reforms are
expected to boost productivity and growth in the long run, and some encouraging signs are
already emerging. However, there is still unfinished business, most notably the harmonization
of the various public pension schemes—a key commitment of the government.

Executive Directors commended the authorities for their success in balancing the budget,
reducing taxes, containing public spending, and launching a reform process that has shown
impressive results in a relatively short period of time. This sound record of economic
management has helped Austria weather the global slowdown relatively well. Directors
endorsed the authorities’ medium-term macroeconomic policy objectives of sustaining a
balanced budget over the cycle, further reducing the tax burden, and pursuing structural
reforms to increase Austria’s growth potential. In this connection, the main policy focus in the

-3period ahead should be to deal with the fiscal implications of tax and other reforms while
maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Directors considered the short-term economic prospects to be generally favorable.
They anticipated that the gradual recovery under way will strengthen toward the end of this
year and accelerate in 2005, although a number expressed doubts about the strength of
private consumption.
Directors agreed that tax reform over the medium term would improve Austria’s international
competitiveness and boost its growth potential, and in this vein, they supported the authorities’
tax reform plans for 2005. Consistent with the objective of lowering the tax burden to 40
percent of GDP by 2010, Directors suggested that the focus in the next round of tax reform
should be on reducing the tax burden on labor, which is relatively high by international
standards.
Directors stressed that the success of tax reforms will hinge on the implementation of durable
expenditure cuts, in particular in the areas of the public administration, health, and transfers.
On current plans, the deficit in 2005-06 is likely to widen as a result of the tax reform, but
would narrow again as expenditure savings come on stream in future years. Directors
observed that the targeted deficit increase in 2005-06 will represent a substantial deviation
from the objective of a cyclically adjusted balance, and the fiscal position would not return to
balance until about 2007. Moreover, if the announced expenditure savings do not materialize
fully, even these targets may be exceeded, raising questions about the government’s mediumterm policy intentions. In that light, a number of Directors encouraged the authorities to strive
to bring the fiscal deficit in 2005-06 as close as possible to the target in order to protect policy
credibility and ensure that further tax reforms can be implemented in later years. Directors
observed that all levels of government will need to contribute to the fiscal consolidation, and
viewed the ongoing negotiations with regional governments on a revenue sharing agreement
as an opportunity to impress on them the need for savings at the regional level.
Directors concurred with the authorities that a fundamental redefinition of the role of the state
in a modern market economy such as Austria’s will be required to achieve the lasting savings
needed to further reduce the tax burden and return to a structural budget balance. Toward that
end, the work by the Austria Convention on a new constitution will provide an opportunity for
streamlining relations between all levels of government and improving the efficiency of public
services. In the same vein, Directors welcomed the progress made in designing a
comprehensive medium-term fiscal framework, which will improve the transparency, planning,
and implementation of spending decisions, and they encouraged the authorities to take the
necessary legislative steps to implement it.
Directors welcomed that the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) had found
the Austrian financial system to be generally sound, well supervised, and resilient to shocks.
Compliance with international standards in the areas of banking, insurance, and securities is
high. Directors also welcomed the prompt action taken by the authorities to address areas
identified by the FSAP, including recent steps to strengthen financial supervision further and
deal with the risks stemming from foreign currency lending. Directors observed that the

-4expansion of Austrian banks in central and eastern Europe will require continued monitoring
and vigilance to diminish the exposure of the banking sector to possible new risks. Looking
ahead, further restructuring and consolidation in the financial system are likely to continue,
requiring the authorities to maintain their proactive approach to supervision of the sector.
Directors commended Austria’s record of leadership in applying standards to counter money
laundering and the financing of terrorism, and welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
continually review and enhance this regime consistent with international best practices.
Directors praised the authorities for their notable achievements on the structural front, and
encouraged them to follow through with their reform agenda, as further deregulation of the
economy will boost productivity and growth in the long run. Top priority should be given to the
harmonization of the public and private sector pension schemes to bolster the credibility of the
government and improve the fairness of the pension system. Directors urged the authorities to
intensify their efforts to rationalize the disability pension, reform the health sector to raise
efficiency and generate budgetary savings, liberalize services further, and complete the
privatization program. Directors noted the favorable performance of the labor market even
during the slowdown, but called for further steps to raise the participation of older workers in
the labor force.
Directors welcomed Austria’s commitment to trade liberalization and the objectives of the Doha
Development Agenda. They commended Austria’s contribution to official development
assistance, and looked forward to further increases toward the UN target of 0.7 percent of
GNP.
