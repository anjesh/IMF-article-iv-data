EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions with Jordan focused on the appropriate policy
response to mounting fiscal and external vulnerabilities and higher inflation.
Background
The economy continued to perform well in 2007, with 6 percent real GDP growth and lower
unemployment. However, sharply higher world fuel and food prices led to a marked widening
of the fiscal and external current account deficits and, more recently, a jump in inflation.
Economic prospects remain broadly favorable, though the public and external sector
imbalances imply increased challenges to sustaining strong macroeconomic performance.
Authorities’ views
The authorities plan to lower the fiscal deficit in 2008, despite pressures to increase spending
following the removal of fuel subsidies. Although specific measures have not yet been
identified, they expect to reduce the deficit substantially more over the medium term, mainly
via lower expenditure growth.
The exchange rate peg has anchored monetary policy and prevented an even larger
deterioration of the current account last year, when there was upward pressure on the dinar.
Interest rate differentials against the U.S. will be allowed to widen further to curb inflationary
pressures and credit growth.
Structural reforms are proceeding, aimed at reducing distortions and enhancing the private
sector’s growth prospects.
Staff recommendations
The planned tightening of fiscal policy in 2008 will help narrow the fiscal and external
imbalances and bring inflation down. Significant further fiscal consolidation is needed over
the medium-term to reduce the still-high public debt and the large current account deficit.
The peg remains appropriate for Jordan. As long as short-term capital inflows remain limited,
there is scope to tighten monetary conditions to stem inflation.
Progress on the structural reform agenda is key to sustaining strong economic performance.
Priority areas include public financial management, the framework for public-private
partnerships, liberalization of the petroleum sector, developing the debt market, and
continued enhancement of financial sector supervision.

I. BACKGROUND
A. Overview
1.
Jordan’s macroeconomic performance in recent years has been very strong,
supported by the implementation of sound policies and wide-ranging structural
reforms. GDP growth has averaged 6 percent annually since the beginning of the decade,
resulting in an increase in per capita GDP of over 60 percent. Inflation has remained
generally low, and efforts to tighten fiscal policy have facilitated a significant decline in the
public debt stock. Although the current account deficit has widened, a significant pickup in
FDI inflows has enabled a tripling of foreign reserves from 1999 to 2007.

2.
Over the past year, higher international food and fuel prices have pushed up
inflation and widened the fiscal and external deficits. The key near-term policy challenges
are to bring inflation back down quickly and to mitigate risks related to fiscal and external
vulnerabilities. Accordingly, the discussions focused on:
•

fiscal policy adjustment to contain inflationary pressures, bring down public debt, and
contribute to a faster current account adjustment;

•

the scope for monetary policy tightening to lower inflation expectations; and

•

structural reforms to support the fiscal adjustment and facilitate higher growth.

5
B. Recent Developments
3.
The economy continued to perform well in 2007 in a more challenging external
environment. Real GDP grew by 6 percent and the unemployment rate fell further (Figure 1
and Table 1). FDI inflows remained strong and international reserves increased substantially.
Inflation, which had picked up following the fuel price adjustment in 2006, declined from
almost 9 percent (year-on-year) in early 2007 to below 4 percent by mid-year. However,
rapidly rising world fuel and food prices put pressure on the fiscal and external accounts in
the second half of the year. Inflation started to pick up again in late 2007 and jumped to
14 percent (y-o-y) in March 2008, following a 47 percent average increase in petroleum
product prices.1 Core inflation also picked up, but remains below 5 percent.

the overall public debt stock to 73 percent of GDP (Figure 2).
5.
Despite a sizable deterioration in the external current account, the reserves
position strengthened. The current account deficit widened to 17½ percent of GDP in 2007,
reflecting higher import costs, a slowdown in export growth, and a shortfall in external grants
(Table 4). Weakness in the textile sector dampened overall export performance, despite
strong growth in exports of nontraditional products and to faster-growing destinations in the
Middle East and Asia (Figure 3). Import volume expansion moderated to 3 percent, but
sharply higher prices translated into a 17 percent increase in the total import bill. In addition,
errors and omissions—which may partly reflect unrecorded current receipts—more than
doubled to 8 percent of GDP. Continued strong FDI and portfolio inflows financed the
current account deficit. The latter also contributed to the strong performance of the Amman
Stock Exchange (up 36 percent in 2007). The real effective exchange rate depreciated by
4 percent in 2007 on account of the weakening dollar, to which the dinar is pegged. Reserves
rose to $6.9 billion by year-end, equivalent to five months of prospective imports, from
$6.1 billion at end-2006 (Table 5). A buyback of nonconcessional Paris Club debt was
completed at end-March 2008 (Box 1). Correspondingly, reserves declined to $5.4 billion.
Box 1. Paris Club Debt Buyback
In March 2008, Jordan finalized a $2.4 billion debt buyback operation with its Paris Club
creditors. The buyback covered all previously rescheduled nonconcessional debt, which was
retired through a $2.1 billion payment to Paris Club creditors. The operation involved a
principal face value reduction of around 11 percent. Financing for the operation was covered
by privatization revenues and external grants.
The buyback operation will (i) reduce Jordan’s large debt burden, with external debt falling
from 46 percent of GDP in 2007 to 28 percent in 2008;1 (ii) send a positive signal to investors
and rating agencies; (iii) provide external debt service saving of roughly 1¼ percent of GDP
per year; and (iv) reduce the nondollar share of external debt. A key objective of the authorities
had been to reduce the high share of debt denominated in currencies other than the dollar,
whose depreciation in 2006 and 2007 raised Jordan’s external debt—in dollar and dinar
terms—by 2 percentage points of GDP in each year.
Following the buyback operation, reserves fell to $5.4 billion, equivalent to 3.7 months of
prospective imports and almost 9 times short-term debt on a remaining maturity basis. At close
to one-third of GDP, reserves remain sufficient to withstand the full (but unlikely) reversal of
all the non-FDI private capital that has flowed into Jordan during the last three years.
_____________________________

The buyback accounts for an 11 percentage point of GDP reduction in gross external debt,
with the remainder reflecting net amortization payments to other creditors as well as nominal
GDP growth.

6.
Monetary policy remained geared toward maintaining the exchange rate peg.
The overnight interest rate was cut by 50 basis points (bps) in September 2007, following the
reduction in the Fed funds rate (Figure 4). Since then, despite a further 250 bps cumulative
cut in the Fed funds rate, the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) has lowered its key policy rate by
only 25 bps (in early February) to avoid an excessively accommodative monetary stance
(Tables 6 and 7). So far, there are no indications that the widening interest differential has
attracted significant short-term capital inflows. Bank prudential indicators have remained
steady, with the average risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio easing to a still-healthy
19 percent in mid-2007. Although private credit growth moderated to 15 percent by end2007, the banking system’s loan-deposit ratio continued to edge up (Box 2). Financial
supervision was enhanced via the issuance of regulations on corporate governance, risk
management, and internal control systems in the banking sector. In addition, the CBJ
launched an annual financial stability report in late 2007.

7.
Staff’s analysis of the real exchange rate shows no clear evidence that the dinar
is misaligned. While alternative methodologies yield a considerable dispersion in
misalignment estimates, the average estimate is very small (Box 3). Analysis of the current
account indicates that transient factors—including temporary factors related to the conflict in
Iraq, terms of trade movements, and mining sector production stoppages—may account for
as much as one-half of the deficit in 2007, implying that the “underlying” current account is
stronger than the actual level. Moreover, the risk of external instability from the capital
account is limited since FDI constitutes the bulk of inflows, external debt is almost entirely to
official creditors, and reserves are very comfortable in relation to short-term liabilities.2
8.
Significant progress was achieved in the structural area over the past year. On
the fiscal side, this includes the introduction of a new chart of accounts, preparation of an

misalignment estimates and analyze the factors accounting for the large current account deficit, respectively.

integrated medium-term expenditure framework, and enhancement of the macro-fiscal unit in
the Ministry of Finance (MOF). In the privatization area, the successful initial public offering
of 71 percent of the shares of Royal Jordanian airline and the privatization of three electricity
companies were completed in recent months. In the financial area, an anti-money laundering
(AML) law was enacted in 2007 and an AML unit was established in the CBJ. An electronic
check clearing system became operational in 2007. The recent establishment of a Dow Jones
index for the Amman Stock Exchange is expected to further enhance foreign investment,
which already accounts for about one-half of market capitalization.
Box 2. Banking Sector Developments
Banks’ loan growth has outpaced that of deposits in recent years. Credit expansion has
predominantly been in local currency, reflecting prudential restrictions on foreign currency lending.
Loans for real estate and to buy stocks have grown rapidly in recent years, though their pace
decelerated in 2007. Several banks are now close to the 20 percent real estate exposure limit, which
includes loans to the construction sector.
Deposit growth has tapered off. This partly reflects changes in the investment policy of the Social
Security Corporation, which has reduced its bank deposits in favor of bonds, equities, and
privatized assets. Deposit dollarization is declining but remains substantial.
Bank lending and deposit interest rates increased in 2007. Interbank rates edged down, reflecting
lower policy rates and some scaling back of liquidity operations by the CBJ (through issuance of
certificates of deposit).

countries.
Assessment of the level of the REER by a variety of commonly applied methods presents a more
mixed picture. The relative PPP approach points to significant undervaluation of the dinar as of end2007. The macroeconomic balance, external sustainability, and equilibrium REER approaches—
whether evaluated at projected values of macro fundamentals for 2013 or by stripping out temporary
factors from the 2007 current account—provide no consistent findings. Whereas the macroeconomic
balance approach suggests that the dinar is overvalued, estimates from the external sustainability and
the equilibrium REER approaches are consistent with fundamentals.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Outlook
9.
The near-term outlook remains generally favorable, but fiscal and external
vulnerabilities have increased. Real GDP growth is expected to ease slightly to 5½ percent
in 2008, with continued robust activity in construction and tourism broadly offsetting weaker
external demand.3 Inflation is projected to moderate to 9 percent (y-o-y) by December,
assuming the fiscal tightening envisaged by the authorities is implemented. Despite high
import prices and weakness of textile exports, the current account deficit is projected to
narrow moderately to 15½ percent of GDP due to a recovery of grants and buoyant prices
of mining exports, and is expected to be financed by continued strong FDI and portfolio
flows.
10.
The fiscal and external imbalances are projected to narrow gradually over the
medium term. Under the baseline outlook, growth is projected to recover to 6 percent—
broadly in line with estimated trend—supported by continued strong investment inflows,
especially from the region. As the effect of the recent fuel price adjustments on headline
inflation wears off, and given the exchange rate peg, CPI inflation is expected to converge to
trading partner countries’ levels. The fiscal deficit is projected to come down moderately to
4½ percent of GDP by 2013, with lower spending—in relation to GDP—more than offsetting
a decline in grants. Thus, the

Application of the WEO commodity price projections for 2013 to 2007 trade volumes implies a temporary
adverse price effect of 6½ percent of GDP on the import side in 2007, which was partly offset by a temporary
boost to mining exports by 1½ percent of GDP (Chapter II of the 2008 Selected Issues Paper contains details).

11
11.
The main risks relate to the relatively high public debt and current account
deficit. In the near term, continued escalation of world fuel and food prices could widen the
current account deficit and intensify pressures to relax fiscal policy. Also, the large external
financing requirement is a vulnerability, although FDI inflows, especially from oil-producing
countries in the region, are expected to remain strong. Over the medium term, government
and government-guaranteed debt is expected to decline in relation to GDP, but will remain
high in comparison with many emerging market economies. Adverse shocks—to growth,
interest rates, grants, or the exchange rate—would result in a significantly higher debt path
(Appendix I). While the baseline external debt outlook is favorable—outstanding external
debt is expected to decline to 14 percent of GDP by 2013—and shocks to growth, interest
rates, and the current account would have a relatively moderate impact, the gross financing
requirement would remain sizable, implying continued vulnerability to a sharp slowdown in
capital inflows (Appendix II).

B. Fiscal Policy
12.
The 2008 budget aims at containing the expenditure pressures that emerged in
2007. Along with the removal of petroleum subsidies in early February, a monthly fuel price
adjustment mechanism was implemented, greatly reducing the vulnerability of the budget to
future oil price developments.5 The authorities estimate that, at a world oil price of
$95/barrel, fuel subsidies could have been 5.8 percent of GDP higher in 2008 had the price
adjustment not been implemented. Compensatory expenditure measures were also taken to
protect vulnerable groups. The measures, which amount to 3.5 percent of GDP, include an
increase in public sector salaries and an expansion of social safety net transfers (Box 4).
While acknowledging that the salary increase would make the overall structure of public
spending more rigid, the authorities emphasized that mechanisms for precisely targeting
sizable social assistance were not available and the measures had, in fact, reached many of

the mechanism. Prices of LPG remain subsidized and are not covered by the monthly mechanism.

the most vulnerable. They also noted that the compensatory package had succeeded in
winning public acceptance for a difficult measure, which implied a fiscal deficit that would
be almost 2½ percent of GDP lower than if fuel subsidies had not been removed. A
supplementary budget that is currently under preparation will seek additional budget
allocations to fully cover the cost of the compensatory measures.

Box 4. Fuel Price Adjustment and Compensatory Measures
Following the 47 percent average price increase in February, petroleum product prices are
being adjusted on a monthly basis. A committee composed of representatives from several
ministries and the Petroleum Refinery now sets fuel prices based on the world average oil price in
the preceding month, as well as transportation and handling costs. A similar pricing mechanism has
been in place for some products—including jet fuel—from last year.
The social impact of removing fuel subsidies was softened by expanding wages, pensions, and
social spending. The 2008

including allocations in the

13
13.
The authorities intend to undertake additional policy effort in order to reduce
the budget deficit in 2008 relative to 2007. They noted that pressures to increase spending
had intensified in recent months, especially in the wake of the fuel subsidy removal and cuts
in food subsidies. Nevertheless, recognizing the importance of reining in the fiscal position,
the authorities emphasized that additional measures of about 1½ percent of GDP will be
taken in order to achieve the original budget deficit target of 5½ percent. Some revenue
measures are already in place, including a gasoline tax and higher mining royalties, and
further measures will be included in the supplementary budget. Significant underutilization
of capital spending allocations, which were increased by 33 percent in the budget, and some
restraint in executing current spending as well as further modest gains in tax administration
are expected to yield additional savings. Thus, the total fiscal policy adjustment, including
the net impact of removing fuel subsidies, would amount to almost 4 percent of GDP in
2008. External grants are also expected to recover modestly from last year.
14.
The authorities agreed that further consolidation of the public finances is needed
over the medium term. To that end, parliament has recently adopted a revised public debt
management law, which enshrines the authorities’ existing medium-term overall public debt
target as a ceiling of 60 percent of GDP in 2011. Even with the envisaged tightening this
year, however, the ceiling is likely to be only just met. The staff’s baseline projections—
based on unchanged policies—suggest that the budget deficit excluding grants would decline
by almost 3 percentage points over the medium term, but lower grants would keep the overall
deficit above 4½ percent of GDP. By contrast, tighter fiscal policy to achieve a primary
surplus by 2011—implying an overall deficit of less than 3 percent—would lower debt to
about 55 percent of GDP. The authorities agreed that aiming toward a more ambitious debt
target would be appropriate, especially given the upfront debt reduction provided by the Paris
Club buyback. They believe a moderate but steady decline in current spending relative to
GDP is both desirable and achievable. With public-private partnership (PPP) projects
expected to pick up, they also see scope for lower capital expenditure (in relation to GDP).
Thus, they expect to achieve a significantly lower fiscal deficit over the medium term than in
the staff’s baseline projections.
15.
Ongoing fiscal structural reforms will help strengthen the fiscal position. The
authorities indicated that the public financial management system is being enhanced, with
further progress expected in the coming months on implementing the treasury single account,
and the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS) soon to move into
the implementation phase. Steps are also being taken to improve budget coverage and
classification. In addition, they have resolved the long-standing issue of the government’s
overdraft facility with the CBJ, and the outstanding balance (from previous years) will be
retired by issuing government bonds to the CBJ.

14
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
16.
The exchange rate peg continues to underpin monetary policy, though the
authorities see some scope for tightening. The CBJ has allowed interest rate differentials
against the U.S. to widen in recent months. While there has been some switching from dollar
to domestic currency deposits, the authorities have not detected a significant pickup in shortterm capital inflows, and reserves have held broadly stable. They also observed that
prudential limits on banks’ open foreign exchange exposure, together with rules that bar
foreign currency lending to clients without export earnings, meant that banks had little
incentive to mobilize relatively inexpensive funding from abroad. Thus, they see some room
to let interest differentials widen further and possibly also for some increase in certain policy
rates, which they expect will help keep inflation expectations in check. They were confident
that underlying inflationary pressures remained well contained and, correspondingly,
headline inflation would moderate quickly following the large fuel price adjustments in
February.
17.
The authorities believe that the real exchange rate of the dinar is in line with
fundamentals. They concurred with the results of the staff’s exchange rate analysis. They
observed that the peg had been critical in achieving relatively low inflation in recent years,
and had likely prevented an even larger current account deterioration in 2007, especially in
the first three quarters when reserves were increasing rapidly. They expressed concern over
the widening of the current account deficit in 2007, but noted that this was due in large part
to transient factors. In addition, they believed the large increase in errors and omissions
partly reflected unrecorded current receipts. They also noted that the envisaged fiscal
consolidation, the coming onstream of new mining exports, and an increase in grant inflows
would narrow the current account substantially over the medium term.
D. Financial Sector Policies
18.
Banks’ prudential indicators remain strong. Banks are well capitalized, nonperforming loan ratios are low, and strict loan classification and provisioning rules require
banks to maintain adequate loan-loss provisions. Although the share of credit to the
construction sector and to purchase stocks has increased in recent years, the authorities
emphasized that prudential regulations are in place to curb banks’ exposure to real estate and
the stock market. They expressed some concern over the continued rise in the loan-deposit
ratio, especially in some of the smaller banks that now have relatively high ratios and have
increasingly relied on the interbank market to fund their lending. The authorities noted that
prudential limits on the sources versus uses of funds were under consideration, to help
mitigate funding risk and curb credit growth, thereby also reducing inflationary pressures.
19.
The regulatory and institutional framework for the financial sector is being
enhanced further. The implementation of Basel II standards is now underway (from 2008)
for the banking sector. The authorities noted that the new standards, together with the recent

15
corporate governance regulations, reflect an emphasis on a risk-based rather than a
compliance-based approach to banking supervision. They are looking forward to the FSAP
Update mission later this year, which they expect will help prioritize future reforms. They
also mentioned that credit bureau legislation is under discussion, which is expected to boost
the further development of the financial system. As regards the broader capital market, the
authorities noted that accounting standards and margin financing regulations had been
brought into line with international best practice in recent years, particularly following the
implementation of tougher margin and capital requirements for brokerage firms in 2006.
Looking forward, further enhancements to disclosure requirements are under consideration
and efforts will focus on developing the secondary debt market.
E. Other Issues
20.
Structural reforms in other areas are envisaged to help sustain strong economic
performance. A regulatory framework for PPP projects to attract private financing for public
investment projects is being established. To guard against fiscal risks, MOF representatives
are to be part of the PPP project approval committee. Plans to fully liberalize the petroleum
sector over the next 2–3 years are being drawn up to further reduce fiscal risks and improve
the efficiency of resource allocation. The authorities are also considering reforms to the
social security system that aim at improving the actuarial soundness of the pension system.
21.
The authorities expect to meet the remaining requirements for Special Data
Dissemination Standards (SDDS) subscription by end-2008. New surveys have been
implemented to improve the compilation and timeliness of wages and earnings data. Efforts
are also being made to align the coverage of budget revenues and expenditures with
government financing flows, which should help reduce the sizable statistical discrepancy in
the fiscal accounts.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
22.
Jordan’s economy continues to grow at a brisk pace, but policy challenges to
sustaining strong economic performance have intensified. Inflation has picked up and the
fiscal and external deficits have widened on account of sharply higher world food and fuel
prices. Macroeconomic policy tightening is needed to bring inflation back down and reduce
fiscal and external vulnerabilities, thereby helping ensure a continued favorable outlook.
23.
The authorities’ intention to tighten fiscal policy is welcome. The removal of fuel
subsidies in early 2008 was a bold but necessary step, and sizable compensatory measures
were understandably implemented in order to gain public acceptance and protect vulnerable
groups. Achieving the targeted narrowing of the budget deficit will require significant
tightening, resisting additional spending pressures, and continued full operation of the new
fuel price adjustment mechanism. The lower deficit will be critical for bringing inflation
down, reducing the external imbalance, and preventing a crowding out of private credit that
could dampen overall growth.

16
24.
Further consolidation of the public finances will be needed over the medium
term to bring the fiscal imbalance to a more comfortable level. The revised public debt
management law, which places a ceiling on public debt, will anchor the budgetary position.
Nevertheless, gearing fiscal policy toward a more ambitious target of at most 55 percent of
GDP would leave some cushion for possible unforeseen demands on the budget. Given the
high level of government spending relative to the size of the economy—over 40 percent of
GDP at present—fiscal expenditure restraint would create needed space for the private sector
and strengthen medium-term growth prospects.
25.
Current account adjustment would also be facilitated by tighter fiscal policy. A
gradual unwinding of transient factors and some softening of world commodity prices is
expected to narrow the external deficit over the medium term. While private capital (mainly
investment) inflows are expected to fully cover the deficit, Jordan will remain vulnerable to a
slowdown in capital inflows, and stronger fiscal adjustment would help limit risks to external
stability. In this context, the Paris Club debt buyback has lowered external debt, improved its
currency composition, and sent a positive signal to investors and rating agencies.
26.
The exchange rate peg continues to serve as a strong anchor for monetary policy,
and there is no clear evidence of exchange rate misalignment. Given inflation risks, the
authorities have appropriately allowed interest rate differentials against U.S. dollar rates
to widen in recent months. Official reserves have remained broadly stable and the CBJ has
not so far needed to step up its sterilization operations. As long as short-term capital inflows
remain limited, there is scope to let interest differentials widen further, and also to
moderately increase policy rates if needed, to keep inflation in check. Higher policy and
interbank interest rates would also aid in curbing banks’ loan-deposit ratios, which have been
edging up. In order to determine the appropriate volume and frequency of liquidity
operations by the central bank, close coordination with the MOF on government debt
issuance will be critical.
27.
Banking sector risks appear manageable, supported by a strong supervisory
system. Prudential regulations are in place to limit banks’ currency, property, and stock
market exposures. The recent implementation of Basel II standards, along with the new
corporate governance regulations, is expected to further enhance the stability and soundness
of the banking system. The regulations under consideration on sources and uses of bank
funds should help mitigate funding risk and, by curbing credit growth, also contain
inflationary pressures.
28.
Structural reforms will help sustain strong macroeconomic performance.
Important gains have been made in the fiscal structural area over the past year. The priority
going forward should be on further strengthening public financial management system
through completing the implementation of the treasury single account and the GFMIS. In
other areas, the focus is rightly turning to establishing a regulatory environment for PPP
projects, which needs to be complemented by an appropriate institutional framework to

17
facilitate careful assessment of risks to the budget. The medium-term plan to fully liberalize
the petroleum sector will further mitigate the impact of any future oil price shocks on the
budget.
29.
Early completion of recent initiatives to address issues related to public debt and
data will bring significant benefits. The recent resolution of the government’s overdraft
facility with the CBJ will further improve the transparency of government debt statistics,
enhance central bank independence, and strongly signal the authorities’ resolve to rein in the
fiscal position. The staff urges early progress in addressing the remaining issues that are
delaying SDDS subscription, and in further strengthening BOP statistics to reduce the errors
and omissions component, which hampers current account analysis. Coordinated effort by
the MOF and CBJ to align budget coverage with government financing flows will facilitate
the assessment of fiscal developments and the policy stance. Fostering the development of
the secondary debt market will support private investment and enhance longer-term growth.
30.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard
12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I: PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Jordan’s public debt is expected to decline to just under 60 percent by 2011.1 The debt
ratio is projected to drop by about 10 percentage points in 2008 following the Paris Club debt
buyback,2 and remain broadly flat—with an average annual decline of less than 1 percentage
point—over the medium term. The projected debt path is based on the assumption that the
primary deficit (including grants) will decline to 1.6 percent of GDP by 2013.
The debt outlook remains vulnerable to adverse shocks. Standard bound tests reveal that:
•

Debt ratios would deteriorate under a 30 percent real exchange rate depreciation shock,
increasing by 14 percentage points relative to the baseline in 2008 and remaining above
65 percent over the projection period.

•

A contingent liabilities shock—an increase in the debt ratio by 10 percent of GDP in
2008—would cause the debt path to shift by about 9 percentage points above the
baseline.

•

Even smaller shocks—individual one-half standard deviation shocks to real growth,
interest rates, and the primary balance, and a combined one-fourth standard deviation
shock—would keep debt ratios above the 60 percent threshold throughout the projection
period.

If key assumptions are held at their historical averages, debt would decline faster than under
the baseline (to 53 percent by 2013), since the average historical level of the primary deficit
(0.1 percent) was significantly lower than projected (2.4 percent for 2008 and 1.8 percent on
average for 2009–13).
Public debt sustainability hinges on appropriate adjustment policies. A no-policy-change
scenario—that assumes the primary deficit of 2007 (2.9 percent of GDP) is kept constant
during 2008–13—would cause the debt-to-GDP ratio to increase from 63 percent at end-2008
to 74 percent by the end of the projection period.

1

Public debt is defined as central government and government-guaranteed debt. The domestic component is net
of government deposits with the banking system, including privatization proceeds.

2

Use of privatization proceeds, which are government assets held with the CBJ, reduced the net impact of the
buyback from 11 percent of GDP to about 3 percent. GDP growth accounts for most of the rest of the reduction
in the public debt ratio.

APPENDIX II: EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Jordan’s external debt sustainability outlook remains broadly favorable. External debt
ratios, which are currently somewhat above norms for emerging markets, are expected to fall
to near 20 percent of GDP by the end of the decade and to around 14 percent of GDP by
2013. A large part of this drop is due to the Paris Club debt buyback that reduced external
debt by around 11 percentage points of GDP in 2008. The external debt outlook is
underpinned by expectations of a gradual current account adjustment reflecting strong export
growth, falling medium-term import unit prices, and continued growth in earnings from
tourism and remittances. The projections also reflect expectations that Jordan will—as in
recent years—pursue cautious external borrowing policies, relying mainly on concessional
sources of external financing from multilateral and regional development banks.
The debt reduction path envisaged is nonetheless sensitive to assumptions regarding the
speed of current account adjustment and the outlook for private capital flows:
•

The standard bound tests reveal that external debt sustainability is most vulnerable to
developments in the current account position. If the actual current account were one-half
standard deviation worse than currently assumed, there would be only a marginal decline
in the debt ratio by 2013. At the same time, bound tests show that the debt-to-GDP ratio
is robust to shocks in the external interest rate or GDP growth. A sharp depreciation
would lead to an immediate deterioration in the debt ratio, but would not have an adverse
impact over time, provided other assumptions remain achievable.

•

A potentially important source of risk in Jordan’s case is a shock involving a larger-thanexpected decline in (non-debt creating) capital inflows. To assess the impact of a such a
decline, a shock scenario is considered in which capital inflows remain the same as in the
baseline scenario for 2008 but fall to the historical average for the remainder of the
projection period. This scenario shows that external debt would remain in the range of
30 percent of GDP, which is well above levels expected in the baseline, but not so high as
to threaten external debt sustainability.

•

If key assumptions are held at their historical averages, Jordan’s debt would fall even
faster than expected since Jordan had maintained current account surpluses for most of
the period prior to 2004.

Overall, the debt sustainability analysis continues to show that policies that help reduce the
current account deficit and maintain the recent growth and FDI momentum would provide
the strongest assurances of a sustainable debt position.

ANNEX I: STATISTICAL ISSUES
31.
Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes. However, staff’s analysis would
be facilitated by improvements in the coverage of fiscal and external statistics.
32.
Jordan has participated in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
September 2000. GDDS metadata were last updated in May/June 2007. An update to the data
module for the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was posted in
February 2004. Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) assessment missions visited
Amman in late 2006 and in July 2007 to assist with preparations for SDDS subscription.
33.
Real sector. During the past few years, progress has been made toward enhancing the
quality of national accounts statistics. Continued improvement requires a strong commitment
and allocation of additional resources. Additional efforts are needed to improve the estimates
from the expenditure approach and the coverage of informal activities. New surveys have
been implemented to improve the compilation and timeliness of wages and earnings data.
34.
Both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI) are
considered of good quality. The CPI (base year 2002/2003) covers all main urban centers and
cities at the governorate level and is expected to be updated with 2006 weights during 2008.
The PPI has been compiled since 2000; weights are derived from the 1999 Survey of
Industry at the 4-digit level, and within each industry, weights are based on the 1999
Economic Establishment Census.
35.
Government finance. In July 2007, an STA mission undertook a review of the
metadata needed for subscription to the SDDS and assisted in the compilation of financing
data on the central government and general government operations. The mission found that
government finance statistics for the budgetary central government cover only those
transactions of the budgetary central government that are channeled through the treasury
account and exclude all other transactions of the government ministries such as grants and
loans, earmarked taxes, and privatization receipts. In addition, social security and
extrabudgetary agencies are not included in the fiscal accounts. Improvements in the
coverage and dissemination of government finance statistics will be needed ahead of SDDS
subscription, including:
•

dissemination of data on central and general government operations with SDDSprescribed coverage, periodicity, and timeliness in accordance with the classification
and sectorization systems recommended by the GFSM 2001;

•

enhanced procedures for the verification of internal and intersectoral consistency of
the stock and flow data that serve as a source for compiling government finance
statistics; and

3

•

strengthening government financing data by instrument and residency consistent with
SDDS requirements.

36.
Monetary statistics. Monetary data for the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) and the
commercial banks are reported and published on a monthly basis. At present, consistency
checks between government finance statistics and monetary statistics are not conducted.
However, the CBJ informed the 2003 data ROSC Update mission that the CBJ Research
Department, which is responsible for the collection and compilation of the monetary
statistics, proposed the establishment of an interagency group to monitor the intersectoral
consistency of macroeconomic statistics. Timeliness of reporting monetary data for
publication in International Financial Statistics is satisfactory. However, little progress has
been achieved so far in implementing the Standardized Report Forms for reporting monetary
data to the Fund.
37.
Balance of payments (BOP) statistics. The CBJ has adopted the methodology of the
fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) for the compilation of the BOP
statistics and the international investment position (IIP), and has disseminated data in the
BPM5 format. The implementation of surveys in the area of services is important for the
further improvement of the quality of the BOP statistics. Further, the CBJ has started
compiling and disseminating the reserves template on the CBJ’s website. The IIP data for
2004–05 incorporates the results of the Department of Statistics foreign direct investment
survey released in May 2007. The CBJ and Ministry of Finance have agreed on the
modalities for compiling and disseminating external debt statistics in line with SDDS
requirements, and to form a technical group to examine proposals for developing quarterly
source data on nonbank private sector debt.

ANNEX III: WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS
1.
As of December 31, 2007, Jordan had received 68 World Bank (Bank) loans,
1 guarantee, and 15 IDA credits totaling $2,343 million net of cancellations and terminations.
Of the $2,343 million, $2,154 million have been disbursed to-date. All the credits and 63 of
the loans have been fully disbursed. There are five active projects in the Bank’s portfolio for
a total of $249 million. Overall performance of the portfolio is good, both from the
perspective of implementation and development impact. This reflects the generally good
project implementation capacity of Jordanian institutions, Jordan’s strong ownership of the
program, and the quality of the dialogue between the Bank and the government of Jordan.
2.
The new Joint World Bank-IFC country assistance strategy (CAS) for 2006–10,
endorsed by the Bank’s Executive Board in May 2006, is aligned with the government
priorities, as expressed in particular in the 10-year National Agenda, of poverty alleviation
and the creation of higher productivity jobs, while assisting the country in its transition
through the medium-term economic shocks. This CAS sets out a four-year program
organized in four cross-sectoral clusters:
•
•
•
•

strengthening the investment environment and building human resources for
value-added, skill-intensive, and knowledge-based economy;
supporting local development through increased access to services and economic
opportunities;
reforming social assistance and expanding inclusion; and
restructuring public expenditures and supporting public sector reform.

3.
The first two clusters tackle issues related to private investment and job creation,
respectively at the macro level and at the local level. The third cluster deals with programs to
support those who cannot by themselves achieve sufficient welfare. The last cluster is
focused on strengthening the public administration’s ability to design and implement
development polices, including improvements in the government budget, as the main tools of
public policy. Important cross-cutting issues, such as gender and the environment, will be
mainstreamed into the clusters. Various sectoral concerns, such as water and energy, will be
integrated in these programmatic clusters through thematic approach. The CAS mix among
possible policy lending, investment lending, and analytical services reflects the emerging
needs with respect to short-term financial challenges and longer-term institutional
developments, with a lending ceiling of up to US$540 million over four years.
4.
Two investment loans were approved during fiscal year 2007 aiming to assist Jordan
achieve a regionally balanced and equitable growth including access to services, employment
opportunities, and private investments outside Amman. One partial risk guarantee for the
Amman East 370 MW power plant was also approved in FY2007.

9
5.
World Bank Group support to private sector development will continue to focus on
improving the investment environment, public private partnership, partial risk guarantees for
major projects (envisaged to attract private sector participation and to provide a better
financial package for critical projects in water and energy), and, in the case of IFC, direct
investment. The IFC has been active in Jordan for many years and has a current portfolio of
$212 million in thirteen companies as of January 2008. In FY07 IFC committed
US$16 million in Jordan for two projects in the financial sector. IFC places a high priority on
business development to seek investment opportunities in the following areas:
(i) infrastructure development to encourage foreign direct investment; (ii) financial sector
development (e.g., microfinance and trade finance); and (iii) export-oriented and foreign
exchange generating investments. The IFC’s advisory activities in Jordan intend to fill the
gaps and address critical areas for private sector development, such as improving the
investment climate.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Jordan

On May 12, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2008 Article IV consultation with Jordan.8
Background
The economy continued to perform well in 2007 in a more challenging external environment.
Output grew by 6 percent and the unemployment rate declined further. FDI inflows remained
strong and international reserves increased substantially. However, rapidly rising world fuel and
food prices put pressure on the fiscal and external accounts in the second half of the year.
Inflation started to pick up in late 2007 and jumped in early 2008 following a 47 percent average
increase in petroleum product prices. Core inflation also picked up, but remains below
5 percent.
The fiscal position deteriorated in 2007, mainly reflecting the higher cost of fuel and food
subsidies and a shortfall in external grants. The overall deficit for the year is estimated at
6.2 percent of GDP, against an original target of 2.8 percent. Higher fuel and food subsidies on
account of increased world prices, and lower-than-anticipated grants were partly offset by lower
capital expenditure and net lending, and overperformance on domestic revenue. Increased
8

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed
during the May 12, 2008 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

2
domestic borrowing to finance the larger deficit resulted in only a marginal decline in the overall
public debt stock to 73 percent of GDP.
Despite a sizable deterioration in the external current account, the reserves position
strengthened. The current account deficit increased to 17½ percent of GDP in 2007, reflecting
higher import costs, a slowdown in export growth, and a shortfall in external grants. Continued
strong FDI and portfolio inflows financed the current account deficit. Reserves rose to
$6.9 billion by year-end, equivalent to five months of prospective imports, from $6.1 billion at
end-2006. Following a US$2 billion buyback of nonconcessional Paris Club debt in early 2008,
the external debt stock declined by 11 percent of GDP.
Monetary policy remained geared toward maintaining the exchange rate peg. The overnight
interest rate was cut by 50 basis points (bps) in September 2007, following the reduction in the
Fed Funds rate. Since then, despite a further 250 bps cumulative cut in the Fed Funds rate, the
Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) has lowered its key policy rate by only 25 basis points (in early
February) to avoid an excessively accommodative monetary stance. So far, there are no
indications that the widening interest differential has attracted significant short-term capital
inflows. Bank prudential indicators have remained steady, with the average risk-weighted capital
adequacy ratio easing to a still healthy 19 percent in mid-2007. Although private credit growth
moderated to 15 percent by end-2007, the banking system’s loan-deposit ratio continued to
edge up.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Jordan’s continued strong economic performance in an
increasingly challenging external environment. Directors noted that higher international food and
fuel prices, given Jordan’s high dependence on food and fuel imports, have pushed up inflation
and widened the fiscal and external deficits. They therefore emphasized the importance for the
authorities to adhere to their current plan of macroeconomic policy tightening, in order to reduce
vulnerabilities and ensure a continued favorable outlook.
Directors strongly supported the authorities’ intention to tighten fiscal policy. They welcomed the
authorities’ bold step to remove fuel subsidies and introduce a monthly fuel price adjustment
mechanism, which has greatly reduced the vulnerability of the budget to oil price developments.
Directors observed that sizable compensatory spending measures, including an increase in
public sector salaries, on a progressive scale, have been implemented to gain public
acceptance and protect vulnerable groups. Nevertheless, significant budgetary savings have
been achieved on a net basis. Some Directors noted that the public sector salary increase could
fuel inflation further. Directors considered that achieving the targeted narrowing of the budget
deficit entails significant tightening, and encouraged the authorities to resist additional spending

3
pressures. They emphasized that the lower deficit would be critical for bringing inflation down,
reducing the external imbalance, and preventing a crowding out of private credit.
Directors recommended that the authorities continue with consolidation of the public finances
over the medium term. They agreed that, given the high level of government spending relative
to the size of the economy, fiscal expenditure restraint would create needed space for the
private sector and strengthen medium-term growth prospects.
Directors noted that the new public debt ceiling limiting total public debt to 60 percent of GDP by
2011 should help to anchor the budgetary position over the medium term. However, given the
upfront debt reduction provided by the Paris Club buyback, they recommended gearing fiscal
policies to a more ambitious debt target that would leave some cushion for possible unforeseen
demands on the budget.
Directors noted that current account adjustment would be facilitated by tighter fiscal policy. A
gradual unwinding of transient factors and some softening of world commodity prices would
likely narrow the external deficit over the medium term. Directors emphasized that, while private
capital inflows were expected to fully cover the deficit, Jordan would remain vulnerable to a
slowdown in capital inflows, and stronger fiscal adjustment would help limit risks to external
stability.
Directors indicated that the exchange rate peg continues to serve as a strong anchor for
monetary policy, and there is no clear evidence of exchange rate misalignment. Given inflation
risks, they agreed that the recent widening in interest rate differentials against U.S. dollar rates
had been warranted. Directors recognized that, as long as short-term capital inflows remain
limited, there could be scope to let interest differentials widen further to keep inflation in check.
Higher policy rates would also help prevent a further increase in banks’ loan-deposit ratios.
Directors noted banks’ strong performance, and supported the authorities’ commitment to strict
financial sector supervision. They welcomed further enhancements in the regulatory and
institutional framework, including the recent implementation of Basel II standards and the
passage of a new anti-money laundering law. They looked forward to the FSAP update mission
later this year, which would help prioritize future reforms.
Directors emphasized the importance of structural reforms in sustaining strong macroeconomic
performance. They welcomed the resolution of the long-standing issue of the government’s
overdraft facility with the central bank, as well as recent structural measures in the fiscal area,

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
