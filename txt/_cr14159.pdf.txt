REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 13 , 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context
Economic activity accelerated in 2013 as oil output stabilized while non-oil growth
continued at close to 10 percent. Inflation remained low and the external position
strengthened further. President Aliyev won a third term in the October election.
Favorable economic prospects and large buffers provide an opportune environment to
speed up reforms.

Focus of consultation and recommendations
In an environment of high oil prices but with a relatively short oil production horizon,
the overarching challenge for Azerbaijan remains bringing fiscal policy to a sustainable
position while accelerating structural reforms to foster broad-based private sector-led
growth. Staff recommends:


Pursuing a growth-friendly fiscal consolidation strategy by cutting investment
projects with small growth returns and advancing decisive reforms to improve the
business environment and thereby create opportunities for private investment;



Maintaining monetary policy in a neutral stance while improving the transmission
mechanism and taking steps to enable greater exchange rate flexibility in the
medium term; and



Fostering private sector–led growth in the non-oil sector by ensuring financial
stability, promoting the deepening of financial markets, strengthening governance,
and removing barriers to competition and trade.

Previous Consultation
During the 2013 Article IV Consultation, Directors encouraged the authorities to: (i)
undertake a moderate front-loaded fiscal consolidation based on a rules-based fiscal
framework; (ii) discontinue the Central Bank’s direct lending to the real economy; (iii)
strengthen the supervisory framework and adopt prudential measures to contain the
growth of consumer credit; and (iv) advance ambitious structural reforms to reduce
barriers to trade and competition. Since then, the authorities have signaled a change in
the course of economic policies by approving a budget for 2014 that contains
government spending, unwinding part of the central bank’s directed lending to the real
sector, and adopting measures to rein in consumer credit. The pace of reforms aimed at
strengthening the fiscal framework and improving governance and the business climate
remains slow.

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
1.
Since the last consultation in early 2013, the government has succeeded in concluding
historic agreements in the gas sector and in tapping the international financial markets. The
agreements extend cooperation with a BP-led consortium over the next 40 years and enable the
implementation of the Shah Deniz-2 gas project, including the construction of pipelines to facilitate
the delivery of Azeri gas to Europe beyond 2018. These positive developments in the gas sector
along with the strong external position of the country paved the way for the issuance of a debut
Eurobond by the Azerbaijani government last March, which was well received by investors amid
market turbulence in the region.
2.
Notwithstanding these achievements, the overarching challenge for Azerbaijan
remains to reduce its heavy dependence on the oil and gas sectors while fostering sustainable
private sector–led growth. Diversification is a priority given the relatively short horizon of oil
reserves and the fact that the wealth associated with gas discoveries is estimated at about one-third
of the oil wealth.1 A more broad-based growth strategy will also help sustain the rapid decline in
poverty and inequality since the early 2000s.2

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
3.
Recent developments and near-term economic prospects are favorable (see panel
charts): 3


The growth of non-oil GDP reached almost 10 percent in 2013 supported by high public
spending and a rapid increase in consumer loans. Non-oil GDP growth will remain strong albeit
somewhat slower in 2014–15, mostly reflecting the recently announced fiscal consolidation
process. Oil output is likely to be flat for a number of years following the stabilization in 2013
that ended two consecutive years of decline.

1

Currently, the shares of oil and gas in total exports are 87 percent and 7 percent, respectively. These shares could
become 60 percent and 30 percent as Azerbaijan reaches the peak of gas production for delivery to Europe before
2020. The reserves to production ratio for oil and gas are 22 years and 57 years, respectively, according to the 2013
British Petroleum Statistical Review of World Energy. Major reasons behind the depletion of oil reserves are the age of
the oil fields and limited investment in the oil sector.
2

For a discussion of the marked decrease in the poverty rate (including gains in employment, wages and
productivity, and social transfers), see “The Inclusiveness of Azerbaijan’s Growth” in IMF Country Report 12/05 (Box 2)



Inflation increased slightly to 2.4 percent in 2013, on the back of adjustments to the regulated
price for petroleum products toward the end of the year.4 Though the output gap turned
positive in 2013, inflation is projected to remain in low single-digit levels during 2014–15, mainly
on the back of the fiscal consolidation.



The de facto exchange rate regime is classified as a stabilized arrangement and is the key anchor
for monetary policy. The manat exchange rate has appreciated by less than 2 percent relative
to the U.S. dollar since November 2010. The impact of depreciation pressures in a number of
neighboring countries has been limited, with few signs of lower manat demand or capital flight.
Moreover, the CBA has continued to intervene to prevent appreciation of the manat since the
beginning of this year, increasing reserves by about $0.5 billion in the first quarter of 2014.



Fiscal policy. Preliminary information suggests that the 2013 non-oil primary deficit in percent
of non-oil GDP remained at 2012 levels at about 45 percent, but still well above the 35 percent
sustainability level implied by the permanent income rule under a conservative scenario of oil
and gas production.5 The deficit would have been even larger had it not been for spending
restraint towards the end of 2013 and some under-execution of spending at the state budget
level and, particularly, on investments financed by the oil fund outside the budget. The spending
restraint helped reduce the break-even fiscal oil price slightly to $77 dollars per barrel.
Parliament approved a consolidated budget for 2014 that lowers the government-spending-toGDP ratio and implies a decline in the non-oil fiscal deficit by about 2 percent of non-oil GDP.
The overall fiscal surplus declined to 1 percent of GDP, on flat revenues, but this allowed the oil
fund to continue to grow (its size now stands at 48 percent of GDP).



Monetary policy. The Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) kept the refinancing rate steady
between February 2013 and end-April 2014, when it lowered the rate by 50 basis points to
4.25 percent and decreased the lower and upper limits of the interest rate corridor by 50–100
basis points (setting the floor at 0.5 percent and the ceiling at 6 percent). In August 2013, the
CBA prompted a reduction in lending rates by cutting the interest rate ceiling of the Azerbaijan
Deposit Insurance Fund (ADIF) from 12 percent to 10 percent. Following this reduction, private
sector credit accelerated while remaining highly concentrated in personal loans. The CBA though
has followed through with plans to stop lending to the real economy.

4

The Tariff Council increased the prices of petrol, diesel fuel and some other petroleum products by 30 percent on
average. This is the first adjustment to these prices since December 2007. The International Energy Agency (IEA)
ranked Azerbaijan as one of the oil exporting countries in the world with lowest energy consumption subsidies in
2012 (about 3 percent of GDP).

profitability also improved
on the back of the recent consumer lending boom. Disclosed nonperforming loans (NPLs) as
a percentage of total loans decreased slightly to 4.5 percent, despite the rapid increase in
consumer loans, reflecting the write-off of fully provisioned loans. NPL figures, though, only
include the overdue portion of principal and interest, suggesting that NPLs are higher.



Recent changes in the regulatory framework of the banking system include measures to
tighten consumer loans and strengthen the provisioning rules and requirements for the accurate
classification of NPLs.6 The CBA also extended the deadline on the new capital requirements
until January 1, 2015, giving some banks (comprising about 8 percent of total banking system
assets) more time to fulfill this requirement. The largest bank, IBA, is in compliance with the
capital adequacy ratio. 7 But as the financial position of IBA remains fragile, the shareholders’
assembly decided to increase the bank’s statutory capital over the next four years, even in the
absence of clear plans for the restructuring of the bank. This increase will bring an additional
burden of about $300 million (about 0.5 percent of GDP) on the government, which may double
if the other (private) shareholders do not participate in the increase.

4.
The baseline scenario reflects the authorities’ plans to sustain the recent change in the
course of economic policies and tackle fiscal vulnerabilities over the medium term. The
government’s plans to rein in spending, particularly in the public investment program, would enable
a decline in the non-oil primary deficit to non-oil GDP ratio to the sustainable level of 35 percent
by 2019. Over the medium term, non-oil GDP growth could be in the 5 percent range, if it is
underpinned by fiscal consolidation and supported by non-oil foreign direct investment (FDI).

6

In particular, the CBA tightened consumer loan extension procedures and limited the loan-to-value of car loans.

5.
Azerbaijan’s external position is strong. External buffers, namely the CBA reserves and the
oil fund, now amount to about 33 months of import cover and provide strong support to the peg.
The current account surplus is high and sovereign foreign assets are expected to reach $55 billion,
or 64 percent of overall GDP, by 2015. These assets are projected to decline to about 40 percent of
GDP by 2019 as the oil fund engages in the financing of some energy-related projects of strategic
importance. Although the planned fiscal consolidation would tend to increase the current account
surplus over the medium term, the dominating influence is expected to be a decline in oil exports, as
oil prices soften and production begins to tail off. Staff projections assume moderate returns from
the energy-related projects given the inherent uncertainty, but further investment in the oil sector
could keep revenues higher than in the baseline scenario.
6.
Against this backdrop, which implies a lower underlying current account, there is no
conclusive evidence of exchange rate misalignment (Box 1). The fact that Azerbaijan has been
able to broadly maintain its share in global non-hydrocarbon exports also suggests that
competitiveness is balanced. The authorities agreed with this assessment and stressed that
improving competitiveness is a top policy priority. They saw public spending on infrastructure as
critical to easing physical constraints on the business climate and improving the productivity of
private investment.

7.
Risks to the baseline scenario are tilted to the downside but financial buffers are
comfortable (Annex 1). Slippages in the fiscal adjustment and further deterioration of IBA would
undermine prospects for reducing vulnerabilities and fostering sustainable growth. A disruption in
oil production or a sustained decline in global oil prices associated with a potential deterioration in
the global outlook and emerging markets could expose fiscal vulnerabilities.8 Sharply slower growth
in Russia would have, however, a relatively small impact. Azerbaijan’s direct real linkages to Russia
have substantially declined over the past decade, following the oil boom. The impact of the tapering
of the quantitative easing of monetary policy in the United States on Azerbaijan should also be
limited, given the low reliance on external savings and capital inflows (Box 2). While the authorities
have room to use financial buffers if such risks materialize, strengthening the non-oil fiscal position
and tightening financial supervision will also be crucial to help mitigate the impact of future shocks.
The potential for higher oil prices is also possible given the risks of gas supply disruptions resulting
from the geopolitical situation in Ukraine and the Middle East.
8.
The authorities broadly agreed with the general assessment of risks to the mediumterm outlook but did not rule out the near-term possibility of some inflows of capital from Azeris
living in Russia if the situation deteriorates considerably. On the oil production time horizon, they
mentioned that new wells and ongoing discussions on a possible extension of the production
sharing agreement between the BP-led consortium and the government could help slow the decline
in oil output. The authorities also downplayed the risks of the considerable softening of oil prices,
given the trend of oil prices in recent years and geopolitical considerations going forward (if the
level of oil prices over the last three years is maintained over the medium term, sovereign
government assets could be near 55 percent of GDP by 2019).

8

A 12 percent decline in the assumption for oil production in 2014 (about 100,000 barrels per day) could worsen the
consolidated fiscal balance by 5 percentage points of GDP and, in the absence of spending adjustment, would result
in a withdrawal of oil fund reserves by $4 billion. A similar impact on the budget would arise with US$20 decline in
the oil price. The probability of such event this year is not small as pointed out by the analysis conducted by the IMF
research department in the context of the 2014 Spring World Economic Outlook.

Box 1. Azerbaijan: Exchange Rate, External Stability, and Competitiveness Assessment
The manat real effective exchange rate (REER)
appreciated during the oil boom years of 2004–8
though it has since stabilized, and there is no
conclusive evidence of a loss of competitiveness.
Between early 2004 and late 2008—the peak of the oil
boom—the REER appreciated by about 78 percent.
Following a sharp drop in inflation after the global
financial crisis, the REER has been broadly steady. In
terms of the competitiveness of non-oil exports, the
share of non-oil exports to total exports has remained
broadly stable, at about 5 percent, since the end of the
oil boom. However, Azerbaijan has fairly steadily
increased its share in global non-oil exports.

The exchange rate assessment with three CGER-like methodologies provides a mixed picture. The
Macroeconomic Balance (MB) approach, following the methodology set out in Beidas-Strom and Cashin
(2011), suggests that with current policies, the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals (slightly
overvalued by two percent).1/ This assessment is corroborated by the external stability (ES) approach,
factoring in the need to stabilize the ratio of the net foreign asset position to output. However, estimating
the equilibrium real exchange rate as a function of a number of medium-term fundamentals (ERER), finds
a 20 percent undervaluation. The degree of undervaluation using the ERER has fluctuated between 10
and 20 percent since the beginning of the oil boom in the mid-2000s and is now at the levels observed
in 2007 and 2010. This approach, however, does not incorporate diminishing oil reserves, an important
fundamental, which may worsen the fit for Azerbaijan.

global oil prices. A sharp slowdown in major emerging
economies, for example, could reduce global GDP by 1¾ percent and oil prices by almost 20 percent.
Azerbaijan would share the adverse consequences of a fall in the oil price. The impact of such a shock in
the GDP could be similar to the estimate for MCD oil exporters, at about 1 percent in the first year. The
impact of a slowdown in emerging markets will be relatively small. Azerbaijan’s non-oil export linkages to
Russia and Turkey are substantial (44.6 percent and 7.5 percent

An escalation of the Russia-Ukraine crisis will have a
relatively small impact as Azerbaijan’s direct real linkages
to Russia have substantially declined over the past decade
following the oil boom. Lower GDP growth in Russia could
directly impact about less than 3 percent of total exports (or
half of the total non-oil exports). The direct exposure of the
financial sector is mainly through small assets of the state oil
fund (SOFAZ) and the Russian subsidiary of the International
Bank of Azerbaijan (IBA). Migrants’ remittances originating
from Russia are also relatively small.

Azerbaijan’s financial sector should be able to withstand
moderate shocks. Azerbaijan’s financing needs are generally low
by international standards, given external and fiscal surpluses.
Lending by global banks to Azerbaijan’s financial sector is small
and corporations rely mainly on their own resources. Higher
global interest rates for Azerbaijan would be mostly felt through
temporary changes in the book value of the oil fund—with assets
close to $35.5 billion or about 50 percent of GDP in 2013, as
about 40 percent of its portfolio has a maturity between one
and five years, though higher rates will in general benefit the
oil fund over time. Exposure of capital markets is nil given its
underdevelopment. FDI, focused on the energy sector, will
remain strong due to new gas developments.

ENTRENCHING SOUND POLICIES
A. Ensuring Growth-friendly Fiscal Consolidation
9.
Pursuing the planned fiscal consolidation should not significantly dampen growth and
will help address fiscal vulnerabilities. While welcoming the approved 2014 consolidated budget,
staff noted that sustained further efforts would be needed to bring the non-oil fiscal position to the
sustainable level implied by the permanent income rule. Staff noted that with energy revenues set to
sharply fall off, leading to a rising overall deficit and depletion of oil fund balances over the
medium-term, it would be important not to delay the adjustment. To this end, staff advocated a
cumulative reduction of about 5 percentage points in the non-oil primary deficit over 2014–15 and a
further adjustment of at least 8 percentage points over 2016–19. Cutting investment projects with
small growth returns as a main component of the adjustment should not hurt growth markedly as
the public investment rate is well above the optimal path suggested by a precautionary saving and
investment model (Box 3). Making the fiscal position sustainable could also entail rationalizing tax
exemptions, better enforcing tax procedures, and to revamp non-oil tax revenue collection.9 Efforts
are also needed to streamline current spending while providing resources to expand the Targeted
Social Assistance (TSA) program to help reduce the impact of shocks, including recent fuel price
increases, on the most vulnerable groups.10 Such measures should be complemented by reforms in
the business environment (as discussed in section D) so that the private sector could use the freedup financing from fiscal consolidation for growth-enhancing private investment.
10.
The authorities stressed their commitment to consolidating the non-oil fiscal position.
They noted their plans to further reduce the transfers from the oil fund in the context of the 2015
budget, as announced in the medium-term indicative targets presented to parliament in the context
of the 2014 budget process. They also indicated that the recent agreement achieved with the World
Bank and the European Commission to complete a public expenditure and financial accountability
assessment (PEFA) by October 2014 will contribute to strengthen control over public spending and
will help guide efforts in prioritizing and improving the efficiency of public investment. In this latter
context, staff noted that along with a strong public investment management system, the selection of
investments could place more emphasis on the impact of spending on the long-term growth of the
non-oil export sector and fiscal revenue.
11.
Staff highlighted the risks stemming from the absence of a fiscal rule given the oil
revenue volatility and the unsustainable level of public investment. Additional fiscal risks are
associated with the heavy oil dependence of the consolidated budget, the pension system, and

The only non-contributory, means-tested safety net program is the Targeted Social Assistance (TSA) channeling
about 10 percent of social transfer spending. According to the World Bank, the TSA is well targeted with about half
the benefits flowing to the bottom decile of the population and less than one percent leaking to the top decile.
Benefits, however, reach only about 4 percent of the population.

government activities outside the budget (Box 4). A rules-based fiscal framework (e.g., a structural
primary balance rule with price smoothing) could help entrench fiscal discipline and mitigate the
volatility of oil revenue while promoting intergenerational equity.11 A statement of fiscal risks as part
of the budget process could highlight the threats to macro stability and the government’s resilient
net asset position, and foster fiscal risk-reducing actions.

The application of, the “Silo” model of Cherif and
Hasanov (2012), a finite horizon precautionary savinginvestment model under uncertainty, suggests that the
current government consumption and investment in
Azerbaijan are well above the optimal levels.1/ The results
are consistent with the application of the IMF’s Sustainable
Investing Tool underpinning the 2013 Article IV Consultation.
The analysis stressed the need for a more moderate
investment path to increase investment efficiency and sustain
the growth benefits.

The Silo model suggests that in the face of highly volatile
revenues, the optimal investment rate is 15 percent of total revenues while saving in safe assets is
37.3 percent initially. Given the expected decline in oil prices and production in the baseline, the projected
current and capital spending exceed the optimal amount over the period 2014–18. The model also indicates that
the Azeri government is saving less than optimal through its sovereign wealth fund.
The gap between projected and optimal investment is very large in 2014—around 20.5 percent of non-oil
GDP—but it will start to shrink in 2015 to reach around 4.3 percent of non-oil GDP in 2018. The model also shows
that government consumption is higher than the optimal level, and the gap is expected to widen over the
period 2014–18, to reach around 7 percent of non-oil GDP) in 2018.
The results call for a rules-based fiscal policy framework that promotes fiscal discipline.

Box 4. Azerbaijan: A Framework for Managing Fiscal Risks
Sound management of fiscal risks could supplement the rules-based fiscal framework recommended
to the authorities in the context of the 2013 Article IV Consultation by enforcing fiscal discipline and
bringing attention to threats to macro stability and to the state’s resilient net asset position.
1/

Managing fiscal risks in Azerbaijan in line with best practices entails:



Identifying and quantifying key sources of fiscal risk: there are four key sources of fiscal risks to the
consolidated budget in Azerbaijan:
Exposure to adverse oil sector developments: A US$20 decline in the oil price assumption for 2014 could
worsen the fiscal balance in percent of GDP by 5 percent and entail a withdrawal of $4 billion from the
oil fund. A similar impact on the budget would arise with a 12 percent decline in the assumption for oil
production in 2014 (about 100,000 barrels per day).
Implicit liabilities associated with pension obligations: Despite successive reform efforts, the funding gap
of liabilities inherited from the Soviet regime is projected to increase to 2 percent of GDP by 2024. The
NPV of these liabilities through 2050 was estimated by an IMF technical assistance mission in the order
of 54 percent of 2012 GDP.
Activities of the State Oil Company (SOCAR): Since 2008, SOCAR’s net liabilities (including trade credits
and excluding tax payments) have doubled, reaching about 12 percent of GDP in 2013. SOCAR
successfully issued international bonds in 2012 and 2013.
Activities of the systemic and largely state-owned bank: IBA holds about a third of the assets and loans of
the banking system. IBA’s financial situation remains fragile despite receiving government support. The
new capitalization plan approved by the shareholders will bring an additional burden of about
$300 million (about 0.5 percent of GDP) to the government over the next four years.



Disseminating a “Statement of Fiscal Risks” as part of the budget to inform the fiscal policy
decisions with sensitivity analysis to oil-related shocks and quantifying contingent liabilities arising from
public entities.



Integrating fiscal risks in the fiscal analysis, and in the medium-term fiscal framework and the public

12.
The authorities agreed on the need to entrench fiscal discipline. They noted that an
informal fiscal rule aimed at keeping the oil fund balance broadly unchanged will help gradually
reduce the reliance of the state budget on oil revenue. Ongoing actions to develop a debt
management strategy for the national oil company in line with international best practice will also
help contain associated risks from major investment projects. Plans are also advanced to approve a
reform of the pension system this year —consistent with recent IMF Technical Assistance (TA)—that
would ensure a sustainable pension system that provides a sufficient degree of income replacement.

B. Increasing the Role of Monetary Policy as Anchor for Inflation
Expectations
13.
Staff supported the CBA’s intention to keep monetary policy in a neutral stance and
welcomed recent measures to slow consumer lending. The anchor of monetary policy is the
maintenance of the stabilized exchange rate arrangement. Nonetheless, with Azerbaijan’s exposure
to large and destabilizing capital inflows from non-government sources quite limited to date, owing
to the low level of development in the financial and capital markets, there is some room for
monetary policy to operate. During the mission, the CBA stated its plans—with the staff
concurring—to retain a neutral stance, given expectations for stable and low inflation amid tighter
fiscal policy, soft international food prices, and slowing consumer credit growth. In the event, in late
April the CBA lowered the policy rate by 50 basis points, noting that the rate cut was based on low
inflation expectations and the need to diversify the economy and to boost investment activity. Staff
cautions the CBA against further policy rate cuts in light of risks of slippages in the fiscal
consolidation, implementation problems of recent measures to slowdown consumer lending, or
potential reversals in soft global food prices due to regional tensions. Indeed, monetary tightening
would be warranted in case slippages in implementing the fiscal consolidation plan caused demand
pressures.
14.
Strengthening the interest rate transmission mechanism is a precondition to making
monetary policy more effective. Staff noted that this would entail continuing with plans to scale
down the CBA’s direct lending to the real economy, including to non-financial public entities, with a
view to discontinuing such lending on a permanent basis. Actions in line with recent IMF technical
assistance, including the publication of inflation notes and balance of payments projections, along
with efforts to deepen the financial markets could pave the way for the adoption of greater
exchange rate flexibility over the longer term. Staff stressed that steps to improve monetary-fiscal
policy coordination and develop currency risk mitigation instruments will also facilitate a move
toward inflation targeting and greater exchange rate flexibility. Notwithstanding the benefits of
maintaining a managed exchange rate, including by providing an anchor for monetary policy, a
flexible exchange rate regime would increase policy options (e.g. to deal with potential capital
inflows as financial development proceeds) and contribute to reduce inflation and output volatility.12

13/165 (chapter 2).

15.
The CBA plans to sustain the unwinding of its directed lending and concurred that
preparing for greater exchange rate flexibility over the medium term is important to develop
a more independent monetary policy. The CBA is confident that its directed lending to the real
sector will continue to decline over the next couple of years. In addition, by this summer, the CBA
plans to launch the implementation of an action plan to prepare for greater exchange rate flexibility
over the medium term, developed on the basis of IMF TA advice.

C. Promoting a Sound Deepening of the Financial Sector
16.
Staff encouraged the CBA to further strengthen banking sector regulations to ensure
financial stability. Staff stressed that notwithstanding the government’s strong financial position
and the relatively underdeveloped banking sector, actions are needed to tackle vulnerabilities.
Recent measures taken on the strengthening of provisioning rules and requiring the accurate
classification of NPLs are steps in the right direction and will help ensure correct capital needs but
further efforts are needed to strengthen the regulatory framework. As pointed out by recent IMF
technical assistance, developing the interbank money market, reducing connected lending and
exposure to single large borrowers, and discouraging banks from taking on foreign-exchange
exposure to un-hedged borrowers would go a long way to increase the resilience of the system. The
relatively small size of the banking system by international standards, combined with recent
increases in capitalization, lessen somewhat the concerns that these foreign exchange, credit, and
interest rate risks give rise to. A thorough assessment of financial stability and development aspects
of the financial sector will be carried out in the upcoming 2015 FSAP update.
17.
Developing the banking system requires measures by the CBA to increase competition
in the banking sector. The ongoing capitalization process provides an opportunity for the CBA to
encourage some consolidation in the system. This could entail reducing bureaucratic and judicial
formality for mergers and acquisitions of healthier banks, introducing debt/equity swaps, and
offering incentives to banks in the form of lower deposit insurance premia or tax advantages. Banks
that do not meet the minimum capital requirement by the newly established deadline should be
liquidated or converted into non-bank financial institutions. Restructuring the largely state-owned
bank IBA so as to reduce its dominance of the sector is also a priority for achieving a more level
playing field in the banking system. Actions by the CBA to increase competition in interest margins
(e.g., creating a private credit bureau) and help banks reduce their costs (e.g., protecting creditors’
rights) would also place the system in a better position to support private sector–led growth,
particularly for SMEs, which face high costs of borrowing (Boxes 5 and 6).

The analysis suggests that lowering bank interest
margins would require reducing operating costs,
increasing competition, consolidating the small bank segments and maintaining a stable
macroeconomic environment. Specifically, reducing operating costs could be achieved by strengthening
bank corporate governance, adopting the best banking technologies, improving staff productivity, and
introducing organizational changes. Enhancing competition in the banking sector would need actions to
downsize the IBA (either by sale of assets or by splitting it into areas of businesses), promote non-banking
financial institutions and capital markets, reduce loan concentration though stricter supervision of large
exposures, and improve transparency and disclosure of bank products. As small banks in Azerbaijan are
operating with significant unrealized economies of scale, the authorities could allow for market-led
consolidation of smaller banks, which will contribute to greater cost efficiency and lower interest rate
spreads. Promoting a stable macroeconomic environment (low and stable inflation) should contribute to
lower equilibrium interest rates; lowering reserve requirements is likely to reduce the cost of intermediation.

18.
The CBA noted that plans are underway to sustain the recent progress in
strengthening banking sector regulations. While indicating that liquidations should not be ruled
out, the CBA stressed that only a few banks may be unable to meet the new capital requirement by
end-2014. The authorities also mentioned that exposures of banks to foreign exchange risks are well
contained in light of the low share of external debt liabilities in bank balance sheets
(below 20 percent) and did not see it possible to extend further the January 1, 2015 deadline for the
minimum capital requirement. They looked forward to the upcoming FSAP, as a useful roadmap for
further improvements in this area.

Credit to the private sector (in percent on GDP)

Sources: National authorities; and IMF staff estimates.

Azerbaijan lags behind other transition economies in credit to the private sector and the level of
deposits. Cross-country comparisons assembled by the EBRD show that Azerbaijan may be on par with
other economies in Central Asia and the Caucasus in financial development, yet Azerbaijan lags other
transition economies in Central and Eastern Europe and Russia by large margins.
Moreover, much of the financial sector growth experienced in the past decade or so has been in
consumer credit. Growth in credit to the private sector increased from just under 5 percent of GDP in 2000
to around 13 percent in 2013. Yet, a large portion of the growth in credit came from growth in household
lending which accelerated from around 9 percent of total bank lending in 2000 to around 40 percent
in 2013. Mortgages have been an important component of banks’ credit to consumers as these comprised
about 14 percent of banks’ portfolios in 2013, up from 8 percent in 2006.
Empirical tests conducted by Fund staff found that the Azerbaijan financial sector is not contributing
to the development of the non-oil economy. Despite some caveats, time series regressions found that
public spending is highly correlated with the growth of the non-oil economy, yet credit from the banking
system was not correlated when controlling for growth in public spending and real changes in oil prices.
The absence of a link between finance and non-oil growth may reflect a number of factors, including
the lack of adequate lending opportunities and institutional bottlenecks. Given the importance that the
financial sector needs to play in supporting the growth of the non-oil economy, looking at constraints on
the development of the sector, and designing a well sequenced program that supports financial
development while also managing the risks that come with financial sector policy reform all require the
attention of policy makers.

“easy service centers” (ASAN). As part of the
anti-corruption program, the authorities are working on a legislative initiative to establish and
develop a national mechanism for asset recovery, including possible amendments to the Criminal
Procedural Code. In addition, the fourth assessment by MONEYVAL began in October 2013 and is
ongoing. The authorities also noted they plan to conduct an AML/CFT risk assessment during 2014.
20.
While noting recent progress, staff stressed that accelerating structural reforms in
governance and the business climate is critical to diversifying the economy and promoting
private non-oil investment (Box 7). Azerbaijan’s low rank on governance-related indicators in
surveys of firms carried out by the World Bank and the World Economic Forum suggests
considerable scope for improving government effectiveness and widening anti-corruption efforts.
Measures to put in place an effective anti-monopoly policy, including by creating an independent
competition agency, will help reduce formal and informal barriers to competition. The authorities
will also need to ensure that the ongoing education reform brings curricula in line with market
needs and removes the existing bottlenecks in higher education to take advantage of relatively
flexible labor market regulations. Such measures could help foster non-oil private investment,
including FDI, particularly if combined with World Trade Organization (WTO) accession over the near
term to facilitate the opening of new markets. This latter process seems to be gaining momentum
following the adoption of the new customs code in line with WTO requirements and the 11th
meeting of the working party in February 2014.

OTHER ISSUES
Data Provision to the Fund
21.
Azerbaijan’s data provision to the Fund has some shortcomings but is broadly
adequate for surveillance. Actions are underway to bring fiscal and external sector statistics in line
with international standards. Ongoing efforts supported with IMF technical assistance will help
strengthen the production of statistics, particularly for GDP, fiscal accounts, and the International
Investment Position. The authorities noted that joint work by the Ministry of Finance, State Statistics
Committee, and the CBA will help speed up the legislation needed for the compilation and
dissemination of external debt and the IIP. The CBA thus expects to start the compilation and
dissemination of International Investment Position (IIP) in coming months. Staff urged the
authorities to resume the compilation and dissemination of the IIP by the CBA, as required under
Article VIII, Section 5, ahead of the next Article IV Consultation.

STAFF APPRAISAL
22.
The government’s recent achievements provide an impetus to advance toward the
goal of becoming a dynamic emerging market. Recent agreements in the gas sector will help
transform Azerbaijan into a strategic gas supplier for the European market. In addition, the
government’s successful debut Eurobond, issued amid market turbulence in the region, is testimony
of investors’ confidence in the prudent management of the oil revenues as reflected in large buffers
and macroeconomic stability. This vote of confidence, along with the benign environment of high oil
prices, provides an opportunity to build on the recent progress in changing the course of
macroeconomic policies and take decisive steps to improve governance and the business climate.
Actions in these areas will be crucial to fostering sustainable and diversified private sector-led
growth that will ensure a sustained improvement in living standards.
23.
Continued efforts to rein in government spending are needed to reduce fiscal
vulnerabilities and achieve sustainability of the non-oil fiscal position in the medium term.
Staff welcomes the approved 2014 budget that contains government spending, and encourages the
authorities to complement their plans to improve public investment efficiency with decisive business
climate reforms to create opportunities for private investment. Moving ahead decisively with the
planned reform of the pension system, along with the adoption of a rules-based fiscal framework
and sound fiscal risk management, will also help safeguard the consolidation efforts and preserve
fiscal sustainability over the medium term. Given the prospects of flat oil production and softer oil
prices, public announcement of and strict adherence to the informal fiscal rule would help build a
track record for the adoption of a formal fiscal rule.
24.
The current monetary policy stance is appropriate if supported by prudent fiscal and
financial sector policies. Inflationary pressures are likely to remain subdued if the authorities’ plans

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

to tighten fiscal policy and cool down consumer credit growth are fully implemented. Monetary
tightening would be warranted if demand pressures arise in the event of slippages in the fiscal
consolidation plan or a reversal in soft global food prices due to regional tensions. Going forward,
strengthening the role of monetary policy as anchor for inflation expectations requires discontinuing
the CBA’s direct lending on a permanent basis and decisive progress to develop the interbank
money and foreign exchange markets in line with past IMF technical assistance. These actions would
facilitate a move toward inflation targeting and pave the way for adopting greater exchange rate
flexibility over the medium term when the costs of the current exchange rate regime will increase as
Azerbaijan further diversifies its economy and increases its financial integration.
25.
Enhancing the regulatory framework while promoting financial deepening is critical
for the development of the non-oil economy. Recent measures by the CBA to strengthen banking
regulations will help ensure correct capital needs; but increasing the resilience of the banking
system also requires reducing the exposure of banks to connected lending and to un-hedged
borrowers. Strengthening the banking system to facilitate a sustainable and broad-based growth led
by the private sector will require actions aimed at encouraging market-led consolidation of banks
without extending the new deadline to meet the capital requirement; creating a private bureau to
promote competition in interest margins; protecting creditors’ rights to help banks reduce their
costs; and ensuring a level playing field in the banking system by further reducing the IBA’s
dominance in the system. Restructuring the IBA is also needed to help strengthen the monetary
transmission mechanism and contain the associated fiscal risks.
26.
Achieving sustainable growth of the non-oil output and export diversification in the
medium term also entails accelerating reforms to attract private investment. Building on recent
efforts to reduce corruption, including the introduction of e-government and “ASAN” public
services, the authorities could broaden the anti-corruption efforts beyond small-scale corruption,
strengthen the rule of law, and reduce formal and informal constraints to business environment in
the non-oil sector. Such efforts will be crucial to foster a competitive economy and reap the full
benefits of complementary efforts aimed at developing the domestic capital market and opening up
new export markets.
27.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Azerbaijan will be held on
the standard 12-month cycle.

(high, medium, or low)
(high, medium, or low)
Global Risks

High

Medium
Channels of transmission from
international financial markets to
Azerbaijan are not strong. The
biggest impact would be through
the value of assets held by the oil
fund.

Protracted period of slower
growth in advanced economies
(negative surprises on potential
growth) or emerging economies
(incomplete structural reforms).

High
(Advanced economies)

High
A long period of slow growth in
Europe could hurt oil export
volumes in the short run and hurt
plans to export gas directly to
Europe. A slowing in emerging
markets will have less impact.

Sustained decline in commodity
prices triggered by deceleration of
global demand and coming-onstream of excess capacity
(medium-term).

Medium

Increasing geopolitical tensions
surrounding Ukraine lead to
disruptions in financial, trade and
commodity markets

Medium

Surges in global financial market
volatility (related to UMP exit),
leading to economic and fiscal
stress, and constraints on country
policy settings.

1

High
(Emerging markets)

Medium/High
Given Azerbaijan’s high oil
dependence, the economy could
go into recession. The oil fund
savings could help cushion the
shock. A prolonged price decline
would necessitate a large fiscal
adjustment.
Medium/High
Disruptions in gas supply could
raise oil prices by 15 percent.
Such event would strengthen
growth prospects as well as fiscal
and external positions.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff's subjective assessment
of the risks surrounding the baseline ("low" is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, "medium" a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and "high" a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views
on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

Country specific risks

Oil production risk
Disruptions in oil production if
recent efforts to stabilize oil
output cannot be sustained

Medium

High
Disruptions in oil production
would undermine growth
prospects and result in
deteriorations of the overall fiscal
and external positions.

Financial sector risks
(The weak position and
supervision of the systemic public
bank (IBA) could compromise the
stability and soundness of the
system)

Medium

Medium
A further deterioration of this
bank could create systemic
problems in the banking system.
Though the government is likely
to step in with important fiscal
costs.

Fiscal risks
Slippages in the fiscal adjustment
due to investment commitments
for the 2015 Euro Olympic games
in Baku.

Medium

Medium/Low
Delays in undertaking the fiscal
adjustment could exacerbate
fiscal vulnerabilities to a potential
oil price decline.

Escalation of the conflict with
Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh
(Tensions with Armenia could
increase, following recent
geopolitical events surrounding
Ukraine)

Medium

High
Military conflict would entail severe
economic and social impacts and
damage FDI prospects, particularly
in the non-oil sector.

Policy responses: With potential downside risks, staff will recommend that the authorities rebuild policy buffers.
This would entail strengthening the non-oil fiscal position beyond the levels envisaged in the 2014 approved
budget. Sustaining efforts to enhance banking supervision combined with development of plans to bring the
public bank under a sustainable financial position will also help contain risks in the financial sector.

Safeguards Assessment
1.

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) was

subject to an assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement that was approved on July 06, 2001,
and expired on July 5, 2004. The assessment was completed on March 11, 2002, and it was
concluded that the external audit and financial reporting were adequate. The assessment proposed
a set of measures to strengthen internal control, data reporting to the Fund, and the legal
framework. The majority of the recommendations were implemented, except for the
recommendation to establish an Audit Committee. The external audit of 2011 CBA financial
statements was completed by April 2012, and the audited financial statements along with the audit
opinion has been published on the bank’s website as an integral part of 2011 annual report.

Exchange Rate Arrangements
2.

The currency of Azerbaijan is the manat, which became sole legal tender on January 1, 1994.

The de jure exchange rate regime is “other managed arrangement” since March 2011, but the de
facto regime remains as “stabilized arrangement”, based on the authorities’ policy to allow greater
exchange rate flexibility since late 2010.

3.

Azerbaijan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 effective

November 30, 2004, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for restrictions maintained for
security reasons that have been notified to the Fund.

Article IV Consultation
4.

The 2013 Article IV consultation with Azerbaijan was concluded on May 3, 2013.

ROSCs
5.

A fiscal transparency ROSC module was prepared by FAD (SM/00/278, 12/12/01) and

updated in April 2003 (SM/03/159, 04/30/03). A fiscal ROSC update mission took place in April 2005.
A data dissemination ROSC module was completed by STA in March 2003 (IMF Country Report No.
03/86). The authorities published the fiscal ROSC, and it is available on the IMF web site. Several

financial systems ROSC were conducted in the context of the FSAP (2003–04) but were not
published. A CPI data ROSC completed in July 2008 (IMF Country Report No. 08/273).
Resident Representative
6.

In October 2009, Mr. Koba Gvenetadze ended his term as IMF Resident Representative in

Azerbaijan. Since November 2009, the IMF no longer has a Resident Representative in Azerbaijan,
but the IMF Office in Baku, located in the building of the Ministry of Finance of Azerbaijan, continues
to operate, headed by Ms. Aghgun Gadirli (Office Manager).

Resident Advisers
7.

An adviser on the establishment of the Treasury in the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Nurcan

Aktürk, was stationed in Baku from December 1994 to September 1996. He was succeeded by
Mr. B.K. Chaturvedi, whose assignment was extended twice, first through August 2000, and then
through May 2001. Mr. B.K. Chaturvedi was replaced by Mr. A. Khan, whose assignment started in
May 2001 and ended in August 2002. A technical long-term adviser for tax administration,
Mr. Mark Zariski, was stationed in Baku from April 1995 to April 1996. He was succeeded by
Mr. Peter Barrand, who was stationed in Baku from January 2001 to December 2002. Mr. Isaac
Svartsman was resident advisor in the CBA for bank supervision and restructuring from
September 1998 to April 2001. Ms. Nataliya Ivanik was stationed in Baku as a STA regional external
sector statistics advisor from November 2006 to November 2008.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of March 2014)

1.

The World Bank Group is currently implementing a two-pillar Country Partnership Strategy

(CPS) that covers FY2011–14 and focuses on: (i) building a competitive non-oil economy; and (ii)
strengthening social and municipal services; with a strong cross-cutting theme of governance and
anticorruption. A new Country Partnership Framework for Azerbaijan expected to be delivered in
spring 2015 will target achieving the World Bank Group’s twin goals of Poverty Reduction and
Shared Prosperity.
2.

The World Bank Group strategy builds on the Governments own development strategies and

includes: (a) Under Pillar I, strengthening the non-oil economy, primarily through an improved
business environment, better infrastructure and agriculture improvements, and (b) Under Pillar 2,
improving the effectiveness of social and community services, including health, education, social
protection and water supply.
3.

During the current CPS period, the Bank has increased its focus on implementation of

existing operations and only considered new operations in selected areas with a strong record of
sufficient institutional capacity and ownership.
4.

The FY2011–14 CPS Progress Report (CPS PR) assessed the objectives of the CPS as relevant

in the long run.
5.

The Bank program for FY2013–14 has been in line with the Government’s own borrowing

plans of US$300–400 million per year from IBRD. This program focuses on sectors in which external
borrowing from international financial institutions has been economically and socially justified based
on expected returns, knowledge and technology transfer, and proven implementation capacity.
Specifically, projects proposed by the Bank support aim at improved competitiveness in agriculture,
solid waste management, water supply and sanitation, judicial modernization, railways, roads and
rural investments program.


Bank lending is complemented by a strong program of knowledge services to inform the
country growth strategy and policy choices as well as the design of investment operations. The
Bank will increase analytic work in the areas of job creation and growth, poverty and inequality,
the financial sector, PFM and tax policy. The first Programmatic Public Expenditure Review
(PPER) was delivered in FY13 and, following the client’s request in FY14, the focus will shift
towards tax policy. Poverty Assessment and Country Gender Study are under preparation and

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

will be delivered in FY14. A Medium Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS), Industrial Parks
Technical Assistance are underway and also to be delivered in FY14.
6.

Two more analytical pieces have been delivered in FY14, namely on Economic Diversification

for Growth, and Fostering Entrepreneurship in South Caucasus. The Bank in partnership with the
government, EU and SECO launched preparation of PEFA. It is expected to be delivered in fall 2014.
7.

The partnership with the Government through a reimbursable Joint Economic Research

Program (JERP) will be established on a case-by-case basis and start with engagement in ICT area.
The Bank and the Government have also established a strong vehicle for policy dialogue in two high
level policy fora held for the first time in 2009 and then in March 2012. The next high level policy
forum is under preparation and expected to take place in September 2014.
8.

Relations between the Bank and the Fund concerning Azerbaijan are very good in terms of

coordinated policy advice and collaboration on macroeconomic monitoring. There is also broad
agreement between the Bank and the Fund on the division of labor between the two institutions.
The Fund will continue to focus on macro-critical areas, and will share responsibilities with the Bank
on banking and financial sector soundness, taking care to coordinate closely so as to minimize
overlap and ensure harmonization of policy advice.
9.

IFC’s program aligned with the joint World Bank Group strategy continues to focus on

supporting sustainable growth and diversification of economy through investments and advisory
support to the non-oil sectors, with a focus on agribusiness, MSMEs and infrastructure. During the
current CPS period (FY2011–14) IFC’s annual commitments have averaged at about $30–40 million
and have been primarily in the financial sector in the areas of micro, small and medium enterprises
and trade finance.
10.

To address barriers to private sector investments in these and other areas, IFC implements

several advisory programs focused on improving the business climate, strengthening financial
markets, and increasing resource efficiency. This includes implementation of policy reforms related
to business registration, inspections and permitting regime, strengthening competitiveness of
agribusiness sector through analysis and regulatory reforms, and extending policy reforms to tax
administration. IFC is also working on strengthening financial infrastructure through development of
credit bureaus and collateral registries. In addition, IFC has also pioneered promotion of sustainable
energy finance through investment and advisory projects with Bank Respublika aimed at developing
SME lending capacity for energy efficient projects. IFC also remains engaged in the areas of banking
sector capacity-building with the focus on risk management and SME lending, corporate

governance, food safety standards and resource efficiency through the regional programs, such as
ECA Corporate Governance Project, ECA Banking Advisory, ECA Resource Efficiency Program and
ECA Agribusiness Standards Program.
11.

The State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan has committed US$350 million to three

funds managed by the IFC Asset Management Company: the IFC Global Infrastructure Fund, which
invests alongside IFC in infrastructure projects in emerging markets; the IFC Catalyst Fund, which
invests in funds and projects focused on low-carbon power generation, energy and water efficiency,
and resource efficiency sector; and the IFC African, Latin American and the Caribbean Fund, which
invests alongside IFC in equity and equity-like projects in Africa and Latin America and the
Caribbean.

RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (EBRD)
(As of December 31, 2013, Update as of March 2014 in paragraph 5)
As set out in the current Country Strategy for Azerbaijan, the Bank's strategic priorities are:
1.

The EBRD has operated in Azerbaijan since 1993. As of 31 December 2013, it invested

approximately US$2.31 billion in 142 projects.2 The current active portfolio amounts to
US$930 million of which 57 percent has been disbursed, and operating assets amount to
US$500 million. The ratio of private sector projects in the portfolio now stands at around
63 percent3.
2.

Strategic priorities for the EBRD’s activities in Azerbaijan, set out in the country strategy

published for public consultation in February 2014, include:


Promoting market-driven economic diversification support leading local corporates with direct
financing while helping EBRD partner banks to remain active in the corporate segment and a
special emphasis on SMEs in the agribusiness sector, Support local banks to develop their
capacity to support agricultural and regional lending. Regional roads development will also help
facilitate the development of a viable agricultural sector while facilitating integration of smaller
communities.



Developing a sustainable financial sector to support private sector development, strengthening
financial intermediation to ensure efficient financing of the private sector, particularly SMEs and
MSEs, including in the regions. Promoting high standards of corporate governance and risk
management: increased competition, new standards and markets for banks, consolidation.
Extending co-operation with existing partner banks and assist in the development and
promotion of new financial instruments to target improved access to finance for women-owned
and women-run businesses, energy efficiency, local capital markets, and local currency



Improving governance and the business environment. Working closely with the Government of
Azerbaijan to deepen institutional and regulatory reform. Using lessons of hydrocarbons and
financial sectors, strive to create a more favorable investment climate in the real sector. Pursuing
investments in energy projects that improve energy security, create new generating capacity,
stimulate competition, diversify energy sources, increase efficiency, and create wider and larger
markets through regional integration.

3.

In the energy and natural resources sectors, the EBRD financed several landmark

transactions such as the BTC pipeline, AZDRES Power Rehabilitation and the Shah Deniz gas field.
The EBRD also financed three power sector projects for a total of US$281 million, making Azerenerji,
Azerbaijan's state-owned power utility, EBRD's second largest client in the country. Energy and
natural resources represents 30 percent of the overall portfolio. The industry, commerce and
agribusiness (ICA) sector represents about 10 percent by volume, but 30 percent by number of
transactions and includes major investments across a broad range of segments from building
materials to mineral water bottling. In the financial sector (one fifth of the portfolio), EBRD has
equity stakes in three Azerbaijani banks and provides funding for on-lending to the MSME sector to
a further six banks and four micro-finance institutions. The infrastructure sector, which constitutes 40
percent of EBRD's portfolio, includes US$ 250 million for Regional Roads Reconstruction and
Upgrading Project, EBRD’s largest investment in Azerbaijan to date.
4.

In 2013, EBRD invested a total of US$225 million in 18 projects. EBRD financed eight projects

in the corporate sector with the average investment size of less than US$5 million. Three projects
were in the agribusiness sector and four in the manufacturing and services sector. In the financial
sector, EBRD signed eight projects, including credit lines with four (existing partner banks to be
onlent to micro companies and SMEs. EBRD also signed a US$120 million second tranche of the
Roads Reconstruction project. EBRD also continued to provide technical assistance in the areas of
institution building, credit appraisal and risk management to financial institutions, and accountancy
standards, corporate governance to corporate clients.
5.

During the first three months of 2014, the EBRD has already signed US$220 million in four

projects of which Shah Deniz Natural Resource project was the largest at US$200 million. The Bank
expects to sign a further 10 transactions by end-2014, including projects with financial institutions
and corporate clients.
6.

Azerbaijan is a part of the EBRD’s Early Transition Countries (ETC) initiative. Launched in

April 2004, this initiative aims to increase investments in EBRD’s eight countries of operation in the
early transition stage, while building on international efforts to address poverty in these countries.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

Through this initiative, the EBRD focuses its efforts on private sector business development and
selected public sector interventions. It aims to stimulate market activity by using a streamlined
approach to financing, focusing on smaller projects, mobilizing more investment, and encouraging
ongoing economic reform. EBRD will accept higher risk in the projects it finances in the ETCs, while
still respecting the principles of sound banking.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.

Economic and financial statistics provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance

purposes. Although the authorities have made significant progress in improving the quality and
timeliness of their macroeconomic statistics, a number of weaknesses should be addressed,
particularly in the areas of national accounts, price statistics, and external sector statistics. STA has
provided extensive technical assistance and recommendations in these areas.
2.

Azerbaijan has participated in the GDDS since mid-2001. In April 2002, a data ROSC mission

reviewed Azerbaijan’s data dissemination practices against GDDS guidelines and conducted an
assessment of the quality of national accounts, consumer price index (CPI), producer price index
(PPI), government finance, monetary, and balance of payments statistics. The data module of the
ROSC is available on the IMF’s external website. Azerbaijan nominated a national SDDS Coordinator
in August 2005. An SDDS assessment mission in April 2007 provided technical assistance on the
outstanding issues required for SDDS subscription. A data ROSC module to reassess the Consumer
Price Index (CPI) completed in July 2008.

A. Real Sector
National accounts and price statistics
3.

Under STA’s national accounts project, significant technical assistance has been provided to

the State Statistics Committee (SSC) and progress has been made in a number of areas. Methods for
compiling gross national income have been improved and revised estimates disseminated; quarterly
national account estimates at constant prices for 1998–2004 have been compiled; capital investment
data have been revised; estimates of undeclared wages have been made; and a new methodology
for calculating price indices for the construction and transportation sectors is well underway. The
March-April 2005 mission identified the following problems: (i) the Oil Fund’s transactions are not
adequately reflected in the national accounts due to lack of information from the Oil Fund; (ii) the
SSC does not have sufficient information to make reliable estimates of remittances from domestic
residents working abroad; and (iii) there are no estimates of informal sector activity. The
February 2013 mission that visited Baku at the request of the authorities prepared an action plan for
the development and publication of discrete quarterly national account statistics.
4.

In January 2005, the CPI was revamped—the consumption basket was expanded to cover

585 items and expenditure weights updated to reflect recent consumption patterns. With respect to
regional coverage, which is now expanded to 54 regions, the SSC used population-based weights in

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

the aggregation of elementary price indices. However, this treatment raised methodological
questions, because (i) international best practices suggest the use of expenditure-based weights in
every stage of aggregation in CPI compilation, and (ii) population shares are not reliable proxies for
regional expenditure shares. The recent reassessment of the CPI found that, although the SSC did
use population weights for regional aggregation through 2006, it has weighted regional indexes by
expenditure since 2007, using 2006 Household Budget Survey results on household expenditure,
while 2009 data are based on 2008 expenditure weights.
5.

It is important for the SSC to measure both the asset and rental prices of housing.

Accordingly, the 2008 CPI reassessment mission suggested compiling a house price index, which
would provide an estimate of inflation for the capital formation component of household final
expenditure. The SSC has been considering proposing such an index for its statistical development
program, as a new price indicator distinct from its consumption-based CPI.

B. Fiscal Sector
6.

Recent treasury modernization efforts are expected to improve the compilation of fiscal

data. With the assistance of a Fund peripatetic advisor, the Ministry of Finance developed the
treasury chart of accounts (COA), an essential input to the new treasury system. The October 2006
STA government finance statistics mission found the latest draft COA broadly consistent with the
Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2001. The work on the COA is proceeding in parallel with the
computerization of Treasury operations.
7.

The 2002 data ROSC mission recommended expanding the coverage of government finance

statistics by including all operations recorded by the treasury and publishing details on financing
and debt outstanding. Starting in 2006, the state budget incorporates transfers to Nakhichevan as a
separate expenditure item, but no further details are provided.
8.

The 2012 STA mission that visited Baku at the request of the authorities, provided assistance

with the preparation of financial reports based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001
(GFSM 2001). The mission concluded that while further work is needed on improving the source
data for the compilation of these statistics, the present level of development of budgetary
accounting and reporting system makes it possible a preliminary compilation and dissemination of
the GFS in accordance with the GFSM 2001 on an annual and quarterly basis.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

C. Monetary Sector
9.

The Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) compiles monetary statistics according to the

methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The CBA reports monetary data to
STA within three weeks after the end of the reference month, via Standardized Report Forms (SRFs).
Monetary and financial data have also been published in the International Financial Statistics (IFS)
Supplement since December 2006.

D. External Sector
10.

Azerbaijan’s balance of payments (BOP) statistics are compiled and disseminated by the CBA

and are broadly in accordance with the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6). The
CBA has also initiated compilation of International Investment Position (IIP) statistics. The IIP data
for 2002–2008 have been published in IFS; however, the authorities have indicated that they have
discontinued the compilation of IIP data effective 2009.
11.

During November 2006–November 2008, a Regional Advisor in External Sector Statistics to

Azerbaijan and Georgia was stationed in Baku to (i) facilitate activities carried out by different
government agencies in the development of external sector statistics; (ii) assist with statistical
capacity building; (iii) coordinate the technical assistance activities of STA with the MCD’s work
program; and (iv) assist the authorities in coordinating with other international institutions and
bilateral agencies involved in technical assistance in statistics in Azerbaijan and Georgia. Moreover,
Azerbaijan has benefited from a STA technical assistance mission in external sector statistics, which
visited Baku in October 2009 to further assist the authorities with addressing a number of
outstanding issues related to the compilation and dissemination of external sector statistics.
12.

The 2009 mission found that appropriate statistical legislation to assign responsibilities for

compilation and dissemination of external sector stocks statistics (IIP and gross external debt) has
yet to be developed. A draft Presidential Decree On Improvement of the Gross External Debt and
International Investment Position Statistics of Azerbaijan was developed in order to authorize the
CBA to compile private and public debt data from relevant agencies, but still has not been
approved. As a result, the CBA temporarily discontinued dissemination of IIP statistics and the
development of the compilation system for the IIP and gross external debt statistics. The mission
recommended the authorities to address these issues, as they would affect the timing of
Azerbaijan’s subscription to the SDDS. The mission also expressed concerns with regard to the pace
of implementation of the strategic framework for the development of external sector statistics,

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

which may be affected by recent staff turnover and a change in the status of the BOP Department
(now a division).
13.

The 2009 mission also found that, in spite of the CBA’s efforts, data sharing and data

provision remain a challenge for the compilation of external sector statistics. Consequently, the
mission recommended to set up a formal, high-level structure for data sharing and data provision.
14.

The 2012 STA mission found low prospects for restarting work on the IIP (annual data were

last published for 2008) as the legal position has not changed since STA’s previous mission in 2009
and the data sharing and data provision across government agencies remain a challenge. The
mission also discussed the BOP compilation methodology and assumptions, and made several
recommendations in the areas of data validation, and in fine tuning the data to the BPM6
specifications.
15.

Statistics for public and publicly guaranteed external debt are reported quarterly on a due-

for-payment basis with a lag of one to two months. A debt service schedule for public and publicly
guaranteed external debt, separately identifying the principal and interest components, is also
provided with a one quarter lag. However, systematic information on nonguaranteed external debt,
including a sectoral breakdown, is lacking. On external debt, the 2005 BOP mission noted that it
would be desirable to use balance sheet data from commercial banks pertaining to banking sector
liabilities, which would permit presentation of information with a breakdown by maturities and
instruments.
16.

Monthly data on total official reserve assets and daily CBA net interventions in the foreign

exchange market are provided within 15 days of the end of each month. Data on official reserves
during the month are provided on request from Fund staff. Azerbaijan does not disseminate
International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity Template data, but the CBA and the
government have stated that there have not been any forward or futures transactions that could
give rise to contingent short-term net drains on foreign currency assets. STA has recently advised
the authorities on the definition and coverage of gross official reserve assets. As the authorities
indicated that several definitions of gross official reserve assets are used, STA stressed the
importance of using only one definition, more specifically the definition that follows the sixth edition
of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6). STA will continue
to provide advice to the authorities for the correct compilation of Azerbaijan’s gross official reserve
assets.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation
with the Republic of Azerbaijan
On May 29, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Azerbaijan1 and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal
without a meeting.2
Recent economic developments have been favorable. In 2013, a stabilization of oil output
and strong non-oil growth at nearly 10 percent helped lift overall GDP growth to 5.8 percent.
Inflation remained low, averaging 2.4 percent, restrained by soft food prices and a stable
exchange rate. High oil prices helped keep the current account in significant surplus. The
impact of regional market turbulence in early 2014 has been limited, with few signs of lower
manat demand or capital flight. Financial indicators of the banking system excluding the
largely state-owned public bank, the International Bank of Azerbaijan (IBA), appear stable.
Since last year, the authorities have begun to unwind the supportive macroeconomic policies
put in place during the 2008/09 global crisis. Preliminary data suggest that the 2013 non-oil
primary deficit in percent of non-oil GDP remained at the 2012 level, below the announced
target, reflecting some spending restraint. The approved budget for 2014 would contribute to
consolidate further the non-oil primary deficit. On monetary policy, the Central Bank of
Azerbaijan (CBA) kept the refinancing rate steady until end-April 2014, when it lowered the
rate by 50 basis points. The CBA has also reduced its direct lending to the real economy, and

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.
2

Article IV consultations are concluded without a Board meeting when the following conditions apply: (i) there
are no acute or significant risks, or general policy issues requiring Board discussion; (ii) policies or
circumstances are unlikely to have significant regional or global impact; (iii) in the event a parallel program
review is being completed, it is also being completed on a lapse-of-time basis; and (iv) the use of Fund
resources is not under discussion or anticipated.

early this year tightened consumer loan conditions to cool down the acceleration of private
sector credit.
Economic prospects over the near and medium term are positive, if underpinned by fiscal
consolidation and supported by reforms to spur non-oil private sector activity. Growth of
non-oil GDP is projected to remain strong at about 8 percent in 2014–15, before declining to
5 percent through 2019. With the non-oil economy hitting capacity constraints, inflation is
set to rise, but tighter fiscal policy and soft food prices would allow it to stay at low single
digit levels. High oil prices will help sustain comfortable sovereign foreign assets. Prospects
could be affected by a disruption in oil production, slippages in the fiscal adjustment, and
further weakening of the financial situation of the IBA. Risks from a potential deterioration
in the global outlook emanate mainly from a fall in global oil prices but large sovereign
foreign assets provide a buffer to help mitigate the impact of any shocks.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2014 Article IV consultation with Azerbaijan, Executive Directors
endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows:
The government’s recent achievements provide an impetus to advance toward the goal of
becoming a dynamic emerging market. Recent agreements in the gas sector will help
transform Azerbaijan into a strategic gas supplier for the European market. In addition, the
government’s successful debut Eurobond, issued amid market turbulence in the region, is
testimony of investors’ confidence in the prudent management of the oil revenues as
reflected in large buffers and macroeconomic stability. This vote of confidence, along with
the benign environment of high oil prices, provides an opportunity to build on the recent
progress in changing the course of macroeconomic policies and take decisive steps to
improve governance and the business climate. Actions in these areas will be crucial to
fostering sustainable and diversified private sector-led growth that will ensure a sustained
improvement in living standards.
Continued efforts to rein in government spending are needed to reduce fiscal vulnerabilities
and achieve sustainability of the non-oil fiscal position in the medium term. Staff welcomes
the approved 2014 budget that contains government spending, and encourages the authorities
to complement their plans to improve public investment efficiency with decisive business
climate reforms to create opportunities for private investment. Moving ahead decisively with
the planned reform of the pension system, along with the adoption of a rules-based fiscal
framework and sound fiscal risk management, will also help safeguard the consolidation
efforts and preserve fiscal sustainability over the medium term. Given the prospects of flat oil
production and softer oil prices, public announcement of and strict adherence to the informal
fiscal rule would help build a track record for the adoption of a formal fiscal rule.

3

The current monetary policy stance is appropriate if supported by prudent fiscal and financial
sector policies. Inflationary pressures are likely to remain subdued if the authorities’ plans to
tighten fiscal policy and cool down consumer credit growth are fully implemented. Monetary
tightening would be warranted if demand pressures arise in the event of slippages in the
fiscal consolidation plan or a reversal in soft global food prices due to regional tensions.
Going forward, strengthening the role of monetary policy as anchor for inflation expectations
requires discontinuing the CBA’s direct lending on a permanent basis and decisive progress
to develop the interbank money and foreign exchange markets in line with past IMF technical
assistance. These actions would facilitate a move toward inflation targeting and pave the way
for adopting greater exchange rate flexibility over the medium term when the costs of the
current exchange rate regime will increase as Azerbaijan further diversifies its economy and
increases its financial integration.
Enhancing the regulatory framework while promoting financial deepening is critical for the
development of the non-oil economy. Recent measures by the CBA to strengthen banking
regulations will help ensure correct capital needs; but increasing the resilience of the banking
system also requires reducing the exposure of banks to connected lending and to un-hedged
borrowers. Strengthening the banking system to facilitate a sustainable and broad-based
growth led by the private sector will require actions aimed at encouraging market-led
consolidation of banks without extending the new deadline to meet the capital requirement;
creating a private bureau to promote competition in interest margins; protecting creditors’
rights to help banks reduce their costs; and ensuring a level playing field in the banking
system by further reducing the IBA’s dominance in the system. Restructuring the IBA is also
needed to help strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism and contain the associated
fiscal risks.
Achieving sustainable growth of the non-oil output and export diversification in the medium
term also entails accelerating reforms to attract private investment. Building on recent efforts
to reduce corruption, including the introduction of e-government and “ASAN” public
services, the authorities could broaden the anti-corruption efforts beyond small-scale
corruption, strengthen the rule of law, and reduce formal and informal constraints to business
environment in the non-oil sector. Such efforts will be crucial to foster a competitive economy
and reap the full benefits of complementary efforts aimed at developing the domestic capital
market and opening up new export markets.
