VIETNAM
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 27, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Macroeconomic situation: As macroeconomic policies were tightened, output growth is
slowing; inflation, after peaking in August 2011, is declining rapidly; confidence in the
Vietnamese dong has increased; and international reserves are beginning to recover. The
credibility of the State Bank of Vietnam rose significantly, but this gain remains fragile.
Financial sector: As credit growth has slowed, vulnerabilities in the financial sector
have come to the fore. The authorities have begun to tackle several small weak banks
that are experiencing a liquidity squeeze. The Prime Minister recently announced an
ambitious reform program for the financial sector over the next few years.
State-owned enterprise (SOE) reform: SOE reform is needed to reduce risks to the
financial sector and public finances, and to improve growth prospects in the medium
term. The authorities are initiating reform measures, but progress is slow.
Policy recommendations: Staff recommend that, to reinforce the SBV’s credibility and
ensure that inflation remains on the downward path, further adjustment in monetary
policy should be made only cautiously. While some fiscal expansion is projected to
arrest a rapid slowdown in 2012, planned public sector wage increases should be
partially offset by cuts in other current spending. In the financial sector, quick and
comprehensive action to deal with weak banks, as well as deeper reforms in the
financial sector will be needed. If downside risks from external factors materialize, there
is scope for a somewhat more accommodative fiscal stance, though the authorities
should eschew monetary loosening as far as possible.
Medium-term prospects: Growth prospects remain good as Vietnam transitions to
middle-income status, if macroeconomic stability is restored and sustained and
structural reforms, notably in the financial and SOE sectors, are implemented.
Exchange regime: The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as “stabilized,”
and the de jure exchange rate regime is “floating.” Vietnam is an Article VIII member
and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

VIETNAM

INTRODUCTION
1.
The economy and financial sector
have begun to stabilize, and monetary
policy credibility has improved.
Undergirded by tight macroeconomic policies,
inflation is receding rapidly, activity is slowing,
and the current account deficit has declined
sharply. The informal interbank exchange rate
has moved within the band around the official
rate and investors, both domestic and foreign,
are shifting into dong assets, allowing the
State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) to increase
foreign exchange reserves.

2.
However, significant vulnerabilities
remain. Even as problems in a number of
small weak banks are being contained, the
process of resolving them, as well as
addressing broader weaknesses in the
financial sector, is slow. Reform of SOEs is also
proceeding slowly.
3.
Stabilization should remain the
highest priority. While much progress has
been made, confidence is still nascent and
policymakers should err on the side of caution,
building policy credibility for the longer run.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK

y/y) in April, despite increases in administered
energy prices (Box 1).1


Output and inflation: In Q1 2012,
GDP fell by almost 8 percent (q/q annualized,
seasonally adjusted), led by construction and
mining, and industrial production remained
flat (q/q annualized, s.a.). Growth in retail
sales slowed to 3¼ percent (q/q annualized
s.a.), compared to 13¾ percent in the
previous quarter. The number of enterprises
that went bankrupt or stopped operation
reportedly increased by 6 percent (y/y) in Q1,
and there is anecdotal evidence of subdued
consumer spending during the Lunar New
Year celebrations. Credit growth for 2011, at
14.3 percent (y/y), undershot the SBV’s target
(of 15–17 percent) and turned negative in Q1
2012 (q/q). Inflation slowed to 10.5 percent


Balance of payments: In 2011, the
current account deficit narrowed sharply, to
0.5 percent of GDP, notwithstanding an
appreciation of the real effective exchange rate
(Box 2). Exports rose rapidly, in part because of
higher commodity prices, but also due to
production from a large foreign-financed
investment project coming on stream. Imports,
in line with slower demand, remained subdued.
In the capital and financial account, direct
investment held up well, while portfolio and
other flows declined somewhat. Hoarding of
gold and foreign exchange by residents outside
the financial system, while overall still high in
2011, has begun to decline in Q4.

However, to limit losses for SOEs, increases in fuel
prices were accompanied by the reduction to zero of
fuel import tariffs. Electricity price rises were insufficient
to recover past losses by the state-owned distributor.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. Inflation Momentum and the Real Interest Rate1
Headline inflation. Vietnam experienced a bout of
high inflation in 2011 comparable to 2008. Headline
inflation peaked at 23 percent y/y in August 2011,
and then declined to 10½ percent in April 2012. In
the previous episode, inflation had similarly risen to
28½ percent in August 2008 and then declined
rapidly to single digits in a space of about eight
months. Both episodes appear to have originated
with external shocks, but were exacerbated by loose
macroeconomic policies. While the 2008 episode
was related to large unsterilized capital inflows in the
aftermath of WTO accession, the 2011 episode came
in the wake of a large macroeconomic policy
stimulus in response to the global financial crisis.
Inflation momentum. Although 12-month inflation
is a widely used indicator of inflation, several other
measures are useful to gauge inflationary pressures
on a rolling basis. For Vietnam, one such measure,
seasonally adjusted inflation (three-month moving
average, annualized) suggests that the inflation
momentum has fallen sharply in recent months.
During Q1 2012, seasonally adjusted inflation fell to
under 5 percent from a peak of over 37 percent in
mid-2011 (earlier than the peak in headline
inflation).2
Real interest rate. With high inflation, the real
interest rate fell into negative territory in Q3 2010.
With the sharp decline in inflation (measured by the
above-mentioned inflation momentum indicator),

the real interest rate reverted back to positive
territory around Q4 2011 and reached around
10 percent in early 2012, a high level by any
measure. The SBV’s recent rate announcement of
cumulative 400 bps rate cuts by end-2012 may be
understood in this context. However, further reining
in inflation would require, among other factors:
(i) supportive steps to limit credit growth by banks;
(ii) quickly and decisively addressing problems of
weak banks; and (iii) strengthening market
confidence in the dong to stabilize inflation
expectations.

Box 2. Exchange Rate Assessment
The dong remained stable in 2011 while the trade
balance strengthened. The real effective exchange
rate (REER) appreciated by about 11 percent in real
effective terms since March, largely reflecting high
inflation.
Staff estimates suggest that the dong is broadly in
line with fundamentals. The macroeconomic balance
approach indicates a current account norm
of -1.8 percent of GDP, which implies a small
undervaluation of 0.3 to 0.7 percent. The external
stability and the equilibrium exchange rate
approaches suggest modest overvaluation. Given
that the net foreign assets (NFA) used corresponds
to the level in 2010, a higher NFA target would imply
a higher level of overvaluation.

CGER Assessment of the Dong
(In percent)

recently, reserves have again risen rapidly,
underpinned by domestic and foreign
investors’ acquisition of dong assets, which
has been driven by attractive yields in
combination with increased confidence in the
dong. Nonetheless, the level of foreign
exchange reserves remains low (Box 3).
Box 3: Reserve Adequacy
Standard measures of reserve adequacy indicate that
Vietnam’s international reserves are low. At end2011, coverage of prospective imports is only
1.3 months. Even taking into account Vietnam’s very
open economy, its reserves are low compared to
peers (see figure below). Coverage of external shortterm debt, on the other hand, at well over
100 percent, is adequate.

Fiscal developments. Net borrowing
declined sharply in 2011, compared to 2010,
and is estimated at 2.6 percent of GDP, much
lower than the budgeted level of 5 percent of
GDP.2 This estimate is largely attributable to
higher-than-budgeted revenues, both on
account of the authorities’ overly conservative
revenue estimates, as well as higher-thananticipated inflation and oil prices, but also to
some rationalization of public investment.

5.
Risks in the financial sector have
materialized. After years of rapid credit
growth, the tightening of monetary
conditions and a decline in asset prices have
put a number of small joint-stock banks under
intense liquidity pressure. The SBV Governor
announced that the aggregate nonperforming
loans (NPL) ratio had risen to 3.6 percent in
late March. This would likely be higher under
loan classification and provisioning rules in
line with international best practices.
6.
The direction of the authorities’
macroeconomic policies during 2011 has
been broadly in line with staff advice.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

However, policies were tightened more slowly
and by less than envisaged by staff.
Furthermore, the SBV has recently reduced
interest rates rather aggressively. Reliance on
administrative measures increased rather than
declined, though staff recognize that they
have been useful in stabilizing the financial
sector. On the fiscal side, the better-thanprojected outcome in 2011 has been due
largely to higher revenue, though investment
reduction, both by the budget and by SOEs,
was also significant. Some progress was also
made in addressing financial sector
weaknesses.

B. Outlook and Risks—A Balancing Act
Staff’s Views
7.
Despite a sharp slowdown in Q1,
the economy is projected to stabilize
further in 2012. The recent cumulative
reduction of policy interest rates by 200 bps
and a modest fiscal impulse are expected to
cushion adverse effects from slowing
domestic demand and the projected
slowdown in Europe and Asia. As a result,
GDP would continue to grow at 6 percent,
while inflation would decline to about
8¼ percent y/y (10¾ percent on average) by
year-end, in line with the authorities’ target of
year-on-year inflation below 10 percent.
Further rate cuts in the course of the year
have been announced (see below), which
could rekindle pressures on prices and the
exchange rate, if implemented prematurely.
International reserves would increase further
from the level reached in March, to around
$19 billion by year-end (1.6 months of

prospective imports), even as the current
account deficit would rise modestly.3
8.
Exogenous risks to this outlook are
relatively modest, but the risk of losing
market confidence in the government’s
policy orientation is substantial. A possible
sharper-than-anticipated slowdown in Asian
economies in response to a weakening
European economy, or severe financial sector
turmoil in Europe with global spillovers, would
adversely affect Vietnam’s performance. On
the domestic side, a spillover of liquidity
problems in weak banks to the wider system
could lead to a credit crunch, loss of
confidence in the dong, and renewed inflation
(Box 4). However, the probability of these risks
materializing is small. A larger risk arises from
a potential perception of waning government
commitment to stabilizing the economy and
safeguarding the financial sector. Maintaining
public confidence is critical for the baseline

policies.

A debt sustainability analysis
indicates that the risk of external debt
distress remains low. While the external
debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline
consistently only from 2016 onward, due to
large projected disbursements from the Asian
Development Bank, the net present value of
external debt remains well below the
thresholds set in the debt sustainability
framework. Public and publicly guaranteed
debt is set to continue to decline gradually
from its peak of 54.2 percent of GDP in 2010.
10.
In the medium term, growth needs
to derive more from efficiency gains and
less from higher factor inputs. Growth has

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

hitherto been driven to a large extent by
investment and domestic consumption, and
has been broadly equitable, with poverty rates
declining rapidly. However, with Vietnam
reaching middle-income status and expecting
a slowdown in labor force growth, reforms to
enhance productivity—which would reinforce
the inclusiveness of growth—will need to
complement lasting macroeconomic stability.
Reforming SOEs will be an important element
in this process.

Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities broadly agreed with
the staff’s assessment of economic

VIETNAM

conditions and outlook. During the mission,
they reaffirmed that reducing inflation
remained their foremost policy goal, even as
they expressed concern about possible social
implications from a further growth slowdown.
In his statement on a second interest rate cut
in April (see below), the SBV Governor

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

expressed concern about the slowing
economy. The SBV is enhancing its effort
toward banking sector reforms including
through personnel and organizational
changes. The authorities also explained that
SOE reform was a high priority, but would
take time.

POLICY THEME 1: REBUILDING STABILITY
The government’s stabilization policies are beginning to bear fruit, but gains made thus far need to be
preserved and built on. Priority should be accorded to preserving and adding to hard-won but still
nascent credibility, which would lead to a further decline in inflation expectations and reinforce
stability in the foreign exchange market. In this context, the SBV’s decision to cut policy rates twice in
quick succession has surprised market participants, though their response has been calm to date. While
they expect further rate cuts over the course of 2012, as announced by the SBV Governor, the timing of
the next move would be crucial, because if it is perceived premature, they could interpret the action as
evidence for a shift of the policy objective toward growth from low inflation, risking the fruits of the
tight policy stance over the past year.

Background
12.
Monetary policy was tightened
during 2011 and sustained in early 2012,
followed by a quick succession of rate cuts.
In H1 2011, policy rates were raised in several
steps, and after a premature cut of the repo
rate in July, the SBV raised the refinancing
rate in October. In February 2012, it publicly
stated that interest rates would not be
lowered through Q1. At the same time, it
requested banks to lower lending rates and
allocate credit to specific sectors, and
imposed differentiated credit growth limits
based on banks’ strength. Enforcement of
regulations was generally strengthened,
though ceilings on the credit-to-deposit ratio
were suspended. The SBV also announced
that depreciation of the dong would be
limited to a maximum of 2–3 percent during
2012 in the absence of adverse external
shocks, and has tightened restrictions in the
gold market.

13.
In March 2012, the SBV announced
that it would cut policy rates by a
cumulative 400 bps in the course of 2012.
The rates were subsequently cut on March 13
and then again on April 10, by 100 bps each
time. Also, the deposit rate ceiling was
lowered by 100 bps each time, adding
pressure on weak banks to seek fundamental
solutions. While the two rate cuts came earlier
than expected for most market participants,
the pace of decline in inflation has also been
faster than anticipated. Hence, the market
seems to think that these cuts were justified,
and expects further cuts down the road.
14.
The SBV has added substantially to
its international reserves. After several
months of decline, in the first three months of
2012 gross international reserves rose by
$4.3 billion and net international reserves by
$4.5 billion, and officials expect further
increases in the coming months. The SBV has

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

VIETNAM

also issued about 45 trillion dong of central
bank bills since mid-March to mop up liquidity.
15.
On the fiscal side, staff projections
indicate an increase in net borrowing by
¾ percent of GDP in 2012. This implies a
slight loosening of the fiscal stance in 2012

from the -1 percent of GDP in 2011, resulting
in a fiscal impulse of ½ percent of GDP, which
is projected to help avert a slowdown in
output growth. This is mainly the result of a
significant increase in current expenditure,
which is projected to increase total spending
by about 1 percentage point of GDP.

A. Monetary and Exchange Policy—Reinforcing Credibility
Staff’s Views
16.
Maintaining and enhancing policy
credibility is critical. The cumulative 200 bps
interest rate cuts to date may be justified in
view of rapidly falling inflation and slowing
activity. However, the rapid decline in inflation
in recent months owes much to the sharp
decline in food prices, and core inflation has
been flat, suggesting a risk of resurgence in
inflationary pressure, if monetary policy is
loosened prematurely and by too much,
which would jeopardize the SBV’s hard-won
credibility as in 2010. Indeed, the authorities
should build on the rapid decline in inflation
to achieve lower inflation for 2012, well below
their original target of “below 10 percent,” by
aiming at greater deceleration in inflation for
the remaining months. To this end, they need
to ensure before deciding on further cuts in
policy rates that macroeconomic conditions
are consistent with such a move, as staff
project a stable growth for 2012 with no
additional monetary action. Even in the event
of exogenous risks materializing (see Box 4),
monetary policy should continue to prioritize
inflation reduction and confidence rebuilding.
17.
Monetary policy should increasingly
rely on market-based instruments. The use
of credit growth ceilings is still warranted to
complement interest rate policy, but should
be phased out once inflationary pressures are

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

firmly under control and weak banks have
been decisively dealt with. Other
administrative measures, such as limiting
increases in energy prices to contain
inflationary pressures, at the cost of losses in
key SOEs and/or foregone tax revenues,
should be eschewed. In this context, the SBV’s
operational independence should be further
strengthened.
18.
Quickly rebuilding foreign exchange
reserves while maintaining stability in the
foreign exchange market should be a
priority. This is more urgent in the face of
potentially destabilizing capital inflows attracted
by high yields. Should there be an erosion of
confidence in the dong and depreciation
pressures re-emerge, policy rates need to be retightened quickly. Should appreciation pressures
mount, instead of loosening monetary policy,
reserve accumulation should be accelerated.
Sales of foreign currency by the SBV should only
occur to limit volatility in the foreign exchange
market.
19.
In the medium term, the anchor for
monetary policy should be simplified. The
simultaneous pursuit of multiple announced
objectives limits policy options and
necessitates administrative controls.
Therefore, the SBV would need to target
inflation and international reserves, while
letting the exchange rate be determined by

VIETNAM

market forces. For this shift not to trigger
excessive volatility in the foreign exchange
market, a high degree of credibility is
required. Therefore, a lengthy period of
exchange rate stability would have to precede
such a move.

Authorities’ Views
20.
The SBV stated that fortifying
macroeconomic stability was of paramount
importance. Officials placed priority on
reducing inflation to single digits by year-end,
and reaffirmed that this goal enjoyed support
at the highest political level. They explained
that the interest rate cuts in March and April
were prompted by slowdown in activity,
declining inflation expectations, and weak

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

credit demand. In addition, because credit
growth is tightly controlled by the
differentiated limits, the SBV argues that the
rate cuts would not likely lead to a resurgence
of credit-induced inflationary pressures. They
also indicated that they planned substantial
reserve accumulation over the course of the
year. Overall, they felt that increased
confidence—which was also reflected in
capital inflows—had allowed their recent
policy moves.
21.
With regard to exchange rate
policy, the authorities reiterated their
commitment to limiting depreciation of
the dong. They repeated that a stable
exchange rate and an increase in international
reserves were a high priority.

B. Fiscal Policy—Supporting Stabilization
Staff’s Views
22.
Fiscal policy should be more
supportive of macroeconomic stabilization.
The sharp reduction of investment and net
borrowing in 2011 is welcome. In 2012, some
fiscal expansion is projected given the sharp
weakening of the economy in Q1. However,
the main factor driving up spending, even as
public investment is further reduced, is a
planned increase in wages and salaries
amounting to about 2 percent of GDP. Staff
recognize that high inflation has eroded real
remunerations, but consider that, to keep a
prudent fiscal stance, other current spending
should be contained to the extent possible.
This could reduce the increase in net
borrowing in 2012 to around ¼ percent of
GDP (and all but eliminate the fiscal impulse).
Such fiscal discipline could also help mitigate
a rise in short-term capital inflows. Only if
downward risks to the economy materialize

should fiscal policy be loosened beyond
staff’s recommendation, which would then be
broadly in line with current budget plans.
23.
In the medium term, the authorities
should ensure that public debt remains on
a downward trajectory. This would serve to
enhance fiscal cushions against possible
future shocks as well as potential liabilities
arising from the financial and state-owned
sectors (see below). After peaking in 2010,
public and publicly guaranteed debt has
begun to decline and is projected to reach
48¼ percent of GDP in 2012, and
42½ percent by 2017. This, however, requires
limiting net borrowing to an average of
around 2 percent of GDP. In addition,
declining oil and trade revenues would need
to be compensated for by other sources of
taxation (Box 5). In this regard, the authorities’
plans for a comprehensive tax reform are
welcome.

Authorities’ Views
24.
The authorities agreed with staff’s
assessment of the challenges faced by
fiscal policy. Ministry of Finance (MoF)
officials said that they would seek to build on
the fiscal consolidation achieved last year, but
explained that the planned wage and salary
increases had already been enacted into law.
They indicated, however, that they would
make efforts to constrain non-wage recurrent
spending, as well as increase taxpayer
compliance to boost revenues. In this regard,
they pointed out that higher wages would

support efforts to combat corruption,
including in the revenue administration.
25.
The authorities are seeking to
minimize fiscal costs arising from bank or
SOE restructuring. They indicated that the
2012 budget did not contain provisions for
assuming nonperforming loans, and that
budgetary resources would not be used to
restructure SOE debt. This policy, in their view,
also limited the need to create fiscal cushions
in anticipation of such contingencies, though
they broadly agreed with the need to reduce
public debt over the medium term.

Box 5. Tax Reform
Vietnam’s 10-year budget plan envisions an overall
decline in revenues from 26.2 percent of GDP in
2011 to 22½ percent of GDP in 2020, led by a drop
in oil and trade revenues, as large offshore oil fields
mature and tariffs are reduced under WTO
commitments. To partially compensate for this
revenue loss, the plan envisages a significant rise in
revenues from business taxes (corporate income tax
(CIT), royalties, and value-added tax (VAT)) as well
as, to a lesser extent, personal income taxes (PIT).
To support this shift, the government has launched
a five-year tax reform plan. This envisions
broadening the VAT base and narrowing the scope
of the lower 5 percent rate, and reducing CIT
incentives. It also aims at improving the tax
administration to manage the structural shift in
revenue composition away from taxes collected at

the border and from SOEs, toward those collected
directly from private companies and individuals.
However, some changes in the five-year plan
threaten to undermine domestic revenue: for
example, the government currently plans to cut the
CIT rate from 25 percent to 22 percent and to
eliminate the top rate of the PIT and raise its
threshold, which is already high by international
standards. Staff recommend that any CIT rate cut be
offset by base broadening and that the current PIT
threshold be preserved. Also, there is scope to
significantly raise nonagricultural land tax (property
tax) rates and extend its base to include buildings;
increase petroleum excises to raise revenue, and
protect the environment; and overhaul natural
resource taxation including through the possible
introduction of a resource tax.

POLICY THEME 2: RESTRUCTURING THE ECONOMY
Both in the short and medium term, key sectors of the economy will need to be reformed to improve
factor allocation and raise productivity growth. In the financial sector, the SBV has contained the
threat of small weak banks to the financial system, but a more forceful approach is needed. Beyond
that, gaps in the supervisory and bank resolution frameworks, and governance issues in banks, will
need to be addressed. Far-reaching SOE restructuring to improve performance on a sustained basis is
required to lower contingent fiscal risks, level the playing field in more sectors, boost the economy’s
productivity, and enable the sector to play the leading role envisaged for it by the government.

Background
26.
Financial market confidence
increased but remains tentative. The
authorities have taken action to address
vulnerabilities emanating from a number of
small weak banks, which account for
approximately 7 percent of banking sector
deposits. In a first step, the SBV reinforced
deposit rate caps to prevent these banks from
undermining competitors. Then, in order to
stem a bank run late last year, the SBV
announced unlimited deposit guarantees,
merged three of the small weak banks (with
more mergers expected), and provided direct
and indirect liquidity support through stateowned commercial banks (SOCBs).
Subsequently, it sent special inspection teams
to the nine banks classified as weak (which are
not allowed to expand credit). The combined
assets of these nine banks amount to some
six percent of the total banking sector assets.
Based on the reports of the inspectors, as well

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

as external audits, the banks will be required
to present restructuring and recapitalization
plans for the SBV’s approval. If the
recapitalization plan is deemed inadequate,
the SBV may even nationalize the bank.
Despite their improvised character, these
measures have strengthened the SBV’s
credibility.
27.
As part of the stabilization strategy
announced last year, the authorities have
made SOE reform a priority. Investments
have been scaled back, and some SOEs have
already sold part of their noncore operations.
A broader plan, which includes a substantial
reduction in the number of SOEs through
listing on the stock market, and the creation
of a centralized body to control state holdings
in SOEs, is being considered for legislation. An
improvement in corporate governance
principles is under discussion. The authorities
also intend to publish aggregated financial
indicators for SOEs.

A. Financial Sector Reform—Cleaning Up
Staff’s Views
28.
The government’s bank
restructuring plan is ambitious; it is now
imperative that its provisions are fully
utilized (Box 6). The plan includes important
features for dealing with weak banks, such as
the possibility of restrictions on dividend
payments and dismissing management.4 It
also allows for the resolution of NPLs through
sale to the Debt and Asset Trading
Corporation (DATC) under the MoF. More
4

Using the management expertise of SOCBs to
improve management of small weak banks can be
effective, but it appears that in the most recent
merger case this expertise is not being used.

broadly, the plan introduces a framework for
comprehensive reform of the financial sector,
including through strengthening internal
controls and management, and limiting
control of dominant shareholders. However,
the lack of implementation details implies that
its application will still be to some extent
ad hoc, and the reluctance to close insolvent
banks (indeed, the plan makes no real
distinction between illiquidity and insolvency)
deprives the supervisory authorities of an
important coercive tool.
29.
The SBV’s steps to contain the
problems at weak banks are welcome, but
can only be a beginning, and need to be
sped up. Minimizing costs not only to the

Box 6. The Bank Restructuring Plan
On March 1, 2012, the Prime Minister approved the
“Scheme for Restructuring the System of Credit
Institutions in the Period of 2011–2015.” Its
objectives include developing the “modern, safe,
sound, and efficient” operation of the financial
sector compliant with “international banking
standards and practices”. The plan prescribes specific
measures for different types of credit institutions.



For banks with temporary liquidity shortage:
Refinancing by the SBV, while they are
strengthening their financial condition,
operations, and management under close SBV
supervision. The SBV may limit their operations
and require higher prudential ratios.



For weak banks: Refinancing by the SBV up to
their charter capital under close and
comprehensive supervision by the SBV. Purchase
of good quality assets by SOCBs and healthy
banks. The SBV may also put these banks under
special control, limit dividend and other
payments, suspend managers, force mergers,
and allow foreign institutions to acquire them,
or directly inject capital.

State-Owned Commercial Banks






Develop one to two SOCBs to compete

Continue to promote equitization, with the state
remaining a dominant share holder.
Raising capital (including from the government)
to meet Basel II requirements by 2015.
Reduce the NPL ratio to less than 3 percent
according to domestic standards.
Improve risk management systems.
Restructure and gradually divest from
non-financial sector subsidiaries.
Reduce the credit-to-deposit ratio below
90 percent by 2015.

Commercial Banks

budget, but to the economy as a whole
should be the overarching goal in dealing
with small weak banks. Merging them is no
solution in itself. Liquidity support by the SBV
or SOCBs should be extended only to solvent
banks, and any solvency support needs to be
accompanied by conditions, including that
owners bear first losses. Executive
compensation should be restricted where
appropriate. Nonperforming assets need to
be recognized and disposed of rapidly.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The Plan also lists ways to strengthen credit
institutions, financially and operationally, which
include:










Sale to the DATC or private firms, conversion to
equity, or write-off of bad debts.
Write-off of bad debts stemming from directed
loans through the budget.
Raise charter capital.
Reduction of the credit-to-deposit ratio to at
most 85 percent by 2015.
Increase of information disclosure.
Gradual withdrawal of SOEs’ shareholding in the
financial sector.
Limitation of control of dominant shareholders.
Improvement of qualification of managers and
board members.

30.
Beyond the current efforts to deal
with weak banks, the regulatory and
supervisory framework needs to be
strengthened at every stage including bank
resolution. This would entail introducing
specific and progressive enforcement
measures to prevent problems leading to
insolvency, as well as a special bank resolution
and insolvency regime. At a minimum, this
should prevent the possibility of a reversal of
the supervisory authorities’ decisions by the
court system, protect their staff from personal

VIETNAM

liability, and strengthen fit and proper criteria
for board members and senior managers.
31.
To improve supervision, the
regulatory framework needs to be
strengthened and better enforced.
Prudential rules, such as for loan classification
and provisioning, should be aligned with
international best practices. Better
enforcement also requires raising the capacity
of the supervisory authorities. For this, staff
need to be adequately trained, including to
collect, compile, and analyze data provided by
banks but also to conduct effective onsite
supervision. Moreover, to reduce turnover
and retain talent, staff should be adequately
compensated and receive political backing.

Authorities’ Views

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

32.
The SBV agreed with the need for
forceful action on weak banks. Officials
pointed out that their timetable was tight, and
underscored their willingness to take over
banks that did not submit adequate
restructuring and recapitalization plans, or
where owners were unwilling or unable to
provide new capital and/or attract other
investors. With regard to NPLs, the authorities
acknowledged that they had as yet no reliable
estimate of their magnitude, but indicated
that the DATC’s capacity would be increased.
In any event, they considered that additional
resources would not be needed in 2012, and
expected that much of the nonperforming
real estate assets (which constitute the bulk of
NPLs) could be sold in the market over the
course of the next two years.

B. SOE Reform—Raising Performance
Staff’s Views
33.
SOE reform is essential to reduce
risks to the economy. In the short term,
reducing inefficient investments would help
control inflation and improve asset quality at
some banks. Also, divestments to focus SOEs
on their core businesses are welcome.
However, the lack of information on SOEs’
financial position is posing a threat to the
financial system, as well as, ultimately, the
public fiscal position.
34.
Reforming SOEs is also critical for
longer-term growth prospects. There is
evidence that SOEs have been using capital
and labor inputs much less efficiently than the
private sector. For SOEs to play a productive
role in the economy, their performance needs
to be strengthened on a sustained basis. This
requires decisive measures beyond planned

equitization and/or privatization of minority
stakes, such as those that raise standards of
accountability, transparency (including through
better accounting and stronger oversight by
the state), and financial discipline (including
through the remittance of profits to the owner).
In the recently conducted World Bank survey,
overwhelming majority responded that
improving transparency and accelerating
equitization were the most effective reform
measures. Against this backdrop, the World
Bank and other donors are urging the
government to advance reorganization and
restructuring of SOEs by dividing them into
three groups: those that should be equitized
immediately, those that need to be
restructured first before equitization, and those
that should remain fully owned by the state.
They are also advocating improvement in
corporate governance.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

VIETNAM

Authorities’ Views
35.
The authorities broadly agreed with
staff’s assessment of the SOE sector and
the required remedies. Officials at the
Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of
Planning and Investment recognized the
urgency of reforms and agreed that improved
accountability and supervision would have to

be part of the reform strategy. However, they
pointed out that such reforms would take
time, as they had to compile more
comprehensive information on financial
performance and debts of SOEs. They also
acknowledged that a restructuring of SOE
debt was being discussed, but ruled out using
budgetary resources.

OTHER ISSUES
36.
Data analysis in the financial sector
should be improved. In particular, the
authorities should compute high-frequency
financial soundness indicators, for all banks as
well as on an aggregate basis, on a regular (at
least quarterly) basis. This is especially
important for the upcoming assessment
under the FSAP.
37.
Vietnam’s AML/CFT framework
should be enhanced. In October 2010,
Vietnam was identified—alongside other

countries—by the Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) as having “strategic AML/CFT
deficiencies.” The authorities initiated an
action plan to address these deficiencies.
While significant progress has been made, it
was not deemed sufficient by the FATF, and
there are outstanding issues, mainly regarding
the criminalization of money laundering, the
freezing of terrorist assets, customer due
diligence measures, and international
cooperation. The next FATF review of the
progress made is scheduled for June.

STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
The authorities made significant
strides in stabilizing the economy, but
hard-won confidence is still fragile. They
tightened monetary and fiscal policy, and
restrained investment by both the state and
SOEs. At the same time, a start has been
made to address banking sector
vulnerabilities, and SOE reform is being
prepared. As a consequence, inflation and
inflation expectations have declined,
confidence in the dong has increased, the
exchange rate has stabilized, and international
reserves have begun to recover.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39.
The SBV needs to maintain and
build on gains in monetary policy
credibility. While the recent rate cuts in quick
succession were justified in light of rapidly
falling inflation and a weak economy, there is
a risk of eroding market confidence and
triggering renewed pressure on prices and the
exchange rate if further rate cuts are
implemented too rapidly and the authorities
are perceived as again prioritizing growth.
Instead, the authorities should seize the
opportunity to bolster their credibility by
aiming for inflation well below their original
target of below 10 percent, rebuild
international reserves further, and accept

VIETNAM

somewhat slower economic growth. Thus, the
SBV should err on the side of caution, and be
prepared to delay rate cuts depending on
developments in the course of the year.
40.
Going forward, monetary and
exchange policies should rely less on
administrative measures. While credit
growth and deposit rate ceilings can be useful
in the current situation, it is strong supervision
of the financial sector that should ensure that
banks’ lending decisions remain prudent. In
the gold and foreign exchange markets,
administrative measures cannot replace
fundamental trust in the domestic currency.
41.
Fiscal policy should support
macroeconomic stabilization and build
cushions against contingent liabilities.
While further rationalization of public
investment is welcome, the planned increase
in the wage bill raises current spending
significantly. Staff appreciate the need to
compensate for the erosion of real wages due
to high inflation, but to keep a prudent fiscal
stance and to help contain inflationary
pressures, this increase should be partially
offset by cuts in other current spending to the
extent possible.
42.
Should risks to the outlook
materialize, care will need to be taken that
stability gains are not jeopardized. To this

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

end, monetary policy would need to continue
to focus on reducing inflation, while fiscal
policy could be loosened moderately.
43.
Financial sector restructuring needs
to move forward rapidly. Market
participants expect further steps, and
maintenance of confidence depends on quick
action by the authorities. In a first step, small
weak banks need to be dealt with forcefully,
including by forcing them to recognize NPLs,
imposing strict conditions for liquidity
support, and closing insolvent banks. In
addition, the bank restructuring framework
should be strengthened to prevent a
recurrence of similar problems. More broadly,
the legal framework for supervision, as well as
its enforcement, need to be strengthened.
44.
SOE reform is critical. The planned
equitization and privatization of a large
number of SOEs is welcome. However,
oversight, accountability, and financial
discipline of the remaining SOEs need to be
raised, both to reduce risks to the financial
sector and public finances, as well as to lay
the foundations for continued strong
economic performance in the medium term.
45.
It is recommended that the next
Article IV consultation be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP2
(As of March 2012)

A. Partnership in Vietnam's Development Strategy
The World Bank Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) for Vietnam was presented to the Board
of Directors in December 2011. The CPS is fully
aligned with Vietnam’s Socio-Economic
Development Strategy (SEDS) 2011–15 and sets
out the World Bank’s planned support for
Vietnam between FY12 and FY16. The CPS
program will support investments and policies
organized into a strategic framework of three
pillars and three cross-cutting themes. The
pillars are: (i) strengthening Vietnam's
competitiveness in the regional and global
economy, (ii) increasing the sustainability of its
development, and (iii) broadening access to
opportunity. Key cross-cutting themes are
(i) strengthening governance, (ii) supporting
gender equity, and (iii) improving resilience in
the face of external economic shocks, natural
hazards, and the impact of climate change. 2
An underlying theme in the CPS is the
importance of building on the country's strong
track record of growth and poverty reduction to
partner with Vietnam in its effort to achieve
success as a middle-income country (MIC). The
CPS program will support reforms for Vietnam’s
multiple transitions, notably, from an agrarian
economy toward one that is more urban and
industrialized; from a focus on quantity toward
a greater focus on quality of production and
service provision; and from a factor driven to an
efficiency driven economy.
Competitiveness: Support in this area focuses
on: (a) Vietnam’s vulnerability to macroeconomic
2

Questions may be referred to Ms. Williams (202-473-6997).

instability, including structural weaknesses in
financial and SOE sector as well as Public Finance
Management; (b) the low quality of key
infrastructure services due to inefficiencies in
power distribution and transmission, and in the
water and transport sectors; (c) low-value
addition in Vietnamese production; and (d) weak
innovation capacity and the related low skills
base of the Vietnamese labor force.
Accountability gaps exacerbated by
decentralization are among the governance
challenges addressed under this pillar.
Sustainability: In this pillar, the focus is on
management of water resource and land;
conservation of forests and biodiversity;
pollution control and the related issue of low
connectivity to sanitation systems; mitigation
and adaptation measures in light of Vietnam’s
high vulnerability to climate change; and
disaster risk management in light of the
country’s increasing exposure to risks posed by
extreme weather events. The CPS program
under this pillar addresses governance
weaknesses such as unclear and conflicting
jurisdiction which undermines enforcement of
environmental regulation, and limited access to
information which undermines accountability.
Opportunity: The World Bank supports the
development and implementation of policies to
ensure that more citizens can benefit from the
country’s transition to MIC status. This involves
efforts to address rising inequality, especially
between ethnic minorities and the rest of
Vietnam’s population, and between urban and
rural households; policy reform and institutional
strengthening for social insurance and social

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

VIETNAM

safety nets to reduce vulnerability at the
household level; weaknesses in basic public
service delivery and access; and gender equality,
a special theme for IDA 16.
Governance: Mainstreaming governance is a
priority cutting across the three CPS pillars. The
approach to mainstreaming is based on the
following three principles: (i) systematically
leveraging the Bank’s lending and analytical
activities to support improved governance in
Vietnam; (ii) improving project performance by
better understanding and addressing
governance risks to the achievement of
development outcomes; and (iii) sustaining the
effort, including by making periodic
adjustments if the approach is not working. This
should lead to a more comprehensive approach
to governance.
Gender: The Bank’s support to gender in the
CPS has four key elements: (i) to support
Government in improving the implementation
of the Law on Gender Equality and the National
Strategy on Gender Equality, in part by building
gender awareness and capacity within relevant

ministries; (ii) to support the development of a
national gender data system by building on the
recent National Gender Statistical Indicator
System; (iii) to apply a gender lens to identify
opportunities to integrate gender more
systematically into Bank operations, as was
done in e.g., the Third Rural Transport Project,
including by making the systematic collection of
data disaggregated by gender a guiding
principle; and (iv) to help close the knowledge
gap through quantitative and qualitative
research on gender issues.
Vulnerability: The global economic crisis has
heightened Vietnam’s vulnerability to external
shocks at both the macroeconomic and
household level, and there is increased awareness
of risks posed by climate change. Resilience is,
therefore, a third theme cutting across all three
CPS pillars, in the context of the macroeconomic
policy framework and financial sector soundness
(engagement areas under Pillar 1—
Competitiveness), climate change mitigation and
adaptation (engagement areas under Pillar 2—
Sustainability), and social protection and
facilitation of livelihoods for the poor
(engagement areas under Pillar 3—Opportunity).

B. World Bank Group Strategy and Lending
The World Bank Group uses a broad range of
instruments, elaborated in the previous as well
as the new CPS, to support the objectives laid
out in the SEDP and other key strategies of the
Government. These instruments include a broad
range of development policy and investment
operations, and analytical and advisory
activities; the IFC’s equity, loan, and technical
assistance (TA) participations and the Mekong
Private Sector Development Facility (MPDF);
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA) activities; and donor partnerships and
ODA coordination.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Scale of the World Bank Group program: In
FY10, the World Bank (IBRD) processed its first
two IBRD operations for Vietnam, totaling
US$700 million. Vietnam’s IDA allocations
depend on its performance relative to other
eligible IDA recipients and on the overall IDA
resource envelope. At more than US$2.1 billion
equivalent for IDA and IBRD combined, the
FY10 program significantly surpassed that of
prior years, and Vietnam was the World Bank’s
eighth largest borrower in FY10. Commitments
increased further in FY11, totaling
US$2.348 billion, of which US$1.268 billion was

VIETNAM

IDA and US$1.068 billion IBRD. In FY12, the first
year of IDA 16, the eight planned World Bank
operations are estimated to reach a total
amount of US$1.15 billion, of which
US$1.05 billion will be IDA. An indicative IDA
16 allocation3 of about SDR 2.8 billion
(equivalent to US$4.2 billion) would be available
to support Vietnam’s economic and social
development in FY12–FY14. This would be the
largest IDA allocation to Vietnam of any IDA
Replenishment, reflecting Vietnam’s strong
performance as well as the increase in overall
IDA resources mobilized for IDA 16 compared
with IDA 15. The share of DPOs in the
FY12–FY14 IDA program is currently estimated
at about 25 percent and could rise if policy
reform momentum increases.
Proposed FY12–FY14 IBRD commitments total
US$770 million, of which around US$280 million
is planned for two Development Policy
Operations, and the balance for investment
lending. Most of these resources would likely
support infrastructure development. There are
currently 49 active IDA/IBRD operations,
totaling US$7.9 billion. IFC commitments
totaled US$1,800 million over the five-year
period of FY07–FY11, including commitments
through their asset management business, and
both IFC and MIGA programs are expected to
grow in the coming years.
Lending program: The World Bank has a
comprehensive investment lending program
cutting across a broad range of sectors. Roughly
two-thirds of the program is dedicated to
infrastructure investments and it is expected that
3 For IDA16 allocations, only FY12 allocation is firm, and
allocations in FY13–14 are indicative and can change
depending on total IDA resources available in FY13 and 14, the
IDA resource allocation process, and exchange rate changes
between the SDR and the U.S. dollar.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

in the future, infrastructure will continue to
dominate the lending program, especially
Vietnam’s IBRD borrowing. In infrastructure, the
program includes lending operations in rural
energy, energy transmission and distribution,
hydropower, various types of transport projects,
water supply and sanitation, urban upgrading
and natural disaster risk management. In
agriculture, the program includes lending for
agricultural competitiveness, livestock
competitiveness, northern mountains poverty
reduction, avian and human influence control
and forest sector development. In human
development, operations cover various health
support projects, hospital waste management,
school education quality assurance, and support
for higher education. The World Bank
furthermore has investment lending in the areas
of public financial investment, tax administration
and financial sector modernization.
The Poverty Reduction Support Credits
(PRSCs 1–10) have been the centerpiece of the
World Bank’s policy lending program during the
last 10 years, supporting reforms in a broad
range of areas. The PRSC series will be followed
by a new DPO series of Economic Management
and Competitiveness Credits (EMCC). Like the
PRSCs, the EMCCs will be multi-year, multidonor operations starting in FY12 with a
five-year time horizon. The series will focus on
critical reforms to enhance competitiveness,
central to sustained growth and poverty
reduction in Vietnam. Strategic and analytical
underpinnings for the EMCCs will be drawn
from the SEDS 2011–20, the Competitiveness
Pillar of the CPS, the National Competitiveness
Report, and recent Vietnam Development
Reports (VDRs). Competitiveness is a function of
many factors, but one of the lessons from the
PRSC series is the importance of a focused
reform agenda under one series of budget
support operations. The EMCCs will, therefore,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

VIETNAM

focus on reforms to strengthen
(i) macroeconomic stability and (ii) institutions
for public sector governance and private sector
development. In addition, policy lending has
also included support for the government’s
poverty reduction program (P-135), higher
education reform, power sector reform, and a
series of DPOs supporting climate change
mitigation and adaptation. Vietnam’s first IBRD
operation, approved in FY10, furthermore
launched a development policy loan series
supporting public investment reforms—partly
as a response to the global economic crisis—
with a second operation approved in FY11.
Knowledge program: The World Bank supports
the Government’s efforts to strengthen
institutional capacity through its knowledge
program of analytical and advisory services.
While financing is still an important part of the
partnership between the Vietnamese
government and the World Bank, Vietnam’s new
status as an MIC highlights the important role
the Bank can and does play in generating
knowledge and sharing global experiences and
best practice. The annual Vietnam Development
Reports (VDRs), written in coordination with a
large number of donors and submitted to the

annual year-end Consultative Group meeting,
summarize the accumulated knowledge in a
specific policy area of Vietnam’s reform agenda.
Recent VDRs have focused on thematic areas
such as social protection (2008), business
development (2009), modern institutions (2010),
natural resource management (2011) and
Vietnam’s transition to a market economy (2012).
The next VDR will focus on Skills Development.
Other reports during this period included
Infrastructure Finance, Higher Education and
Skills for Growth, Country Financial
Accountability Assessment, Health Financing,
Gender Assessment, Financial Sector Strategy, a
series on Vietnam’s Infrastructure Challenges,
High Quality Basic Education, and an
Urbanization Review. Forthcoming reports
include: Financial Inclusion and Access to
Finance, Poverty Assessment, Agriculture Public
Expenditure Review, Poverty and Social Impact
Assessment for Climate Change and Poverty in
the Central Highlands. In addition, the World
Bank continues to provide technical assistance
in areas such as governance, social protection,
renewable energy, climate change adaptation,
financial sector reform and public financial
management reform.

C. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Vietnam
Specific Areas
Since the expiration of the PRGF in April 2004,
the two institutions have closely collaborated
on monitoring the macroeconomic situation,
and in discussions of PRSC triggers and
benchmarks in the policy areas that used to be
covered by the PRGF agreement. The IMF has
provided Letters of Assessment in support of
PRSC operations. The collaboration will
continue with the EMCC. In the area of public
financial management, the World Bank has an
investment credit to support the introduction

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

of a modern Treasury and Budget Management
Information System, and coordinates technical
inputs on a large multi-donor trust fund for
public financial management reform. It also has
an investment loan for Tax Administration
Modernization. The World Bank has started a
Programmatic Public Finance Review (PPFR)
and will be collaborating closely on this with
the IMF, including on a review of Budget
Transparency. There is close cooperation

VIETNAM

between the IMF’s Regional PFM Advisor and
the Bank team in Hanoi.
In recent years, joint work has been under way
in support of the establishment of a modern
central bank, with the IMF providing technical
assistance (TA) on monetary policy and
operations, and both the World Bank and IMF
providing TA on banking supervision. The
World Bank has also set up investment credits
to support development of an integrated
system of advanced business processes and
modern information technology at the SBV
(including for the Deposit Insurance Agency
and Credit Information Center) to improve its
capacity to make more informed and timely
policy decisions. The World Bank and IMF are
working closely together toward fielding an
FSAP, at the request of the authorities. A
World Bank-IMF joint FSAP information
seminar was held in September 2010, which
has been followed up with joint meetings with
the SBV. The IMF further fielded a mission on

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

stress testing during the second half of 2011.
Since 2005, the World Bank and the IMF have
jointly prepared an annual Debt Sustainability
Assessment. The Asian Development Bank has
joined since 2009. There are plans to jointly
conduct training on debt management in the
coming months. The IMF and the World Bank
also collaborate in the development and timely
dissemination of reliable economic and
financial statistics. The IMF focuses on
improving balance of payments, national
accounts, and price statistics, while the World
Bank provides assistance on issues related to
the production of high-quality household and
enterprise surveys. Through PRSC10 and
specific TA, the World Bank and development
partners have supported the SBV to formulate
a regulation that would improve timeliness
and availability of monetary and banking
sector information. The two institutions consult
during Article IV consultation in order to share
information and help coordinate policies.

ANNEX III. RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of March 2012)
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) resumed
its operations in Vietnam in October 1993. The
Country Strategy and Program (CSP) 2007–10
was endorsed in October 2006 and was fully
aligned with and designed to support
implementation of the Government’s SocioEconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006–10.
The goals of the CSP were to help the
Government reduce poverty, achieve the
Millennium Development Goals/Vietnam
Development Goals, and exit from low-income
country status. Recognizing Vietnam has
actually achieved poverty reduction through
rapid economic growth, the CSP was also
growth-oriented with focuses on: (i) businessled, pro-poor economic growth: AsDB support
aimed to help the Government develop the
foundations for increased private sector
investment and employment; (ii) social equity
and balanced development: in addition to
supporting education, health, targeted poverty
reduction, and rural infrastructure, the CSP
addressed communicable diseases such as avian
influenza and HIV/AIDS; gender and other
equity issues were main-streamed in AsDB
projects; (iii) environment: the CSP supported
natural resources management, emphasizing
the link between resources depletion and
persistent poverty, through assistance on
biodiversity, water, and coastal resources
management and livelihood improvement.
Governance has been addressed through all
AsDB operations and regional cooperation has
also been strongly supported through a number
of projects. As Vietnam has prepared the new
Socio-Economic Development Strategy for
2011–20 and Socio-Economic Development

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Plan 2011–15, the AsDB is also preparing a new
CPS for 2012–15 to further support Vietnam’s
continuing rapid growth as a new middleincome country in line with AsDB’s Strategy
2020. Important features of Vietnam CPS
2011–15 are: (i) fully aligned with SEDP
2011–15; (ii) consistent with the AsDB’s Strategy
2020 for strategic directions and operational
priorities; (iii) Results-based with monitorable
and time-bound performance (outcome and
output) indicators; (iv) formulated on the basis
of sector assessment, strategy, and roadmap;
and (v) more selective approach in order to
maximize development effectiveness and
minimize trans-action costs. The new CPS is
expected to be approved by the AsDB Board in
the second half of 2012.
From October 1993 until December 31, 2011,
the AsDB approved 114 sovereign loans totaling
US10.443 billion, comprising US$5.449 billion
from highly concessional Asian Development
Fund (ADF) and US$4.994 billion from less
concessional Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR).
The contract awards achievement in 2011 was
US$1,353.45 million compared with
US$610.21 million in 2010 and
US$1,781.77 million in 2009. Disbursement in
2011 attained US$791.84 million compared
with US$406.69 million in 2010 and
US$1,093.4 million in 2009. The AsDB has also
extended technical assistance grants amounting
to US$242.2 million for 261 projects and other
26 grant projects totaling US$150.1 million. In
addition to public sector operations, the AsDB
has also approved eight nonsovereign loans,
two political risk guarantees, and one B-loan
totaling US$280.0 million. Vietnam also receives

VIETNAM

substantial support under the Greater Mekong
Subregion initiatives, involving Cambodia,
China, Lao P.D.R., Myanmar, Thailand, and
Vietnam.
Support for policy and structural reforms to
improve public sector efficiency and to
encourage the development of the private
sector is a vital component of AsDB operations
in Vietnam. So far, the AsDB has approved
26 program loans in the agricultural sector, the
financial sector, SOE reform and corporate
governance, public administration reform, SME
development, secondary education, health and
in support of the multi-donor supported
Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC). The
AsDB’s policy dialogue included support for
increased efficiency of state-owned utilities
through reforming their rate structure and other
measures to increase cost recovery and to
strengthen financial management, policy
analysis, and planning. The AsDB is also the key
supporter of public administration reform,
particularly through civil service reform.
Following a reorganization of the AsDB’s
regional departments in May 2006, Vietnam is
covered by the Southeast Asia Department,
along with Cambodia, Brunei Darussalam,
Lao P.D.R., Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia,
Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore. The
resident mission has been gradually
strengthened and is responsible for country
economic monitoring, programming, and donor
coordination functions, in addition to
administration of 31 percent of the ongoing
loan portfolio. The resident mission has helped
the Government prepare the results-based
SEDP 2006–10 through a broad, consultative
process, including preparing the results
framework for monitoring SEDP outcomes, and
such efforts are continuing for the development
of SEDP 2011–15. To implement the principles

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the
resident mission actively participates in the
Partnership Group on Aid Effectiveness with the
Government and other development partners
(which was reorganized to be the Aid
Effectiveness Forum in 2010), taking a lead in
harmonizing social safeguard policies and
procurement rules and procedures between the
Government and donors. The AsDB also actively
participates in the “Six Banks Initiative,” with
Agence Française de Développement (AfD), KfW
Development Bank, Korea Eximbank, Japan
International Cooperation Agency, and the
World Bank, to harmonize project preparation,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation
practices, and improve the quality and
effectiveness of investment projects.
The AsDB and IMF staff work closely together to
support the process of economic reforms in
Vietnam. The AsDB staff interacts with IMF
missions, exchange information, and regularly
consult on policy matters. The resident missions
of the two institutions cooperate closely. For the
first time in 2008, the AsDB took part in the
Vietnam debt sustainability analysis with the
IMF and the World Bank. As of 2011, at the
invitation of the authorities, the AsDB attended
some meetings during IMF Article IV missions.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 27, 2012)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for
Surveillance
General: Data provision has some
shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for
surveillance. Most affected areas are: national
accounts, government finance, external sector,
and financial sector statistics.
National accounts: The General Statistics
Office provides quarterly (cumulative) and
annual data on GDP by type of economic
activity and annual data by expenditure (both in
current and constant prices), and monthly and
annual data on external trade, industrial output,
retail sales, and prices. The annual constant
price GDP estimates have 1994 as the base year
and are in need of updating. While the national
accounts methodologies are broadly consistent
with the SNA93, the compilation process suffers
from poor data collection practices and a lack of
coordination and communication between data
collection agencies. The 2010 National Accounts
Statistics mission outlined the following
outstanding data issues: (i) compiling quarterly
GDP by expenditure approach; (ii) accounting
for the non-observed economy; (iii) conducting
a quarterly survey on capital formation; (iv) use
of price deflators rather than quantity valuation
approach for estimating output of
manufacturing at constant prices; and
(v) development of real estate statistics, wage
rate index for construction industry employees,
construction price index, estimation of
consumption of fixed capital (CFC), and capital
stock.
Prices statistics: The CPI methodology is
largely in line with international standards.
However, there is only a notional inclusion of

owner-occupied and rental housing. Also, there
is a need to adopt a geometric mean of price
relatives at the lower level of aggregation,
instead of the upward biased arithmetic mean.
Trade price indices are also compiled, but not
used in the national accounts.
Government finance statistics: Government
operations data reflect the consolidated
operations of the state budget, which cover all
four levels of government (central, provincial,
district, and commune). However, data exclude
off-budget investment expenditure, onlending,
quasi fiscal activities of the central bank (and
state-owned enterprises (SOEs)), and extrabudgetary funds, among which are the Social
Security Fund, Enterprise Restructuring Fund,
Development Assistance Fund, Export Support
Fund, local development funds, and the Sinking
Fund (for repayment of on-lent funds), for
which data are not compiled/disseminated on a
regular basis. Compilation is on a cash basis for
final annual data, but varies for provisional data
depending on their source. As a result,
government financing data, in particular
domestic bank financing, cannot be reconciled
as reported in the fiscal and monetary accounts.
The World Bank and the IMF have
recommended improving the coverage of fiscal
data and aligning definitions with the
GFSM 2001. A new budget law, expected to
become effective in 2013, is likely to
significantly enhance the quality of fiscal
reporting. Vietnam tentatively confirmed
participation in the three-year GFS technical
assistance (TA) project for Asia and Pacific
Island countries, funded by the Japanese
Government. Participation in this project,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

VIETNAM

launched recently by STA, could enhance
further the quality of fiscal data.
Monetary statistics: A key shortcoming is
insufficient sectorization of bank credit. The
IMF’s Statistics Department (STA) has
encouraged the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) to
develop a reporting scheme for a
comprehensive break-down of banks’ credit to
the economy by borrowing sectors and
subsectors. In addition, STA has recommended
that: (a) a list of SOEs that have been privatized
and, therefore, should be classified as private
enterprises should be distributed to banks in
order to guide their data reporting on
enterprises; (b) funds for on-lending should be
reclassified out of banks’ “unclassified liabilities”
to “other deposits.” Further cooperation from
the authorities is needed to resolve data
discrepancies involving credit data for a stateowned bank. These discrepancies may reflect
possible non-coverage and/or omission of
certain loans and financial leases, offset by
lower deposits and other liabilities.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments
statistics rely on limited source data, resulting in
gaps in all areas of the external accounts
(current, capital, and financial). The authorities
are working on improving data on tourism
revenue (travel) and workers’ remittances,
supported by IMF’s STA TA. Regarding foreign
direct investment, the 2009 STA mission noted
that direct investment statistics are incomplete
because the legal definition of foreign investor

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

as used by the State Securities Commission does
not accord with statistical guidelines; as a result,
branches of foreign banks in Vietnam and
100 percent foreign–owned enterprises resident
in Vietnam are considered as nonresidents. Data
on portfolio investment assets do not identify
sector and instrument breakdowns; and the
scope of the data on the liabilities side appears
limited. International investment position (IIP)
data are not compiled. The authorities are
working on improving external sector statistics
with assistance from STA.
Financial sector statistics: Financial sector
data remain largely unavailable, even on
financial soundness indicators.

Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) since September 2003.
No data ROSC are available.

Reporting to STA
Currently, no government finance statistics
(GFS) are reported for publication in the IMF’s
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY)
or International Financial Statistics (IFS). Annual
GFS data through 2004, excluding extrabudgetary funds and social security funds,
based on the 1986 GFS format, have been
reported for publication in the GFSY. No
sub-annual fiscal data have been reported for
publication in IFS since 2001.

CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS

April 27, 2012

Approved By

Masahiko Takeda and Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
Sudhir Shetty and Jeffrey D. Lewis (IDA)

Prepared By

International Monetary Fund
International Development Association

Based on the external LIC DSA, Vietnam remains at low risk of debt distress. All external
debt sustainability indicators are projected to remain well below their applicable
thresholds in the baseline scenario and under stress tests.1 The outlook for public sector
debt, however, calls for continued fiscal consolidation. In addition, potential contingent
liabilities arising from the financial sector and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), whose size
is unknown, pose further risks to public debt sustainability.2

1

Vietnam’s policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment, averaged 3.81 over the past three years, placing it as a “strong performer.” The relevant indicative
thresholds for this category are: 50 percent for the present value (PV) of the debt-to-GDP ratio, 200 percent for
the PV of the debt-to-exports ratio, 300 percent for the PV of the debt-to-revenue ratio, 25 percent for the
debt service-to-exports ratio, and 22 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are
applicable to public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt.
2

This DSA was prepared jointly by Bank and Fund staff, in consultation with the Asian Development Bank
(AsDB). The debt data underlying this exercise were provided by the Vietnamese authorities and donor
partners. Data beyond end-2010 are staff estimates and projections.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS VIETNAM

INTRODUCTION
1.
Vietnam’s external debt position has
historically been low, but has risen somewhat
since 2008. Vietnam’s total external (including
private sector) debt is estimated to have risen to
about 43¾ percent of GDP at end-2010, about
11½ percentage points higher than in 2008. Most
of Vietnam’s PPG external debt is concessional
with long maturities and a fairly diversified
currency composition (see text table). Meanwhile,
large foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows have
provided significant non-debt-creating financing.
GDP growth has recovered somewhat since 2008,
but remains below pre-crisis rates. Despite a
significant narrowing of the current account
deficit, international reserves remain low on
account of large, albeit declining, domestic shift
from Vietnamese dong into U.S. dollars and gold.3
2.
Domestic public debt has historically
been manageable, but risks have increased in
recent years. Public sector debt in this analysis
refers to debt of the general government and
debt guaranteed by the central government.
Debts of SOEs not guaranteed by the government
are excluded from public sector debt due to lack

of data (except that of Vietnam Development
Bank, whose nonsecuritized domestic debts are
included in public sector debt). Vietnam’s
domestic public debt has remained at around
17–18 percent of GDP during 2006–08, but
increased to about 21½ percent of GDP in 2010
on account of the 2009 fiscal stimulus. Domestic
financing needs have traditionally been met
comfortably through borrowing at low or
negative real interest rates from captive banks
and quasi-government entities.

COMPARISON AND ASSUMPTIONS
3.
Vietnam is assessed to be at a low risk
of debt distress, similar to the assessment in
the last DSA. PPG external debt and the PV of
PPG external debt in 2010 are slightly higher than
projected in the last DSA. In 2010, PPG domestic
debt (21½ percent of GDP) is about 1 percentage
point higher than, and the PV of public debt is

As reflected in negative net foreign assets of
commercial banks and in negative errors and
omissions estimated at 4 percent of GDP in 2010,
largely reflecting foreign currency and gold hoarding
by residents outside the financial system as a hedge
against inflation and depreciation.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

about ½ percentage point higher than projected
in the last DSA. This largely reflects newly available
information on additional governmentguaranteed domestic debt. The noninterest
current account deficit, FDI, and aid flows in 2011
were mostly better than projected in the last DSA.
However, commercial banks’ acquisition of large
net foreign assets and large private capital
outflows are reflected in the residual beyond the
identified financing gap. The main baseline
assumptions underlying the DSA are summarized
in Box 1.

VIETNAM 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

EXTERNAL DSA4
A. Baseline
4.
Vietnam’s PPG external debt position
remains manageable. The PV of the PPG external
debt stock at end-2010 was about 28 percent of
GDP and is estimated to have declined to
26½ percent of GDP in 2011―much lower than
the threshold of 50 percent of GDP. Other PPG
external debt and debt service indicators also
remain well below the applicable debt thresholds.
5.
Under the baseline scenario, the PV of
PPG external debt to GDP is projected to
decline over the longer term.5 In addition, the
PV of PPG external debt in percent of exports and
revenues is expected to decline steadily between
2011–30, while the debt service-to-exports ratio is
projected to remain relatively flat, and the debt
service-to-revenue ratio to increase somewhat,
reflecting a shift toward more commercial

borrowing. With remittances included in the
denominator of debt indicator calculations, the
above results still hold broadly.
6.
Contingent liabilities arising from the
SOE sector pose some risk to this assessment.
The assessment of risk of debt distress does not
include private external debt. The debt servicing
difficulties of the Vinashin conglomerate suggest
risks of possible isolated cases of nongovernment
external debt default, and some part of this
external debt may need to be assumed by the
government. Nonetheless, even in such a
scenario, the external debt outlook will likely
remain manageable given the relatively small size
of private external debt and the low PPG external
debt.

B. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
7.
Stress tests indicate that the PV of PPG
external debt is most sensitive to an export
shock. However, under none of the standard
stress tests would the PV of PPG external debt to
GDP breach the threshold.6 Other PPG external
debt indicators are also most sensitive to a

slowdown in exports, yet they remain well below
the applicable thresholds even under the most
extreme stress tests. Results are similar when
remittances are included in the denominator of
debt indicator calculations.

4

This analysis focuses on PPG external debt, which
accounts for more than 75 percent of total external
debt. Non-SOE private external debt is largely
associated with foreign-invested projects, and hence is
more self-sustainable. Non-government guaranteed
external debt of SOEs is included in private external
debt.
5

Unidentified debt-creating flows are recorded as
“residual” in the DSA summary tables, which also
captures the impact of exchange rate movements.
6

The modified debt burden thresholds are 10 percent
lower than the applicable debt sustainability framework thresholds.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS VIETNAM

Box 1. Key Macroeconomic Assumptions for Baseline Scenario (2012–31)
Real GDP growth is projected at about 6 percent
for 2012, slowing down somewhat, from an average
of about 7 percent over the past 10 years, and
gradually increase to about 7½ percent by 2017—
the level prior to the 2009 global economic crisis—
supported by domestic and a recovery in external
demand. Real GDP growth is expected to average
about 7½ percent per year during 2017–25, and
thereafter slow gradually as Vietnam’s level of
development and demography begin to converge
to those of more advanced neighbors.
Inflation is projected to decline from an average of
18.7 percent in 2011 to 10¾ percent in 2012 as
food prices stabilize and also due to base effects. It
is projected to then gradually decline to 5 percent
by 2017 as macroeconomic conditions stabilize,
and remain at that level through 2031.
The current account deficit is estimated to have
narrowed from 4 percent of GDP in 2010 to
½ percent of GDP in 2011 largely due to a rebound
in exports and subdued import growth. In the
longer term, as the main exports shift toward
higher value-added products and imports of capital
goods decline, the current account deficit should
gradually narrow and finally be slightly above
balance by 2028. As high growth continues in the
longer term, remittances (whose growth tends to
be in line with GDP growth in the United States, the
largest source country of remittances to Vietnam)
as a share of GDP will gradually decline.
The capital and financial account surplus is
projected to rise from slightly above 4 percent of
GDP in 2012 to about 5 percent in 2017 and
thereafter decline gradually throughout the
projection horizon. The non-debt-creating portion
of FDI is projected to decrease from about
6 percent of GDP in 2011 to about 2 percent in
2031. As Vietnam is expected to graduate from IDA
eligibility around 2020, concessional official
development assistance is assumed to decline as
Vietnam transitions

to IDA Blend, which has shorter grace periods and
maturities, and higher interest rates.
Reserve coverage is expected to remain low at
about 1.6 months of prospective imports by end2012, but is forecast to gradually recover to about
3.2 months by end-2017 and increase further to
5 months by end-2031.
Effective interest rates on foreign borrowing
are expected to increase gradually from around
2½ percent in 2010 to 6½ percent by 2031, as the
share of concessional loans in total debt declines.
Net borrowing by the government (including
off-budget expenditure and excluding official
development assistance onlending) is projected to
decline from 3½ percent of GDP in 2012 to below
2 percent of GDP by 2015, and remain at about
2 percent of GDP in the long run. Revenues and
grants decline gradually to 27¼ percent of GDP
by 2014, and in the long run gradually decline to
around 25–26 percent of GDP as the ratio of
grants, trade revenue, and natural resource
revenues to GDP declines and are only partially
replace with other revenues, in line with the
authorities’ plans. Noninterest current expenditure,
while increasing somewhat in real terms, would
decline gradually as a percentage of GDP. The
primary deficit declines from 2.1 percent of GDP in
2012 to an average of around 1–1½ percent of
GDP in 2017–31.
Net domestic financing (NDF) is projected to
become slightly negative given expected ODA
disbursements in the coming years and revenue
and expenditure projections. However, the financing
mix is projected to shift toward domestic sources in
the long run, and NDF to rise to about 1½ to
1¾ percent of GDP in the outer years.
Contingent liabilities or exceptional financing are
not assumed in the baseline scenario.

VIETNAM 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

PUBLIC DSA
A. Baseline
8.
The PV of public sector debt at end2010 is estimated at 49½ percent of GDP
while the nominal debt-to-GDP ratio is
estimated at 54¼ percent of GDP. The nominal
debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated to have declined
to 48½ percent of GDP at end-2011, and is
projected to decline further to 43½ percent of
GDP by 2016, and to well below 35 percent of
GDP in the longer term. The debt service-to
revenue ratio declines initially to 12 percent in
2016 before rising again to about 18 percent, as
concessional financing is expected to decline, and
maturities of and interest on commercial debt are
shorter and higher, respectively.

9.
These trends largely reflect fiscal
consolidation in 2011 and over the medium
term. Fiscal consolidation has already begun. Net
incurrence of liabilities is estimated to have
declined to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2011 from
8.3 and 7.1 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010,
respectively. In the baseline scenario, the non-oil
primary deficit is projected to decline from about
5½ percent of GDP in 2011 to about 3 percent of
GDP by 2017. Over time, net incurrence of
liabilities is projected to decline to around
2¼ percent of GDP, in line with the authorities’
plans for revenue reform to replace declining oil
and trade revenues.

B. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
10.
The standard stress tests indicate the
importance of fiscal consolidation over the
medium term. A less ambitious adjustment than
assumed in the baseline may not provide a
sufficient hedge against a large exchange rate
shock. Lower GDP growth would also jeopardize
public debt reduction.
11.
Contingent liabilities pose some risk to
public debt sustainability. Raising the capital of
state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) to
required minimum levels is estimated at around
2–3 percent of GDP, while adequate provisioning
for nonperforming loans (NPLs), if International
Financial Reporting Standards are applied, could
amount to some 4½ percent of GDP.7 In a stress
event, a broad approximation suggests that NPL
levels in the whole banking sector—arising from
SOEs, private companies, and households—may

Estimates for contingent liabilities are updated based
on those from last year’s DSA.

rise by about 23½ percent of GDP, based on past
experience in emerging market banking crises
(though not all NPLs would necessarily be
reflected in public debt since the size of
recapitalization would likely be smaller). Should
such a scenario materialize, public sector debt
could rise commensurately either in one step or
distributed over a relatively short time period. A
shock of this magnitude would drive up the debtto-GDP ratio to about 78½ percent of GDP which
would, under an unchanged fiscal stance, decline
only to about 48½ percent of GDP by 2031.
However, the large presence of SOCBs, the explicit
guarantee of deposits extended in 2011, and the
action already being undertaken by the SBV to
address problems in a number of small weak
banks, reduce the likelihood of a panic-driven
crisis and hence the crystallization of contingent
liabilities. Thus, this calculation should be taken as
a mechanical illustration of the possible
maximum, which by no means indicates any
likelihood of such an outcome.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS VIETNAM

DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION AND CONCLUSIONS
12.
In the staffs’ view, Vietnam remains at
a low risk of external debt distress based on
external debt burden indicators. The projected
PPG external debt ratios and projected path
remain well below applicable thresholds. Under
the sensitivity analysis, all external debt indicators
remain well below the applicable thresholds.
13.
The public DSA suggests that
Vietnam’s overall public sector debt dynamics
are not at immediate risk. However, continued
fiscal consolidation with the aim of reducing the
public debt-to-GDP ratio and building up
cushions is necessary. Under the baseline
scenario, public debt would gradually decline to
more comfortable levels. However, potential
contingent liabilities arising from the financial
sector and SOEs pose sizable risks to public debt
sustainability.
14.
Risks that stem from the possible
impact of contingent liabilities on public
finances need to be considered carefully. The
staffs’ estimates of contingent liabilities are based
on limited information on the financial state of
SOCBs and SOEs, and on general experience with
financial sector crises in other countries in the
past, which may have little bearing on Vietnam’s
specific circumstances. Therefore, they are
necessarily general and should be considered as
indicative only. In this regard, the SBV and
Ministry of Finance should strengthen their
capacity to assess and monitor contingent

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

liabilities arising from both the financial and SOE
sectors.
15.
The above debt sustainability results
depend critically on the underlying
assumptions. The key assumptions include: (i) a
fiscal adjustment that reduces net incurrence of
liabilities to around 2½ percent of GDP in order to
reduce public sector debt to below 45 percent of
GDP by 2016 and below 40 percent of GDP in the
longer run; (ii) continued export growth and
dynamism of the Vietnamese economy more
generally; (iii) continued access to non-debtcreating external financing, especially private
remittances and FDI; and (iv) continued albeit
declining access to concessional financing by
multilateral and bilateral sources in the medium
term.
16.
The authorities broadly agree with the
staffs on the external debt sustainability
analysis. They agree that the public debt-to-GDP
ratio should decline over the medium and long
term. They also share the staffs’ concern on risks
arising from contingent liabilities of SOEs and the
banking sector, though they indicated that
budgetary resources would not be used to
restructure SOE debt. This policy, in their view,
also limited the need to create fiscal cushions in
anticipation of such contingencies, though they
broadly agreed with the need to reduce public
debt over the medium term.

Average

Sources: Vietnamese authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
3/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Statement by the Staff Representative on Vietnam
Executive Board Meeting
May 25, 2012

1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff report
(SM/12/95) was circulated to the Executive Board on April 30, 2012. This information does
not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Inflation has continued to decelerate. Inflation slowed to 8.3 percent (y/y) in May, the
first time in single digits since October 2010.
3.
The authorities revised their estimate of the current account for 2011. Instead of a
deficit of $0.7 billion (0.5 percent of GDP), the current account now shows a surplus of
$0.2 billion (0.2 percent of GDP). This revision does not change overall gross international
reserves accumulation, which remains at $13.5 billion.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Vietnam
On May 25, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Vietnam.1
Background
As tighter macroeconomic policies were having an effect and the credibility of the State Bank of
Vietnam (SBV) was strengthening significantly, the economy began to stabilize. GDP growth for
2011 decelerated to below 6 percent and declined to 4 percent year-on-year (y/y) in the first
quarter of 2012. Credit growth slowed to 14.3 percent y/y in 2011, and inflation, after peaking at
23 percent in August 2011, declined to 10.5 percent in April. The current account moved to a
small surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2011 from a deficit of over 4 percent in 2010. Confidence
in the Vietnam dong has improved, bringing the informal interbank exchange rate back within
the official trading band. Investors, both domestic and foreign, are shifting into dong assets,
allowing the SBV to increase international reserves significantly in the first three months of
2012, though they remain low.
The authorities adopted a stabilization package in February 2011 in response to increasing
pressures on prices and the exchange rate in late 2010. As a result, they tightened
macroeconomic policies significantly during 2011. Policy interest rates were raised, a credit
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
growth ceiling was imposed, and investment by the government and state-owned enterprises
was contained. These policies had the desired effect, but with the sharper-than-expected
slowdown of the economy and the rapid fall in inflation in early 2012, the SBV reduced policy
interest rates three times over three months since March. The government also began to
encourage more bank credit to strategic sectors (agriculture, SMEs, etc). The authorities
maintained, however, that macroeconomic stability was of paramount importance. In addition,
the authorities have taken action to address vulnerabilities at a number of small weak banks.
The nine banks classified as weak were placed under the special inspection, and required to
present restructuring and recapitalization plans for approval by the SBV. The authorities have
also adopted a comprehensive medium-term strategy to strengthen the financial sector as a
whole.
Despite the sharp slowdown in the first quarter, the economy is projected to stabilize further in
2012 given that the recent reduction of policy interest rates and a modest fiscal expansion are
expected to cushion adverse effects from slowing domestic and external demand. As a result,
GDP is projected to grow at 6 percent and inflation to decline to about 10¾ percent for 2012
(8¼ percent y/y at year-end). International reserves would increase further from the level
reached in March, even as the current account deficit would rise somewhat. Risks to this
scenario are tilted to the downside. In addition to a slowdown in export markets, there is a risk
that pressures on prices and the exchange rate could resurface, if the authorities’ commitment
to stabilizing the economy and safeguarding the financial sector is perceived as waning.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the tightening of macroeconomic policies in 2011, which
contributed to declining inflation, stabilizing the exchange rate, and a rebuilding of international
reserves. While welcoming the authorities’ commitment to macroeconomic stability, Directors
noted that vulnerabilities and risks remain. A key challenge will be to balance support for the
slowing economy against the risk of eroding hard-won confidence, while rebuilding policy
buffers. Directors emphasized the need to resist loosening policies prematurely and to
accelerate structural reforms.
Directors stressed that a cautious monetary policy stance is needed to build on recent gains in
stability. While recognizing that slowing economic activity and falling inflation provide a basis for
policy easing, Directors recommended that monetary policy give priority to reducing inflation
and rebuilding reserves further. In this context, Directors emphasized the importance of giving
careful consideration to further cuts in policy rates. In the medium term, the authorities should
move toward market-based policy instruments and a more flexible exchange rate regime.
Directors agreed that fiscal policy needs to continue to support macroeconomic stability,
especially in light of the recent sizable civil service salary adjustment. Noting that some

3
progress has been made in rationalizing public investment, they recommended focusing further
on containing current non-wage spending and improving the quality of public spending. They
encouraged the implementation of the planned medium-term tax reforms to broaden the tax
base and prepare for a decline in oil revenue.
Directors welcomed steps taken to date to contain problems in weak banks, but urged the
authorities to speed up implementation of their bank restructuring plan. Banks should recognize
nonperforming loans, enhance the size and quality of their capital, and improve corporate
governance. The authorities need to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory framework,
including on bank resolution, and improve transparency in the banking sector. Directors looked
forward to the forthcoming Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for providing reform
momentum. They also stressed the importance of strengthening legislation against money
laundering and terrorism financing.
Directors called for intensification of efforts to reform state-owned enterprises and improve the
business environment, both key actions to enhance growth potential and reduce budgetary and
financial sector risks. They welcomed the plans for equitization and privatization of a large
number of state-owned enterprises, but emphasized that improving accountability and financial
discipline holds the key for successful reform.
Directors encouraged the authorities to increase the frequency, quality, and transparency of
economic statistics.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
